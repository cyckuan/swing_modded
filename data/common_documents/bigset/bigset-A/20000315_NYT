EDITORIAL: VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN SPAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, March 15:
</P>
<P>
   Something new and healthy is going on in Spanish politics, and
Sunday's election results provide tangible proof. Party loyalties
that were carried over from the civil war era and the long
right-wing dictatorship of Francisco Franco are finally breaking
down, yielding to a more pragmatic politics that judges governments
by their performance.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar is a clear beneficiary. He has
led his conservative Popular Party toward a more modern and
centrist outlook and achieved notable economic successes. Yet
pundits expected Aznar to emerge from last weekend's election with
only a narrow victory. Instead, his party won an absolute
parliamentary majority, the best performance by the Spanish
center-right since democracy returned almost 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago Aznar edged into power amid voter revulsion at
Socialist financial scandals. A colorless politician who had
dabbled in far-right causes during his youth, he won only a bare
plurality and depended on support from a Catalan regional party.
But Aznar has now established firm centrist credentials and drawn
support from traditionally Socialist voters with his achievements.
During his tenure Spain created 2 million jobs, as many as the 14
other members of the European Union combined. It also met the
rigorous fiscal and monetary tests for joining the European
Monetary Union. Aznar continued the privatization of state-owned
industries, cut government bureaucracy and promoted agricultural
exports.
</P>
<P>
   Despite charges that some of his closest personal associates
reaped large profits from privatization deals, Aznar's economic
policies proved so popular that the Socialist campaign promised to
follow a similar course. But voters showed little interest in
returning the Socialists to office, particularly after they formed
a disastrous electoral pact with the former Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Freed from dependence on his former allies and their demands for
regional spending, Aznar can press ahead with fresh economic
reforms. Despite Spain's impressive job creation, unemployment, at
15 percent, is still painfully high, and incomes remain lower than
elsewhere in Western Europe. But his most important challenge will
be to manage the needs of Spain's distinctive regions. These have
spawned a multiplicity of parties and, in the Basque country,
terrorist violence.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the Basque terrorist group ETA broke off a
14-month-long cease-fire. Its bombings and threats marred this
otherwise positive election campaign. Renewing the cease-fire and
resuming peace talks will require a deft mix of firmness and
conciliation. Aznar's new majority could give him the strength to
succeed.

BARBARA COONEY, 83, CHILDREN'S BOOK CREATOR
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Maine, Mass.)  (fb) 
 By EDEN ROSS LIPSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barbara Cooney, an author and illustrator of children's books
whose first work was published in 1940 and whose 110th, ``Basket
Moon,'' appeared last fall, died on Friday at a hospital in
Portland, Maine. She was 83 and lived in Damariscotta, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Cooney honored an admonition she ascribed to her best-loved
character, Rumphius, who said, ``You must do something to make the
world more beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   She won the Caldecott Medal for illustration twice, first in
1958 for a version of Chaucer's ``Chanticleer and the Fox'' in full
color in the scratchboard technique she had been using for roughly
20 years. Her second Caldecott, in 1980, was for paintings for
Donald Hall's ``Ox-Cart Man'' that were in a distinctive primitive
folk art style.
</P>
<P>
   Each prize changed the artistic course of her career. After the
first she began to paint, and after the second she began to write
her own stories to illustrate, including what she retrospectively
called a trilogy _ ``Rumphius'' (1982), ``Island Boy'' (1988) and
``Hattie and the Wild Waves'' (1990). They made up what she said
was ``as close to any autobiography as I will ever get.''
</P>
<P>
   She was born in 1917 at the Hotel Bossert in Brooklyn Heights,
which was built by her maternal grandfather. ``Hattie and the Wild
Waves'' describes in detail her artist mother's childhood in a
wealthy German-American family.
</P>
<P>
   Cooney grew up on Long Island and began summering in Maine at
age 2. She graduated from Smith College in 1938 and studied
lithography and etching at the Art Students League in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She married Charles Talbot Porter and raised four children while
he practiced medicine in Pepperell, Mass., later moving to a house
overlooking the sea in Damariscotta.
</P>
<P>
   The somewhat awed narrator of ``Rumphius'' describes her
great-aunt as ``little and old'' but adds, ``she has not always
been that way.'' Rumphius is also known as the Lupine Lady because,
after an adventurous life, she has returned to the Maine coast,
where she harvests and scatters the seeds of her favorite plant.
``Island Boy'' tells the story of Matthais Tibbetts, who lived
almost his entire life on a remote Maine island.
</P>
<P>
   Maine, the much-loved scene of many of Cooney's books, treasured
the author in turn. In 1989 the Maine Library Association created
the Lupine Award to honor outstanding children's books by state
residents or authors of books about Maine, beginning with Cooney,
and in 1996 Gov. Angus King proclaimed her a Living Treasure of the
State of Maine. In 1997 Cooney announced a donation of $550,000 to
the library in Damariscotta, and later added $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Groundbreaking for a library costing $2 million will be next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Cooney received many honorary degrees and won numerous awards in
addition to the Caldecotts, including the American Book Award for
``Rumphius'' in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband and four children, she is survived by
two brothers, three grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   Cooney's work is much admired for its historical detail and
accuracy, from the embroidery on Eleanor Roosevelt's baptismal gown
(``Eleanor'') to details of Finnish folklore (``Louhi, Witch of
North Farm'').
</P>
<P>
   In her 1959 Caldecott acceptance speech, she explained: ``How
many children will know that the magpie sitting in my pollarded
willow in `Chanticleer and the Fox' is an evil omen? How many
children will realize that every flower and grass in the book grew
in Chaucer's time in England? How many children will know or care?
Maybe not a single one. Still I keep piling it on. Detail after
detail. Whom am I pleasing _ besides myself? I don't know. Yet if I
put enough in my pictures, there may be something for everyone. Not
all will be understood, but some will be understood now and maybe
more later.''

CHALLENGED BY FATHER, BOY KILLS HIM, OFFICIALS SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOMS RIVER, N.J. _ An argument between a father and his
10-year-old son about a missing container of chocolate frosting
escalated into a killing here Monday night, as the man challenged
the boy to stab him. The boy did so, with the 5-inch kitchen knife
his father handed him, inflicting a single fatal chest wound, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers responding to a 911 call found Andrew Harms, 38, a
welder and father of three, lying on the floor of his two-car
garage. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The Ocean County prosecutor, E. David Millard, said that after
detectives questioned the fourth-grader and other family members,
the boy was charged as a juvenile with manslaughter, and not
murder, because Millard said he thought the boy had been provoked
into the stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Harms, who believed the boy had taken the frosting, took him to
the garage, away from the other children in the house, and there,
Millard said, ``the discussion became heated and emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the dispute, Harms put the knife in the boy's
hand and told him to stab him if he hated him so much, Millard
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendant responded by plunging the knife into his
chest,'' Millard said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the stabbing occurred so quickly that another
family member watching the argument was unable to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Although the manslaughter charge carries a maximum term of three
years for a juvenile, Millard suggested he would not seek
incarceration because of what he called the underlying facts and
circumstances of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the investigation thus far had not turned up any
indication that the boy had had previous difficulties with the law,
at home or at school. At a news conference here Tuesday afternoon,
Millard identified the boy only as John Doe because of New Jersey's
juvenile privacy laws.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was being held in the county youth shelter, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, the boy's parents separated. He and his two
siblings, who were not identified, lived with their father and his
fiancee and her three children in a modest, rented home.
</P>
<P>
   His mother lives in neighboring Monmouth County, Millard said.
He would not identify her.
</P>
<P>
   The family's immediate neighbors described the six children in
Harms' home as polite and eager to help residents mow their lawns,
rake leaves or shovel snow.
</P>
<P>
   John Gonzalez, who lives next door, called Harms a good
neighbor. ``I liked him and I liked the kids,'' Gonzalez said.
``They are all very polite.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Harms often played football with the children at a
nearby school playground. Last summer, he said, Harms owned a small
boat and sometimes took the children crabbing or swimming on
Barnegat Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife died a couple of months ago, and the whole family was
very helpful,'' Gonzalez said, tears brimming in his eyes. ``When
she died, they were the first ones I called.''

INSURERS' SUIT ACCUSES DOCTORS OF FRAUDULENT BILLING SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Md., Va., Conn., N.J.)   (bl)  
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four major insurance companies have filed a joint
lawsuit against a group of doctors _ including one whose license
was revoked three years ago _ charging that they sold their names
and licenses to chiropractors and other health care workers to
steal insurance money.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the state Supreme Court in
Manhattan, describes a complicated scheme to bill insurance
companies through 47 fake medical professional corporations, most
of which were set up in New York. Under the scheme, the lawsuit
says, doctors lent their names to the medical corporations, where
people without medical licenses, like chiropractors and physical
therapists, would then practice. Those health care workers would
then bill for medical services at the rates doctors would charge.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which identifies more than 15 doctors among 100
defendants, says the scheme had six masterminds: two doctors from
New Jersey; two from Connecticut, one of whom had a license at one
point in New York; and one each from Maryland and Virginia. Twenty
chiropractors and 15 management companies were also named in the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Under New York law, only licensed medical doctors can own
medical corporations. What is more, doctors are allowed to bill at
a much higher rate than chiropractors and other health care
workers, which is why those accused in the scheme would have needed
the doctors' names to set up shop. Under the terms of the deal, the
suit says, the doctors who lent their names were absolved of any
actual responsibility for the corporations, including providing
care in them.
</P>
<P>
   But setting up fake corporations was only the beginning,
according to the insurance companies, Progressive Auto Insurance;
Allstate; Geico, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway; and New York Central
Mutual.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of billing for services at doctors' rates, the suit
accuses the health care workers of ordering unnecessary tests,
billing for services provided by doctors who were no longer working
in the corporations and referring patients to MRI clinics, also
defendants in the suit, that were financially related to the
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The most active participant, according to the suit, was Alan
Cohen, a doctor from Milford, Conn., who the suit says sold his
name for $4,000 a year to create fake medical professional
corporations. When he received his stock in the corporations, the
insurance companies said, he left it blank, allowing the real
owners to fill in whatever name they wished. ``Enabled by Cohen,''
said Vince Coyne, the lead investigator for Progressive, ``many
proceeded to engage in billing abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, reached by telephone Tuesday, would not comment. The
Maryland doctor named in the suit, George Battaile, had a license
in New York that was revoked in 1997. There is no longer a listing
for him in Maryland, so he could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance companies are seeking damages under the federal
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the state
consumer fraud act and various other fraud laws. Further, the
companies, which all provide auto insurance, also seek to be
excused from the claims submitted by the corporations. The
accusations of fake claims stem from auto accidents, a spokeswoman
for the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Random calls to a dozen of the 40 corporations named in the
suit, which are all in New York, showed that many appeared to be
out of business, to have been replaced by other companies or not to
have people answering the phones.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Borsody, a lawyer for at least a half-dozen of the
corporations, including Bay Medical Health Care in Queens, said
that he was unsure whether any of his clients had a problem with
health care fraud, but added that having the doctor who formed the
corporation absent from the day-to-day workings of the office did
not constitute a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term phony is the question at issue,'' Borsody said. ``If
any of them billed for a patient they didn't see, that is fraud.
But these PCs did have doctors, there were injured patients, there
was treatment provided and the insurance companies don't want to
pay for the claims so they are alleging they are fraudulent.
Insurance companies will look for a reason not to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Health care fraud has become an increasingly hot issue for
prosecutors around the country, since they are emboldened by new
laws passed by Congress to stem costs. Executives from the
insurance companies involved in the suit say they have passed their
information on to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for New Yorkers to understand that fraud like
this contributes to overall costs,'' said Stephen Englert, the
special investigations manager for Allstate. He estimated the fraud
costs at $170 to $200 per household per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allstate has zero tolerance of fraud of any kind,'' he said.
``We hope today's announcement sends a message that Allstate will
do whatever it takes to shut down scams like this.''

NFL SUSPENDS 3 PLAYERS FOR OFF-THE-FIELD VIOLENCE
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Football League, facing a growing public relations
problem as off-the-field violence by its players reached a new
level, suspended three players on Tuesday for two games each. It
was the first time that playing time has been revoked for
first-time offenders under the league's violent-crime policy.
</P>
<P>
   For their involvement in a bar fight last summer, the former
Jets Matt O'Dwyer and Jumbo Elliott were suspended without pay for
the first two games of the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Denard Walker, a starting cornerback for the Tennessee Titans ,
was also suspended without pay for the first two games after
pleading guilty to assault on the mother of his son.
</P>
<P>
   Although Elliott recently announced his retirement, the league
informed him he would have to serve his suspension first if he
decided to return to the NFL. O'Dwyer now plays for the Cincinnati
Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   Jets tackle Jason Fabini, who was also involved in the fight
last July at a Long Island bar, was fined $14,000, the equivalent
of his salary for one game.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced in 1997, the league's anti-crime policy previously
led to fines or mandated counseling, or both, for players who had
pleaded guilty to violent crimes or accepted plea bargains.
</P>
<P>
   But with Baltimore linebacker Ray Lewis and Rae Carruth, a
former Carolina wide receiver, accused of murder, Tuesday's
announcement seemed an attempt by the league to set a more
stringent course.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an organization whose continued success depends on
integrity and public confidence, the NFL simply cannot tolerate
conduct that victimizes other individuals and results in a loss of
respect for NFL players,'' Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in a
statement. ``We instituted this policy during the 1997 season with
counseling only. In 1998, we began fining employees for violations.
Now that the policy has been in effect for three seasons, we are
raising the disciplinary standard in order to underscore that this
type of behavior will not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Crimes that fall under the league's programs include the use or
threat of physical violence, the use of a deadly weapon, illegal
possession of a weapon, hate crimes, the destruction of property
and domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Any NFL employee or player charged with one of these crimes must
undergo counseling. A conviction or guilty plea has subjected a
player to a fine or the possibility of a suspension without pay as
determined by the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Under the policy, a longer suspension, and possibly banishment,
can follow a second conviction.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dwyer, Elliott and Fabini were arrested on July 10, 1999.
O'Dwyer later pleaded guilty to assault and disorderly conduct
charges and received three years of probation. He was also ordered
to pay $4,373 in restitution for kicking out a police car window.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott also pleaded guilty to harassment and disorderly conduct
and received a $250 fine and was ordered to perform 50 hours of
community service. Fabini received a lesser sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Walker received probation after pleading guilty on Aug. 11 to
assault on Rhonda Lynn Chesser, the mother of Walker's 19-month-old
son. She alleged that Walker threatened, punched and tried to
strangle her.
</P>
<P>
   Walker told the police that he and Chesser argued and
``basically wrestled on the floor, with some punches thrown not to
be harmful.'' He said he received ``marks around my neck, with some
minor scratches'' in the fight.

OFFICER ACCUSED OF FALSE TESTIMONY KILLS HIMSELF, AUTHORITIES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A veteran police officer who was facing possible
dismissal after testifying falsely in state court about a 1998
arrest shot and killed himself with his service weapon early
Tuesday, hours before he was scheduled to testify again about the
arrest in federal court, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, James Sullivan, 34, who had made nearly 100 arrests
and earned nearly two dozen commendations in his nine-year career,
was found in his car at 12:50 a.m. along the Sunken Meadow Parkway
and the Jericho Turnpike, police said. Sullivan was married and had
two children.
</P>
<P>
   About six hours before his body was found, Sullivan had been
served with a subpoena to testify Tuesday at a federal parole
revocation hearing in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn for the man
he had arrested in 1998, Stanford Francis, said senior police
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan and his partner, Officer Edward Melin, arrested Francis
on charges of attempted murder and gun possession on Dec. 30, 1998,
after a shooting in the East New York section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Francis, who had three prior convictions, including one in
federal court for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, was tried in
state court and acquitted on all charges stemming from the 1998
arrest. Because it is illegal for a felon to possess a gun, federal
prosecutors obtained an indictment against Francis after the state
acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, during trial preparation for the federal case,
the prosecutor, Eric A. Tirschwell, said he learned that Sullivan
had testified falsely about the events that occurred immediately
after Francis was arrested in 1998, according to a March 9 letter
from Tirschwell to the judge in the federal case, Reena Raggi,
seeking to dismiss the indictment because of the false testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The government intended to go forward with a hearing to revoke
Francis' parole for a prior federal narcotics conviction because of
the gun arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In the state trial, Sullivan and Melin both testified that the
gun taken from Francis was transported back to the precinct station
house in the trunk of their patrol car, the letter said. Both men
also testified that Sullivan had picked up the .45-caliber
semiautomatic pistol from the ground where Francis had dropped it.
</P>
<P>
   But Sullivan told Tirschwell last Wednesday that in fact Melin
had picked up the gun and handed it to him and that he had put it
on the front seat of the patrol car, not in the trunk. He told the
prosecutor he had not been truthful in his testimony on these two
points, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Commissioner Howard Safir announced a policy that he
would fire any officer for lying to a superior or in an official
proceeding. Several officials said that Sullivan had been told to
bring a lawyer for his testimony Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior police official said state prosecutors had indicated
that they did not plan to pursue perjury charges because the lies
were not material to the case, but an official in the Brooklyn
district attorney's office said the case had not yet been reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan was the second police officer to commit suicide this
year.

NCAA Tournament bracket pool behind the couple who let their

   _ The more Kenyon Martin's season-ending injury is replayed in

Now can Cincinnati get back up?

<P>
   _ Martin's injury did what few seemed possible _ turn the Big

the Final Four would make a great story because Martin has handled
his injury with grace and courage.

A possible South Regional semifinal between Ohio State and
Cincinnati (who haven't played each other since 1962). A possible
second-round matchup between Arizona's Lute Olson and Fresno
State's Jerry Tarkanian (who have never sent each other Christmas
cards).
</P>
<P>
   _ Kansas State naming Jim Wooldridge its next basketball coach
might not qualify as a ``sexy hire.'' But Iowa State didn't exactly
cause a stir when it hired Larry Eustachy from Utah State two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   There's no truth to the rumor that Kansas State football coach
Bill Snyder was asked if he might consider adding ``basketball
coach'' to his job description.
</P>
<P>
   Wooldridge's biggest challenge: removing the perception that
Kansas State is now a football school.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nebraska is willing to pay big bucks for a top-flight coach.
Bill Self of Tulsa is its main target. Some say that Nebraska is a
great job. Others aren't so sure. Self must decide if he needs to
strike while the iron is hot (his Tulsa team went 29-4 this
season).
</P>
<P>
   _ Utah State _ basketball coaching factory. First, Eustachy
leaves to coach Iowa State after leading the Aggies to a 25-8
record his final season. Stew Morrill, his replacement, has Utah
State 28-5 and on a national-best 19-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   _ The off-the-court story this season involves the NCAA cracking
down on eligibility and amateurism issues. NCAA enforcement
administrators say they are just following up on tips they receive.
Translation: When a player from School A is suspended, the lead
that created the suspension typically comes from School B. Just
like they used to do it in the old SWC.
</P>
<P>
   _ Indiana State coach Royce Waltman had this to say about the
Sycamores being assigned to Salt Lake City: ``I've been there, and
it's a great place to go. As would Madagascar if that's where they
had scheduled our first round.'' Hey, Royce. Madagascar is the site
of this year's East Regional. It's just commonly known as Syracuse.

MLS FUTURE THREATENED BY LAWSUIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BLANE BACHELOR 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fact that Major League Soccer has been in a long-standing
legal dispute with its players generally comes as news to even the
most devoted soccer fans.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens after the jury trial of Ian Fraser, et al. v.
Major League Soccer, LLC _ set to begin Sept. 18 _ might signal the
beginning of the end for MLS.
</P>
<P>
   Ten MLS players, representing the league's original teams, head
a class-action suit, filed in February 1999, that claims MLS's
single-entity structure violates U.S. antitrust law. The players
claim the concept's goal is to control player movement and keep
salary levels low.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outcome will determine whether MLS continues to move
forward or withers,'' Chicago Fire president Bob Sanderman said.
``I can't see how it would be possible to continue on if players
win the lawsuit. It's that simple, and I've told our teams that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would upset everything that we've spent five years
creating. There is a revenue sharing between the league and the
teams, and cost sharing. It would be back to square one, and I
don't think the investors would be interested.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the financial future of MLS. If the players win in
court and this season does not produce significant increases in
attendance or television ratings, investors might not keep pouring
money into the league.
</P>
<P>
   The suit primarily focuses on the league's single-entity
concept.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1996, MLS is a centrally operated league, like the
former American Basketball League, which folded in December 1998.
Under the single-entity format, the league _ instead of its
individual teams _ controls all players' salaries, the lengths of
contracts, trades and transfers to foreign clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, players are looking for a free-agency system
similar to ones in Major League Baseball and the NFL, NBA and NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the difference between a free market, and that's all that
people want in any business,'' said goalkeeper Mark Dodd, the
Burn's representative as one of the 10 players named in the suit.
Added Jeffrey L. Kessler, an antitrust specialist representing the
players: ``It is 100 percent complete elimination of competition.
If other companies tried to do this, they'd go to jail. Their
defense is that they are a single entity, but it's a complete
sham.''
</P>
<P>
   The MLS minimum salary for players is $24,000, and the maximum
is $247,200. On the larger scale of professional sports, those
paychecks are pocket change. The average income in the MLS is
around $90,000, much less than recent averages for the NBA ($2.6
million), Major League Baseball ($1.6 million) and the NHL
(approximately $1.2 million).
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing wrong with financial responsibility and
salary-cap type things,'' Dodd said. ``Really, all the players are
saying is that by having the ability to negotiate with other teams,
it just means that you may change your salary, for better or for
worse. But you're not going to change the overall (league
salary).''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Soccer Federation and FIFA _ soccer's world governing
body _ are also named as defendants in the suit. The suit alleges
that the bodies ``conspired to eliminate such competition among
themselves, through among other things, group boycotts, concerted
refusals to deal except on uniform terms, combining assets and the
creation of a `sham' single entity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a concern about the outcome,'' MLS chief
operating officer Mark Abbott said. ``We know we're going to win.
That being said, we'd just as soon sit down and negotiate with the
players.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand their (adamant stand about their chances to
win the lawsuit). We've spent years looking at this structure. ...
That isn't a concern for us.''
</P>
<P>
   If the players win, it could set a precedent affecting other
centrally owned sports leagues, such as the proposed women's soccer
league and Isiah Thomas' Continental Basketball Association. NFL
Europe also operates under the single-entity format.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the players' suit also say having free agency
would help bolster fan interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a concept where the league hires all its players
and disperses them to all the teams is un-American,'' said John
Kerr, executive director of the MLS Players Association. ``Not
letting each team make its way in the world and win or lose based
on choices it makes, that's not what fans like. I think it's
holding us back.''
</P>
<P>
   The players are being helped financially to press their suit by
the NFL Players Association, which is also the home of the MLS
Players Association. For various labor-law reasons, the suit was
not filed by the soccer players association but as a class
representing all current and future players in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Since the league's inception in 1996, players and MLS officials
held several meetings to discuss overall concerns with the
single-entity concept, Dodd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was very excited when the league came into existence,
and then everybody was really taken aback when you find out that
there is one person controlling all the decisions with regards to
your salary, length of contract and your rights,'' Dodd said.
``Players obviously became very disgruntled with that sort of
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Since the lawsuit was filed, the league has experienced
significant changes. Near the end of last season, former
commissioner Doug Logan was fired after the league's attendance
average from slipped to 14,282 from 15,375. Former NFL executive
Don Garber stepped in. Since Garber came aboard, the league has
eliminated the shootout, loosened its purse strings to keep
overseas-bound stars in the league and strengthened its television
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But the pending suit, which had been in the discovery phase
until the court date was announced last month, brings about a
potentially unprecedented overhaul. To this point, it's still
fairly quiet; Sanderman said most of the players on the Fire's
roster were not completely aware of all the underlying issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletes play for the love of game, but they also play for
financial incentive,'' Dodd said. ``If you take away the financial
incentive, you've taken away an important part of the motivational
process. And over 200 players, year after year, that adds up. As an
owner, I think you have to ask yourself, `Am I getting the most out
of my players?' And I'm not sure the answer would be yes.'' nn

TIPS TO MAKE A SPLASH IN YOUR POOL PARTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Omens. Facts. Darts. Take your pick of methods to determine your
NCAA Tournament bracket office-pool selections. This year, with the
tournament expected to be more wide open than ever, any system
should work.
</P>
<P>
   But before beginning today's primer, a word about office pools.
Yes, it's three weeks of thrills or embarrassment (depending on the
accuracy of your selections). Yes, there are an estimated 640 Web
sites that you can visit to set up and track your brackets. Yes,
they're a form of gambling. And no, they don't allow bracket pools
in the NCAA offices (because it's a form of gambling).
</P>
<P>
   Let's begin, and please no wagering.
EAST REGION
</P>
<P>
   OMEN FOR: Duke. The last three times that Duke has been a No. 1
seed in the East Region, the Blue Devils have advanced to the Final
Four (1986, 1992, 1999). Each of those Final Four visits brought a
visit to the national championship game. Duke won the title in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   FACTS SUPPORTING: Temple. The Owls have won 17 of their past 18,
have a savvy point guard in Pepe Sanchez and a matchup zone defense
that is the Rubik's Cube of college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   DART TOSS: Illinois. The Illini have won 10 of their past 12,
they're young and talented with an experienced coach (Lon Kruger),
and they don't have to face Michigan State (two losses by a total
of 40 points). SOUTH REGION
</P>
<P>
   OMEN AGAINST: Stanford. The South has been a graveyard for No. 1
seeds. Kentucky, riding a sizzling 3-point attack in 1993, is the
only No. 1 seed to advance out of the South _ and formerly
Southeast _ Region the past 11 seasons. Five of the past 11 years,
the South No. 1 failed to reach the regional final. The jinx has
claimed teams such as Duke, Kansas, Connecticut and Kentucky. The
average record of the South No. 1 seed the past 11 years has been
27-3; the Cardinal's record is 26-3.
</P>
<P>
   FACTS AGAINST: Connecticut. The Huskies have been inconsistent.
Their nine losses are the most for a defending champion who made
the next season's field since Villanova in 1986. UConn plays
12th-seeded Utah State. In each of the past 11 NCAA Tournaments a
No. 12 seed has beaten a No. 5 seed.
</P>
<P>
   DART TOSS: Cincinnati. Even with a No. 2 seed, the Bearcats are
considered a dark horse. MIDWEST REGION
</P>
<P>
   OMEN FOR: Michigan State. In the 1990s, the Final Four had
repeat teams eight times. The Spartans, who lost to Duke in last
year's semifinals, have a veteran team with a veteran point guard.
</P>
<P>
   FACTS SUPPORTING: Iowa State. Of the last 32 Final Four
entrants, 27 have won either their regular-season or tournament
titles. Six of those teams, like the Cyclones, pulled a league
double. Three of those teams have won national championships. Three
of last year's Final Four teams had a league double.
</P>
<P>
   DART TOSS: UCLA. The Bruins have won six consecutive games and
finally have their full roster. WEST REGION
</P>
<P>
   OMEN FOR: St. John's. The past three Big East Conference teams
to reach the Final Four all came out of the West Region _ Seton
Hall in 1989, Syracuse in 1996 and Connecticut last year. All three
of those teams reached the championship game, and the Huskies won
the title.
</P>
<P>
   FACTS SUPPORTING: Oklahoma. Teams such as Ohio State (1999),
Utah and Stanford (1998), Syracuse (1996), Florida and Arizona
(1994) have reached the Final Four after a season of playing well,
but not winning, in a strong conference.
</P>
<P>
   DART TOSS: Fresno State. The Bulldogs have a tournament-tested
coach (Jerry Tarkanian), the nation's leading scorer (Courtney
Alexander), five starters who can score (82.9 points per game) and
a favorable draw.
</P>
<P>
   So, there you go. Three types of advice to suit your bracket
pool tastes. If none of these methods works, please know that the
phone number and e-mail address that follows will be experiencing
technical difficulties for the next three weeks.

HOLDOUT DEFENDER JOINS BURN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Burn defender Jorge Rodriguez, who has been holding out
throughout the preseason, showed up at practice Monday and said
Tuesday he is attempting to renegotiate his contract with Major
League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez had returned to his native El Salvador because he was
seeking to double his salary, which is believed to be at least
$70,000. However, he said he has returned to the team, at least for
now.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn opens its season at 3:30 p.m. Saturday against the
Chicago Fire at the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league has asked me to show good faith and come back to
the team and start training and become part of the team again,''
Rodriguez said. ``We hope this leads to more open negotiations and
a development in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   MLS executive vice president of player relations and operations
Ivan Gazidis said Rodriguez's return is a positive development.
Gazidis also said the league was considering reworking Rodriguez's
contract before his holdout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be where we were before all of this happened, but to
reward a player for holding out is not fair to the other players
who reported for training and honored their contract commitments,''
Gazidis said. ``We do not want to reward him for the tactic that he
employed, but we could be rewarding him in the way we were prepared
to do anyway, which is a new contract.''
</P>
<P>
   In other Burn news, defender Ricardo Iribarren said Tuesday he
plans to sign with the Burn this week. Iribarren, who played for
Columbus for two seasons, has trained with the Burn for most of the
preseason. nn

JOSEPH GOLDSTEIN, 76, AUTHORITY ON FAMILY LAW
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Spelling of Mariam is CQ.) 
(fb) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Goldstein, a longtime law professor at Yale who was
widely known for his interdisciplinary approach to family law and
other legal fields, died on Sunday at a hospital in New Haven. He
was 76 and lived in Woodbridge, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said the Yale Law School's
director of public affairs, Elizabeth Stauderman.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, who was also a psychoanalyst, was a co-author of
three books that, as Martin Guggenheim, a professor of law at New
York University, put it, became ``required reading for judges and
practitioners in the field of child custody and other legal issues
relating to judicial decisions concerning a child's future.''
</P>
<P>
   The books are ``Beyond the Best Interests of the Child'' (1973),
``Before the Best Interests of the Child'' (1979) and ``The Best
Interests of the Child'' (1986). Dr. Goldstein wrote them with Anna
Freud, the psychoanalyst and daughter of Sigmund Freud, and Albert
J. Solnit, the director of the Yale Child Study Center.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein joined the law school's faculty in 1956 and retired in
1993. He continued lecturing at the law school and doing research
until his death.
</P>
<P>
   Alan M. Dershowitz, the Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law at
Harvard Law School and a former student of Goldstein's, said that
Goldstein ``introduced, probably more than anyone else, real
interdisciplinary thinking in the law school and thus the legal
world in general.'' His influence was widely felt, Dershowitz said,
through both his writing and his influential students.
</P>
<P>
   Central to Goldstein's and his co-authors' thinking, Guggenheim
said, was the idea ``that courts should choose the alternative that
was the least detrimental to the interest of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   That principle, in the authors' view, followed from an even more
basic one: They were highly distrustful of the capacity of judges
to make intelligent decisions about custody arrangements. And so,
Guggenheim said, ``they wanted courts to have very limited
authority to intervene in a family.''
</P>
<P>
   The books also expressed the view that custody disputes should
be looked at from the point of view of children, especially their
perspective on time. For example, for very young children, six
months might be 100 percent of their life, not six months in the
life of a 40-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   In the foster care side of family law, Guggenheim said,
Goldstein and his co-authors encouraged the acceleration of
termination of parental rights in cases where children were in
foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of their work,'' Guggenheim said, ``statutes were
rewritten to shorten the length of time children should be in
foster care before courts would terminate the right of the natural
parents, freeing the children to become eligible to be adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein's work involving family law, Dershowitz said, was an
application of his thinking about the interface between psychiatry
and the law. Early in his career he began studying issues related
to the insanity defense. Goldstein went on to write ``The Family
and the Law'' (1965) with Jay Katz, a Yale Law School professor and
psychiatrist, and ``Psychoanalysis, Psychiatry and the Law'' (1966)
with Katz and Dershowitz. He finished his own psychoanalytic
training in 1968 at the Western New England Psychoanalytic
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed both law and psychoanalysis'' by bringing them
together,'' Dershowitz said. ``In the world of law, he made us all
think about the role of law as superego, how we internalize law,
how we make it part of our personality. And then, I think, he used
the concept of law to help broaden and make more meaningful
concepts like the superego and psychoanalysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Goldstein was born in Springfield, Mass. He received a
bachelor's degree from Dartmouth, a doctorate from the London
School of Economics and a law degree from Yale, where he was an
editor of the Yale Law Journal.
</P>
<P>
   He was a law clerk for Judge David L. Bazelon of the U.S. Court
of Appeals in Washington and taught briefly at Stanford Law School
before returning to Yale as an associate professor of law.
</P>
<P>
   He was also an author, co-author or editor of books on criminal
law, on the My Lai massacre and on constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
   He was an Army code-breaker in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein is survived by his wife, the former Sonja Lambek, who
was one of his co-authors; three sons, Joshua, of Cambridge, Mass.,
Jeremiah, of Philadelphia, and Daniel, of Davis, Calif.; a
daughter, Anne Goldstein of Hartford, Conn.; eight grandchildren; a
brother, E. Ernest Goldstein, who lives in Texas, and a sister,
Mariam Sommer of New Haven, Conn..

AMBITIOUS PLAN TO LURE OLYMPICS 2012 TO NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A group intent on luring the 2012 Summer Olympics to
New York City unveiled a plan at City Hall on Tuesday that would
use new and existing arenas, stadiums and other structures
stretching across the city, and from New Jersey to Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes' village would be built on the 73-acre Queens West
development site along the East River, across from the U.N.
building. The village would later be converted to 5,000 units of
housing.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest project would be a new Olympic stadium, which
advocates hope will rise at the rail yards on the West Side of
Manhattan, a site that has been suggested by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
for a new Yankee ballpark or a football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The group, a 150-member steering committee that includes an
advisory board studded with celebrities like Jerry Seinfeld and
Diana Ross, was formed more than a year ago. It faces a deadline of
Dec. 15 to submit a 600-page application for the 2012 Summer Games
to the U.S. Olympic Committee, which will select among New York and
seven other candidates. The winning entry will be submitted to the
International Olympic Committee, which is expected to choose the
site of the 2012 Summer Games by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``No event could better cap New York's remarkable resurgence
than hosting the Olympic Games,'' said Giuliani, who met Tuesday
with leaders of the group, called NYC 2012. Giuliani has pushed for
private development of a domed Olympic stadium at the rail yards,
near the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. After the Summer Games,
the mayor said, the stadium would be used for professional
football.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the Jets football team, Robert Wood Johnson IV, has
said he plans to leave Giants Stadium when the team's lease expires
in 2008. The West Side is a possible new home for the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for a West Side stadium face hurdles not addressed
Tuesday by the steering committee, including objections from
environmentalists and residents over the traffic it would generate.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said the Olympics could be staged across a broad
urban landscape, with soccer in Giants Stadium and boxing in
Harlem's 369th Regiment Armory, and almost all sites could be
linked by ferry, train or subway. ``We could get virtually all
athletes to their events without ever going on a road,'' said
Daniel Doctoroff, a Wall Street executive and president of NYC
2012.
</P>
<P>
   While describing the proposed West Side complex as the best
option for an Olympic stadium, Doctoroff said the steering
committee was also considering sites in Flushing Meadows-Corona
Park and the Sunnyside rail yards in Queens. While any of the
options would require a large infusion of private funds, he said,
the revenue generated from things like ticket sales to Olympic
events and television rights is projected to be $3.6 billion, far
more than the $1.7 billion estimated cost of staging the Games.
</P>
<P>
   He said NYC 2012 had raised $4.6 million in contributions from
several corporate sponsors. The group is seeking $2.2 million more
for the initial stage of its campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In its meeting with the mayor Tuesday, the group distributed
copies of a code of ethics it had adopted that was clearly intended
to prevent allegations of bribery and back-room dealing from
arising, like the charges that surfaced a year ago against
officials in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The code prohibits ``unethical payments'' to Olympic officials,
including gifts, kickbacks or commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The other places vying to be the U.S. candidate are Dallas,
Houston, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tampa, Fla.
Washington and Baltimore are working on a joint plan.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony Williams of Washington and Mayor Martin O'Malley
of Baltimore held news conferences Tuesday to tout their plan,
which would use five locations around the region, including the
University of Maryland, where an Olympic village would be housed.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Kenice, president of the Washington-Baltimore coalition that
was formed to try to win the Olympics, said one of the area's major
advantages was that almost all of the needed facilities were
already built or under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani shrugged off those rivals. ``All have significantly
higher crime rates than New York,'' he said with a smile.

FRESHMAN KAPONO TURNING HEADS AT UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA freshman forward Jason Kapono is set to shake
things up at the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   And it just won't be with the new headband, a custom-made
variant of the basic white and black he has worn for three months,
that he'll be wearing.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since Don MacLean arrived from Simi Valley
High in 1988-89, UCLA's best player is a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Kapono has just one dunk this season, but he leads the Bruins in
scoring (16.4 ppg). He has not caught an alley-oop pass, but he is
their best passer and their best shooter. Their central nervous
system. He understands body position and passing angles. He does
not have the speed to dash past defenders, but he moves brilliantly
without the ball. He doesn't read defenses, he dissects them.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate tribute arrived Sunday, when Kapono became the
first freshman in school history to make the All-Pacific-10 team.
MacLean didn't make it. Nor did Baron Davis or Rod Foster or Pooh
Richardson or David Greenwood. (Lew Alcindor and Bill Walton did
not play as freshmen.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What does Kapono do for UCLA? He does everything,'' Arizona
coach Lute Olson said. ``He's the kind of guy every coach in
America would like to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always say of players, `He's another Magic. He's another
Bird.' But when people say (Kapono) is a shorter Larry Bird, that's
one I understand. We tried to get him. He's a special player.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapono is the league's top 3-point shooter (47.7 percent), he's
84 points shy of MacLean's freshman scoring record, and he has
sparked a headband craze among opposing fans.
</P>
<P>
   But his greatest accomplishment has been a seamless ascension
within the team dynamic. He does not crave attention and he does
not crave shots. He does not speak out of turn or upstage
upperclassmen. He's as subtle as he is savvy. His touch with
teammates is as soft as a 3-pointer from the right wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``His impact has been amazing, especially for a freshman,'' UCLA
senior Sean Farnham said. ``He's not an athlete like Baron Davis.
But his all-around package is incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here four years, and you always hear hype about the
freshmen. Sometimes, they don't live up to the level of hype. But
Jason's better than his hype. He's the guy we look for if we need a
basket. We're not going to second-guess him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapono credits a rigorous summer program for his success. He
worked on skill development with his Artesia High coach, Wayne
Merino. He spent time with Tim Grgurich, one of the most respected
assistants in the NBA. Each afternoon, he drove to UCLA for pickup
games against NBA players. He hired a trainer to improve his
quickness and footwork. He changed his diet to reduce body fat and
enhance speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I played my last game in high school, I changed my
mindset,'' Kapono said. ``It was time to move on. I knew I had to
get my mind and body ready for college.''
</P>
<P>
   When practice began in October, Kapono was better than the
Bruins expected. Not three weeks had passed when coach Steve Lavin
pronounced Kapono the most-skilled freshmen he had seen. Yet his
game was subtle. While his teammates tossed alley-oops, Kapono made
bounce passes. While they soared for dunks, he made backdoor cuts.
He's chicken-noodle soup among a dozen lobster bisques, but he's
the best meal on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a daily basis, he doesn't do the spectacular things,''
Lavin said, ``but he does all the little things that add up to big
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapono didn't expect to lead the Bruins in scoring or stand
where no freshman has stood before. His plan was simply to help the
team. If that meant scoring, fine. If that meant passing, fine. He
did not expect to start and he did not make closed-door demands for
playing time. He was neither upset nor inspired by preseason
magazines that picked Stanford's Casey Jacobsen as Pac-10 freshman
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't worried,'' he said. ``I didn't even think about that
stuff. But it's crazy to think about (being UCLA's first
all-conference freshman) with all the great players to come through
here.''
</P>
<P>
   That list has grown by one.

BRUINS, MARTIN TRYING TO SALVAGE SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At the start of the season, women's basketball
coaches and media predicted UCLA to repeat as Pacific-10 Conference
champions and reach the NCAA Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, they predicted forward Maylana Martin would be an
All- American (Women's Basketball News Service named her Preseason
Player of the Year) and a possible first pick in the WNBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Things haven't panned out that way. UCLA failed to win the
conference and, at a 10th seed, is a longshot to reach the Final
Four. To do so likely would mean having to beat Tennessee in
Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   As for Martin, she put up her usual numbers: 17.8 points (tops
in the Pac-10) and 8.6 rebounds per game (second highest), all
while playing with a weak back (she had off-season surgery). She
made all-conference and has been invited to play in the Women's
Basketball Coaches Association All-Star Game on April 1 in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the Associated Press All-America team came out Tuesday,
Martin had fallen all the way to honorable mention (there are three
teams of five players).
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA draft is weeks away, and Martin is more likely a
potential first-round pick instead of a No. 1 selection.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that isn't where Martin's focus is these days. She's
preparing for Friday's NCAA first-round game against George
Washington at South Bend, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she knows what could have been. If everyone was healthy,
then maybe UCLA would have won the conference and would be hosting
the first two rounds and would be in the West region instead of the
Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole year was hard for us,'' she said. ``We lost some bad
games, and we were all kind of focused on ourselves and how we can
help the team instead of each individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Memory loss: The excitement of seeing her school's name was so
great, Damaris Hinojosa forgot about the particulars.
</P>
<P>
   Hinojosa, a freshman from Moorpark, watched Sunday's selection
show with her Pepperdine teammates, then cheered mightily when she
saw the Waves had made their first NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, Hinojosa stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait a minute,'' she said, ``Who are we playing and where are
we going?''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling Waves: Pepperdine's players claim coach Mark Trakh has
made their trip to Charlottesville, Va., longer than necessary
because of his fear of propeller planes.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves planned to leave this morning for Dulles Airport,
outside of Washington, then take a two-hour bus ride to
Charlottesville.
</P>
<P>
   The players wanted to fly a propeller plane, but Trakh wouldn't
hear of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those four tires are on the ground,'' Trakh said of a bus.
</P>
<P>
   To which Hinojosa taunted: ``He's afraid of the propellers. I've
flown in a couple. They're not bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing homework: When Pepperdine drew Virginia, Trakh and the
coaching staff called all of the Cavaliers' nonconference opponents
seeking video (he didn't expect Atlantic Coast Conference teams to
help).
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday morning, Siena and Kent had responded. By Tuesday
afternoon, tapes arrived from Loyola (Chicago), Virginia Tech, Old
Dominion and Arkansas State, plus tapes of Boston College, a
possible second-round opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Trakh took his tapes and went home.
</P>
<P>
   To which Hinojosa responded: ``Don't forget to sleep, Coach.''

COLUMN: AFTER INJURY, THE INSULT OF LATE AID
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. _ The horror began last Mother's Day. Sean
Tobin, a young hospital corpsman at the Navy submarine base in
Groton, told the police that he grew so frustrated with his
6-week-old son, who was crying and refusing a bottle, that he shook
him until his ``neck appeared very loose and his head was rolling
around.'' Then he slammed the baby on the couch.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said the baby was unlikely to survive, and the family
removed life supports. But the baby, Vincent Tobin, lived. Nearing
his first birthday, he is almost totally blind, severely
hearing-impaired and unable to crawl or sit up on his own. Cerebral
palsy has been diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal case moved efficiently. Sean Tobin, 20, pleaded
guilty to assault. At an emotional hearing in Superior Court here
earlier this month, a judge sentenced him to 18 years in state
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The disposition for Vincent Tobin has been anything but
efficient. Born a healthy son of a Navy man, he is now the
medically needy son of a convict. Along the way, he lost one thing
he desperately needed, health insurance. A case that began with one
man's rage became a parable for the chronic frustration of
navigating the health insurance system.
</P>
<P>
   At 19, Tina Riggio, Vincent's mother, was suddenly the
unemployed mother of a baby who needed her constant attention as
well as specialized medical care. She moved in with her parents
near Orlando, Fla., and took her son to pediatricians, neurologists
and eye doctors. He began physical and speech and occupational
therapy five days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will eventually be in a wheelchair,'' Riggio said. ``If he
doesn't learn to use his hands, he will have a feeding tube. He
will never walk. He will never talk. He will actually get very
stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the bills, many with notations like, ``For us to
continue providing medical services, you must pay outstanding
balance immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has a program to assist dependents of military
personnel who leave the service due to domestic abuse, which is
paying Riggio $1,078 a month for three years. The money helps,
since she cannot both work and care for Vincent. (She worked at a
Pizza Hut before he was injured.) But it doesn't begin to cover
Vincent's medical care. Riggio applied many months ago for health
insurance under the same program, and waited for the Navy to
respond, with unpaid bills approaching $5,000 as of Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Stellabotte, an administrative assistant at the Easter
Seals clinic in Deltona, Fla., where Vincent received therapy, said
Tricare, the military medical plan, returned his bills, saying
without explanation that he was not covered. Medicaid, for which
Riggio and Vincent qualified, also refused, saying Tricare was the
primary insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Stellabotte said that Easter Seals often treated uninsured
children but that Riggio stopped taking her son for $55-a-day
sessions in December, fearing it would only add to the stack of
unpaid bills.
</P>
<P>
   Riggio arrived at her husband's sentencing carrying their
dark-haired, olive-skinned baby and a sheaf of his bills. But the
hearing concerned the crime, not the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Riggio, the baby's maternal grandfather and namesake,
told the judge: ``He has no idea who I am. He has no idea who my
wife is.'' Sean Tobin, he said, ``destroyed my grandson.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin's mother, Renee, said, ``My son's not a bad man, he's a
good boy.'' She told the judge that ``I am the product of physical
abuse, sexual abuse, verbal abuse,'' and said that ``as parents we
don't recognize what we teach our children until it is too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent, cradled in his mother's lap, let loose with a cry. Then
his father was taken away to prison.
</P>
<P>
   There he will have a full range of medical, mental health and
dental services. For prisoners, at least, medical care is a right.
</P>
<P>
   For Vincent, it was far more complicated. ``I can really assure
you that the Navy is working with this family to help them get any
benefits, medical or monetary, that they are entitled to,'' was all
Lt. Sandra Johnson, assistant legal counsel for Navy Personnel
Command, would say about Vincent on Friday after several calls to
the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   That was news to Riggio, who felt alone against the Navy. Then,
Tuesday afternoon, a Navy official called Riggio to say she and
Vincent would receive Tricare. ``These things take some time,''
said Lt. Ingrid Mueller, a Navy spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   In Vincent's case, it took nine months, or about three-quarters
of his life.

PEPPERDINE TO START LATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ The good news for Pepperdine is that Friday's
NCAA Tournament opener against Indiana will be televised in prime
time locally, at 7:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that in Buffalo, N.Y., that's 10:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   That's a long time waiting around for tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never played !off!that!ital! late before,'' Pepperdine
guard Brandon Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   If there's an edge to be found, perhaps this one goes to the
Waves. Their bodies should still be on West Coast time, and their
home games normally start at 7 p.m. anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess maybe it'll give us a chance to get over the hype of
playing in the NCAA,'' Armstrong said. ``We can calm down and
concentrate on getting ready.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, anyway, Pepperdine doesn't think it's a concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to stay focused on the game and what we have to
do,'' guard Craig Lewis said. ``It doesn't matter what time it is.
It's a business trip so we've got to look at it like that. No
matter what time it is, we just have to be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying through the weekend: Last week, Pepperdine's focus was
on making it to the tournament. Now, the objective is to stick
around. That's been one of the themes during practice the last
couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th-seeded Waves would face either Oklahoma State or
Hofstra if they beat Indiana on Friday,
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we got in, all that's over with,'' Lewis said. ``Now
we want to stay as long as we can. We feel confident, and that's
good, that's what we need.''

KNIGHT CASTS RED SHADOW ON PEPPERDINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ A writer with a bit too much red in his shirt
sat in the stands, watching Pepperdine's basketball team go through
its pre-tournament maneuvers, when a student manager approached, a
counterintelligence officer on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to make sure you're not one of Bobby Knight's
friends,'' he said with a sly laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Relax - there were no Friends of Bobby in Firestone Fieldhouse
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the presence of Bobby Knight was palpable during
Pepperdine's final practice before the team leaves for Buffalo and
its NCAA Tournament opener against Indiana on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Coach and legend, hero and antihero, Knight hung over the scene
like an overstretched red sweater.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, more than any Pepperdine player, more than Indiana All-
American A.J. Guyton, is the star of this first-round matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, in the news again Tuesday because of an allegation of
violence by another ex-Hoosiers player, is going to be the story.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's face will be on TV Friday night more than Regis
Philbin's. Pepperdine coach Jan van Breda Kolff's face will be on
TV less than Gary Bauer's.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana and its coach have won three national championships in
the quarter-century it has taken Pepperdine to win three NCAA
Tournament games. He has, as he'd remind us, forgotten more about
the NCAA Tournament than the Waves will ever know.
</P>
<P>
   How can they fail to be intimidated by the thought of facing
Knight, distracted by the sight of the red sweater they've seen on
TV all their young lives?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely going to look,'' Pepperdine guard Tommie Prince
said. ``Actually, it's scary to me, because I watch Indiana a lot
on TV. To play them, it's a big situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Prince said, ``we can't be intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight coached Isiah Thomas, who just happened to be Pepperdine
guard Tezale Archie's favorite player.
</P>
<P>
   How will that feel?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to be dribbling any balls or taking any shots
or guarding any of us, so we'll leave the head games to coach van
Breda Kolff,'' Archie said.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, the 24-8 Waves deserve their at-large berth in
the Final 64. Their coaches will drum home that point this week as
an antidote to intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-8 Hoosiers have no more right to be in Buffalo than they
do, and no more right to advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indiana came in fifth in the Big Ten, not first,'' Pepperdine
assistant coach Chris Walker said. ``They're struggling a little
bit right now. They've lost four out of the last five times
(they've been to the NCAA Tournament) in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more worried about us than we are about them. They
have more to lose than we do. Our guys can go in relaxed. There's
no worrying about Bobby Knight.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Walker pointed out, ``It would be a major coup for us if
we could beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   After Pepperdine defeated Fresno State on the road in the second
game of the season, one of van Breda Kolff's assistants
congratulated the coach for beating Jerry Tarkanian.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You did a great job, you beat Fresno State, you beat
a coach who won a national championship,' '' van Breda Kolff
remembered. ``It never dawned on me ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We played Kansas (losing by 15) and we didn't look at that
game as `Gee, we're going up against Roy Williams.' Sometimes I
think coaching is overrated. Once the game starts, it's the players
who are going to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff, in his first season at Pepperdine after nine at
Cornell and Vanderbilt, doesn't know Knight personally, although
his father coached against Knight when Butch was at Princeton and
Bobby was at Army.
</P>
<P>
   But van Breda Kolff thinks he knows what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``His teams play hard. He's demanding of them. They're going to
get loose balls, draw charges, play a physical games and do the
things they need to do to win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing you worry about from a coaching standpoint is
you don't want a situation where he has a direct influence on how
the game is officiated. Watching him on TV, he's a boisterous
coach, and sometimes you see that ends up having an effect on one
or more than one official. Big Ten coaches say you've gotta be
careful of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that van Breda Kolff can do much if Knight decides to scream
at the refs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job as coaches is to get our players ready and not be too
concerned with the extraneous things like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably the refs, the chairs and Knight's own players who
should be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, it was reported that Neil Reed, a guard who transferred
from Indiana to Southern Mississippi, claims Knight choked him
during a 1997 practice.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation enlarges Knight's reputation for volatility. That
reputation is the reason Knight's presence looms larger than, say,
Roy Williams'.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a source of inspiration, not intimidation, for the
Waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can make Bobby Knight mad,'' Prince said with a smile,
``that would be really good.''

 McCAIN OFF BALLOT; POLL FAVORS DEMOCRAT; HATCH CHALLENGED; NADER (hm) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oregon officials have decided to remove Sen. John McCain's name
from the primary ballot in May, a move that has irked at least some
McCain supporters, who noted that he has not formally withdrawn
from the presidential race. McCain said last week that he was
suspending his campaign. The Oregon secretary of state, Bill
Bradbury, said voters would be presented with ``a false choice'' if
the senator's name remained on the ballot and that any die-hard
McCain supporters could still write in his name. The move leaves
two Republican candidates on the ballot, George W. Bush and Alan
Keyes, and two Democrats, Vice President Al Gore and Lyndon
LaRouche.
</P>
<P>
   POLL FAVORS FLORIDA DEMOCRAT
</P>
<P>
   A poll of registered voters in the U.S. Senate race in Florida
offered some encouragement to Bill Nelson, the lone Democrat and
the state insurance commissioner, and to Tom Gallagher, a
Republican and the education commissioner. It was less kind to Rep.
Bill McCollum, one of the House managers who prosecuted President
Clinton's impeachment trial. A survey of 621 registered voters
conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling and Research Inc. for The
Tallahassee Democrat found that Nelson would win a hypothetical
general election over McCollum by 43 percent to 33 percent. If
Nelson and Gallagher faced each other in November, the Democrat
would, hypothetically, win by just 39 percent to 38 percent. The
poll's margin of sampling error was four percentage points, making
that race too close to call. The poll showed McCollum and Gallagher
about even going into the Republican primary on Sept. 5. The
Republican incumbent, Connie Mack, is retiring after 12 years.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHALLENGING HATCH

   Fresh from an unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential
nomination, U.S. Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah will not even have
clear sailing toward a fifth term. State Sen. Scott Howell, a
Democrat from Salt Lake City and state Senate minority leader since
1995, said Tuesday that he would oppose Hatch in November. For
Democrats, Howell is a lifesaver. After considering a run, Jan
Graham, the state attorney general and the only Democrat holding a
statewide office, said last month that she had decided not to
oppose Hatch. &QL;

   Ralph Nader, who is running for president on the Green Party
ticket, told a group of students Tuesday that he planned to qualify
for the ballot in all 50 states. When he announced his candidacy
last month, Nader said he hoped to be on the ballot in 45 states
and win 5 percent of the vote. Speaking to students at the
University of Nevada in Reno, Nader said Tuesday that the Green
Party was ``growing quite readily'' as an alternative to the
Democratic and Republican parties, which he likened to ``one party
with two heads wearing makeup.'' Nader was on the ballot in less
than half the states as the Green Party candidate in 1996. &QL;

GIBBS IS GLUE THAT HOLDS PEPPERDINE TOGETHER

<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ It was a throwaway moment, the waning minutes
of a blowout victory for Pepperdine in a late-season game that had
no significant meaning.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it was the perfect opportunity for Kelvin Gibbs
to send a message.
</P>
<P>
   As the loose ball rolled toward the boundary, Gibbs raced over,
dove headfirst onto the floor, tapped the ball to a teammate, then
rolled out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine kept possession. Gibbs made his point.
</P>
<P>
   In the Waves' no-nonsense season, nothing is taken for granted,
not even 20-point leads in meaningless games.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the writers came up to me after the game and asked, `How
do you get a guy, when your up by 20, to dive for the ball like
that?' '' Waves coach Jan van Breda Kolff said. ``It was a great
play, but he does things like that to ignite us. Our whole team
jumped up and we went on a 10-0 run and we were up by 30 in another
two minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was typical Gibbs, a 6-foot-7 junior forward who set the tone
for the Waves' unselfish personality this year by sacrificing
individual statistics to help diversify the Waves' offense.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine (24-8) won the West Coast Conference regular-season
championship and earned a berth into the NCAA Tournament as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves open East Regional play Friday at 7:20 p.m. (West
Coast time) against Indiana in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   They might not be in the tournament had it not been for Gibbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he didn't make those sacrifices, I don't know where we'd
be,'' Pepperdine guard Tezale Archie said. ``We'd still be a good
team, but we definitely wouldn't be where we're at.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in then-Pepperdine coach Lorenzo Romar's
slow-it-down, grind-it-out offense, Gibbs was the team's
second-leading scorer and one of two main cogs offensively, along
with Jelani Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   It was a predictable attack that opponents could easily defend.
Stop Gardner, and you stopped Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was boring,'' Gibbs admits. ``It was a slugfest game.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff changed that when he took over after Romar left
for St. Louis. Pepperdine is now a pressing team that creates
turnovers and gets easy points in transition. When things slow down
to half-court sets, the Waves no longer rely on one or two players
for points. Everyone is urged to take advantage of open looks.
</P>
<P>
   It's been an easy sell for van Breda Kolff. The Waves prefer the
more wide-open offense, which is enjoyable to play and tougher to
defend. Besides, now there's six or seven happy players on offense
rather than two.
</P>
<P>
   But it comes at a price for Gibbs, whose points dropped from 11
points to nine. It could have been a delicate situation. Gibbs, who
averages 7.1 rebounds, was expected to score more, not less, once
Gardner graduated.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he never made it an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me the scoring wasn't a big thing,'' Gibbs said. ``I always
felt if I played the way I was capable of and did the things I
could do, I'd help my team win. I never thought about getting
numbers, I just thought about getting (wins).''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the gesture was significant. Had Gibbs resisted the
change, it would have doomed van Breda Kolff's plan, and probably
the Waves' season. Once Gibbs embraced it, they developed into a
tournament team.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't see (what Gibbs did) because it doesn't
get touched on,'' Archie said. ``But the guys in the locker room
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his scoring has dipped, Gibbs is more important to
Pepperdine now then at any point of his three-year career. On the
floor, he provided rugged defense and rebounding, medium-range
offense and an occasional 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Off court, his engaging personality blends well with
Pepperdine's diverse personalities, making him an ideal leader.
He's not afraid to speak up, but mature enough to chose his spots
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff picked up on those traits during meetings with
Gibbs in the offseason to discuss the changes. After talking with
Gibbs, van Breda Kolff was confident things would work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``(My first) week on the job he was in the office watching the
Gonzaga tape from last year when (Pepperdine lost) by 30,'' van
Breda Kolff said. ``He wanted to see what Gonzaga did to beat them.
He was already thinking about that six months before we played
them. He wanted to know what he could do to help the team, and said
whatever you want me to do I'll do.''

PARK JUST THROWS, SUCCEEDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ So much of the Los Angeles Dodgers' success
this season rides on the right arm of Chan Ho Park, which explains
why manager Davey Johnson was so enthralled with what transpired
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   After worrying about having the perfect mechanics in his first
two spring outings, the cerebral Park changed his focus to just
pitching. The results brought a huge smile to Johnson's face.
</P>
<P>
   Park, who had a 10.80 ERA, allowed one run in five innings. His
control, which was lacking, was much better as he struck out five
and walked one against Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan Ho, that was large,'' Johnson said. ``His breaking stuff
is not where I'd like to see it, but he threw some breaking balls
over. That was a good, positive outing for him. He needed that. I
know that he's been a little confused at times with everybody
adding their two cents in there, but he went out there and threw
the ball for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Park spent the first few weeks of the season working with Sandy
Koufax and Orel Hershiser on his mechanics, particularly on keeping
his right leg straight to help his control.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my mechanics, I'm much more comfortable right now so I
don't have to worry about them on the mound,'' Park said. ``I can
just pitch. I don't know if I had good mechanics because I focused
on the pitches. But the pitching coach (Claude Osteen) and the
other guys told me I had better mechanics. I don't have to worry
about them on the mound anymore, maybe just in the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Few chances remain: Several team officials said the Dodgers
front office is almost out of patience with left-handed Carlos
Perez, and his recent arrest for driving under the influence of
alcohol is just the latest piece in the disappointment pile.
Depending on his Friday start against St. Louis, Perez could be out
of the running for a starting spot by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he will go with a five-man rotation after Perez and
Orel Hershiser pitch Friday, and who that fifth man will be depends
heavily on how Perez throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see progress,'' Johnson said. ``That's what spring
is about. It's not about having great outings. It's about having
better outings, stronger outings, sharper outings, going after the
hitters, keeping the ball down, being more pitch efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez has done none of those things in his first two outings. It
began with an abysmal five-run, two-inning outing, and was followed
by a four-run, three-inning process of extreme labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That last time out - three innings, 73 pitches - we have to
improve on that,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Right-hander Gregg Olson, who last pitched March
7, threw on the side but still has minor irritation and
inflammation in his elbow, Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone
said. ``It seems like he's making progress,'' Malone said....
Right-hander Mike Fetters should make his Grapefruit League debut
Thursday.... Catcher Todd Hundley had his fourth straight day off
because of back spasms, but he said he plans to play today against
the Mets.... The Dodgers sent pitcher Chad Ricketts and infielder
Jorge Nunez to Triple-A Albuquerque and reassigned pitchers Jim
Bullinger and Maximo Nunez, infielder Adam Riggs and outfielder
Shawn Gilbert to minor-league camp.

BMW RECONSIDERS AND MAY SELL ITS MONEY-LOSING ROVER UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In a startling about-face, BMW said Tuesday
that its supervisory board would consider selling most of Rover,
the money-losing British carmaker it bought six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Tuesday night, after a report in the
Munich newspaper Suddeutsche, BMW said that plans for a sell-off
were ``one of the imaginable scenarios'' that will be presented to
the supervisory board on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last month, BMW executives had been insisting
that they were not flinching from their commitment to Rover and
rejected overtures from Volkswagen and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Rover has consumed billions of dollars and brought the
German car maker a seemingly endless stream of problems. Rover lost
1.9 billion marks, about $1 billion, in 1998, and company
executives have already warned that the losses in 1999 were even
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Rover is also running into unexpected problems in its
negotiations with the British government over a package of
subsidies to retrofit Rover's main British factory in Longbridge.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission raised new objections to the deal,
warning that the subsidies amounted to unjustified and illegal
government support of the venture.
</P>
<P>
   The Longbridge plant outside Birmingham employs 9,000 workers,
and there has been persistent anxiety among Rover employees about
their future. Tens of thousands of supply-industry jobs that
indirectly rely on the Longbridge plant would also be vulnerable if
it was to be closed or sold.
</P>
<P>
   Many automobile analysts have argued for more than a year now
that BMW's strategy with Rover is misguided. The idea has always
been that owning Rover, which produces the popular Land Rover
sport-utility vehicle as well as a range of mass-market sedans,
would allow BMW to expand beyond its core business of making sporty
luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts argue that the strategy will only hurt
profits, not only because it consumes so much money but also
because profits are much lower in the mass-market segments than for
luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   The issue led to a huge boardroom fight more than a year ago and
to the resignation of BMW's previous chief executive, Bernd
Pischetsrieder.
</P>
<P>
   But even after Pischetsrieder's ouster and replacement by
Joachim Milberg, BMW seemed bent on pursuing exactly the same
strategy as before.
</P>
<P>
   BMW has begun freshening up and rethinking the Rover product
line. But the results have been modest, and company executives have
declined to predict when Rover will return to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from problems with the line-up of Rover sedans, the
company has been badly hurt by currency problems stemming from the
high value of the British pound.
</P>
<P>
   The pound has soared in relation to the euro, the currency for
most of Continental Europe, and one result has been that cars
produced in Germany, France and Italy are much cheaper than those
produced in Britain. British exports to the rest of Europe have
been strangled while imports into Britain have soared.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure has grown more intense as the global automobile
industry continues its relentless consolidation. Ford now owns
Volvo, not to mention Jaguar and Aston-Martin.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, General Motors announced plans to take a 20 percent
stake in Fiat.
</P>
<P>
   BMW, in which Germany's Quandt family owns a controlling stake,
has repeatedly refuted speculation that it might be willing to be
sold as well.
</P>
<P>
   But it is well known that many companies, from Ford to
Volkswagen, would jump at the chance to acquire BMW. Volkswagen,
headed by Ferdinand Piech, has been nudging the company but said
publicly last month that it had become convinced that BMW was not
interested in any deals.
</P>
<P>
   In its report on Tuesday, Suddeutsche said that Milberg would
present a plan to sell Rover's line of sedans to an unidentified
buyer that is not one of the ``established carmakers.''
</P>
<P>
   After first denying the report as ``pure speculation,'' BMW said
Tuesday night that some sort of sale involving Rover was among the
options under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The news had little impact on BMW shares, which rose 0.76 euro
on Tuesday, to 27.3 euros, or about $26.20, on the Frankfurt
exchange.

PATAKI PROPOSES BROAD PACKAGE OF GUN CONTROLS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Swimming against the tide of his own party, Gov.
George Pataki on Tuesday proposed a sweeping package of gun
controls, including mandatory trigger locks with gun sales, a ban
on assault weapons and steps to make it easier for the police to
trace guns used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates say the measures, if enacted, would give
New York among the strictest gun controls in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, if you think it's the right thing, you have to
pursue it,'' Pataki told ABC News in an interview Tuesday night.
``I'm hopeful we can get this through the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the measures would require so-called ballistics
fingerprinting, which would record the unique markings from all new
guns so that bullets and shell casings could later be traced to
them.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, the governor called for raising the legal age
for gun purchases to 21 from 18, and said he would seek to close a
loophole in the system of background checks for gun buyers by
requiring that those checks be done on buyers at gun shows and flea
markets, not just on those who buy in stores. Aides to Pataki said
he would unveil details of his proposals at a news conference
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals are expected to pass in the Democratic-controlled
Assembly, though their fate in the Republican-dominated Senate is
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the proposals put Pataki, who harbors ambitions of
national office, at odds with the Republican leaders in Congress
and many of his fellow Republican governors. In fact, they put him
squarely in the camp of Democrats, including President Clinton, who
have been calling for many of the same measures for years. It is a
familiar position for Pataki, who favors abortion rights and gay
rights, and who recently signed into law an ambitious health care
program for the poor and a major increase in the state's cigarette
tax.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has called on Congress to require
background checks at gun shows and has proposed mandating
ballistics fingerprinting, and specific legislation is being
written by Democratic lawmakers, said Kristen Rand, the senior
counsel for the Violence Policy Center, a gun control group. The
gun control measure in the congressional conference committee
contains a trigger-lock provision, but gun control advocates say it
is too weak to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Morton, the spokesman for Handgun Control, said Pataki's
proposals go beyond what most other states are considering and are
important given that Pataki is a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from a Republican governor this is revolutionary,''
Morton said. ``This is an incredible, forward-looking step in law
enforcement and crime control. It shows that this is not a partisan
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's proposals are the first significant gun control
legislation he has called for in his five years in office. Various
elements of his plan have passed the Democratic-controlled Assembly
at one time or another. ``I welcome him aboard,'' the speaker of
the Assembly, Sheldon Silver, said Tuesday night. ``We've been
doing these things for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate, where Republicans hold the majority, has
resisted gun control measures in the past, but in this election
year, the majority leader, Joseph Bruno, has expressed a
willingness to consider some measures, though he has not given any
specifics. John McArdle, a spokesman for Bruno, would not comment
on the governor's plans.
</P>
<P>
   The most innovative part of the governor's plan would require
that any new gun sold in New York be fired first, to record its
ballistic fingerprint, the pattern of nicks and scratches left on a
bullet that is unique to each weapon. Such markings are often used
by the police and prosecutors to trace a crime to a particular gun,
but first the gun must be found. Under Pataki's plan, the
ballistics patterns of all new guns would go into a database that
could be used for comparison with bullets used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a crime scene, people don't leave the gun very often,'' the
governor told ABC. ``But they do leave bullets or shell casings.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association has been opposed to the taking of
ballistics samples for the government, contending that it would be
a preliminary step toward national gun registration.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Michon, the vice president of the New York State Rifle
and Pistol association, the state affiliate of the NRA, said his
organization would likely oppose the legislation
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need any more legislation, they just need to
enforce the ones that are on the books,'' he said. ``They are
throwing up a smokescreen for their own inadequacies at enforcing
the laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Michon said the trigger lock legislation was inferior to a
measure Pataki vetoed last year that would have taught an NRA gun
education program in state schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trigger locks are unnecessary because it's proven they won't
work,'' Michon said. ``The state association has pushed to educate
kids that you should not touch a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun control has become one of the most contentious issues in
Washington, and it promises to become a big part of the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans have generally resisted gun control
measures, though some measures, like requiring trigger locks with
gun sales, enjoy broad support.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in the wake of the Columbine High School shooting in
Colorado, each house of Congress passed its own measure that would,
among other things, close the gun show loophole. But negotiators
have made no progress toward reconciling the differences between
the two bills, and some Republican leaders have made it clear that
they think both versions go too far, saying that what is needed is
better enforcement of existing laws. Clinton has accused
congressional Republicans of intentionally stalling.
</P>
<P>
   Each highly publicized school shooting like Columbine leads to a
new round of legislative proposals for gun control, and new heights
of popularity for those proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Calls for requiring that trigger locks be included in all gun
sales have grown in the two weeks since a 6-year-old boy in
Michigan fatally shot a classmate with a pistol he found in his
home. Such a lock physically blocks the movement of the trigger,
making the gun impossible to fire without the key to the lock.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals to ban or restrict assault rifles gained momentum
after such a weapon was used in a schoolyard shooting in Stockton,
Calif., in 1989 that left five children dead.
</P>
<P>
   Rand, of the Violence Policy Center, said that while the
measures proposed by Pataki were important to improve law
enforcement and gun safety, they might not do much to dent gun
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to decrease gun violence, you have to
regulate the gun industry in a more comprehensive way,'' Rand said.
``And that is difficult at the state level.''

U.S. IS SAID TO SEEK DEATH PENALTY IN EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Repeating for all needing.)  
(bl) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are pursuing the
death penalty against at least one defendant in the bombings of two
U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998, according to defense lawyers
involved in the broad terrorism case.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, is one of three
suspects in the embassy bombings who could face the death penalty,
and the lawyers said it now appeared very likely that prosecutors
would also seek the death penalty against the other two.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan,
which has not been made public, is subject to approval by Attorney
General Janet Reno. But death penalty experts said they expected
Reno to concur, noting that she has given approval in all four
previous cases in which White's office has sought capital
punishment. Each of those cases resulted in plea bargains that led
to long prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   The decision in the al-'Owhali case has been watched
particularly closely by death penalty experts because prosecutors
say he was a suicide bomber who had actually wanted to die as a
martyr in the explosion at the embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. That
bombing and a nearly simultaneous explosion at the embassy in Dar
es Salaam, Tanzania, killed more than 200 people and wounded
thousands on Aug. 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty decision is also the first in the series of
major terrorism prosecutions of about two dozen Islamic militants
in New York since the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, including
another plot to blow up major landmarks in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In some of those cases, the convicted terrorists did not face
the death penalty because their crimes occurred before a 1994 law
that broadly expanded the use of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Two lawyers for al-'Owhali, Leonard F. Joy and David I. Bruck,
would not comment Tuesday on White's decision to pursue a capital
case. The lawyers had met with prosecutors recently to make a
direct appeal against a death penalty prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   White's office also refused to discuss her decision Tuesday or
say whether she planned to seek the death penalty against two other
defendants in the embassy bombings. But a lawyer for another
defendant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he learned
of White's decision Tuesday. ``This sort of takes the mystery out
of what's going to happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A total of six defendants are in custody in the case in New
York, but the other three are not charged with capital crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Al-'Owhali is the only defendant whom prosecutors directly
accused of being a would-be suicide bomber. Al-'Owhali, who was the
first suspect brought back to New York from Africa in the weeks
after the bombing, was said to have acknowledged that he rode as a
passenger in the truck that carried the massive bomb to the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi, according to federal charges.
</P>
<P>
   The government has charged that al-'Owhali admitted to
investigators that he tossed a dummy grenade at a security guard
seconds before the bomb was detonated, that he was prepared to die
and that the bombing was intended as a ``martyrdom operation in
which he did not expect to survive.'' The indictment also contends
that the driver of the truck, identified only as Azzam, was killed
in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   A number of defense lawyers and others have questioned whether
the government would seek the death penalty for such a defendant,
since it would then seem to offer him the reward he was seeking: a
highly publicized execution and a trip to paradise at the hands of
his enemy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was not clear Tuesday how White and a committee of
prosecutors who examined the case viewed such issues. Nor was it
known whether White's office considered how a death penalty
prosecution in the bombing case would play out in Islamic
countries, including Afghanistan. The man suspected of
masterminding the embassy bombings, Osama bin Laden, has been
living there under the protection of the fundamentalist Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   One effect of a capital prosecution will most likely be to force
two separate trials before Judge Leonard B. Sand in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan. One trial would involve el-'Owhali and any of
his co-defendants who face the death penalty, and the other would
involve the defendants accused of participating in what the
government says is bin Laden's global terrorism conspiracy against
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A single trial for all the defendants is now scheduled for
September.
</P>
<P>
   The other two defendants who could face the death penalty are
Mohammed Saddiq Odehand Khalfan Khamis Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the practice in other federal death penalty cases,
the defense lawyers, Joy, Bruck and Robert Tucker, are expected to
travel to Washington and ask Reno's office to overrule White.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers who have watched the four other federal death
penalty cases in Manhattan said that Reno had been generally
unreceptive to such appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they said, in two other recent cases in Manhattan, Reno
is believed to have overruled a decision by White not to seek the
death penalty and ordered a capital prosecution. In one case, the
defendant has pleaded guilty. The other case is pending.

SELE A SURPRISING ADDITION TO MARINERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ Seattle Mariners manager Lou Piniella has seen
enough of 6-foot-10 left-hander Ryan Anderson's 95-mph fastball and
hard, biting slider. If he sees any more, Piniella might be tempted
to keep the 20-year-old phenom.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd better get him out of camp quick,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella is joking. The temptation isn't that great. He loves
the thought of Anderson in the Mariners' rotation next year, or
perhaps late this season, but, for now, the Mariners can afford to
give their precocious prodigy more seasoning in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, if he'd pitched like this, he'd have made the
team,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Mariners didn't have Aaron Sele, who won 18
games for the Rangers last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had a decent pitching staff last season. Veteran
left-hander Jamie Moyer was his usual steady, consistent self and
went 14-8. Youngsters Freddy Garcia, John Halama and Gil Meche
combined to win 36 games.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the team finished 79-83, 16 games behind the Rangers in the
American League West.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to close the gap, the Mariners signed six free
agents in the off-season, including first baseman John Olerud, a
career .301 hitter, and former Rangers second baseman Mark
McLemore. The most important one, though, could be Sele, whom they
didn't think they had a chance to get.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a proven winner at the top of our rotation to go along
with Jamie is going to be a great addition,'' pitching coach Bryan
Price said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are trying to make up a 16-game deficit but had no
idea they would have a shot at signing the Rangers' top winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the season went, I assumed all along we'd quickly get
a deal done and I'd head back there,'' Sele said.
</P>
<P>
   Sele was so certain he put down a deposit on a townhouse in
Colleyville. Why not? The Rangers wanted him. He wanted to pitch
for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he followed a strange, twisting road that took him to
the Rangers' divisional rivals. Rangers general manager Doug Melvin
began talking with Sele's agent, Adam Katz, during the World
Series. Before long, Melvin made a four-year, $28 million offer.
That offer, however, sat on the table so long it accumulated
several layers of dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no movement, and it didn't seem like there was any
real effort to re-sign me,'' Sele said.
</P>
<P>
   That's his version. Melvin's version is that Katz never made a
counteroffer, and, without any other offers, there was no reason to
bid against himself. Tired of waiting, Melvin signed free agent
left-hander Kenny Rogers in December.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after the Rangers signed Rogers, Sele agreed to a
four-year contract with the Baltimore Orioles for a little more
money than Texas' original offer.
</P>
<P>
   But he never signed. The Orioles flew him in for a physical on a
Friday and began to backpedal when they didn't like the look of
something in his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got your incumbent team offering you a four-year
contract, and the team you agree with questions your physical, it
was something else,'' Sele said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he flew to Los Angeles for a second opinion from Dr.
Frank Jobe. He received a clean bill of health and, five hours
later, agreed to terms with the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way contracts are supposed to be done,'' said Sele,
who grew up and lives in the Seattle area. ``Get in, start a
dialogue and get signed. It was really nice after the way the whole
off-season went.''
</P>
<P>
   He got a two-year deal for $15 million, instead of the $28
million the Rangers offered, but said things worked out for the
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was crazy the way this whole off-season went,'' he said.
``To end up in Seattle, it's a wonderful thing. It's really a
blessing for my family. It worked out excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked out well for Sele, and it worked out well for the
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Anderson might prove to be a Randy Johnson-type
ace. But for the present, the Mariners have an 18-game winner in
the rotation. nn

CRABTREE, RANGERS DISCUSS CONTRACT EXTENSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL AND T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. _ A contract extension could be forthcoming for
Rangers reliever Tim Crabtree.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Baldwin, who represents Crabtree, called general manager
Doug Melvin on Monday to start discussions. Melvin indicated
yesterday that the organization would be interested, but any
conversations will be done discreetly to prevent any distractions
for the player, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree will earn $925,000 this season, and the Rangers hold an
option for the 2001 season at $1.3 million. Crabtree could become a
free agent after the 2001 season, but the right-hander appears
willing to forgo his first crack at free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like where I'm at,'' said Crabtree, who led the Rangers with
a career-high 68 appearances in 1999 and went 5-1 with a 3.46
earned-run average. ``I like the Rangers, and I'm very comfortable
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' acquisition of Crabtree from the Blue Jays for
catcher Kevin Brown ranks among one of Melvin's better trades.
Crabtree is 11-2 with a 3.53 ERA in 132 appearances for the Rangers
over the past two seasons. Brown has hit .277 in 54 games for the
Blue Jays during that period.
Lamb pressing
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates sees third baseman Mike Lamb pressing
during his at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb, the organization's 1999 minor-league player of the year,
went 0-for-4 yesterday as he battles Tom Evans in the competition
to become the Rangers' regular third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pressing,'' Oates said. ``I know he's not swinging the
bat like he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb's average dipped to .240 (6-for-25) with yesterday's
performance. Evans is hitting .450 (9-for-20) with four home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure is the name of this game,'' Oates said. ``If he
thinks Evans is putting pressure on him, wait until he faces Pedro
\RMartinez\S.''
Trade talks quiet
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have reached the midpoint of spring training, and
little has developed in the way of trade talks.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some talk among major-league officials that the
Rangers might be interested in a second baseman _ Delino DeShields
and Mike Lansing are available _ but general manager Doug Melvin
shot that down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for a second baseman,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers scouts are keeping an eye out for left-handed relief if
Mike Venafro is slow recovering from a strained ligament in his
left middle finger. But the New York Mets have stopped trying to
trade Dennis Cook, and Melvin said there is little else available.
_ T.R. Sullivan
Greer closer to return
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Rusty Greer returned to Port Charlotte yesterday
and might resume playing as soon as Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Greer underwent a magnetic-resonance-imaging exam and bone scan
Monday in Dallas, and the results confirmed that the inflammation
in his right ankle is being caused by fluid. Greer received a
cortisone shot and is scheduled to resume workouts tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out of the woods yet,'' Johnny Oates said.
``Hopefully, everything is OK, but you don't rest until it is.''

LONGHORNS HAVE MOVED ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas guard Will Clay says that if Monday's
practice was any indication, the Longhorns have gone onward through
the lackadaisical fog they appeared to play in during the loss to
Oklahoma in the Big 12 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great day of practice,'' Clay said. ``Very intense. And
we're going to work hard to get better right up until we play again
Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-seeded Longhorns traveled to Salt Lake City yesterday,
where they open NCAA Tournament play tomorrow in the West Region
against 12th-seeded Indiana State. Declarations of rededication
abound. And if his team learned something of a lesson from the
dismal performance against the Sooners four days ago, so be it,
coach Rick Barnes said. But he also said he could think of better
learning tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a guy who likes to lose games to teach lessons,''
Barnes said. ``Maybe if we play well \Rin the NCAAs\S, I'll look
back and say it was helpful. You lose, you put it behind you, pick
yourself up and go again. I guess you can spin it any way you want
to spin it.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Chris Mihm said the Longhorns should benefit from the Big
12 regular-season war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conference was fantastic, a dogfight all year,'' Mihm
said. ``There hasn't been an easy game. We had to stay on our toes
to finish 13-3, and it's been difficult. I think that will help
prepare us for the NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it's going to be refreshing to play some other
teams and see what we can do. It does get a little tedious at times
during conference play when everybody knows what to expect. That's
what makes it special in the NCAA Tournament because you never know
who you're going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas did travel to Utah with one injury concern. Backup point
guard Chris McColpin, who has given the Longhorns some valuable
spot minutes and has tournament experience, sprained an ankle in
Monday's practice. X-rays taken yesterday were negative, but he is
listed as questionable for tomorrow's game.

WEB SITE OFFERS GONZO LOOK AT BASKETBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ From noon to 2 p.m. on most days, the dozen
or so employees at HoopsTV.com in Paoli, Pa., can count on a rough
and tumble board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Board meeting, in this case, means a meeting beneath the boards
_ as in playground basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at HoopsTV.com, a 1-month-old Internet startup company
that caters to hardcore basketball fans, use their two-hour window
for lunch to get in a few games of pickup basketball at a nearby
park in their western Philadelphia suburb.
</P>
<P>
   These long lunch hours don't bother the man in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work is work, fun is fun and ball is ball,'' said Seth Burger,
the 32-year-old president and founder of HoopsTV.com. ``If nothing
else, the only reason to work here is to hoop from 12 to 2 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   And that pretty much explains the passion behind HoopsTV.com.
The site takes a gonzo approach to a sport that transcends all
kinds of demographics. HoopsTV.com bills itself as a 24-hour
basketball network, specializing in original programming from the
playgrounds to colleges to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   And with the NCAA men's and women's tournaments ready to tip off
and the NBA playoff races heating up, HoopsTV.com offers an
interesting stop for basketball fans, especially for the site's
target audience of ball players ages 12 to 30.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can find multimedia clips, commentary from experts such
as Kenny Smith and Bill Raftery and gads of interactive features.
An example of the site's alternative approach: HoopsTV.com's latest
daily survey revealed that 80 percent of its members would trade in
their girlfriends for worldly possessions, such as a Range Rover or
Tyra Banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not a site for the casual fan,'' Burger said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott O'Neil, one of the company's vice presidents, said
HoopsTV.com isn't like NBA.com for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go where no one else can go,'' O'Neil said, referring to
the site's sections on playground and amateur basketball. ``Anyone
can turn on television to see an NBA game. We represent what the
culture of the game is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Burger, who worked at a basketball sneaker company, said he came
up with the idea in June. He secured funding from sources he had
cultivated in the sports-apparel business, hired about 10 people
and it ``kind of grew from there.''
</P>
<P>
   While some Internet startups are positioning themselves for
alliances with bigger online companies, Burger said HoopsTV.com's
goal is to be ``strong and independent.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one way to ensure the lunch-hour pickup games.
Bytes
</P>
<P>
   Odds are: The odds of picking the winner at your office pool
probably aren't as long as those on a contest promoted by
Sandbox.com. For a $10 million grand prize, the winner must select
the winner of all 63 games. University of Southern California
mathematics professor Kenneth Alexander figured that someone has a
better chance of winning a pick-six state lottery twice in a row
than picking every game correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Accomplishing the same feat at online sports book Intertops.com
will earn $2 million; Predictit.com and FansOnly.com have $1
million payouts. Not everyone likes the contests. ``We're adamant
about doing anything we can to get these things as far away as
possible from any appearance of gambling,'' Wally Renfro, an NCAA
spokesman, told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker ban: Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker's diatribe in
Sports Illustrated cost him more than a 14-day suspension and $500
fine. Rocker paid dearly with an online fantasy league called
FantasySportsnet.com.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based site suspended Rocker for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell C. Lerner, the site's CEO, said they would review
Rocker's situation before the All-Star break, and ``if there have
been no further transgressions, and his ERA is below 3.00 and he's
accumulated 15 saves, he might be reinstated for selection by FSN
subscribers.''
</P>
<P>
   Best fan: Here is a contest that Mavericks owner-in-waiting Mark
Cuban, or anyone willing to pay $250 million for a lower-rung NBA
team, might want to check. United Sports Fans of America
(UsFANS.com), a fan advocacy group, is on a two-month search for
``Basketball's Biggest Fan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boca Raton, Fla.-based site, which tackles issues such 0as
escalating ticket prices, NFL TV blackouts, player and official
strikes, stadium funding and franchise moves, is accepting essays
of 150 words or less from fans vying for the title.
</P>
<P>
   The contest concludes April 18, the final weekend of the NBA
regular season. The grand-prize winner earns a trip to the 2000 NBA
Finals.

HAAS GETS PAST INITIAL AWE AT AUGUSTA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rest assured, Hunter Haas is not the first person to suffer
momentary lockjaw upon his initial visit to Augusta National Golf
Club. Nor is he likely to be the last. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To a golfer, strolling down Magnolia Lane for the first time
must be akin to a follower of Islam getting his first glimpse of
Mecca. It's a time for silence and reflection. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is what Haas, the U.S. Public Links champion from Fort
Worth, seemed to be doing at the guard booth to the main gate
before a recent practice round. His father, Jim, had to nudge him
back to reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked through the window at the guy and just froze. He
didn't know what to say,'' Jim Haas said. ``I finally told him,
`Say SOMETHING.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Haas stammered: ``I'm Hunter.''
</P>
<P>
   The attendant replied: ``Mr. Haas, we've been expecting you all
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ice broken, the Southwest High School graduate and former
University of Oklahoma golfer relaxed and made the most of three
practice rounds in preparation for the biggest golfing week of his
career. Haas, 23, will compete April 6-9 at the Masters in Augusta,
Ga., and already has lined up a Tuesday practice round with Arnold
Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   But his initial exposure to the course came last weekend, when
Haas squeezed in as much golf as possible between three lightning
delays and pumped as much information as possible out of four
caddies, the course superintendent and a handful of members.
</P>
<P>
   First impressions?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's kind of an eerie feeling about the place. I'm not sure
that's the right word, but everywhere you go, you can sense the
history,'' Haas said. ``You definitely know where you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Haas didn't bother keeping score during his rounds. He was more
interested in experiencing as many different shots from as many
different locations as possible. He lined up some U-shaped putts
and chips at the undulating 16th green. He felt the swirling winds
at Amen Corner.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he noticed his comfort zone expanding with each
shot during his Friday-Sunday stay.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Haas flew the green with his approach on No. 1
during his initial practice round. He opted to putt from the
fringe. Four strokes later, he had carded a double bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``But by Sunday, I knew where every putt was going and I was
actually making some long putts,'' Haas said. ``I really liked the
course. I felt comfortable. A lot more comfortable than if I went
in for the first time on Monday (of tournament week).''
</P>
<P>
   During the obligatory tour of club facilities, Haas made some
mental notes and adjusted some logistical plans. The tiny Crow's
Nest, a room in the clubhouse made available to amateurs during
tournament week, will not be a permanent resting place for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one or two nights will be fine, just for the
experience,'' Haas said. ``Definitely not for the whole
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of strategy, Haas got to experience the course in both
firm and wet conditions. A Friday rain limited his practice session
to seven holes but sunny conditions returned during weekend rounds.
Discussions with caddies convinced him that tee shots during
tournament week, when the course is firm and fast, would travel
30-40 yards farther than the shots he hit last weekend when the
course was tailored to members.
</P>
<P>
   ``My caddie told me a lot of pros play from the members' tees
this time of year because (approach shots) wind up where they'll be
hitting from in the tournament,'' Haas said. ``I hit from the back
tees, just for the visual image, then kicked it up 30 or 40 yards.
I think that will help me know how to shape shots and where I need
to be in the fairways.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, where Haas would like to be _ on a permanent basis _
is in the room he enjoyed most during his tour: the champion's
locker room. Small and quaint, Haas noticed multiple names on each
door. Even Jack Nicklaus, a six-time champ, doesn't get his own
stall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That lets you know you have to earn your spot. They don't just
build a new locker every year,'' Haas said. ``I liked that.''
</P>
<P>
   While in the room, Haas said he envisioned his name on one of
those doors. But he didn't care if he shared with Nicklaus, Tiger
Woods or Nick Faldo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take whatever they can give me,'' Haas said.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Haas already may have taken his first steps in that
direction with last week's introduction to Augusta.
STRATEGY SESSION
</P>
<P>
   Members of the PGA Tour's policy board convene Wednesday to
decide what action, if any, the tour will take in pursuing its
ongoing legal battle with disabled golfer Casey Martin. A U.S.
appeals court in San Francisco ruled 3-0 last week to uphold a 1998
decision by an Oregon court that Martin, 27, should be allowed to
use a cart during competition under the Americans With Disabilities
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Martin suffers from Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, a
circulatory disorder that has withered his right leg and makes
walking painful. In handing down the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruling, judge William Canby wrote: ``The central
competition in shot-making would be unaffected by Martin's
accommodation. ... All that the cart does is permit Martin access
to a type of competition in which he otherwise could not engage
because of his disability. That is precisely the purpose of the
ADA.''
</P>
<P>
   PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem issued a statement saying tour
officials ``will have further comment, if appropriate'' after
Wednesday's meeting. The final step in the appeals process for the
tour would be the U.S. Supreme Court, which could not hear the case
until 2001, at the earliest.

   Memo to Finchem &AMP; Co: You're already 0-3 when involving courts
on this issue (0-2 in actual legal venues, 0-1 in the court of
public opinion). It's time to do what should have happened
initially: Incorporate a tour bylaw saying players with permanent
disabilities that impair mobility, as attested by a doctor, can
ride a cart during competition. Over the next 100 years, the short
list of players who fit that description and break par regularly
will probably begin and end with Casey Martin. If not, there won't
be enough additions to make it worth the continuation of this
losing battle in the courts. UNLUCKY SEVEN
</P>
<P>
   Olin Browne, reigning MasterCard Colonial champion, was among
seven golfers who missed out on a Masters invitation because of a
new rule in place this year at Augusta National Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament officials no longer automatically invite every winner
of a PGA Tour event in the previous calendar year. Instead,
invitations go to the top 50 players in the world golf rankings,
with the remaining spots filled by past Masters winners or by
competitors based upon finishes at other major championships
(professional and amateur).
</P>
<P>
   Joining Browne in the first wave of 1999-2000 tournament winners
to get the Augusta snub were Brad Faxon, Rich Beem, J.L. Lewis,
Brian Henninger, Jim Carter and Tom Pernice Jr. Two winners from
this season, Paul Azinger and Kirk Triplett, squeezed in based on
rankings (No. 49 and No. 27, respectively) as of the March 6
cutoff. Shigeki Maruyama, a career nonwinner on the PGA Tour,
vaulted into the field because he climbed to No. 48 in the world
rankings by the cutoff date.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their tournament and they can do what they want. I'm
disappointed not to be invited,'' Browne said, choosing his words
carefully. ``I've played there twice already and think I've shown I
can compete in that setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Browne, 40, finished 52nd at last year's Masters. O'MEARA
RETURNS TO COLONIAL
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara, one of five high-profile players who skipped the
1999 MasterCard Colonial to accept a six-figure appearance fee and
compete in a European Tour event with conflicting dates, has made
plans to return to Fort Worth this season.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, the 1998 PGA Tour Player of the Year, is among 62
players who have committed to compete in the May 18-21 event. It
will be O'Meara's first visit to Colonial since missing the cut at
the 1995 event.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable commitments released this week by Colonial
officials include four of O'Meara's teammates on the 1999 U.S.
Ryder Cup: Tom Lehman, Justin Leonard, Davis Love III and Steve
Pate. Also on the list are Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks and
two-time Colonial champs Corey Pavin, Bruce Lietzke and Ben
Crenshaw. Matt Gogel, an early contender for PGA Tour Rookie of the
Year honors, also has committed to make his Colonial debut.
</P>
<P>
   Commitments are not binding, but Colonial officials said all 62
players have arranged housing during tournament week and are
expected to compete. LPGA GOLDEN MOMENTS
</P>
<P>
   To commemorate the LPGA Tour's 50th anniversary, the
Star-Telegram will feature a significant moment in tour history
each week during the 2000 season. July 26, 1992
</P>
<P>
   Patty Sheehan, an LPGA Hall of Famer with three runner-up
finishes at the U.S. Women's Open, defeated Juli Inkster in an
18-hole playoff to win the event in her 13th attempt. Sheehan
needed birdies on the final two holes of regulation to force the
playoff.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was especially emotional for Sheehan, who
surrendered an 11-stroke lead to Betsy King over the final 33 holes
of the 1990 Open to finish second in heartbreaking fashion. To win
in come-from-behind fashion the same event two years, Sheehan said,
made the 1992 Open the most memorable of her 35 tour victories.

MAVS DOMINATE EAST'S NO. 1 TEAM
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Through the window, over the expressway, under the
tunnel, off the janitor's head.
</P>
<P>
   Had any of the Dallas Mavericks attempted one of those ludicrous
shots against Indiana, it probably would have dropped. It was that
kind of night.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Dirk Nowitzki's 28 points, the Mavs scored their
most-impressive victory of the season in a resounding 111-90 rout
of the Eastern Conference-leading Indiana Pacers before 15,761
Tuesday night at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks, who led the entire game, shot 51 percent in the
first half and led by as many as 32 points in the third quarter
before the final 12 minutes became extended garbage time. It was
the Mavs' second-largest margin of victory, behind a 23-point
victory against Golden State in the third game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's contagious and perpetual,'' said guard Steve
Nash, who scored 21 points on 8-of-11 shooting, including 4-of-5
from 3-point range. ``It's not going to be that way every night,
but the good thing is that we played defense and when you do that
you give yourself a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Offense first, defense later.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs shot 60 percent (9-for-15) from 3-point range, scored a
season-high 36 first-quarter points and every player scored.
Highlighted by Nowitzki's 10-of-13 shooting, and 4-of-5 from
3-point range, and Michael Finley's 16-point, 11-assist
performance, the Mavericks' starters shot 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were on fire tonight,'' said Pacers forward Austin
Croshere, who scored 10 points on 4-of-12 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Six Mavs finished in double-figures, punctuated by sub Greg
Buckner's first career double-double as he finished with 10 points
and 11 rebounds in 24 minutes. Even little-used reserve Bruno
Sundov jumped in on the fun with a hook shot that banked in with
less than one minute remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite clear we were hot and making shots,'' Mavs coach
Don Nelson said. ``But, that's just half of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense limited Indiana, which entered the game shooting 46
percent, to 33 percent shooting, and All-Star guard Reggie Miller
was held to seven points. This coming the day after the Mavericks
hired former Lakers coach Del Harris as their defensive
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Del's wonderful isn't he? He makes a big difference in two
minutes,'' dead-panned Pacers coach Larry Bird. ``When you play
against a team that on the defensive end gets up into you and makes
a lot of shots on the other end, you're going to lose the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, who were playing without injured All-Star forward
Dale Davis, suffered their second consecutive defeat and first loss
to a team with a losing record since Orlando defeated them Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson switched defensive assignments, putting the smaller Nash
on Miller and the taller Finley on point guard Mark Jackson.
Jackson and Miller were a combined 3- for-18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight we used it to our advantage,'' Nash said.''It can work
either way. It was a dilemma for them. You either let Finley go one
on one and I went to spot up, and by the time they got to me it was
too late.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory also exacts a small degree of revenge for the
Mavericks, who lost at Indiana on Feb. 21 by one point on a
controversial late foul on Finley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there is extra satisfaction,'' forward Cedric Ceballos
said. ``We did the same thing in Indiana. We took over the game
(there), and then three other people (referees) started getting
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks jumped on Indiana so early that any interaction
from neutral parties was never going to be in question. The Mavs
led 17-6 in the first six minutes and stretched the margin to 18 by
the end of the first quarter. The inevitable NBA-run came in the
second quarter, when the lead was cut to 10 points with 59 seconds
remaining in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Any thoughts of a comeback were buried by Nowitzki, who scored
10 consecutive points to begin the third quarter that were part of
a 25-3 run that pushed the lead to 80-48. nn

SPURS' ELLIOTT RETURNS 7 MONTHS AFTER TRANSPLANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ With one thunderous dunk, Sean Elliott's big heart
overshadowed his new kidney.
</P>
<P>
   Almost seven months to the day after receiving a life-saving
kidney from his brother, Noel, the San Antonio Spurs forward
Tuesday night became the first professional athlete to return to
action after receiving an organ transplant. Showing no ill effects
other than fatigue and a hesitancy to shoot, Elliott otherwise
relieved the fears and calmed the nerves of teammates and a crowd
of 26,708 at the Alamodome by scoring a monumental two points in 12
minutes in a 94-79 Spurs victory against the Atlanta Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott missed his first two shots, but brought the crowd and
his teammates to their feet with a third-quarter drive-and-dunk
down the lane. Even before that _ by making a surprise start _
Elliott had already become a modern-medicine marvel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to approach it as just another game, but I think it's
pretty important because it affects so many people,'' said Elliott,
who received a hug from Hawks center Dikembe Mutombo and a standing
ovation before the opening tip. ``I couldn't feel my arms or legs
to start the game, my feet were heavy and my mouth was dry. And,
honestly, I was surprised I felt that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Spurs team doctor Paul Saenz, ``Because Sean's venturing
into the unknown, I think we're all breathing a sigh of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   While Noel downplayed his necessary role in Elliott's miracle,
his brother started slowly by driving twice on Mutombo but failing
to get off a shot in his first-half, five-minute stint. Elliott,
who showed signs of fatigue by bending over and grabbing his shorts
during timeouts, was more aggressive starting the third quarter. He
first launched a 3-pointer from the left wing and then left a
driving finger-roll layup on the front rim before making his
emphatic first basket of the season for a 56-53 Spurs lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That dunk wasn't just two points,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich
said. ``It was the culmination of something very, very special. It
about brought tears to my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   As the clock dwindled under two minutes, the crowd chanted, ``We
want Sean!''
</P>
<P>
   ``All this over a kidney?'' Noel joked at the media attention.
``Seriously, seeing him on the court on a scale of 1-10, it's an
11.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott tried to shrug off his remarkable return, joking that
he'll eventually be ``the first transplant patient to be booed.''
But for the estimated 12,000 kidney-transplant patients around the
country, Tuesday night he became the first man to walk on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great not just for us, but for all of basketball and even
all mankind,'' said teammate Avery Johnson, who pointed out that,
ironically, Elliott used to have the reputation as being ``soft.''
``He's beating the odds and giving hope to a lot of desperate
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott made his unlikely return in front of 40 friends and
family, including his surgeon, Dr. Francis Wright; his mother,
Odiemae; and older brother Noel, who asked only for two tickets to
little brother's first game back as payment for saving his life. As
the buzzer sounded, Elliott embraced Noel as they walked toward the
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have prolonged his career,'' said Noel, who works for a
Tucson company that builds Learjets, ``but he's making me the
world's most famous organ donor.''
</P>
<P>
   NBA Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson recently donated a kidney to
his daughter, but Elliott became the first player to participate in
a game after receiving an organ from a donor.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, 32, learned in 1993 he had a disease (focal
glomerulosclerosis) that slows kidney function and prevents them
from properly filtering waste from the blood system. With his
health deteriorating and his kidneys literally shriveling last
spring, Elliott informed only teammate Steve Kerr of his situation
so as not to interrupt the Spurs' successful run to their first NBA
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Literally hours after the team's victory parade from atop floats
down San Antonio's Riverwalk in June, doctors considered putting
Elliott on emergency dialysis. On Aug. 16, a kidney was taken from
Noel and transplanted into Sean at the Methodist Specialty and
Transplant Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to see Noel sitting over there smiling,'' Sean
Elliott said. ``The only way I can repay him is by playing the best
I can and taking advantage of my second chance. This is partly for
me, but also for Noel and other transplant patients that hopefully
can get some hope that their lives aren't over.''
</P>
<P>
   Working out on his own with no assurances of being allowed to
play again, Elliott almost gave up in December. He was having
trouble putting back on the 20 pounds he lost after surgery, and
his daily anti-rejection pills so weakened his immune system that
he was hospitalized with pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``My confidence was wrecked,'' Elliott said. ``What kept me
coming back was thinking about Noel, and my love for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's next hurdle: Using his new kidney to help regain his
old skills. nn

CARTOON NETWORK LANDS IN BURBANK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER ROSE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  BURBANK, Calif. _ Burbank will further cement its reputation
as 'toon city with the opening of a new Cartoon Network production
center by early June.
</P>
<P>
   Cartoon Network has signed a lease valued at more than $10
million for 43,000 square feet of space at 300 N. 3rd St. The
studios initially will employ about 100 people in the heart of the
city's downtown media district, and is expected to house as many as
200 by the fall as new shows go into production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burbank seems to be the capital of animation, and it's close
to everything,'' explained Brian Miller, who will be vice president
and general manager of the Time Warner-controlled unit. ``It's near
the home lot (Warner Bros.); Burbank is also home now to Disney
animation, Nickelodeon, DIC (Entertainment) and some Sony
animators. It's a very centrally located city for our artists.''
</P>
<P>
   The expansion is part of the Cartoon Network's previously
announced $450 million commitment to original animation.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner gained control of the cable network as part of its
purchase of Turner Broadcasting in 1996; Turner had formed the
foundation of the company by purchasing Universal City-based Hanna
Barbera in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Miller comes to Cartoon Network from Nickelodeon's Nicktoons
Animation Studio, another relatively new Burbank facility that
produces cartoons for the Viacom-controlled Nickelodeon channel.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the industry in general continues to enjoy a boom
that started about a decade ago, fueled by new channels and a
greater demand for original programming instead of the decades-old
reruns which were often the staple of children's animation
programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think originals do well with kids today because they're more
sophisticated, and want something fresh,'' Miller said. ``Also,
advertisers take original content more seriously, so you get better
support from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartoon Networks' two top-rated shows, ``Power Puff Girls'' and
``Johnny Bravo,'' are produced in rented offices in Sherman Oaks
since moving from the Warner Bros. lot in December. The new studios
also will produce the network's ``What a Cartoon'' shorts
showcasing the work of new animators.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the building, currently being built out for the
network, will be ``very artist friendly.'' Features will include an
art gallery displaying the work of in-house animators, and a roof
deck with awnings and picnic tables.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the building's new tenants are eagerly getting into
the decorating of the facility, with ``Power Puff Girls'' Creator
Craig McCracken even helping to pick out furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles office of real estate firm Julien J. Studley
brokered the deal; the firm said the rate was below market value.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George Bush
of Texas claimed their parties' nominations Tuesday night, marking
the official if anticlimactic end to their primary campaigns and
the beginning of what promises to be one of the longest
general-election campaigns in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   The two nominees effectively secured their nominations last week
when their only remaining serious rivals, former Sen. Bill Bradley
and Sen. John McCain, dropped out after defeats in nationwide
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night the voters in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas gave Gore enough delegates to the
Democratic convention to lock up the nomination. Bush came within a
few dozen delegates, but his campaign's reckoning of the
complicated delegate calculus, including results from so-called
beauty contest primaries, put him over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I filed for president, I pledged I'd come home to Texas
with the nomination of my party,'' Bush said in remarks prepared
for a reception Tuesday night in Austin, Texas. ``Tonight we can
say: Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are halfway _ but only halfway _ to ending the Clinton-Gore
era in Washington, D.C. To get there, we must face one more
Clinton-Gore campaign. The last week has been a preview: The Gore
campaign will say anything to try to win at any cost. We will
confront their tactics one more time, and this time, we will
prevail and they will fail. They will fail because Americans have
caught on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ticking off the states that put him over the top, Gore told a
rally at a high school here, ``We have now won enough delegates to
secure the Democratic nomination,'' adding: ``Tonight the South put
us over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has pulled even with Bush in the national polls, was
signaling that he would not concede the South or states like
Florida to the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   As they prepare for the eight months until the November
elections, the candidates are now the titular heads of their
respective parties. Gore takes over the Democrats after an
eight-year reign by Bill Clinton, and Bush the Republicans after a
turbulent era in which the party's loudest if not strongest voice
was that of the deposed speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign feels it has the more palpable advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is, as of tonight, we are the
presumed nominee, and under party rules, the party can pay for
travel and a lot of other things,'' said Tony Coelho, the Gore
campaign chairman. He added that, contrary to conventional wisdom,
Gore would not have to schedule ``official'' vice presidential
visits to make up for a lack of campaign funds, since the campaign
has about $13 million on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers also said he could now more freely raise money
for the party, and he has been taking advantage of that freedom. He
is attending three fund-raisers in the space of a week. Last
Saturday he raised about $100,000 in Houston. On Monday night, he
raised $200,000 from about 400 people attending a reception in
Belle Meade, a wealthy, generally Republican suburb of Nashville.
He has another fund-raiser scheduled for Washington on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Having the nomination in hand is also helping Gore organize his
campaign. Now that he is the nominee, he can start pulling together
the Democratic National Committee organizations in each state, one
Gore strategist said. On Monday night the vice president called
about 30 Democratic mayors to Nashville for a strategy session on
how to use their city machines as a counterweight to the state
organizations of the Republican governors supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The mayors, Gore told them, are on the front lines. ``You give
me a swap out straight up between all the Republican governors and
the Democratic mayors, and I'm with you all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has already made wide use of the 31 Republican governors
who have supported him and Ari Fleischer, Bush's spokesman, said
there were no other advantages to clinching the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates now face the challenge of sustaining the
interest of voters without turning them off.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are aggressively trying to define each other and
control the debate as they emerge from the primary process, and
they are both putting their opposition research operations into
high gear. Gore is casting Bush as a lightweight who lacks the
experience to run the country; Bush is chaining Gore to President
Clinton and raising doubts about the vice president's integrity and
his ability to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that both sides are already fully engaged, Bush
volunteers traveled to the small brick Forks River Elementary
School in Elmwood, Tenn., Tuesday morning, where Gore was voting in
the Tennessee primary, to hand out anti-Gore literature.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is already showing the same aggressiveness in the race
against Bush that he showed in the primaries toward Bradley. He
sought to take control Tuesday night, at least symbolically, by
sending an e-mail message to Bush, in which he reiterated his
challenge to eliminate all campaign commercials and debate twice a
week instead.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the earliest point in a campaign in modern times
that the parties have selected their nominees, when neither nominee
has been an incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore actually reached and surpassed the magic number of
delegates Tuesday morning before the day's votes were tallied. This
was possible because over the last week, the party's superdelegates
_ its leaders and elected officials and others who will
automatically attend the convention in August _ pledged their
allegiance to him, by phone and by mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans do not have superdelegates. Bush began the day
with 654 delegates and 341 were at stake Tuesday. That was 39 short
of the 1,034 need to claim the nomination. But under different
methods of calculation he had 227 more delegates from earlier
races.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the voting Tuesday, Bush received as much as 88 percent of
the vote, in Mississippi, to 74 percent in Florida. On the
Democratic side, Gore obtained 92 percent of the vote in Tennessee
to 69 percent in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his ability to win his party's nomination without losing
a single state, Gore, who first ran for president in 1988, remained
cautious about his achievement. ``It's still a little premature to
go, `Yahoo,''' Gore told a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a fall-off of attention in the news media, that's
fine,'' he added. ``There's a natural rhythm and cycle to news
coverage. I don't worry about that. But in terms of my effort to
communicate directly with voters, there will be no let-up at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Making it clear that Gore will not be the only candidate dealing
with education issues, the Bush campaign released literature on
Bush's education proposals, plus a fact sheet on what the Bush
campaign said were measures of how schools have failed to improve
under the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   The references to education by the campaign and in Bush's speech
Tuesday night highlight one of the governor's greatest challenges,
jettisoning some of the perceptions, left by the dynamics of his
campaign against McCain, that his persona and positions are too far
to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was clearly sending signals to voters in the center with
the circumstances of his victory speech here Tuesday night. He held
it at a Jewish community center and was introduced by Mayor Carlos
Ramirez of El Paso, a Democrat who also happens to be Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's presence underscored the degree to which Bush has
cobbled together more political support from minorities in Texas
than Republicans traditionally command and spoke to Bush's hope of
establishing the same crossover appeal nationally.

<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United
Kingdom said Tuesday that the sequence of the human genome should
be made freely available to all researchers, leading to a sharp
selloff in the stocks of biotechnology companies that hope to
profit by creating drugs based on genetic data.
</P>
<P>
   The White House quickly said that it did not intend to hurt the
fledgling biotechnology industry, but investors who have made
biotechnology stocks the darlings of the market were unconvinced.
In frantic selling, they wiped away tens of billions of dollars in
market value from the industry. Genomics companies, which are
racing to produce a database of human DNA, were hit hardest, with
some off more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The drop was not confined to the biotechnology sector. After
briefly passing 5000 in morning trading, the Nasdaq composite
index, which is heavily weighted in technology stocks, fell
steadily. The index closed at 4706.63, down 200.61 points, its
second-largest point loss ever.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, the drop is noteworthy, because biotechnology and
Internet companies have led the stock market so far this year,
while most other stocks have languished. Despite falling almost 13
percent Tuesday, the Nasdaq biotech index remains up almost 30
percent this year, thanks to investors' belief that a new wave of
drug discovery and gene therapy is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the rapid runup, the stocks are pricey by all
traditional valuations. The joint statement from Clinton and Blair,
which said that the genome data ``should be made freely available
to scientists everywhere,'' served as a spark for excitable
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Whitfield, chief executive of Incyte Pharmaceuticals, which
shed 28 percent of its market value during the day, said that
investors failed to distinguish between genome sequences and gene
sequences. The genome, referring to the total human DNA, has no
commercial value in itself and cannot be patented. The genes, which
occupy only 3 percent of the genome, can be. Researchers can work
on the sequences of patented genes in academic work and have to pay
license fees only if they wish to sell some invention based on the
sequence.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders' statement, which was eight months in the
making, is a bureaucratic outgrowth of the longstanding rivalry
between a public consortium of American and British academic
centers and Celera Corp. of Rockville, Md., to complete the
sequence of the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium, largely funded by the federal National
Institutes of Health and the Wellcome Trust of London, is posting
its findings daily on a Web site open to all. Celera promises to
make its version of the human genome freely available when it is
finished, probably this summer. Celera plans to patent some genes,
but its principal business plan is to operate a database of the
human and other genomes, charging fees for use of the programs that
search and analyze the genetic data.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was intended simply to codify the government
position in the rivalry _ that the human genome sequence should be
made publicly available to all researchers _ but appears to have
been interpreted as a challenge both to Celera's intellectual
property rights and to those of other genome and biotech companies.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said neither challenge was intended,
noting that the statement explicitly endorsed intellectual property
protection for patents based on genes.
</P>
<P>
   The statement cuts across a complicated two-way rivalry between
the public consortium and Celera, and between Celera and its two
chief rivals, Incyte Pharmaceuticals and Human Genomes Sciences.
Both the consortium and Celera aim to sequence the human genome,
which means determining the order of the 3 billion chemical units
in the DNA, the genetic information possessed by each human cell.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of Incyte and Human Genome Sciences is to focus on
the genes themselves, patenting as many as possible. The genes, the
programming instructions that operate the cell, are hidden in the
DNA, with no obvious signposts, and are hard to find even when the
genome sequence is known.
</P>
<P>
   Incyte's stock fell $53.50, to $143.50, while Human Genome's
stock fell $29.04875, to $123.51625. Meanwhile, Celera fell $39.75,
to $149.25.
</P>
<P>
   The government statement adds to the tension between the public
consortium and Celera, which last week announced they had
effectively broken off merger negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Celera and its president, J. Craig Venter, have long been at
odds with the leading scientists of the public consortium, chiefly
Dr. John Sulston of the Sanger Center in Britain and Dr. Robert
Waterston of Washington University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Before merger talks broke off, the public consortium proposed
that both sides abandon what it called ``the current antagonism and
excessive competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative for the statement issued Tuesday is believed to
have come from the Wellcome Trust. Michael Dexter, Wellcome's
director, said the trust's concern was over the general ownership
of the genome, which in his view ``is mankind's and should not be
owned by any one company, individual or country.''
</P>
<P>
   Denying that the statement was aimed at any person or company,
he said the raw sequence _ the string of chemical units making up
the genome _ was not patentable and that the trust ``would fight
any patents based on sequence if they obstruct academic work and
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Venter, however, indicated that he thought Celera was a target
of the statement, but unfairly so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are puzzled by the statement and we think it represents the
lack of insight and the confusion that has been generated out
there. Our business is not in patenting the genome or tying it
up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Venter reiterated his previous position that Celera would make
available the sequence of the human genome when it was finished,
and said the onus was on rivals Incyte and Human Genome Sciences to
make their data public. ``I agree with the president and Tony Blair
that Incyte and HGS should publish their data,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Dexter and Rachel E. Levinson, a senior official at the
White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said the joint
statement acknowledged intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson said nothing in the statement changed existing patent
law. She said she was ``very concerned and upset'' about the
reactions on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal Lane, the White House science adviser, said the
statement would not affect Celera because of Celera's known intent
to publish the human genome sequence, Levinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Haseltine, the chief executive of Human Genome
Sciences, said his company's data was being published through the
patent system. When a patent is issued, the underlying invention is
fully described.
</P>
<P>
   Haseltine said he agreed with Tuesday's statement because raw
genomic data ``has no practical use,'' an observation that he
termed ``the biggest untold secret of the human genome project.''
When researchers with the public consortium published the first DNA
sequence of a human chromosome in December last year, he said, ``No
new medical discoveries were made and no new genes were found.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he added, is that the computer programs for finding
genes are still far less efficient than the method pursued by his
company, one based on short DNA sequences called ``expressed
sequence tags,'' or ESTs.  &QL; 
than the method pursued by his company, one based on short DNA
sequences called ``expressed sequence tags'' or E.S.T.'s.
</P>
<P>
   The EST approach exploits the fact that humans may not be able
to spot the genes in the genome but human cells surely can. They
regularly make transcripts of the genes whose information is needed
to synthesize the cell's various proteins. Researchers can capture
and analyze these transcripts, known as messenger RNAs, and from
just a small portion of their sequence can identify the
corresponding part of the gene from which they come. These little
snippets of genes, the ESTs, are the basis of gene-searching
approaches used by Human Genome Sciences and Incyte.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Patent and Trademark Office has issued some patents
based on ESTs alone, any such patents seem likely to be weaker than
patents based on the full-length genes.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures released by Human Genome Sciences, Incyte
leads in the human gene patent race with 353 U.S. patents issued,
followed by Human Genome Sciences (114 patents), SmithKline Beecham
(60), the US government (49), the University of California (46) and
Massachusetts General Hospital (45).
</P>
<P>
   There is still wide disagreement on the number of genes
contained in the human genome sequence. Both Dr. Randy Scott,
president of Incyte, and Haseltine estimate that there are 140,000
genes, double the number that Venter has favored.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the biotechnology companies have yet to prove their
ability to translate their research into revenues, much less
profits. Yet these stocks have helped drive the Nasdaq composite to
an 86 percent gain last year, the best performance by a major index
ever in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   By traditional valuation standards, the Nasdaq is
extraordinarily expensive, leaving some analysts worried that it is
overdue for a sharp drop. The average Nasdaq stock trades at well
over 100 times expected 2000 earnings, and some large Internet and
computer stocks trade at unheard-of price-earnings multiples of 500
or more.
</P>
<P>
   A drop in the biotech and computer high-fliers could shake the
broader stock market, which has already been rattled by the Federal
Reserve's recent increases in short-term interest rates, analysts
said. For the year, the Dow Jones industrial average is down more
than 14 percent, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index is off 7.5
percent, while the Nasdaq is up 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Cliggott, U.S. equities analyst at J.P. Morgan, called
the market ``very fragile'' because the stocks that are driving it
higher are already so expensive. ``We see the kinds of
price-earnings multiples that the Nasdaq's trading at as being
absolutely, positively unsustainable,'' said Cliggott, who turned
cautious in January.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, broader indexes followed the Nasdaq down. After
spending most of the day up, the S&AMP;P slipped 24.47 points to
1359.15, a 1.8 percent drop. The Dow industrials fell 135.89
points, or 1.4 percent, to 9811.24.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, analysts who have dared to be bearish have been
wrong for the last five years. Byron Wien, chief U.S. investment
strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, noted that the Nasdaq is
very volatile and that investors might shrug off this decline as
simply a buying opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had bad days in the Nasdaq before, and they've snapped
right back,'' Wien said. ``What we have to see is whether the `buy
the dips' mentality is broken.''

</HEADLINE>

By GREG GITTRICH AND BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The city of Los Angeles took jurisdiction over
environmental conditions at the Belmont Learning Center six years
ago but failed to ensure adequate safety systems were installed at
the now abandoned school, the Daily News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   A little-known 1993 agreement between the city Planning
Commission and the Los Angeles Unified School District shows that
city officials _ who are now demanding a direct role in Belmont and
other school construction projects _ bear at least some
responsibility for the failure of the $175 million project.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between the city and school district made the city
``co-responsible'' for the mitigation of environmental problems at
the dangerously tainted property, as well as the installation and
monitoring of safety systems needed to protect the nation's
costliest school.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions of the 1993 agreement called for the city to get
involved before construction started.
</P>
<P>
   Work, however, was under way for nearly a year before the city
stepped up in 1998, documents show. And when it did, the city
Planning Commission accepted the LAUSD's assessment of the dangers
at the property and signed off on a proposed safety system to deal
with emissions of explosive and toxic gases rising from a former
oil field beneath the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no alarms or buzzers. Staff likely accepted what
the school district presented,'' said Bob Scott, a Woodland Hills
attorney who serves as one of five city planning commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   State toxic officials have since deemed the safety system
inadequate and have concluded that comprehensive environmental
tests were never conducted.
</P>
<P>
   The city Planning Commission approved the environmental report
for Belmont on July 9, 1998. While Scott voted in the majority, he
said, he doesn't remember details of the meeting and recently asked
the commission's staff to investigate why the school district
didn't have to submit to a rigorous environmental review for
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these matters come before us, and they appear more or
less routine,'' he explained. ``Nobody was there telling us it
doesn't look fine. We are volunteers and usually we have to take
what our staff tells us.''
</P>
<P>
   City Planning Director Con Howe recalled that the commissioners
had some concern because construction at Belmont had already
started. Nevertheless, he said, they decided to accept the school
district's environmental impact report and mitigation plans. The
approval was part of a larger conditional use permit for the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Following the commission's recommendation, the permit was
submitted to the City Council for review and approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my firm recollection that the City Council has never
acted on it,'' Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   The school board decided to abandon Belmont in January, citing
environmental and cost concerns. Five weeks later the City Council
belatedly intervened, demanding that the board reconsider its
action and give the city a role in future school construction
projects in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently unaware of the 1993 agreement with Los Angeles
Unified, as well as the city Planning Commission's action, the
council on March 3 criticized the school district's management of
the Belmont project and its decision to abandon construction.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from influential, well-paid lobbyists, the
council passed a motion calling on the school district to
re-evaluate the fate of the site and work with the city to find
alternative inner-city campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The motion, written by Councilman Mike Hernandez, included a
threat. If the city is not satisfied with the district's
cooperation, the council vowed to withhold building permits and
funding for public spaces at schools in the Belmont attendance
area, a dramatically overcrowded, low-income enclave.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez called the school district's decision to kill Belmont
a ``broken promise to the people of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez did not respond to requests for comment about the
city's ``co-responsibility'' for the environmental conditions at
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Nate Holden referred to the city Planning
Commission's oversight of the Belmont project as ``just a
formality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We rely on the credibility of them (the people who submit the
environmental report),'' Holden said. ``We don't go out and
double-check ... If they say it's OK, it's their responsibility in
the end. If they misled the city, that's their problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But Councilman Joel Wachs, a mayoral candidate, disagreed. Wachs
argued that the City Council's new interest in Belmont stemmed not
from wanting to open a safe school for kids, but from interest in
doing a favor for lobbyists connected to one of the city's largest
law firms, O'Melveny &AMP; Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, the school board filed a malpractice lawsuit
against O'Melveny &AMP; Myers over legal advice related to Belmont. The
firm, which could be liable for millions of dollars in damages if
Belmont isn't built, has hired two lobbying firms to help
resuscitate the school and potentially minimize its damages in the
malpractice case. The lobbyists contacted several council members
before the March 3 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something really fishy going on,'' said Wachs, who
was the only member of the council to vote against Hernandez's
motion. ``There are a lot of people who have a lot of interest in
getting Belmont built and it doesn't have anything to do with
education. It's not about the kids. It's about money.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   School board member Valerie Fields, a former education adviser
to the late Mayor Tom Bradley, called on the City Council to take
its share of responsibility for Belmont. Fields urged the council
to start thinking about the city's children, not lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder whether the City Council was aware of their share of
responsibility for Belmont before they recommended that we consider
reopening the school,'' Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the City Council feels so strongly about reopening Belmont,
they should take on all the responsibility and expense to mitigate
the environmental problems for the 30- to 50-year lifetime of the
school,'' she added. ``They should also take on all the liability
for every time a student or an employee at the school comes down
with an ailment.''
</P>
<P>
   LAUSD administrators, who recommended that the school board kill
Belmont, declined to comment on the district's 1993 agreement with
the city.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior official, who asked not be named, said: ``The city
and council missed a number of opportunities to be alarmed and
point out the dangers at Belmont. They didn't. They only got
involved on the advice of lobbyists. They got involved late, late
in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the school district agreed to the added layer of city
oversight as a condition of the city Planning Commission's approval
of the purchase of the largest portion of the 35-acre downtown
site.
</P>
<P>
   The city insisted on the agreement to give it a means to review
the project's environmental conditions and safety, and prevent the
district from ``bulldozing'' through the project, documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the environmental oversight, the Planning Commission
insisted upon six other conditions to give the city more of a say
in various aspects of the school construction project. Without the
conditions, the school district would only have been required to
comply with state regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions included requiring the district to complete a
traffic study and conduct public workshops during the design phase
of the project.
</P>
<P>
   State law would have permitted the district to exempt itself
from the city's conditions by a majority vote of the school board.
But the board never took any action.

$50 MILLION FOR NOT BEING AWFUL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Tuesday was a big morale-lifting day for the
local BofA folks.
<P>
   First the employees picked up their Chronicles and learned that
their beloved leader, Hugh McColl, had been awarded a $50 million
bonus, even though the company nosedived last year.
</P>
<P>
   If Hugh had been moping, that should cheer him up.
</P>
<P>
   The execs in the home office in Charlotte, N.C., would have
phoned their San Francisco cousins to give them the good news, but
it's a toll call.
</P>
<P>
   Then the local employees, still giddy with excitement, found in
each of their mailboxes a genuine BofA lapel pin!
</P>
<P>
   The feeling was that the pin more than makes up for the fact
that much of the support staff didn't get Christmas bonuses last
December for the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wear it with pride while busing your ATM,'' one staffer told
his fellow employees.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AND YET,  &LR; I sense in the general populace an undercurrent of
resentment that Hugh McColl is being obscenely rewarded for not
sucking too badly, while the bank's minions and the rest of us,
when it comes to merit raises and bonuses, seem to be judged by a
more stringent standard of performance.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh has a small PR problem. Maybe he should offer a $50 million
reward for the capture of the demon airport dogflinger.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MINI BLACKOUT  &LR; Tuesday morning on the Embarcadero, as the Ferry
Building and 16 others lost power for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   When Carol Martin reported for work at the Agricultural Building
and found power out, she phoned PG&AMP;E with an SOS.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's your address?'' the PG&AMP;E woman asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the Port of San Francisco, the Ferry Building _ you
know, where the big clock tower is, at the foot of Market Street?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have an address.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that Martin was connected to a Sacramento office.
</P>
<P>
   Memo to PG&AMP;E: If you do dispatch a crew to restore the power,
tell 'em San Francisco is the city right at the other end of the
big silver bridge, with the tall, pointy buildings, cute houses and
funny hills.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT WOULD  &LR; Jesus drive? That question arose in a theological
discussion here. I guessed Triumph Spitfire, but others say no.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold S. Vorster, a Methodist pastor in Mill Valley, says he
has it on good authority that Jesus would drive an Austin Healy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toyota Corona, of course,'' says William Greene. ``Or maybe an
Infiniti Epiphany.''
</P>
<P>
   The Old Pizza Dude says it would be a Plymouth, Jesus' family
car. ``The Bible says God drove Adam and Eve out of the Garden of
Eden in a Fury.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a Plymouth. But more likely a Christler.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``STOP MAKING  &LR; fun of student errors,'' scolds Bill Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   Bill sat through 30 years of faculty meetings at California
junior colleges, mostly Santa Rosa and Merced, and jotted down
random statements of faculty and administration, including:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the statistics on the breakdown of our freshman
class.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time I normally speak to you ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Louise has some idea of how much down it could go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here to launch a bandwagon or a panacea.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to get these figures in the budget so we can start
cutting them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, folks, what we're basically doing is working
with people, and I'm a living example of that, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope the word  &UR; immediate  &LR; has some flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a full-time person sitting in that chair because
that's only the tip of the iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking as an average person, and I'd sometimes put myself in
that bag ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``It took off like Cape Canaveral.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I failed to mention this because it is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Bill, ``Imagine what I might have heard had I stayed
awake.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEY,  &LR; Professor Bill: To launch a panacea, do you use a bottle
of champagne or Pepto-Bismol?

   PSKOV, Russia _ Roman Sokolov led a group of Russian snipers in
Chechnya, and looked the part. He was solidly built, with regular
features, close-cropped soldier's hair and threatening V-shaped
brows set over eyes fixed in the flat, detached gaze of a career
warrior.
</P>
<P>
   His face, with its unlined and slightly menacing visage, could
easily be a poster in Russia's determined campaign to win Chechnya
at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday the image was in a frame that lay atop Captain
Sokolov's zinc coffin in Pskov's soaring Trinity Cathedral. It was
a coffin that, like the seven beside it, was covered in carnations
and tulips and lilies, bedecked in Russian Orthodox icons and wept
over by thousands of mourners.
</P>
<P>
   The eight men were among 84 members of a single Pskov-based
regiment who died in Chechnya early this month, trapped on a
hilltop by thousands of Islamic guerrillas who cut off
reinforcements and, in a gruesome all-night battle, virtually wiped
out a seasoned group of paratroopers. It was one of Russia's worst
defeats in its Chechen campaign, and it has left Pskov, a city of
200,000 on Russia's European border, in shock and bereavement.
</P>
<P>
   In other places, it might be the spark that ignited resentment
against a war that many outsiders see as needlessly brutal and,
ultimately, doomed. What Pskov's mourning Tuesday suggested,
instead, was that Russians, still adrift in their search for a
national identity, have seized on this war as a unifying force, and
wrapped themselves in its grief as in a comforting blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Few if any mourners talked Tuesday about the brutality of
Sokolov's war or the realization, dawning ever so slowly here, that
victory in Chechnya will not be quick or clean or cheap. Rather,
they talked about his heroism in the final hours of a lost cause,
and about his love of military life, and about the 3-year-old
daughter who is still asking her mother to bring daddy home.
</P>
<P>
   And when the service was over, they loaded his coffin on a
military flatbed, mounted his photograph on the back for
identification, and took him to a deserted cemetery for a burial
that was heartbreaking in its wintry sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are heroes,'' Yekaterina Zelinskaya, one of throngs
of women who jammed the cathedral, whispered above the sniffles of
the bereaved. ``They died in battle to defend us, to protect us
against new explosions like the ones last fall. We always knew we
could rely on them. If it is to be necessary, we will fight
terrorism ourselves to save our children.''
</P>
<P>
   The mysterious bombings of apartment blocks last fall, which
killed 300 and were attributed to Chechens but are still unproved,
sealed the Islamic revolt in Russians' minds as a threat to their
nation's existence.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have since admitted to perhaps 1,500 combat
deaths in the conflict. Some outside experts contend that the true
number may be two or three times that. The military has been loath
to admit its losses, and refused to confirm the extent of the
disaster that befell the Pskov company until nearly a week after
local journalists had reported it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go to the political officer of my division, and he
concealed the truth from me, even though everyone knew there was a
fierce battle,'' Sokolov's 24-year-old widow, Olga Sokolova, said
in an interview Tuesday. ``People in town knew more than we did in
the division.''
</P>
<P>
   But she and other Russians, almost genetically suspicious of
most government pronouncements, have largely accepted explanations
that the lag in reporting deaths stems from double-checking of
casualty lists.
</P>
<P>
   By design or otherwise, most of Pskov's dead remained Tuesday in
a military mortuary in Rostov, in southwestern Russia, where their
identifications and causes of death were being officially recorded.
Most will be shipped to other hometowns; Pskov, very much a
military city, was a stationing point for service men and women
from around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The eight who came home Tuesday were local boys, and were
mourned as such. Thousands lined the street outside Pskov's massive
1,100-year-old kremlin, in which the centuries-old cathedral
stands. More jammed the kremlin's cobblestone yard and strained
against police lines for a view.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the frigid cathedral, opposite a wall of ancient icons
perhaps 100 feet high, priests and a choir chanted an hourlong
dirge, their frosty breath merging with smoky puffs of incense;
their mantra the names of the dead: Mark, Aleksandr, Vladimir,
Roman, Sergei, Aleksei, Mikhail, Mikhail.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the service marked the start of a long procession to
the waiting military flatbeds, along a cobbled path strewn with red
carnations and lined by soldiers in camouflage, fur hats at their
waists.
</P>
<P>
   It was a heroes' welcome; an outpouring of reverence and grief
that made the familiar arrival of American military coffins at
Wilmington, Del., seem spartan by comparison.

PSKOV, Russia: by comparison.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever one may think of the conduct of the Chechen war, it was
hard to fault Tuesday's proceedings. By any definition, these men
were military heroes, Sokolov first among them.
</P>
<P>
   It was a small 2,500-foot-high ridge near the southern Chechnya
village of Urus-Kert that Company Six of Pskov's Regiment 104 took
Feb. 29, on orders to stop some 2,000 Chechen guerrillas from
escaping into neighboring Dagestan. By that afternoon they were
trapped in a fierce battle, with the nearest reinforcements more
than 5 miles away. Command of the force fell to Capt. Sokolov, who
had wanted to go to Chechnya last fall, during the bombings.
Instead, he shipped out from Pskov barely a month ago, just before
his 28th birthday on Feb. 16.
</P>
<P>
   At Urus-Kert, Sokolov organized the final defense of the
hilltop, aided by a few soldiers from a platoon that had broken
through rebel lines. At 11:30 p.m. that day, hundreds of guerrillas
began a nightlong attack against the defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolov, by then wounded in the hand, rounded up six of his
company's newest members as the guerrillas drew close. He told them
to attempt a retreat, then radioed Russian forces and ordered
strikes on his own position in a last attempt to repel the
attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen Russians died that night, including Sokolov. The rest
were killed as the battle raged on. The six men Sokolov ordered to
flee were the only survivors.
</P>
<P>
   In a private ceremony on Monday, two able-bodied survivors came
to the yellow stucco gymnasium of the 104th Regiment, where the
caskets lay in state. There they kneeled before Sokolov's bier and
thanked him for his sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the funeral, a truck bearing his body arrived at a
small church in a run-down section of town, trailed by a bus
carrying family and friends. An honor guard unloaded the coffin. To
the beat of a snare drum and a trumpet, the soldiers carried
Sokolov past a broken iron gate and down a path of rutted frozen
mud strewn with spruce boughs.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four soldiers followed the coffin, and perhaps 75
mourners. Sokolov's mother buried her face in her husband's
shoulder, sobbing as she walked. Mrs. Sokolova, her head shrouded
in black lace, was silent.
</P>
<P>
   As they reached the newly dug grave, the soldiers lifted the
rust-colored cover from the coffin, revealing the Russian tricolor
and a small window above Sokolov's face. His father, Vladimir
Timofeyevich, fell upon it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgive me for remaining alive,'' he cried, before being
lifted from the coffin and into a relative's arms.
</P>
<P>
   A camouflage-clad officer spoke over the coffin. ``They did
everything for Russia to survive,'' he said. ``We will do
everything so that the cause you struggled for will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Why Sokolov and the others had to die, beyond the help of the
Russian army's vastly superior firepower, is a mystery. ``From a
professional standpoint, I can say that something wasn't followed
well,'' said a colleague, Aleksandr Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who met survivors at the 104th
Regiment offices Tuesday afternoon, offered a remarkable admission
of responsibility for the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear comrades, I address you as a person to whom you entrusted
the fates and lives of the people dearest to you,'' he told the
hundreds of mourners. ``I want to apologize before you that we
failed to save them in this, so grave an hour for Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for raising such wonderful sons and true patriots,''
he added. ``May soil be as soft as down.''

SASAKI IMMIGRATES TO M'S WITH HIGH MARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ Not to put too much pressure on the new guy, but
Kazu Sasaki needs to virtually shut out the entire Valley of the
Sun for about 200 innings today in order to get the Mariners'
spring training ERA under a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But as a one-inning relief pitcher, and maybe the Mariners'
biggest off-season acquisition, such a deployment would be a bigger
squandering than the Tino Martinez trade.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, spring ERAs are like misdeeds of the Catholic church _
prone to handy revision. The Mariners can always put off such
gas-pump numbers on the season's infancy, or Arizona's light air,
or the other team's readiness, or any of the traditional excuses to
hide an absence of talent.
</P>
<P>
   Other than an adjustment time for American hitters, there should
be no excuses needed for Sasaki.
</P>
<P>
   He has pitched only two spring innings, giving up a run on three
hits with three strikeouts. But a fellow who has watched him
throughout his 10-year career in Japan is persuaded that Sasaki has
what it takes to heal the ulcer of the Seattle bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very happy not to face him,'' said Kiyoshi Nakahata, a
former all-star first baseman for the Tokyo Giants and one of the
most popular figures in Japan's baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Nakahata retired about 10 years ago, just as Sasaki's pro career
began, and has been a baseball broadcaster for Japan's NTB Channel
4. The two met Tuesday for a long TV interview, sitting in the
outfield grass of a practice field.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Nakahata explained through an interpreter what was
special about Sasaki's premier pitch, a forkball, or split-finger
fastball, the likes of which he suspects major league hitters have
not seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What might not be known here is that he has three different
kinds of splitter,'' he said. ``One starts as a strike but drops so
low so quickly that it's a ball, and unhittable. A second splitter
starts lower and doesn't drop away so fast, so it's a strike at the
knees if the batter doesn't swing. A third one is actually
off-speed with some movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakahata knows Sasaki's Aug. 9 elbow surgery has slowed him a
bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``His curveball has improved, but his fastball is not there
yet,'' he said. ``When he's ready, it will (be) a 150-kph
fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunnert-fifty? Oh, wait _ the conversion. That's about 93-95 mph
in U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Nakahata said while Japanese hitters were thrilled to bid him
sayonara _ his ERAs the last three seasons were 0.90, 0.64 and 1.93
_ many fans did not share the excitement, much in the manner of
Seattle's reaction to the loss of Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best stopper and highest-paid pitcher in Japan,''
he said. ``They were very disappointed that they wouldn't see him
pitch anymore. But most understood the dream and the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the challenge has not been overwhelming, to hear Sasaki
tell it. Imposing physically at 6-foot-4 and 210 pounds, he
nevertheless is an amiable sort with an easy smile and a
worldliness when it comes to the media. At 32 with four previous
U.S. visits, including a 1988 stay in Seattle while pitching for a
touring college all-star team, he professes little trauma in
adjusting to American baseball or life.
</P>
<P>
   He already has an apartment in Seattle and loves cruising
Costco, so he's about one double-tall/low-fat/no-foam from having
moss appear on his north side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the food, and everyone has been nice _ no practical
jokes,'' he said through his interpreter, Alan Turner. ``Baseball
is the same language anywhere _ throw strikes, Lou says.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki thus has received the sum total of pitching help to be
supplied by the Mariners manager. But Sasaki is a self-starter who
has dictated his own regimen.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Bryan Price has been working to correct a flaw in
his delivery that causes his left side to fly open upon release.
Sasaki has been sufficiently impressed with the greater power of
American hitters that he won't indulge himself mistakes that were
survivable in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to change anything,'' he said, ``but I have to
be careful about high pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   After interest from both New York teams and Arizona, the free
agent signed Dec. 18 with the Mariners for about $8 million over
two years. The official plan is to have the right-hander set up in
the eighth inning for closer Jose Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   But the fear is that there is not enough stomach lining in the
Northwest to endure another season of closes from Mesa, despite his
club record-tying 33 saves. Mesa last year was second in the
American League in most baserunners allowed per nine innings of
relief (16) and third-highest in batting average allowed (.305).
</P>
<P>
   He's been barely OK this spring, facing 13 batters and giving up
two hits and three walks. With Sasaki and Arthur Rhodes available
this season, Piniella is no longer forced to endure another night
like the opener at the new ballpark, when Mesa walked four of the
five batters he faced, forcing in the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is no issue for Sasaki, who has spent 10 years in the
ninth-inning crucible. He's even had the pleasure of facing
America's best, during the annual November exhibition tours of
Japan by U.S. stars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he recalled meeting up with Griffey. Whiffed him, in
fact, blowing by him a fastball up and in.
</P>
<P>
   Said Sasaki: ``He argued the call with the umpire.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, Kazu. Wasn't his first complaint.

JAVIER FINDS FIT WITH MARINERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ Stan Javier is near the end of his career.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't run quite as well as he used to.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries take longer to heal.
</P>
<P>
   His bat speed has lost a tick.
</P>
<P>
   And he's no longer an everyday player.
</P>
<P>
   So why are the Mariners so happy to have signed Javier this
winter?
</P>
<P>
   Javier is built for Safeco Field. Consequently, he's built for
the 2000 Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up around winners. He owns a World Series ring. He plays
the little game inside the big game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you want me to do, I can do,'' Javier says quietly
without the swagger of a braggart. ``I can bunt, get on base,
hit-and-run, steal a base, play defense. That's the kind of game I
play.''
</P>
<P>
   But because he doesn't hit .300 every year or guarantee 30
homers and 90 RBIs, his skills aren't suited for a club still
trying to find itself. Put him in Minnesota, say, or Florida, and .
. . well, you just wouldn't find him playing for teams bereft of an
opportunity to win. Not at this stage of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help a team like that,'' Javier said. ``The kinds of
things they need, I can't do. I won't hit 40 homers or hit .340.
But if I'm on a team that's got a chance to win, I can help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to do the little things _ bunting, running, playing
defense _ that fans may not always notice. But my teammates and the
opponents will notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle manager Lou Piniella and Javier go back to 1984, when
Javier was just a kid trying to make it with the Yankees. But he
was a kid with a pedigree _ his father, Julian, played second base
for the St. Louis Cardinals in the Bob Gibson-fueled glory days in
the '60s _ and he was a kid with skills.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella, then nearing the end of the line as an outfielder,
took one look at Javier that spring and told him that all he had to
do was hit .250-.270, and with his defensive skills, Javier could
play in the major leagues for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   This season will be Javier's 14th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never believed that when Lou said that,'' Javier said. ``I
never thought I'd play this long. But I've avoided big injuries,
and I've tried to keep my game at the same level.''
</P>
<P>
   Through all that, his family has kept him humble. His wife is a
doctor. Two brothers are doctors, as is one sister-in-law. Their
lives are not wound up in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm at home, they're always talking about medicine and I
don't have anything to say,'' Javier said, breaking into a shy
smile. ``No one wants to talk about baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is spring training, and it's time to talk about
baseball again. One more time. The end is near for Javier as a
player. The end would already be here if a team like the Mariners
hadn't come calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that keeps me going is having the chance to win,''
Javier said. ``There's no better feeling than that. Preparing to
win, that's fun. If my only chance to play was to play for a team
that had no chance, I'd just stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than staying home, he spent the past four years with San
Francisco, generally a competitive team in the NL West. Back in
1989, Javier helped Oakland win the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Jose Canseco went down for the first half of the
season with a wrist injury. Javier stepped in. When Canseco
returned, the A's had a five-game lead in the AL West, thanks in no
small part to Javier's ability as a fill-in, an ability the
Mariners want to tap in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella said Javier, who stepped in and played for six weeks
when Barry Bonds of the Giants was injured last year, still has
what Piniella saw all those years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any winning team needs a player like Stanley,'' Piniella said.
``You need someone who can do all the little things and still step
up and fill in when necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Alex Rodriguez, a longtime friend of Javier's, takes
it a step further.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no value to a bad team. But he has unbelievable value
to a team like ours,'' Rodriguez said of the man he considers a
mentor. ``Getting Stan here was a great move by our front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't anything he can't do in the outfield, playing
first base, hitting or running the bases. He's willing to do
whatever it takes for his team to win, and without guys like that,
you won't win.''

PATAKI PROPOSES BROAD PACKAGE OF GUN CONTROLS
</HEADLINE>
 (SUBS to insert new 3rd-to-last graf.)   
(Eds: This story is an added starter to the front page.)

 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Swimming against the tide of his own party, Gov.
George Pataki on Tuesday proposed a sweeping package of gun
controls, including mandatory trigger locks with gun sales, a ban
on assault weapons and steps to make it easier for the police to
trace guns used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates say the measures, if enacted, would give
New York among the strictest gun controls in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, if you think it's the right thing, you have to
pursue it,'' Pataki told ABC News in an interview Tuesday night.
``I'm hopeful we can get this through the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the measures would require so-called ballistics
fingerprinting, which would record the unique markings from all new
guns so that bullets and shell casings could later be traced to
them.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, the governor called for raising the legal age
for gun purchases to 21 from 18, and said he would seek to close a
loophole in the system of background checks for gun buyers by
requiring that those checks be done on buyers at gun shows and flea
markets, not just on those who buy in stores. Aides to Pataki said
he would unveil details of his proposals at a news conference
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals are expected to pass in the Democratic-controlled
Assembly, though their fate in the Republican-dominated Senate is
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the proposals put Pataki, who harbors ambitions of
national office, at odds with the Republican leaders in Congress
and many of his fellow Republican governors. In fact, they put him
squarely in the camp of Democrats, including President Clinton, who
have been calling for many of the same measures for years. It is a
familiar position for Pataki, who favors abortion rights and gay
rights, and who recently signed into law an ambitious health care
program for the poor and a major increase in the state's cigarette
tax.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has called on Congress to require
background checks at gun shows and has proposed mandating
ballistics fingerprinting, and specific legislation is being
written by Democratic lawmakers, said Kristen Rand, the senior
counsel for the Violence Policy Center, a gun control group. The
gun control measure in the congressional conference committee
contains a trigger-lock provision, but gun control advocates say it
is too weak to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Morton, the spokesman for Handgun Control, said Pataki's
proposals go beyond what most other states are considering and are
important given that Pataki is a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from a Republican governor this is revolutionary,''
Morton said. ``This is an incredible, forward-looking step in law
enforcement and crime control. It shows that this is not a partisan
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's proposals are the first significant gun control
legislation he has called for in his five years in office. Various
elements of his plan have passed the Democratic-controlled Assembly
at one time or another. ``I welcome him aboard,'' the speaker of
the Assembly, Sheldon Silver, said Tuesday night. ``We've been
doing these things for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate, where Republicans hold the majority, has
resisted gun control measures in the past, but in this election
year, the majority leader, Joseph Bruno, has expressed a
willingness to consider some measures, though he has not given any
specifics. John McArdle, a spokesman for Bruno, would not comment
on the governor's plans.
</P>
<P>
   The most innovative part of the governor's plan would require
that any new gun sold in New York be fired first, to record its
ballistic fingerprint, the pattern of nicks and scratches left on a
bullet that is unique to each weapon. Such markings are often used
by the police and prosecutors to trace a crime to a particular gun,
but first the gun must be found. Under Pataki's plan, the
ballistics patterns of all new guns would go into a database that
could be used for comparison with bullets used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a crime scene, people don't leave the gun very often,'' the
governor told ABC. ``But they do leave bullets or shell casings.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association has been opposed to the taking of
ballistics samples for the government, contending that it would be
a preliminary step toward national gun registration.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Michon, the vice president of the New York State Rifle
and Pistol association, the state affiliate of the NRA, said his
organization would likely oppose the legislation
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need any more legislation, they just need to
enforce the ones that are on the books,'' he said. ``They are
throwing up a smokescreen for their own inadequacies at enforcing
the laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Michon said the trigger lock legislation was inferior to a
measure Pataki vetoed last year that would have taught an NRA gun
education program in state schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trigger locks are unnecessary because it's proven they won't
work,'' Michon said. ``The state association has pushed to educate
kids that you should not touch a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun control has become one of the most contentious issues in
Washington, and it promises to become a big part of the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans have generally resisted gun control
measures, though some measures, like requiring trigger locks with
gun sales, enjoy broad support.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in the wake of the Columbine High School shooting in
Colorado, each house of Congress passed its own measure that would,
among other things, close the gun show loophole. But negotiators
have made no progress toward reconciling the differences between
the two bills, and some Republican leaders have made it clear that
they think both versions go too far, saying that what is needed is
better enforcement of existing laws. Clinton has accused
congressional Republicans of intentionally stalling.
</P>
<P>
   Each highly publicized school shooting like Columbine leads to a
new round of legislative proposals for gun control, and new heights
of popularity for those proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Calls for requiring that trigger locks be included in all gun
sales have grown in the two weeks since a 6-year-old boy in
Michigan fatally shot a classmate with a pistol he found in his
home. Such a lock physically blocks the movement of the trigger,
making the gun impossible to fire without the key to the lock.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals to ban or restrict assault rifles gained momentum
after such a weapon was used in a schoolyard shooting in Stockton,
Calif., in 1989 that left five children dead.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office would not release details of the assault
weapons ban Tuesday night. There is a federal ban on assault
weapons, but it has so many loopholes that some states have passed
bans of their own to close them. A ban enacted in California last
year, for example, spells out the physical characterstics of banned
weapons, such as fixed magazines that carry more than 10 rounds and
features that allow rapid firing.
</P>
<P>
   Rand, of the Violence Policy Center, said that while the
measures proposed by Pataki were important to improve law
enforcement and gun safety, they might not do much to dent gun
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to decrease gun violence, you have to
regulate the gun industry in a more comprehensive way,'' Rand said.
``And that is difficult at the state level.''

ORTIZ NOT AFRAID OF BICEPS INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Pitcher Ramon Ortiz, who felt stiffness in his
right biceps while warming up Monday, returned to Los Angeles on
Tuesday to be examined by Dr. Lewis Yocum. Ortiz initially was
diagnosed with tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   Before the examination, Ortiz, who has a 1.80 earned-run average
in two games this spring, said he wasn't concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the first time it's happened, that's why I know
it's nothing,'' he said. ``It happened to me before spring training
last year. They gave me some (medication). With that and massage, I
could pitch in three days.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim Angels manager Mike Scioscia and pitching coach Bud
Black, however, will not send Ortiz out so soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bud's a little cautious, he wants Ramon to get in a good
bullpen before he goes out there again,'' Scioscia said.

<P>
   Cooper improves: Brian Cooper, from USC, took a big step toward
winning a spot in the starting rotation with his performance
Tuesday against the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper gave up two runs (one earned) and five hits in four
innings of the Angels' 7-2 victory. Garret Anderson had the big
blow offensively, hitting a three-run homer, his second of the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   For Cooper, the outing was critical after giving up six runs in
two innings against the Brewers in his first start last Thursday.
Cooper needed to bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I would have been snow-bound if I had another tough
one here,'' Cooper said, referring to the weather in Edmonton, the
Angels' Triple-A affiliate. ``I haven't really been getting people
out or shown them how I can pitch. Even throwing bullpens
(workouts), I've been erratic the whole time we've been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said he needs to be consistent with his fastball, change
speeds and trust his stuff.
</P>
<P>
   He took a step in the right direction Tuesday, but it took a
while for him to get comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning I was trying to show them everything I've got
on the first day, and I overthrew,'' he said. ``Then it got to a
point where I was trying to fix everything and I lost my rhythm.
But after my last time out, I got off the mound for three days in a
row, and it helped me get back the fluidity of my windup and my arm
angle felt much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's emergence is important for the club considering the
injuries to Ortiz and Jarrod Washburn and the inconsistency of
Jason Dickson and Kent Mercker. But Scioscia said it's still too
early to win or lose a spot in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell a guy not to worry about results, but I knew Coop
needed it for his confidence,'' Scioscia said. ``He had much better
command and he's going to get better as he keeps pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Baughman hot: In a split-squad game in Scottsdale, the Angels
got three hits from Justin Baughman, including a home run, to beat
the Giants, 8-6. The Angels now are 7-6 in the Cactus League.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Ken Hill was roughed up for four runs and seven
hits in three innings. Among the seven hits was a home run by Barry
Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad feels fine: Darin Erstad played his first spring game in
the outfield Tuesday and showed his left shoulder is fine. He made
a couple of throws from the warning track and hit the cutoff man
both times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just trying to get his outfield legs right now,''
Scioscia said. ``It's going to take a little work for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The minors The Angels sent seven players to minor-league camp.
Pitchers Elvin Nina, Scot Shields and Matt Wise, catcher Jason
Dewey and outfielder Elpidio Guzman were optioned, and pitcher
Steve Green and catcher Shawn Wooten were reassigned.

LAKERS' HORRY LIKES RESERVE ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   DENVER _ Robert Horry is playing like a starter. He's got the
minutes and often the stats to prove it. But he's told coach Phil
Jackson he wants to keep coming off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer it,'' said Horry, who plays behind A.C. Green but
these days plays more minutes and all fourth quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy it, warming up really hard and then getting that
little pause to get ready for the game,'' he said. ``I think A.C.,
his style of play is so different from mine, to watch him defend
the other guy, really lets me know how to defend the guy I have to
go out there and play. Plus, A.C. needs to be warmed up and come
straight on out. So I think I'm in a better situation to come off
the bench right now than he is....
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus you know how you get into a little groove, you don't want
to break the groove.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry's role has grown almost as quickly as the Los Angeles
Lakers' 19-game winning streak. And it's no coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's two players that have stepped up (during the
streak),'' Jackson said. ``Shaq (O'Neal)'s had some great games,
but two players that have stepped up and played at a level that's a
little better has been Robert and Kobe (Bryant).''
</P>
<P>
   Horry has scored in double figures just eight times this season,
but five of those have come in the last 11 games. He has raised his
shooting percentage to 44.8 percent, his 3-point shot is a threat
again and his defense against opposing power forwards has been at
times spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is consistently giving Horry starter's minutes, while
Green's playing time has plummeted to 18 minutes a game over the
past seven games. But Jackson has no plans to alter the starting
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good teams have starters coming off the bench or players that
are equal to their starters,'' he said. ``That makes teams very
good and changes up what they do on the floor, gives them a little
more tenacity or speed or outside shooting or whatever, a lot of
things which Robert does do for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes two: Glen Rice now has ridden the bench for all but
three minutes of the last two fourth quarters combined, as Jackson
has gone to defensive-minded Rick Fox. Though Rice was upset by a
similar strategy in late January, he says he's fine with it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I was telling Rick before the game (Monday in Denver),
we're the two small forwards on this team, so we've got to go out
there and we've really got to do our part,'' he said. ``That's what
we're going to try to do from here on out.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was comfortable with the offense-defense switches
from Rice to Fox, Rice said, ``Yeah, it's comfortable, but don't
forget - I can play defense, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Breather: The Lakers will go for their 20th straight win, which
would tie the second-longest winning streak in NBA history, on
Thursday at Washington. They remained in Denver for light practices
Tuesday and today.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal is receiving therapy for his strained right hamstring and
is expected to be fine for the game.

A GALAXY OF QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ There are more questions than answers about
the Los Angeles Galaxy entering a new season, but the team's
history has taught the players to persevere.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy's loss to D.C. United in the MLS championship game
last November was the team's second defeat in the final in four
years. Although the players are trying to remain optimistic as they
prepare to open the Major League Soccer season Saturday against
Colorado at the Rose Bowl, the Galaxy isn't exactly riding a wave
of favorable preseason reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preseason didn't deliver the results we expected,''
defender Paul Caligiuri said of the Galaxy's 2-3-1 exhibition
record, which included games against other MLS teams in Florida as
well as stops in Mexico and Argentina. ``I think the individual
efforts were there, but we could have done better in game
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems could be attributed in part to the fact Robin
Fraser, Cobi Jones and Greg Vanney spent more time with the U.S.
National team than the Galaxy. In addition, defender Ezra
Hendrickson was lost to St. Vincent &AMP; The Grenadines for World Cup
qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Galaxy's schedule includes four matches each with
powerhouses United, Colorado and Dallas. For the first time, the
MLS went with a weighted schedule, similar to that of the NFL -
meaning the best teams will play each other more often.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy's task is even tougher because other MLS teams have
bolstered their foreign lineups while the Galaxy's requests to the
league for foreign help have been ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy is lacking a foreign replacement for Carlos
Hermosillo, who decided to finish his career in Mexico. Meanwhile,
Iran's Khodadad Azizi was assigned to San Jose, German defender
Lothar Mattheus was assigned to New York/New Jersey, Henry Zambrano
was traded to Colorado and Kansas City picked up Miklos Molnar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sort of a victim of our own success,'' said coach Sigi
Schmid, explaining why the MLS has not assigned the team a marquee
foreigner to replace Hermosillo. ``If we had done bad, they would
have given us an allocation. That's just the way it is. We just
have to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid remains optimistic. Last week, during an exhibition in
Argentina, he saw signs of the Galaxy coming together as a team for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they were getting after it a little more,'' Schmid said.
``Part of that is because we are getting close to the start of the
season, and part of that is guys realize that we can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he didn't have some of his starters, Schmid said the
preseason gave him an advantage he didn't have last year, when he
replaced Octavio Zambrano five games into the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big benefits of preseason was that we had a chance
to see everybody play in competition,'' Schmid said. ``We were able
to mix and match different lineups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a much better feel of what everybody needs to do and a
much better feel fitness-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   Caligiuri said the team is more match fit than it's ever been,
but that there are plenty of kinks to work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Sigi tended to focus a little more on fitness,'' said
Caligiuri. ``And because we were trying to lay a strong foundation,
there wasn't always the best results in (preseason) games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until our last game (in Argentina), I felt we hadn't played
well together as a team at all.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the camp's biggest surprises was first-round draft pick
Sasha Victorine, a midfield/striker from UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Victorine, who stands 6-foot-2, gives the Galaxy a threat in the
air with his presence on crosses. He's the closest the Galaxy has
to a replacement for Hermosillo and he's worked well with midfield
playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we would like a striker to replace Carlos, but
Sasha has really stepped up,'' said Schmid. ``Sasha gives us more
of a target. He's a little stronger than anyone else we have up
front.''
</P>
<P>
   The backline that led the MLS in fewest goals allowed (29)
remains intact. Fraser, Caligiuri, Vanney and Hendrickson give the
Galaxy experience. Rookie Danny Califf as well as experienced
defenders Joe Franchino and Steve Jolley give L.A. depth.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos, who amazes Schmid with his fitness and work ethic,
joins Roy Myers, Danny Pena and Clint Mathis in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, Jones will likely join Victorine.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman, who has perhaps
more reason than anyone else to get this season started. More than
any player, he has bad memories of November's loss to United.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman botched a routine clearing pass that led to an easy
United goal. The mistake left a bitterness Hartman has tried to rid
himself of ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the healing begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me (this season) is personal,'' said Hartman, who recently
signed a new four-year contract. ``It's made me a lot more hungry.
For other people it maybe puts them into a daze before there is a
wake-up call, but I can't wait to get the season started.''

NEW KINGS TO HAVE THRASHERS REUNION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Ed Ward dropped off new Kings Kelly
Buchberger and Nelson Emerson at the Atlanta airport Tuesday
morning for their flight to Los Angeles, they wondered when they
might see each other again.
</P>
<P>
   How about tonight.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ward returned to his home, he had been traded from
Atlanta to the Mighty Ducks, who are hosting the Los Angeles Kings
at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he might want to stick around the airport,''
Emerson said, after arriving at the Kings practice facility in El
Segundo. ``There has been a lot of talk about who was going to be
traded. Now it has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, 23 players were swapped in 12 trades before Tuesday's
deadline. The biggest name was Vancouver's high-scoring forward
Alexander Mogilny, who had a goal in Monday's night's 3-2 overtime
loss to the Kings at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilny is headed to the Eastern Conference-leading New Jersey
Devils, who many think have just secured their place in the Stanley
Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings acquisitions aren't quite that dramatic. Emerson,
32,is joining his seventh franchise and missed nine games earlier
this season with a concussion. Buchberger, 33, will play on the
fourth line. But Emerson, the Kings new second-line right winger,
has five 20-goal seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than playing out the schedule for the expansion Atlanta
Thrashers, Emerson and Buchberger, a member of three Stanley Cups
champions in Edmonton, have been dropped in the middle of the tense
Western Conference playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   By beating Vancouver, the Kings (34-27-8) jumped ahead of
Phoenix for the fifth spot in the West. That could mean an
unenviable matchup with Detroit rather than a showdown with
Colorado, one of the league's hottest teams.
</P>
<P>
   But by making the deal that sent disgruntled Donald Audette and
promising rookie defenseman Frantisek Kaberle to Atlanta, the Kings
showed they aren't happy just to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are missing pieces, no question,'' Kings captain Rob
Blake said after Monday's trade. ``This is a team that has a chance
to do some things in the playoffs. They bring great character and
leadership to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward's post-season plans seem less certain since the Ducks are
five points behind San Jose for the eighth and final spot.
</P>
<P>
   He was acquired for a conditional pick in the 2001 draft and
will play tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Kings are 10 points ahead of the Ducks in the
Pacific Division, they have not dominated their Southern California
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The teams tied 1-1 on Dec. 3 at the Pond and the Ducks won 5-3
on Feb. 8 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Buchberger, Emerson and Ward have had their numbers
blurred by playing on such a bad team.
</P>
<P>
   Buchberger and Emerson seemed a little embarrassed that the
Kings acquired two players that totaled a minus-58 on the ice this
season.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Buchberger's Stanley Cup background that makes him so
appealing. He was part of championship clubs in 1987,1988 and 1990
with Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Although those Oilers teams had superior talent, like Wayne
Gretzky and Mark Messier, Buchberger said the biggest lesson he
took from the experience was the concept of teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some of the all-time greats, but no one was bigger than
the team,'' Buchberger said. ``Those guys didn't care who scored
the goals, just as long as they won. That is not always easy.''
</P>
<P>
   About his role as a leader, Buchberger said, ``For right now,
the most important thing is to blend in. You get to know the guys
and they get to know you. They see that you work hard and want to
win badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitting in shouldn't be difficult. Emerson and Blake are old
friends from their college days Bowling Green. Both took quite a
bit of ribbing from Kings players after Emerson arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchberger's strongest connection for the Kings will be the
way he handles the other team's top forwards. Tonight's assignment:
Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so quick and fast, but you can take away their room
to operate on the ice. ``he said. ``That's what it's like in the
playoffs.''
</P>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Staples Center, which has become to Los Angeles
Clippers games as an off-duty church is to AA meetings, was the
site of a rare sobering experience for the visiting team.
</P>
<P>
   Riding the distilled joy of a one-game winning streak, the home
team received another cold-blooded fourth-quarter performance from
rookie Lamar Odom to post a 110-104 victory Tuesday over the Denver
Nuggets before 10,706.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing a lot better job of executing at the end of the
game,`` said Odom, whose team usually calls for the cigarettes and
blindfolds in the last 12 minutes. ``We were down, but I felt that
it was still anyone's game.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, anyone named Odom.
</P>
<P>
   With the Clips down, 99-90, he bagged a 3-point basket, then
followed with a runner in the lane to trim Denver's lead to 99-95.
After Derek Anderson (20) produced a three-point play that gave the
Clippers a 102-101 edge with 3:13 to play, Odom broke a 103 tie -
and the Nuggets' backs -- with a 3-pointer at 2:04.
</P>
<P>
   Denver never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many guys in the NBA can do what he can do,'' Clippers
guard Eric Piatkowski said of Odom, who scored 13 of his 25 points
in the final quarter. ``He's playing awesome right now.''
</P>
<P>
   And Piatkowski isn't slouching these days, either. He followed
Sunday's 20-point effort at Oakland with a career-high 31 points on
11-of-15 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope I can keep the feeling going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets (26-38), who led by as many as 14 points (92-78) in
the fourth, seemed to be feeling a bit gassed. After losing to the
Lakers on Monday in Denver, they didn't have enough residual
chutzpah to avoid a seven-game losing streak and overcome the
Clippers' Hyde-and-Jekyll routine, despite 31 points from Antonio
McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets trailed 27-24 after one quarter, achieved a tie at
55 by intermission and - thanks to 13 points from McDyess in that
period - led, 86-76, after three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers (14-50) were down by 14 midway through the fourth
quarter, before Odom went cuckoo with assorted moments of greatness
in the final stanza. His dynamic inclination keyed a closing run of
32-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew that for us to win, I would have to score,'' said
Odom, who also had 9 assists and 4 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Interim coach Jim Todd gave his blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``History tells us we've been folding lately in situations like
that,'' said Todd, whose team made 53 percent of its field-goal
tries, but allowed Denver to snipe at a 57 percent rate. ``We don't
mind Lamar having the ball late in the game; he's getting better
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Point guard Jeff McInnis, a Y2K CBA evacuee and survivor
of two 10-day NBA contracts, was signed by the Clippers through the
2000-2001 season. The Nuggets' visit provided a reunion opportunity
for McInnis, who was chosen by Denver with the 37th pick in the
1996 Draft. ... Mario Bennett, who was signed to a 10-day contract
by the Clippers on March 7, did not suit up due to soreness in his
right knee. ... The status of power forward Brian Skinner remains
indefinite due to lingering pain in his left ankle.

romantic, his switch has also brought a management problem that the

climbed his way to the top, and grown used to the trappings that
come with one of corporate America's plum jobs, start anew? The

<P>
   I think we have an opportunity, if we will all put our shoulders
to the wheel, to really change our democracy forever. A
presidential campaign is a chance to really define who we are as a
people. And a president who follows what the people are saying in
your hearts can make all the difference. The American people have
lifted up this issue of reform. I didn't do it. John McCain and
Bill Bradley got a wonderful response because the people heard that
in their message. I talked about this in the primaries. But I want
to hold the banner higher still because the American people have
insisted that this agenda be front and center.''

<P>
   This last week has been a preview. It's been a preview that the
Gore campaign will say anything to win and try to win at any cost.
We will confront their tactics one more time, and this time, we
will prevail and they will fail. They will fail, because Americans
have caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has gone into low performing schools and claimed my plan
would undermine them. Think a moment about what this means. Al Gore
has visited schools and told them, in essence, `You are hopeless.
We won't set high standards for you, because you will never achieve
them.' This is not a defense of public education, it is a surrender
to despair. This is a bright and dividing line in this campaign. I
want to solve our education problems; Al Gore wants to subsidize
them. I will work for children and their parents. He will work for
the entrenched interests that fund his campaigns. I will challenge
the status quo; Al Gore is the status quo.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George Bush
of Texas claimed their parties' nominations Tuesday night, marking
the official if anticlimactic end to their primary campaigns and
the beginning of what promises to be one of the longest
general-election campaigns in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   The two nominees effectively secured their nominations last week
when their only remaining serious rivals, former Sen. Bill Bradley
and Sen. John McCain, dropped out after defeats in nationwide
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night the voters in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas gave Gore enough delegates to the
Democratic convention to lock up the nomination. Bush came within a
few dozen delegates, but his campaign's reckoning of the
complicated delegate calculus, including results from so-called
beauty contest primaries, put him over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I filed for president, I pledged I'd come home to Texas
with the nomination of my party,'' Bush said in remarks prepared
for a reception Tuesday night in Austin, Texas. ``Tonight we can
say: Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are halfway _ but only halfway _ to ending the Clinton-Gore
era in Washington, D.C. To get there, we must face one more
Clinton-Gore campaign. The last week has been a preview: The Gore
campaign will say anything to try to win at any cost. We will
confront their tactics one more time, and this time, we will
prevail and they will fail. They will fail because Americans have
caught on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ticking off the states that put him over the top, Gore told a
rally at a high school here, ``We have now won enough delegates to
secure the Democratic nomination,'' adding: ``Tonight the South put
us over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has pulled even with Bush in the national polls, was
signaling that he would not concede the South or states like
Florida to the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   As they prepare for the eight months until the November
elections, the candidates are now the titular heads of their
respective parties. Gore takes over the Democrats after an
eight-year reign by Bill Clinton, and Bush the Republicans after a
turbulent era in which the party's loudest if not strongest voice
was that of the deposed speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign feels it has the more palpable advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is, as of tonight, we are the
presumed nominee, and under party rules, the party can pay for
travel and a lot of other things,'' said Tony Coelho, the Gore
campaign chairman. He added that, contrary to conventional wisdom,
Gore would not have to schedule ``official'' vice presidential
visits to make up for a lack of campaign funds, since the campaign
has about $13 million on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers also said he could now more freely raise money
for the party, and he has been taking advantage of that freedom. He
is attending three fund-raisers in the space of a week. Last
Saturday he raised about $100,000 in Houston. On Monday night, he
raised $200,000 from about 400 people attending a reception in
Belle Meade, a wealthy, generally Republican suburb of Nashville.
He has another fund-raiser scheduled for Washington on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Having the nomination in hand is also helping Gore organize his
campaign. Now that he is the nominee, he can start pulling together
the Democratic National Committee organizations in each state, one
Gore strategist said. On Monday night the vice president called
about 30 Democratic mayors to Nashville for a strategy session on
how to use their city machines as a counterweight to the state
organizations of the Republican governors supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The mayors, Gore told them, are on the front lines. ``You give
me a swap out straight up between all the Republican governors and
the Democratic mayors, and I'm with you all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has already made wide use of the 31 Republican governors
who have supported him and Ari Fleischer, Bush's spokesman, said
there were no other advantages to clinching the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates now face the challenge of sustaining the
interest of voters without turning them off.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are aggressively trying to define each other and
control the debate as they emerge from the primary process, and
they are both putting their opposition research operations into
high gear. Gore is casting Bush as a lightweight who lacks the
experience to run the country; Bush is chaining Gore to President
Clinton and raising doubts about the vice president's integrity and
his ability to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that both sides are already fully engaged, Bush
volunteers traveled to the small brick Forks River Elementary
School in Elmwood, Tenn., Tuesday morning, where Gore was voting in
the Tennessee primary, to hand out anti-Gore literature.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is already showing the same aggressiveness in the race
against Bush that he showed in the primaries toward Bradley. He
sought to take control Tuesday night, at least symbolically, by
sending an e-mail message to Bush, in which he reiterated his
challenge to eliminate all campaign commercials and debate twice a
week instead.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the earliest point in a campaign in modern times
that the parties have selected their nominees, when neither nominee
has been an incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore actually reached and surpassed the magic number of
delegates Tuesday morning before the day's votes were tallied. This
was possible because over the last week, the party's superdelegates
_ its leaders and elected officials and others who will
automatically attend the convention in August _ pledged their
allegiance to him, by phone and by mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans do not have superdelegates. Bush began the day
with 654 delegates and 341 were at stake Tuesday. That was 39 short
of the 1,034 need to claim the nomination. But under different
methods of calculation he had 227 more delegates from earlier
races.
</P>
<P>
   (The New York Times does not project eventual delegates from
earlier so-called beauty contests, while some other news
organizations, and the campaigns themselves, do.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the voting Tuesday, Bush received as much as 88 percent of
the vote, in Mississippi, to 74 percent in Florida. On the
Democratic side, Gore obtained 92 percent of the vote in Tennessee
to 69 percent in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his ability to win his party's nomination without losing
a single state, Gore, who first ran for president in 1988, remained
cautious about his achievement. ``It's still a little premature to
go, `Yahoo,''' Gore told a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a fall-off of attention in the news media, that's
fine,'' he added. ``There's a natural rhythm and cycle to news
coverage. I don't worry about that. But in terms of my effort to
communicate directly with voters, there will be no let-up at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Making it clear that Gore will not be the only candidate dealing
with education issues, the Bush campaign released literature on
Bush's education proposals, plus a fact sheet on what the Bush
campaign said were measures of how schools have failed to improve
under the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   The references to education by the campaign and in Bush's speech
Tuesday night highlight one of the governor's greatest challenges,
jettisoning some of the perceptions, left by the dynamics of his
campaign against McCain, that his persona and positions are too far
to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was clearly sending signals to voters in the center with
the circumstances of his victory speech here Tuesday night. He held
it at a Jewish community center and was introduced by Mayor Carlos
Ramirez of El Paso, a Democrat who also happens to be Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's presence underscored the degree to which Bush has
cobbled together more political support from minorities in Texas
than Republicans traditionally command and spoke to Bush's hope of
establishing the same crossover appeal nationally.

<P>
   ``Hi, I'm Monica Lewinsky,'' she says, rising from a sofa to
greet me as I enter her suite in the luxurious Four Seasons Hotel
in Beverly Hills. As if any such introduction were necessary.
</P>
<P>
   She may be newly svelte _ having recently shed some 30 pounds _
but with that helmet of black hair, alabaster skin and
orthodontically perfect smile, she's still instantly recognizable
as the reluctant star of the tawdry Oval Office scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from her tete-a-tete with Barbara Walters last March and
her star turn on Kenneth Starr's witness stand, Lewinsky mostly
kept to herself in the months after the story of her affair with
Bill Clinton broke.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late December, she announced that she'd struck a deal
to be the new spokeswoman for the weight-loss program Jenny Craig.
Though she won't reveal the financial details of her contract
(rumor has it she's getting paid $10,000 for every pound she
loses), she will be appearing in national TV commercials for the
diet company she credits with finally helping her get in shape.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this new public role, Lewinsky agreed to talk to me
about her lifelong battle with an unhealthy body image.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   In reading ``Monica's Story,'' which author (and Princess Diana
confidante) Andrew Morton wrote for her, on the flight to
California, I was struck by the extensive role Monica Lewinsky's
insecurity about her weight played in her disastrous liaison.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why she didn't dry clean the infamous blue dress, for
example, she recalled that Linda Tripp told her she looked fat in
it, so she left the dress in her closet. (Under the burden of that
insult, how many women wouldn't have done the same?)
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's comment struck a deep nerve, one that has plagued
Lewinsky throughout her 20-odd years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrew noted in the book how when I was going through my
pictures with him, I marked everything by my weight: `Here I was 20
pounds heavier,' `Here I was 20 pounds thinner,''' she recalls.
``It was interesting to me that one of the constructs of how I view
my life is my weight. I found it disturbing _ and, of course, he
wouldn't change it, which annoyed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for her, it is also how the public came to view
her. Dubbed the ``portly pepperpot'' by the New York tabloids, her
public battle to protect her privacy became an equally public
struggle with the scale. For two years, reporters have gleefully
critiqued her wardrobe and chronicled every morsel that has crossed
her lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time it's not even true!'' she says, laughing.
``The joke among my friends is, whatever is the most fattening
thing ordered at the table is what I ate, and I probably also had
what everyone else ate, too! I saw Calista Flockhart at a
restaurant once, and I wanted to say to her, `We're the Laurel and
Hardy of the tabloids!'''
</P>
<P>
   So why, I ask, would she invite further attention by signing on
with jenny Craig?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I've found something that's helped me and might be
able to help others,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics may point to the financial rewards of the deal (which
indeed will go a long way toward paying her legal bills), but
Lewinsky also has a genuine desire to connect with other women
who've struggled with their weight. On her book-signing tour, she
says, countless women came up to her saying that they identified
with her pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``For other people to feel comfortable sharing with me was very
touching, because it's still difficult for me to be open about
that.''
 &UR; HOW SHE'S HEALING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's abundantly clear that she's been in therapy _ ``It's no
secret that I'm working on myself,'' she says. She talks repeatedly
of trying to find ``balance'' and defuse the ``compulsive control''
that food has held over her.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've started to see is that weight for me has been a
control issue, whatever my weight has been,'' she says. ``I have
very black-and-white feelings about food _ that something's good or
something's bad, or if I eat this I'm a bad person, if I eat that
I'm a good person. I'm trying to have a more forgiving attitude and
not be as militant with myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have issues that I'm working on and I'm not there yet,
but I'm aware of a lot more.'' Those issues, she says, are ones
she's been wrestling with since as early as second grade. ``There
are things I deal with in therapy now that have nothing to do with
anything that's happening to me now or in the past few years,'' she
says, ``but are all a result of things that happened in high school
or grade school. You think, that was 10 or 15 years ago, that's
ridiculous. But those are the formative years, when you're so open
to impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in image-conscious L.A., she says, also had a
tremendous impact on her, as did her parents' eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom has always been conscious of her weight,'' she says,
``and I watched her being controlled by that in different ways on
different diets. But even if you don't see it with your own mom,
you see it at your girlfriend's house with her parents. You just
can't escape it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents' separation _ and subsequent divorce, when she was
15 _ sparked an emotional trigger for her overeating, setting a
pattern of yo-yo dieting that would last into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my problems in the past was that I would either not get
to my goal because it was unrealistic, or I'd get there and,
because I'd struggled so hard, I'd stay there for five minutes,''
she says. ``I've probably gained and lost 20 people in my life!''
Now, she says, ``It's about keeping it off.''
</P>
<P>
   But her biggest hurdle, she says, is dismantling her
``all-or-nothing'' attitude. ``I think being able to go out and
know that it's OK to have a little bit of this or a little bit of
that stops me from saying `I blew it' and having 12 drinks or a
whole cake,'' she says. ``I'm working on managing depression, too,
so I need to be able to go out with my friends. If that means that
I have a drink, then I work that into my food budget.''
 &UR; THROUGH THICK AND THIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does she think the press would have treated her differently if
she had been thin?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would have changed some of it,'' she says, with a
touch of regret. ``There were a lot of cruel things that people
said to me, and my weight handed them one more thing to be cruel to
me about. Especially in the beginning, when there was a lot of
uncertainty about what the relationship really was, my weight
played a negative role, because people would look at me and say,
`She's heavy _ why would anybody be interested in her?''
</P>
<P>
   She admits her search for love has been a bit, well, misguided.
(``That hasn't been undocumented!'' she laughs.) ``I fell prey to
someone I shouldn't have gotten involved with,'' she says quietly.
``But one of the positive things that came out of that was that
because I was with somebody who thought I was beautiful and sexy no
matter what size I was, I was able to discover that sexuality comes
from within. Even when I don't like to look at myself in the
mirror, my body has always felt good to me. But there's a catch-22
for me, because the person with whom I discovered my own sexuality
and sensuality was a bad emotional influence on me, and yet he gave
me this wonderful gift.''
</P>
<P>
   As she dabs at her tears, I can feel the pain of her heartbreak.
We've all made mistakes, I tell her; we've all done foolish things
in the name of love. ``Unfortunately,'' I joke, ``my friends have
long memories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just make sure none of them have tape recorders!'' she fires
back.
</P>
<P>
   I'm stunned at her ability to defuse the emotional moment with a
joke, especially one at her own expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously,'' she continues, ``I'm blessed to have some of the
most amazing friends in the world. I don't really consider Linda
(Tripp) a friend; I don't think she ever was.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if not for Tripp and her tape recorder, we might never
have known the name Monica Lewinsky. Whatever Lewinsky's admitted
lapses of judgment, she never intended to gain fame from her
entanglement with the president _ certainly not this kind of fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people forget I made the mistake of confiding in
someone privately,'' she says, ``but I went to pretty great lengths
legally to not have those conversations come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Her desire to reveal the truth was the reason she agreed to be
interviewed by Barbara Walters. But what she had to say was instead
dwarfed by what she was wearing _ namely, the lipstick whose sales
immediately skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I designed it or owned it, that'd be great.'' She pauses,
then adds, ``Who knows, maybe I'll do my own lipstick someday!''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, she's brought her business sense to the fashion
world, having launched last summer a line of handbags under the
name The Real Monica Inc., with sellout success. But, she says, ``I
really just want to find the right person and get married and have
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Eligible bachelors will now find this 26-year-old living in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the seasons and the diversity and that you just sort of
blend in,'' she explains. More than anything, it seems, she
desperately wishes that she might regain some semblance of a
normal, quiet life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some kooky decisions and had some kooky things happen
to me, but I'm a real person,'' she says. ``What's special about me
is that people know my name, but other than that, I'm just like
everybody else. You don't have to like me _ sometimes I don't like
me _ but at least judge me on the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does she think the history books will treat her?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think I will probably be just a footnote. My name may
not even be mentioned,'' she says, perhaps more optimistic than
realistic. ``What I'm hoping is that people come to judge me not
for how the story began, but for how it ends.'' &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   ``Hi, I'm Monica Lewinsky,'' she says, rising from a sofa to
greet me as I enter her suite in the luxurious Four Seasons Hotel
in Beverly Hills. As if any such introduction were necessary.
</P>
<P>
   She may be newly svelte _ having recently shed some 30 pounds _
but with that helmet of black hair, alabaster skin and
orthodontically perfect smile, she's still instantly recognizable
as the reluctant star of the tawdry Oval Office scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from her tete-a-tete with Barbara Walters last March and
her star turn on Kenneth Starr's witness stand, Lewinsky mostly
kept to herself in the months after the story of her affair with
Bill Clinton broke.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late December, she announced that she'd struck a deal
to be the new spokeswoman for the weight-loss program Jenny Craig.
Though she won't reveal the financial details of her contract
(rumor has it she's getting paid $10,000 for every pound she
loses), she will be appearing in national TV commercials for the
diet company she credits with finally helping her get in shape.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this new public role, Lewinsky agreed to talk to me
about her lifelong battle with an unhealthy body image.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   In reading ``Monica's Story,'' which author (and Princess Diana
confidante) Andrew Morton wrote for her, on the flight to
California, I was struck by the extensive role Monica Lewinsky's
insecurity about her weight played in her disastrous liaison.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why she didn't dry clean the infamous blue dress, for
example, she recalled that Linda Tripp told her she looked fat in
it, so she left the dress in her closet. (Under the burden of that
insult, how many women wouldn't have done the same?)
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's comment struck a deep nerve, one that has plagued
Lewinsky throughout her 20-odd years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrew noted in the book how when I was going through my
pictures with him, I marked everything by my weight: `Here I was 20
pounds heavier,' `Here I was 20 pounds thinner,''' she recalls.
``It was interesting to me that one of the constructs of how I view
my life is my weight. I found it disturbing _ and, of course, he
wouldn't change it, which annoyed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for her, it is also how the public came to view
her. Dubbed the ``portly pepperpot'' by the New York tabloids, her
public battle to protect her privacy became an equally public
struggle with the scale. For two years, reporters have gleefully
critiqued her wardrobe and chronicled every morsel that has crossed
her lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time it's not even true!'' she says, laughing.
``The joke among my friends is, whatever is the most fattening
thing ordered at the table is what I ate, and I probably also had
what everyone else ate, too! I saw Calista Flockhart at a
restaurant once, and I wanted to say to her, `We're the Laurel and
Hardy of the tabloids!'''
</P>
<P>
   So why, I ask, would she invite further attention by signing on
with jenny Craig?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I've found something that's helped me and might be
able to help others,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics may point to the financial rewards of the deal (which
indeed will go a long way toward paying her legal bills), but
Lewinsky also has a genuine desire to connect with other women
who've struggled with their weight. On her book-signing tour, she
says, countless women came up to her saying that they identified
with her pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``For other people to feel comfortable sharing with me was very
touching, because it's still difficult for me to be open about
that.''
 &UR; HOW SHE'S HEALING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's abundantly clear that she's been in therapy _ ``It's no
secret that I'm working on myself,'' she says. She talks repeatedly
of trying to find ``balance'' and defuse the ``compulsive control''
that food has held over her.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've started to see is that weight for me has been a
control issue, whatever my weight has been,'' she says. ``I have
very black-and-white feelings about food _ that something's good or
something's bad, or if I eat this I'm a bad person, if I eat that
I'm a good person. I'm trying to have a more forgiving attitude and
not be as militant with myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have issues that I'm working on and I'm not there yet,
but I'm aware of a lot more.'' Those issues, she says, are ones
she's been wrestling with since as early as second grade. ``There
are things I deal with in therapy now that have nothing to do with
anything that's happening to me now or in the past few years,'' she
says, ``but are all a result of things that happened in high school
or grade school. You think, that was 10 or 15 years ago, that's
ridiculous. But those are the formative years, when you're so open
to impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in image-conscious L.A., she says, also had a
tremendous impact on her, as did her parents' eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom has always been conscious of her weight,'' she says,
``and I watched her being controlled by that in different ways on
different diets. But even if you don't see it with your own mom,
you see it at your girlfriend's house with her parents. You just
can't escape it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents' separation _ and subsequent divorce, when she was
15 _ sparked an emotional trigger for her overeating, setting a
pattern of yo-yo dieting that would last into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my problems in the past was that I would either not get
to my goal because it was unrealistic, or I'd get there and,
because I'd struggled so hard, I'd stay there for five minutes,''
she says. ``I've probably gained and lost 20 people in my life!''
Now, she says, ``It's about keeping it off.''
</P>
<P>
   But her biggest hurdle, she says, is dismantling her
``all-or-nothing'' attitude. ``I think being able to go out and
know that it's OK to have a little bit of this or a little bit of
that stops me from saying `I blew it' and having 12 drinks or a
whole cake,'' she says. ``I'm working on managing depression, too,
so I need to be able to go out with my friends. If that means that
I have a drink, then I work that into my food budget.''
 &UR; THROUGH THICK AND THIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does she think the press would have treated her differently if
she had been thin?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would have changed some of it,'' she says, with a
touch of regret. ``There were a lot of cruel things that people
said to me, and my weight handed them one more thing to be cruel to
me about. Especially in the beginning, when there was a lot of
uncertainty about what the relationship really was, my weight
played a negative role, because people would look at me and say,
`She's heavy _ why would anybody be interested in her?''
</P>
<P>
   She admits her search for love has been a bit, well, misguided.
(``That hasn't been undocumented!'' she laughs.) ``I fell prey to
someone I shouldn't have gotten involved with,'' she says quietly.
``But one of the positive things that came out of that was that
because I was with somebody who thought I was beautiful and sexy no
matter what size I was, I was able to discover that sexuality comes
from within. Even when I don't like to look at myself in the
mirror, my body has always felt good to me. But there's a catch-22
for me, because the person with whom I discovered my own sexuality
and sensuality was a bad emotional influence on me, and yet he gave
me this wonderful gift.''
</P>
<P>
   As she dabs at her tears, I can feel the pain of her heartbreak.
We've all made mistakes, I tell her; we've all done foolish things
in the name of love. ``Unfortunately,'' I joke, ``my friends have
long memories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just make sure none of them have tape recorders!'' she fires
back.
</P>
<P>
   I'm stunned at her ability to defuse the emotional moment with a
joke, especially one at her own expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously,'' she continues, ``I'm blessed to have some of the
most amazing friends in the world. I don't really consider Linda
(Tripp) a friend; I don't think she ever was.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if not for Tripp and her tape recorder, we might never
have known the name Monica Lewinsky. Whatever Lewinsky's admitted
lapses of judgment, she never intended to gain fame from her
entanglement with the president _ certainly not this kind of fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people forget I made the mistake of confiding in
someone privately,'' she says, ``but I went to pretty great lengths
legally to not have those conversations come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Her desire to reveal the truth was the reason she agreed to be
interviewed by Barbara Walters. But what she had to say was instead
dwarfed by what she was wearing _ namely, the lipstick whose sales
immediately skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I designed it or owned it, that'd be great.'' She pauses,
then adds, ``Who knows, maybe I'll do my own lipstick someday!''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, she's brought her business sense to the fashion
world, having launched last summer a line of handbags under the
name The Real Monica Inc., with sellout success. But, she says, ``I
really just want to find the right person and get married and have
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Eligible bachelors will now find this 26-year-old living in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the seasons and the diversity and that you just sort of
blend in,'' she explains. More than anything, it seems, she
desperately wishes that she might regain some semblance of a
normal, quiet life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some kooky decisions and had some kooky things happen
to me, but I'm a real person,'' she says. ``What's special about me
is that people know my name, but other than that, I'm just like
everybody else. You don't have to like me _ sometimes I don't like
me _ but at least judge me on the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does she think the history books will treat her?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think I will probably be just a footnote. My name may
not even be mentioned,'' she says, perhaps more optimistic than
realistic. ``What I'm hoping is that people come to judge me not
for how the story began, but for how it ends.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Wally Pryor leaving job as UT `Voice'
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ His mellow voice is as much a part of
Royal-Memorial Stadium as Big Bertha, Bevo and bad nachos, but
Wally Pryor is through as ``the Voice of the Longhorns.''
</P>
<P>
   Pryor, who started as the public address announcer at University
of Texas football games in 1957, about the same time electricity
was discovered, and the same year Darrell Royal began coaching at
UT, says he's not upset about losing his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to make a change, and I agreed,'' Wally said. But he
says UT brought it up, not him. ``It's disappointing, but it's not
the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the job isn't what it used to be anyway. It's gone from
calling out touchdowns to plugging Taco Bell. ``I'm reading
commercials the whole time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   UT Associate Athletic Director Chris Plonsky says UT hasn't
decided who will take Wally's place.
</P>
<P>
   Wally's one of those chili cookoff kind of guys who doesn't fit
UT's stuffy image. Wally was born on Leap Day. ``I just had my 18th
birthday February 29th, so women can take advantage of me legally
now, but I can't drink yet,'' Wally joked.
</P>
<P>
   To add a little levity, Wally announced the Slippery Rock scores
over the stadium P.A. system. He was known for wisecracking in
front of 78,000 strangers. He was a friend of the late Hondo
Crouch, self-described ``imagineer'' and founder of Luckenbach, the
town near Fredericksburg that is really a beer joint with live
music.
</P>
<P>
   Wally says that at Scholz -- eer -- ar-- en before a game in the
1970s, Crouch asked him to mention his name over the P.A. system
during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I can't do that,''' Wally recalled. Yeah, right.
During the game, Wally announce-- : ``Hondo Crouch, Scholz -- eer
-- arden called. They want you to pick up your grandmother after
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Afterwards, Hondo came up and said, `Thank you; I'm going to
be at the Broken Spoke after the next game,''' Wally said. From one
game to the next, fans would wait to hear at which bar Crouch was
supposed to pick up his grandmother. One week Granny would
allegedly be at the Spoke, the next week at the Rusty Nail, the
next week at the Split Rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then T. Jones (a former assistant athletic director in the
early '80s) made me stop ad-libbing,'' Wally said. He says Jones
made him stick to the script because he made up names for the
members of the Longhorn Luvs, a female dance team that performed at
UT men's basketball games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had given them all nicknames like Luscious Lil, Sexy Sal _
nothing bad,'' Wally said. ``He had gotten a letter from this gal,
and she complained about how I had introduced them.''
</P>
<P>
   So who will UT pick to replace Wally? One possibility would be
KVET radio executive Bob Cole, since KVET has the contract to
broadcast the UT football games. But Cole's not sure he's
interested. ``Following Wally Pryor would be like following Darrell
Royal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So what about Matthew McConaughey?

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call (404) 222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: A&AMP;E recently featured a program titled ``66 AD.'' Is it
possible to order a videotape of it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The complete title is ``66 AD: The Last Revolt.'' The
cost is $29.95. You can order it by calling 1-888-423-1212 (ask for
item number AAE-17772), or online at www.aetv.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who was the governor of Georgia, and what was the date, when
the state flag was changed to include the Confederate battle
symbol?
</P>
<P>
   A: On Feb. 13, 1956, Democratic Gov. Marvin Griffin signed into
law a bill changing the 1879 Georgia flag to the current one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What causes most accidental deaths in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Preliminary National Safety Council statistics for 1998 (the
latest available) show that 41,200 people died in motor vehicle
accidents. This compares to 16,600 from falls; 8,400 from solid or
liquid poison; 4,100 from drowning; 3,700 from fires/burns; 3,200
from ingestion of food/objects; 900 from firearms; and 600 from
poison gases.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Jim Henson Co. was sold recently to a German company. Why
would Henson's children want to sell their father's company?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was a matter of economics, according to the principals
involved. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Brian Henson,
chairman and CEO of Jim Henson Co., explained that it's becoming
``harder and harder for independent companies like ours'' to face
the increasing difficulties as power in the entertainment industry
becomes more and more concentrated in the hands of a few global
conglomerates. ``The huge, vertically integrated companies want a
piece of our programs (in exchange for air time) and are paying
lower licensing fees,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Henson said combining with the German company EM.TV &AMP;
Merchandising, in a deal worth $680 million in cash and stock,
should enable Henson Co. to grow, without any change in leadership
and with its headquarters remaining in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held Henson Co., which is controlled by the five
children of its founder, the late puppeteer Jim Henson, is
profitable on annual revenue of more than $200 million. But it has
struggled in recent years, despite the appeal of its Muppet
characters, to reinvent and grow the brand.
</P>
<P>
   Disney had agreed to buy Henson Co. in 1989 for $150 million,
but the deal fell apart after Jim Henson's sudden death in May
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In all the reporting about Sen. John McCain, we've seen and
heard very little about his first wife. Who was she? How long were
they married? Did they have children? Do you have any other
information about her?
</P>
<P>
   A: His first wife was Carol Shepp, who had been a model in
Philadelphia. They met when McCain was at the Naval Academy, began
a serious relationship while he was stationed in Pensacola, Fla.,
and married in 1965. They had a daughter, Sydney; and McCain
adopted Shepp's sons, Douglas and Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   As everyone knows, McCain was imprisoned in Hanoi during the
Vietnam War. During that time, his wife was severely injured in an
automobile accident.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1980, McCain petitioned a Florida court to dissolve
the marriage, saying it was ``irretrievably broken.'' His wife
didn't contest the divorce. McCain agreed to pay her medical bills
for life and gave her the deeds to houses they owned in Virginia
and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Family friends blamed the breakup on McCain's 5 1/2-year absence
_ he was shot down in October 1967, and not released until March
1973 _ as well as affairs he later acknowledged. He married Cindy
Hensley in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Shepp, who remains loyal to her ex-husband, lives in northern
Virginia. She refuses to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When private individuals earn free airline tickets by
accumulating enough frequent-flier miles, are those tickets taxable
by the Internal Revenue Service?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you earn the miles (and tickets) with your own money, that
ordinarily isn't considered taxable income, said IRS spokesman Mark
Green.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that the IRS hasn't adopted an official
policy on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife and I have two homes, and we have received notices at
both that we will be receiving forms for Census 2000. Should we
complete both forms, since we split our time at both homes, or only
one for the home we consider our primary residence (where we are
registered to vote)?
</P>
<P>
   A: You should use the form delivered at your primary residence,
and discard the other one, said Mary Vetter of the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The forms, by the way, will have a telephone number to call if
you have any questions. And you'll be able to talk to a person and
not a machine, Vetter said.
</P>
<P>
   If you wish, in case you won't be going back to your primary
residence in time to fill out and return the form by mail, you can
call the number and answer the questions by phone.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you figure GMT?
</P>
<P>
   A: Greenwich Mean Time is based on the prime meridian, a
north-south line passing through Greenwich, a borough of London.
The site of Britain's Royal Greenwich Observatory, it was
designated as the world's prime meridian by an international
conference in 1884.
</P>
<P>
   There are 24 time zones, each with a width of 15 degrees
longitude. Moving west of Greenwich, the time becomes one hour
earlier with each time zone entered. In standard time, excluding
Alaska and Hawaii, the United States has four, GMT -5 (East Coast)
to -8 (West Coast). So, on standard time, if it's noon at
Greenwich, it's 7 a.m. in New York, 4 a.m. in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were Girl Scout cookies ever made by hand?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes: the sale of cookies in 1917 when the Mistletoe Troop
baked and sold cookies in its high school cafeteria in Muskogee,
Okla., as a service project. Then, in the '20s and '30s, Girl
Scouts and their mothers in different parts of the country baked
their own simple sugar cookies, packaged them in wax paper bags,
and sold them door-to-door.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, Greater Philadelpia became the first council to sell
commercially baked cookies. Three bakeries _ down from 14 in 1961 _
are licensed to produce them now.

   A: The property, which totals several hundred acres in Mitchell
County, was an endowed gift from the estate of Julius Brown in
1928, said Tech spokesman Bob Harty. Tech receives oil receipt
revenue from the land. The endowment income supports professorships
in electrical engineering and/or chemistry, Harty added, with the
chairs named in honor of Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When tracking the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq
composite index, what do the numbers represent? How do changes
affect the individual investor?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Dow is an average obtained by adding the prices of 30
large blue-chip stocks and dividing by a divisor, which is chosen
to adjust for stock splits that have occurred over the years.
Because of the way it's computed, high-priced stocks have more
influence on the Dow than low-priced stocks, said Myron Greene,
retired Georgia State University business professor and publisher
of the Mutual Fund Timing Guide.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite is an index whose value is obtained by
dividing the current market value of all stocks traded on Nasdaq by
the market value of all stocks traded on Nasdaq on Feb. 5, 1971
(the Friday before Nasdaq's first day of trading), and multiplying
by 100. This technique gives more weight to stocks with higher
market valuations and is unaffected by relative price levels,
Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   Point changes in any average or index aren't very significant,
Greene explained. Investors should focus on the percentage changes.
For example, when the Dow was at 1,000, a change of 100 points
amounted to 10 percent. With the Dow currently around 10,000, a
100-point change is a relatively insignificant 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow is dominated by large, well-established companies, while
Nasdaq is the home of many high-tech firms. So investors owning
equity-income or index funds should be more concerned with the Dow.
Those owning growth mutual funds should watch the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last year, NASA recovered the Mercury 7 space capsule that
sank after Gus Grissom splashed down in it. Did the space agency
discover the reason for its sinking?
</P>
<P>
   A: NASA has known all along that the capsule's hatch blew open
prematurely, allowing the spacecraft to fill with water. But the
reason for the hatch's blowing open may never be known.
</P>
<P>
   The 7 1/2-foot aluminum and titanium capsule, Liberty Bell 7,
sank 3 miles to the bottom of the ocean floor after splashdown on
July 21, 1961. It was brought to the surface last July 20 by Curt
Newport, an underwater salvage expert who spent 14 years searching
for it. He finally located it about 300 miles southeast of Cape
Canaveral, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But Newport's team didn't find the hatch, which might have shed
more light on what happened. Grissom, who swam from the capsule
after the hatch flew off, insisted for the rest of his life that he
didn't cause it to blow. Along with two other astronauts, he died
in 1967 during an Apollo launch pad fire.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I thought I read that Herb Kelleher, of Southwest Airlines,
had died. Am I wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A: What you read was that Kelleher, Southwest's chairman,
president and CEO, was undergoing radiation treatment for prostate
cancer. It was reported in August that he would receive brief
radiation treatments each weekday for about eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest spokeswoman Linda Rutherford told Q&AMP;A that Kelleher's
doctors were ``very encouraged'' at his reponse to the radiation
treatment, which he finished in October.
</P>
<P>
   He's now back at work full time, she said, and will undergo
further testing this spring to monitor his status.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that there will not be another Feb. 29 in a year
ending in 00 until 2400. I've tried doing the math, but can't
figure out why 2100, 2200 and 2300 won't have one. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Only those century years (years ending in 00) that are
exactly divisible by 400 (such as 1600, 2000 and 2400) are leap
years. The century years you cited obviously don't meet that
standard.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the deal. The calendar year and the solar year don't
quite coincide, so we add an extra day, Feb. 29, every four years
(leap year). But adding a day every fourth year then makes the
average calendar year 11 minutes, 14 seconds too long.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the 16th century, mathematicians decided to tweak the
system a bit more. They calculated that the correction amounted to
three days in 400 years, and saw that by dropping three leap years
in a cycle of 400 years, all would be well.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the extra day isn't added in the century years _ except
those divisible by 400.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard a radio interview with the U.S. ambassador-at-large
for war crimes issues. Who is he, and what exactly is his mission?
Is this something new?
</P>
<P>
   A: David Scheffer is the first-ever ambassador-at-large for war
crimes issues. The appointment carries an ambassadorial rank.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Scheffer was nominated for the post by President
Clinton, confirmed by the Senate, and sworn in by Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson, who then was U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations. Scheffer has served in the Clinton administration since
1993.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department explains that this post addresses serious
violations of international humanitarian law anywhere in the world.
Scheffer coordinates support for the functions of the Yugoslav and
Rwandan War Crimes Tribunals, and coordinates and leads U.S.
participation in U.N. negotiations for the establishment of a
permanent International Criminal Court.
</P>
<P>
   Scheffer isn't the first, or the only, ambassador-at-large.
Among others: Stephen Sestanovich, for the new independent states
of the former U.S.S.R.; Robert Seiple, for international religious
freedom; and Michael Sheehan, for counterterrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With prices for gasoline continuing to rise, does the tax
also rise? Does the government make more money, in other words,
when gasoline costs more?
</P>
<P>
   A: The federal tax on a gallon of gasoline is 18.4 cents a
gallon; state taxes are extra. The total amount of tax revenue
going to the federal and state governments rises only if the total
amount of gasoline sold rises, unless some states impose a state
sales tax, which would apply to the retail price.
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute posts tax information for all
states online at www.api.org/consumer/fueltax99.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Atlanta Braves pitcher Greg Maddux had laser eye surgery.
What's involved in the procedure?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Braves pitcher, who was nearsighted, underwent laser eye
surgery last July 9 at Emory Vision Correction Center in Atlanta.
Emory's Claire Schwall explained that in the LASIK procedure, which
is intended to correct near-sightedness and astigmatism, a portion
of the cornea is lifted and the bed of the cornea is reshaped. In
Maddux's case, the surgery enabled him to shed both the glasses he
often wore off the field, and the contacts he wore while pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux said he had the procedure done for personal reasons, not
in hopes that it would improve his pitching. But he has told
reporters that he's now more comfortable on the mound. Before the
surgery, he wore contacts when pitching because they gave him
better peripheral vision than glasses. But they also were
constantly irritating his eyes, he said, so for him the surgery was
a better option.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported several weeks ago that a Navy helicopter
crashed and sank within sight of a ship off San Diego. Several
sailors and Marines were rescued. Did the Navy recover the bodies
of the others? I never saw a follow-up after an initial report that
the search had been called off.
</P>
<P>
   A: The bodies of six Marines and a Navy corpsman were pulled
from the wreckage at the bottom of the ocean nearly two weeks after
the Dec. 9 crash. The CH-46E Sea Knight helicopter had taken off
from the Bonhomme Richard, an amphibious assault ship, and was
approaching the Navy tanker Pecos when it apparently got caught in
a metal safety net and was pulled into the water. The men were
training for a mission to the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven Marines were rescued quickly after the accident, which
occurred about 15 miles off the San Diego shore. But the
23,000-pound copter filled with water and sank about 3,600 feet to
the ocean floor, making rescue of those trapped inside impossible.
Their bodies were recovered by a submersible robot that can dive to
5,000 feet and retrieve objects with mechanical arms.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service for the seven who died was held Dec. 20 at
Camp Pendleton in California.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've noticed that on some TV crime shows, the police refer to
a criminal as a ``skel.'' Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: A dictionary of slang terms spells the word ``skell'' and
defines it as ``a street derelict who also may be a villain.'' The
Dutch ``schelm'' (meaning scoundrel or villain) appears to have
been the root word. According to the dictionary, the term found its
way into English as early as 1611, and was spelled ``skelum.'' It
was revived by New York police as ``skel'' or ``skell'' by the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, Q&AMP;A was settling a bet about the number of
counties in Georgia and Texas. In passing, you mentioned that
Delaware has only three counties. I'm a former Delaware resident,
and I believe the state actually has hundreds. Can you check?
</P>
<P>
   A: This may seem like a word game. Delaware has three counties _
Kent, New Castle and Sussex _ so that reference indeed was correct.
</P>
<P>
   But Delaware also has ``hundreds.'' In fact, it's the only state
with hundreds. But that doesn't refer to the number of counties;
hundreds is the term for the divisions within Delaware's three
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Newton of the Delaware Division of Libraries said the
state has a total of 33 hundreds, with 11 in New Castle, 9 in Kent
and 13 in Sussex.
</P>
<P>
   There are several theories about how the term originated in
Delaware, Newton told Q&AMP;A, but the two most widely accepted are
that it referred to an area of 10 families or 100 people, or to an
area that could supply 100 militiamen. It traces to centuries back
in England, Newton added.
</P>

any library.

   Q: Who was the governor of Georgia, and what was the date, when
the state flag was changed to include the Confederate battle
symbol?
</P>
<P>
   A: On Feb. 13, 1956, Democratic Gov. Marvin Griffin signed into
law a bill changing the 1879 Georgia flag to the current one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What causes most accidental deaths in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Preliminary National Safety Council statistics for 1998 (the
latest available) show that 41,200 people died in motor vehicle
accidents. This compares to 16,600 from falls; 8,400 from solid or
liquid poison; 4,100 from drowning; 3,700 from fires/burns; 3,200
from ingestion of food/objects; 900 from firearms; and 600 from
poison gases.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Jim Henson Co. was sold recently to a German company. Why
would Henson's children want to sell their father's company?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was a matter of economics, according to the principals
involved. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Brian Henson,
chairman and CEO of Jim Henson Co., explained that it's becoming
``harder and harder for independent companies like ours'' to face
the increasing difficulties as power in the entertainment industry
becomes more and more concentrated in the hands of a few global
conglomerates. ``The huge, vertically integrated companies want a
piece of our programs (in exchange for air time) and are paying
lower licensing fees,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Henson said combining with the German company EM.TV &AMP;
Merchandising, in a deal worth $680 million in cash and stock,
should enable Henson Co. to grow, without any change in leadership
and with its headquarters remaining in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held Henson Co., which is controlled by the five
children of its founder, the late puppeteer Jim Henson, is
profitable on annual revenue of more than $200 million. But it has
struggled in recent years, despite the appeal of its Muppet
characters, to reinvent and grow the brand.
</P>
<P>
   Disney had agreed to buy Henson Co. in 1989 for $150 million,
but the deal fell apart after Jim Henson's sudden death in May
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In all the reporting about Sen. John McCain, we've seen and
heard very little about his first wife. Who was she? How long were
they married? Did they have children? Do you have any other
information about her?
</P>
<P>
   A: His first wife was Carol Shepp, who had been a model in
Philadelphia. They met when McCain was at the Naval Academy, began
a serious relationship while he was stationed in Pensacola, Fla.,
and married in 1965. They had a daughter, Sydney; and McCain
adopted Shepp's sons, Douglas and Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   As everyone knows, McCain was imprisoned in Hanoi during the
Vietnam War. During that time, his wife was severely injured in an
automobile accident.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1980, McCain petitioned a Florida court to dissolve
the marriage, saying it was ``irretrievably broken.'' His wife
didn't contest the divorce. McCain agreed to pay her medical bills
for life and gave her the deeds to houses they owned in Virginia
and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Family friends blamed the breakup on McCain's 5 1/2-year absence
_ he was shot down in October 1967, and not released until March
1973 _ as well as affairs he later acknowledged. He married Cindy
Hensley in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Shepp, who remains loyal to her ex-husband, lives in northern
Virginia. She refuses to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When private individuals earn free airline tickets by
accumulating enough frequent-flier miles, are those tickets taxable
by the Internal Revenue Service?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you earn the miles (and tickets) with your own money, that
ordinarily isn't considered taxable income, said IRS spokesman Mark
Green.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that the IRS hasn't adopted an official
policy on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife and I have two homes, and we have received notices at
both that we will be receiving forms for Census 2000. Should we
complete both forms, since we split our time at both homes, or only
one for the home we consider our primary residence (where we are
registered to vote)?
</P>
<P>
   A: You should use the form delivered at your primary residence,
and discard the other one, said Mary Vetter of the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The forms, by the way, will have a telephone number to call if
you have any questions. And you'll be able to talk to a person and
not a machine, Vetter said.
</P>
<P>
   If you wish, in case you won't be going back to your primary
residence in time to fill out and return the form by mail, you can
call the number and answer the questions by phone.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you figure GMT?
</P>
<P>
   A: Greenwich Mean Time is based on the prime meridian, a
north-south line passing through Greenwich, a borough of London.
The site of Britain's Royal Greenwich Observatory, it was
designated as the world's prime meridian by an international
conference in 1884.
</P>
<P>
   There are 24 time zones, each with a width of 15 degrees
longitude. Moving west of Greenwich, the time becomes one hour
earlier with each time zone entered. In standard time, excluding
Alaska and Hawaii, the United States has four, GMT -5 (East Coast)
to -8 (West Coast). So, on standard time, if it's noon at
Greenwich, it's 7 a.m. in New York, 4 a.m. in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were Girl Scout cookies ever made by hand?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes: the sale of cookies in 1917 when the Mistletoe Troop
baked and sold cookies in its high school cafeteria in Muskogee,
Okla., as a service project. Then, in the '20s and '30s, Girl
Scouts and their mothers in different parts of the country baked
their own simple sugar cookies, packaged them in wax paper bags,
and sold them door-to-door.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, Greater Philadelpia became the first council to sell
commercially baked cookies. Three bakeries _ down from 14 in 1961 _
are licensed to produce them now.

 &HT;    Miracle of the loaves
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ave Bonar bakes autobiographical bread.
</P>
<P>
   Bonar is one of the most accomplished photographers in Texas,
specializing in striking black-and-white portraits and documentary
shots that capture whimsical and unguarded moments for posterity.
</P>
<P>
   But in her home in Austin, Bonar prefers to caress bread dough,
not a camera, to preserve her own family's history.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked into the rear corner of her refrigerator is a plastic box
where she stores a treasured family heirloom. Inside is 1 1/2 cups
of homemade liquid yeast that allows Bonar to keep her heritage
alive by continuing to bake the same bread her family has made for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Bonar's grandmother began baking with the yeast mixture nearly
80 years ago, and each bread loaf made since then carries her
imprint and that of all family members who baked after her. That's
because a portion of starter mixture is taken out of each batch of
dough and carried over to the next .
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother got it from a neighbor when my father was born
in Texico, New Mexico, and that was in December 1923,'' Bonar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandmother always called it the `everlasting yeast.' I never
heard her call it (bread) starter.''
</P>
<P>
   Her grandmother, Amarillo homemaker Vonnie Peters Miller, handed
down the everlasting yeast to Bonar's father and mother in Lubbock.
When Bonar left home to attend art school at the University of
Texas in 1969, she packed the active ingredient for her family's
staff of life.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Bonar has so cherished the family bread that she
has traveled cross country with the liquid yeast in an ice chest.
She has shipped a portion of the yeast by overnight mail to her
aunt in New Mexico. And she has given some away to close friends
who begged for it, including Austin photographer Steve Clark, who
owns the Stephen L. Clark Gallery for photography.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Bonar even wrapped some of the everlasting yeast in a
large plastic bag, packed it in a cardboard box and mailed it to a
friend. Unfortunately, the package arrived over a weekend and the
yeast grew, leaving the box lumpy and suspicious-looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``His secretary was terrified,'' Bonar said. ``She thought it
was a bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from UT in 1976 with a degree in journalism,
Bonar developed an unmistakable style of photography first inspired
by Russell Lee and others who documented the Depression in
compelling black-and-white photos. Bonar's photos often show the
wry side of life _ a dog tangled in a leash stretched almost to the
breaking point, a young man pushing a line of shopping carts, and
Ann Richards posing next to a tacky fish trophy in a small-town
chamber of commerce during her successful 1990 campaign for Texas
governor.
</P>
<P>
   As with her photographs, Bonar puts a signature touch on her
breadmaking. She turns the traditional white bread dough into whole
wheat or multigrain loaves.
</P>
<P>
   And, at a friend's suggestion, she installed a wood-burning oven
in her South Austin back yard last year to bake the bread. Since
then, she has discovered the joys of gathering wood, building and
stoking a fire, and guesstimating the oven's temperature.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has put it in a different realm for me,'' Bonar said.
``It is so much better outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonar spent several hundred dollars for her oven made of natural
materials, which is called a cob oven. She and her friends mortared
recycled concrete chunks to form the base of the oven. An Austin
company called CobCrew helped build the baking chamber out of
layers of mixed clay, sand, and straw.
</P>
<P>
   Bonar hasn't had to buy firewood because she collects discarded
tree branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got two station wagon loads of wood from (former Texas Lt.
Gov.) Bob Bullock's house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonar had been photographing a family that lived across the
street from Bullock. She stopped to talk to the tree-trimmers,
asked for the wood _ and they even cut it to lengths she needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a chain saw, but I've never had to use it,'' Bonar
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among Bonar's friends, the everlasting bread is as popular as
her photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her she should be marketing it because it really is
fabulous bread,'' said Sherry Matthews, who runs her own marketing
and public relations company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her bread is a way of showing affection,'' Matthews said. ``If
I were sick or had a bad day or some stressful thing had happened
to me that I might have mentioned to her, then I would come home
and there would be this little round of bread on my doorstep. I
always thought it was wonderful. That would be her way of trying to
cheer me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonar's three siblings followed her example of carrying on the
family bread tradition. Her sister bakes the bread in Panama, a
brother bakes in Venezuela and another brother bakes in Austin. Her
mother still makes it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Bonar's father baked bread, but he died of cancer in 1983. While
her father was ill, Bonar baked a lot of bread and brought loaves
to the hospital nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went over there one day and we were standing over the bed,
and I told the nurse, `We bake bread,''' Bonar said. ``And he
looked at me and said, `No, you bake bread.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bonar knew her father, a psychiatrist who used to bring patients
home to knead bread, was handing off the everlasting bread for the
last time. Bonar, his eldest child, instantly understood that her
father was acknowledging that ``I'm carrying it on.''

 &HT;    Your bran muffin might have no more fiber than white bread
 &HT;    By Karen Collins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much fiber do bran muffins provide?
</P>
<P>
   A: The amount varies with the recipe and the size of the muffin.
Some may contain quite a bit of bran, others just a trace. Most
commercial muffins are made with white flour. For more fiber and
nutrients, look for muffins made with whole-wheat flour, or make
your own. Muffins are easy to make, and can be frozen for use one
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   As muffin size increases, so does fiber content, along with
calories. Some small bran muffins without much bran give you only 1
gram of fiber (no different than a slice of white bread); a
mega-muffin with more bran may supply 3 to 8 grams of fiber, but
may also yield 400 or more calories (equal to two doughnuts!).
Check ingredient and Nutrition Fact labels. Health experts
recommend 20-35 grams of fiber per day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that for best nutrition we should eat all our
vegetables raw?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Although cooking does destroy a portion of certain
heat-sensitive vitamins such as vitamin C, some sources have
misinterpreted this to mean that no nutrients remain in vegetables
after they are cooked. This is far from true. If you take care not
to cook vegetables until they're limp, you will get plenty of
nutrition. Also, cook by steaming, microwaving, roasting or
stir-frying to prevent vitamins from leaching out into cooking
water.
</P>
<P>
   New research shows that at least one valuable phytochemical (a
naturally occurring substance in plant foods) may actually become
more available to our bodies when we get it from cooked vegetables.
Lycopene, which some studies suggest helps prevent prostate cancer,
is better absorbed by the body from processed products like tomato
sauce, soup and juice than from raw tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How high in omega-3 fatty acids is farm-raised catfish?
</P>
<P>
   A: Catfish, wild or farm-raised, is a very nutritious, low-fat
source of protein (as long as you don't deep-fat fry it!). It is
not, however, a good source of omega-3 fatty acids. According to
USDA data, a 3-ounce cooked portion provides about as much omega-3
as clams and shrimp, only about a tenth as much as you get from
fattier fish such as salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Experts note that these components of fat seem to have a variety
of health benefits, including reduced risk of heart disease and
benefits to the immune system. Some research even suggests that
omega-3 fats may help lower risk of breast cancer and, perhaps,
other cancers. These Ask a Dietitian questions were answered by
Karen Collins, M.S., R.D. of the American Institute for Cancer
Research.

 &HT;    Fresh halibut is on the line
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As a signal that spring is really on its way, the
fishing season for fresh Alaskan halibut begins today. That means
the prized fish will be in stores by the weekend _ or no later than
Tuesday, the first day of spring. It depends on the weather those
first few days.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that under tightly controlled fishing, fresh
halibut was taken during brief openings and was available only
sporadically. The controls have worked and halibut fishing in
Alaska, which produces 90 percent of the Pacific halibut, is now
allowed from March 15 to Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Fish is always best enjoyed fresh and in season. During the
winter, what little fresh halibut is available arrives from the
East Coast. It is in short supply and commands a caviar price _ as
high as $15-$16 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific halibut is vastly more plentiful. While the opening
price may be high, it will drop dramatically as the season
progresses.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of halibut is that it is lean and pure white, with
appeal to those who avoid more assertively flavored fish such as
tuna and salmon. The flavor of halibut is delicate, and the big
flakes are firm. The only down side is that it dries out if even
slightly overcooked. That's why some experts avoid broiling or
grilling it, preferring to poach or braise it in liquids.
</P>
<P>
   But those aren't popular cooking methods. Roasting (or baking)
thick halibut steaks works if the fish is protected with butter. Of
course, it isn't so lean then, but in this case we're talking taste
and texture.
</P>
<P>
   It is crucial to cook the food on the bone to maximize the
flavor and retain moisture. The four sections of a halibut steak
separate from the bone easily when cooked.
</P>
<P>
   ROAST HALIBUT WITH BUTTER AND BREAD CRUMBS
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons butter, melted and seasoned with salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 large or two medium halibut steaks, about 1 1/2 pounds or more
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup bread crumbs (fresh is best, but dried will work)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Pour half the seasoned butter in
the bottom of a baking dish and place the fish on top. Drizzle with
the rest of the butter and sprinkle bread crumbs over all. Place in
the oven. Bake about 8-10 minutes, then check for doneness by
peeking between the flesh and the bone with a thin-bladed knife.
</P>
<P>
   When there is just the tiniest bit of translucency remaining _
before the fish is totally opaque _ remove the fish from the oven.
It will finish cooking by the time you get it to the table.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with some of the pan juices spooned over the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 416 calories, 22 g
fat, 100 mg cholesterol, 388 mg sodium. (Note: While the pan juices
are good, the fish is moist without them. Skip them and you'll
substantially reduce the calories and fat).
</P>
<P>
   _ Recipe is adapted from Mark Bittman's ``Fish'' (Macmillan).
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite ways to cook fish is pan roasting. The fish
is seared on one side in an ovenproof skillet _ I use cast iron _
then turned and popped into a 450-degree oven to finish cooking.
The technique, a favorite of chefs, helps keep fish succulent but
provides a crisp exterior. Fish steaks or center-cut fillets should
be at least an inch thick for this technique.
</P>
<P>
   This is an everyday recipe that requires no special preparation.
Serve it with a a few spoonfuls of your favorite salsa.
</P>
<P>
   CUMIN-DUSTED HALIBUT
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds halibut steaks, at least an inch thick
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Pat the fillets dry and sprinkle with cumin and salt and pepper
to taste on both sides. Heat oil in a large cast iron skillet. Sear
the fillets over high heat until brown, about 4 minutes. Use a
spatula to turn. Place the skillet in the middle of the oven and
roast for another 6 to 8 minutes. Check doneness by using a thin
knife to separate the flesh from the bone. It should separate
easily and be opaque throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 200 calories, 5.2
g fat, 54 mg cholesterol, 360 mg sodium.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FILE 2 OF 2
</P>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call (404) 222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was in Texas recently, I saw a billboard on I-20,
about 23 miles north of Big Springs, stating that the land was the
property of the Georgia Institute of Technology. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: The property, which totals several hundred acres in Mitchell
County, was an endowed gift from the estate of Julius Brown in
1928, said Tech spokesman Bob Harty. Tech receives oil receipt
revenue from the land. The endowment income supports professorships
in electrical engineering and/or chemistry, Harty added, with the
chairs named in honor of Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When tracking the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq
composite index, what do the numbers represent? How do changes
affect the individual investor?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Dow is an average obtained by adding the prices of 30
large blue-chip stocks and dividing by a divisor, which is chosen
to adjust for stock splits that have occurred over the years.
Because of the way it's computed, high-priced stocks have more
influence on the Dow than low-priced stocks, said Myron Greene,
retired Georgia State University business professor and publisher
of the Mutual Fund Timing Guide.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite is an index whose value is obtained by
dividing the current market value of all stocks traded on Nasdaq by
the market value of all stocks traded on Nasdaq on Feb. 5, 1971
(the Friday before Nasdaq's first day of trading), and multiplying
by 100. This technique gives more weight to stocks with higher
market valuations and is unaffected by relative price levels,
Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   Point changes in any average or index aren't very significant,
Greene explained. Investors should focus on the percentage changes.
For example, when the Dow was at 1,000, a change of 100 points
amounted to 10 percent. With the Dow currently around 10,000, a
100-point change is a relatively insignificant 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow is dominated by large, well-established companies, while
Nasdaq is the home of many high-tech firms. So investors owning
equity-income or index funds should be more concerned with the Dow.
Those owning growth mutual funds should watch the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last year, NASA recovered the Mercury 7 space capsule that
sank after Gus Grissom splashed down in it. Did the space agency
discover the reason for its sinking?
</P>
<P>
   A: NASA has known all along that the capsule's hatch blew open
prematurely, allowing the spacecraft to fill with water. But the
reason for the hatch's blowing open may never be known.
</P>
<P>
   The 7 1/2-foot aluminum and titanium capsule, Liberty Bell 7,
sank 3 miles to the bottom of the ocean floor after splashdown on
July 21, 1961. It was brought to the surface last July 20 by Curt
Newport, an underwater salvage expert who spent 14 years searching
for it. He finally located it about 300 miles southeast of Cape
Canaveral, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But Newport's team didn't find the hatch, which might have shed
more light on what happened. Grissom, who swam from the capsule
after the hatch flew off, insisted for the rest of his life that he
didn't cause it to blow. Along with two other astronauts, he died
in 1967 during an Apollo launch pad fire.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I thought I read that Herb Kelleher, of Southwest Airlines,
had died. Am I wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A: What you read was that Kelleher, Southwest's chairman,
president and CEO, was undergoing radiation treatment for prostate
cancer. It was reported in August that he would receive brief
radiation treatments each weekday for about eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest spokeswoman Linda Rutherford told Q&AMP;A that Kelleher's
doctors were ``very encouraged'' at his reponse to the radiation
treatment, which he finished in October.
</P>
<P>
   He's now back at work full time, she said, and will undergo
further testing this spring to monitor his status.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that there will not be another Feb. 29 in a year
ending in 00 until 2400. I've tried doing the math, but can't
figure out why 2100, 2200 and 2300 won't have one. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Only those century years (years ending in 00) that are
exactly divisible by 400 (such as 1600, 2000 and 2400) are leap
years. The century years you cited obviously don't meet that
standard.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the deal. The calendar year and the solar year don't
quite coincide, so we add an extra day, Feb. 29, every four years
(leap year). But adding a day every fourth year then makes the
average calendar year 11 minutes, 14 seconds too long.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the 16th century, mathematicians decided to tweak the
system a bit more. They calculated that the correction amounted to
three days in 400 years, and saw that by dropping three leap years
in a cycle of 400 years, all would be well.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the extra day isn't added in the century years _ except
those divisible by 400.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard a radio interview with the U.S. ambassador-at-large
for war crimes issues. Who is he, and what exactly is his mission?
Is this something new?
</P>
<P>
   A: David Scheffer is the first-ever ambassador-at-large for war
crimes issues. The appointment carries an ambassadorial rank.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Scheffer was nominated for the post by President
Clinton, confirmed by the Senate, and sworn in by Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson, who then was U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations. Scheffer has served in the Clinton administration since
1993.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department explains that this post addresses serious
violations of international humanitarian law anywhere in the world.
Scheffer coordinates support for the functions of the Yugoslav and
Rwandan War Crimes Tribunals, and coordinates and leads U.S.
participation in U.N. negotiations for the establishment of a
permanent International Criminal Court.
</P>
<P>
   Scheffer isn't the first, or the only, ambassador-at-large.
Among others: Stephen Sestanovich, for the new independent states
of the former U.S.S.R.; Robert Seiple, for international religious
freedom; and Michael Sheehan, for counterterrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With prices for gasoline continuing to rise, does the tax
also rise? Does the government make more money, in other words,
when gasoline costs more?
</P>
<P>
   A: The federal tax on a gallon of gasoline is 18.4 cents a
gallon; state taxes are extra. The total amount of tax revenue
going to the federal and state governments rises only if the total
amount of gasoline sold rises, unless some states impose a state
sales tax, which would apply to the retail price.
</P>
<P>
   The American Petroleum Institute posts tax information for all
states online at www.api.org/consumer/fueltax99.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Atlanta Braves pitcher Greg Maddux had laser eye surgery.
What's involved in the procedure?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Braves pitcher, who was nearsighted, underwent laser eye
surgery last July 9 at Emory Vision Correction Center in Atlanta.
Emory's Claire Schwall explained that in the LASIK procedure, which
is intended to correct near-sightedness and astigmatism, a portion
of the cornea is lifted and the bed of the cornea is reshaped. In
Maddux's case, the surgery enabled him to shed both the glasses he
often wore off the field, and the contacts he wore while pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux said he had the procedure done for personal reasons, not
in hopes that it would improve his pitching. But he has told
reporters that he's now more comfortable on the mound. Before the
surgery, he wore contacts when pitching because they gave him
better peripheral vision than glasses. But they also were
constantly irritating his eyes, he said, so for him the surgery was
a better option.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported several weeks ago that a Navy helicopter
crashed and sank within sight of a ship off San Diego. Several
sailors and Marines were rescued. Did the Navy recover the bodies
of the others? I never saw a follow-up after an initial report that
the search had been called off.
</P>
<P>
   A: The bodies of six Marines and a Navy corpsman were pulled
from the wreckage at the bottom of the ocean nearly two weeks after
the Dec. 9 crash. The CH-46E Sea Knight helicopter had taken off
from the Bonhomme Richard, an amphibious assault ship, and was
approaching the Navy tanker Pecos when it apparently got caught in
a metal safety net and was pulled into the water. The men were
training for a mission to the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven Marines were rescued quickly after the accident, which
occurred about 15 miles off the San Diego shore. But the
23,000-pound copter filled with water and sank about 3,600 feet to
the ocean floor, making rescue of those trapped inside impossible.
Their bodies were recovered by a submersible robot that can dive to
5,000 feet and retrieve objects with mechanical arms.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service for the seven who died was held Dec. 20 at
Camp Pendleton in California.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've noticed that on some TV crime shows, the police refer to
a criminal as a ``skel.'' Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: A dictionary of slang terms spells the word ``skell'' and
defines it as ``a street derelict who also may be a villain.'' The
Dutch ``schelm'' (meaning scoundrel or villain) appears to have
been the root word. According to the dictionary, the term found its
way into English as early as 1611, and was spelled ``skelum.'' It
was revived by New York police as ``skel'' or ``skell'' by the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, Q&AMP;A was settling a bet about the number of
counties in Georgia and Texas. In passing, you mentioned that
Delaware has only three counties. I'm a former Delaware resident,
and I believe the state actually has hundreds. Can you check?
</P>
<P>
   A: This may seem like a word game. Delaware has three counties _
Kent, New Castle and Sussex _ so that reference indeed was correct.
</P>
<P>
   But Delaware also has ``hundreds.'' In fact, it's the only state
with hundreds. But that doesn't refer to the number of counties;
hundreds is the term for the divisions within Delaware's three
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Newton of the Delaware Division of Libraries said the
state has a total of 33 hundreds, with 11 in New Castle, 9 in Kent
and 13 in Sussex.
</P>
<P>
   There are several theories about how the term originated in
Delaware, Newton told Q&AMP;A, but the two most widely accepted are
that it referred to an area of 10 families or 100 people, or to an
area that could supply 100 militiamen. It traces to centuries back
in England, Newton added.
</P>
<P>
   If you're online, check
http://dir.yahoo.com/Regional/USStates/Delaware/ for information or
look at the Delaware entry in World Book Encyclopedia, available at
any library.

 &HT;    LIFE-IN-AMERICA 0316: These ``gals'' love their vets
 &HT;    By Christine Evans
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH. Fla. _ At Emma-N-Kay's Very Cheap and Wonderful
Volunteer Barber Shop in the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, two
special ladies keep the vets looking spiffy.
</P>
<P>
   And every penny in profit goes back to their 'fellas.'
</P>
<P>
   Barber shop profits used to help veterans in need
</P>
<P>
   C'mon in, hon! Take a load off! Doll face, you look adorable,
but what do we do about that mustache?
</P>
<P>
   It's open-up time at the veterans hospital, and the saints with
scissors, as their adoring customers call them, are busy snipping
and singing, and when they're finished, every single fella settled
into the cushiony chairs by the long mirror is gonna be a ``doll''
or a ``lady killer'' or a ``sure shot'' on that job interview.
Because, honey, this ain't just any old barber shop. This is
Emma-N-Kay's place.
</P>
<P>
   Where else can you dance to ``In the Mood'' while you get a
little taken off the sides?
</P>
<P>
   Where else do fellas in wheelchairs line up under an oldfangled
barber pole to book a date with their ``gals''?
</P>
<P>
   Where else do ``two old birds'' _ that's Emma talking, and she's
only 82 _ stand on their feet all day administering $5 haircuts,
then give away every penny of profit ($35,417.84, to be exact) to
the very vets who come in for a snip and an eyebrow clip?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, yeah, sure, as 73-year-old Kay might say in her spunky
Bostonese. Plenty of veterans hospitals have barber shops, don't
they? Yeah, yeah. But they don't have Emma-N-Kay, the saints with
the scissors (and matching blond bouffants), so really, there's no
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearts of gold, these ladies,'' a smitten customer says, after
Emma kisses his bald spot. ``Plus, they promised me hair on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Hello? You haven't been to Emma-N-Kay's Very Cheap and Wonderful
Volunteer Barber Shop on the first floor of the towering, pink
Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Riviera Beach? Your loss, doll.
Because there's a lot of good people in this world, and as Emma
puts it, ``most of 'em are right here, getting their sideburns
trimmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stand in the doorway a moment (the whole place looks as if some
set decorator got hold of it for an old black-and-white), and maybe
you'll get lucky. Maybe Emma will hit the button on the dancing
flowers she keeps on the counter right next to her 1934 operating
license from the Frances School of Beauty Culture, and the flower
pot will play ``In the Mood,'' and Kay will do a little dance as
she hot-curls the hair of a sergeant's wife, and the five-dollar
bills will land like B-17s in the cash register, only to fly out
again to help the vets.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Kay is in the middle of a color job, or Emma is busy
on a client's flat-top, and a doctor or nurse or social worker will
look in the door and say, ``Hey Emma, hey Kay, there's this fella
who needs ... ``
</P>
<P>
   And that's it. That's all it takes. They might do a little
research, put their heads together a bit, and then if the cause is
deemed worthy _ and it usually is, because these are America's vets
we're talking about _ they make a little withdrawal from their
significant reserves at the credit union. The other day, they
kicked in $200 to send veteran amputees on a Colorado ski trip. A
few winters ago, they bought 40 warm coats for homeless vets. And
when a fella needs a special mattress so he can, please God, sleep
one good night through, it's Emma-N-Kay who come up with the
$360-plus.
</P>
<P>
   And how about the vet who had cancer? His whole family got to go
to Disney World at Christmastime, thanks to Emma-N-Kay, and when
the thank-you note came in, on Mickey Mouse stationery, they pinned
it to the bulletin board and wept.
</P>
<P>
   Emma Preffer and Kay Douckas started up the Volunteer Barber
Shop not quite four years ago, after a hospital bigwig admired the
way they cut the hair of an ill veteran friend. They have worked
every Monday and Thursday since, giving $5 haircuts and $20 perms
to vets and spouses and sisters and best friends from Iowa _ some
5,000 heads in all _ pulling in $200 on a good day, and spitting it
right back out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our chance to do something,'' says Emma. Her husband,
Charles, drove a tank in World War II. Came home with heart
trouble. Kay's Frank was a foot soldier. Got two broken legs when a
tank plowed his foxhole. The husbands met after the war, through a
Disabled American Veterans chapter.
</P>
<P>
   The ladies are explaining all this when a gentleman with two
combat tours in Vietnam and two parachute jumps in Korea settles
into one of the comfy chairs and says he would like to put in a
word for the old days, back when patriotism was cool, not smirked
at or ignored. ``I'd like to see people in their 20s and 30s come
out and wave a flag once in a while,'' he says. ``Maybe show up for
a parade and shake a vet's hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite right, say Emma-N-Kay, and around the little shop there is
a collective nod, because there isn't a soul in here who doesn't
feel the same.
</P>
<P>
   Like old pros, which they are, having worked decades in the
beauty business, Emma-N-Kay remember everything _ who got the color
last time, who has the artificial knee, who does not want his
ponytail cut.
</P>
<P>
   They are accompanied in their meticulous pursuits by a
half-dozen volunteers who handle the cash and sweep the floors. And
then there's Jim Diana, a veteran himself who used to own a Chicago
hair salon. He has throat cancer, but even so he drives 38 miles
from Deerfield Beach to help the other vets, the ones without legs,
the ones without families, the ones who have job interviews and are
alight with hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't take my picture,'' says Jim. And what he means is,
``Don't give me too much credit.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a sort of silent ``no self-aggrandizement'' rule in
force in the shop. Around here, you might have fought in the Battle
of the Bulge, but all the other guys fought in something, too, so
wouldn't do to brag about it. It's all for one, and one for all.
</P>
<P>
   And Emma-N-Kay for everybody. ``Oh, my, sweetheart, don't you
look grand!'' Emma says to a fellow who, really, does not look that
grand at all. But he will, when she's finished.
</P>
<P>
   A white-haired POW who was held in German camps during World War
II is wheeled in for a much-needed trim, and Emma gives him a red
blanket because he's cold, and takes up her scissors. The POW has a
son who is going to visit from Texas. He has not seen his boy in a
long, long time, and he has not said a word all afternoon, perhaps
because of nerves, but when Emma finishes him up and brushes the
white leavings from his shoulders, he gives her a little smile and
a $2 tip on the $5 haircut.
</P>
<P>
   A fella might not be able to lift a fork to his lips at
lunchtime, but he sure as hell will find a way to dig into his
pocket to hand the saints a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my, sweetie, thank you!''
</P>
<P>
   Now we know what you are thinking. Emma-N-Kay really ought to
charge more than five bucks a haircut. Yeah, yeah, says Kay. She
knows. They could.
</P>
<P>
   But wouldn't that be a little unpatriotic? Don't our fellas
deserve a break? And so, insists Emma, a glow in her cheeks, a
dance in her step, five dollars it is and always will be, at least
until the year 2010, at which point, they might reevaluate _ but
not retire.
</P>
<P>
   It's close-up time at the V.A. Barber Shop, but never mind,
sweetie pie, because Emma-N-Kay will be back on Monday.

 &HT;    By Christine Evans

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH. Fla. _ At Emma-N-Kay's Very Cheap and Wonderful
Volunteer Barber Shop in the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, two
special ladies keep the vets looking spiffy.
</P>
<P>
   And every penny in profit goes back to their 'fellas.'
</P>
<P>
   Barber shop profits used to help veterans in need
</P>
<P>
   C'mon in, hon! Take a load off! Doll face, you look adorable,
but what do we do about that mustache?
</P>
<P>
   It's open-up time at the veterans hospital, and the saints with
scissors, as their adoring customers call them, are busy snipping
and singing, and when they're finished, every single fella settled
into the cushiony chairs by the long mirror is gonna be a ``doll''
or a ``lady killer'' or a ``sure shot'' on that job interview.
Because, honey, this ain't just any old barber shop. This is
Emma-N-Kay's place.
</P>
<P>
   Where else can you dance to ``In the Mood'' while you get a
little taken off the sides?
</P>
<P>
   Where else do fellas in wheelchairs line up under an oldfangled
barber pole to book a date with their ``gals''?
</P>
<P>
   Where else do ``two old birds'' _ that's Emma talking, and she's
only 82 _ stand on their feet all day administering $5 haircuts,
then give away every penny of profit ($35,417.84, to be exact) to
the very vets who come in for a snip and an eyebrow clip?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, yeah, sure, as 73-year-old Kay might say in her spunky
Bostonese. Plenty of veterans hospitals have barber shops, don't
they? Yeah, yeah. But they don't have Emma-N-Kay, the saints with
the scissors (and matching blond bouffants), so really, there's no
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearts of gold, these ladies,'' a smitten customer says, after
Emma kisses his bald spot. ``Plus, they promised me hair on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Hello? You haven't been to Emma-N-Kay's Very Cheap and Wonderful
Volunteer Barber Shop on the first floor of the towering, pink
Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Riviera Beach? Your loss, doll.
Because there's a lot of good people in this world, and as Emma
puts it, ``most of 'em are right here, getting their sideburns
trimmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stand in the doorway a moment (the whole place looks as if some

   RAVES _ ATLANTA _ The face of the youth counterculture of 2000
can be seen at free-form parties called raves. Raves have been
around for awhile, but they've gone from spontaneous, semi-private
affairs to a full-fledged scene, promoted openly and held in venues
like the Tabernacle and the Atrium. Sometimes thousands attend, to
take in the thumping techno vibe, do drugs and interact
spontaneously, giving and taking massages from strangers, and
flailing on the ``dance'' floor. It's a turn-on, drop-out hippie
scene, minus the politics, plus technology (the techno music and
cyber networking). Another way to look at it: The anti-Buckhead
party scene, which draws 15- to 30-year-olds from all over the
area, and all over the South. (Harris, Atlanta

   RAVES _ ATLANTA _ The face of the youth counterculture of 2000
can be seen at free-form parties called raves. Raves have been
around for awhile, but they've gone from spontaneous, semi-private
affairs to a full-fledged scene, promoted openly and held in venues
like the Tabernacle and the Atrium. Sometimes thousands attend, to
take in the thumping techno vibe, do drugs and interact
spontaneously, giving and taking massages from strangers, and
flailing on the ``dance'' floor. It's a turn-on, drop-out hippie
scene, minus the politics, plus technology (the techno music and
cyber networking). Another way to look at it: The anti-Buckhead
party scene, which draws 15- to 30-year-olds from all over the
area, and all over the South. (Harris, Atlanta

BORDER MOVES RAISE FEARS IN GEORGIA OF CHECHNYA CONFLICT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND THOMAS W. HAINES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHATILI, Georgia _ The battered shells of a bus, two flatbed
trucks and a bullet-ridden Mercedes lie abandoned in this mile-high
gorge that snakes through the towering, snowcapped peaks of the
Caucasus mountains.
</P>
<P>
   This rugged landscape, on Georgia's border with the
scorched-earth combat zone that is Chechnya, is the battlefield of
another high-risk conflict, a war of nerves with potentially
explosive implications for a region where the United States and
Russia are maneuvering for influence and strategic strength.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Argun Gorge, Russian paratroopers have closed a
single-lane dirt road that connects Chechnya with Georgia. Russia
described the action as an effort to seal an escape route for
Chechen separatist militants while the army tries to wipe out
remaining rebel bands in the foothills to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is trying to strengthen a decade of independence from
Moscow by moving closer to the West. The Russian troops loom as a
threat that the war could spill over into Georgia. Such a
development would threaten this post-Soviet country's fragile
sovereignty, and cast doubt on lucrative, US-backed gas and oil
pipeline deals Georgia badly needs to revive its economy.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Georgian and Russian troops patrol high bluffs
separated by a neutral zone of a few hundred yards formed by the
sweeping canyon cut by the Argun River. They watch each other with
high-powered binoculars, and scan the area for rebel infiltrators.
Russian warplanes occasionally buzz through Georgian airspace,
dropping mines on suspected paths and firing on the Chechens
risking the snowy passage.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy fighting in the gorge and the harsh winter conditions in
the mountains have combined to trap tens of thousands of Chechens
on the Russian side of the border. Only several thousand refugees
have crossed into Georgia, a trickle compared to the 250,000 who
have sought refuge within Russia. The wrecked cars serve as a
warning that the Russians will shoot at anything that moves on the
gorge road.
</P>
<P>
   But in a few weeks, when spring comes, the snow will melt and
the trees will provide leafy, green cover for refugees to cross
from Chechnya into Georgia through dozens of footpaths. The Russian
troops cannot watch them all, and its air force cannot mine all the
paths.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, there are two fears: That there
will be more refugees than this impoverished country, already
divided by two separatist conflicts of its own, can afford to take
in; and that rebel fighters will enter Georgia along with the
civilians, followed by the Russian army.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions have tested the formidable diplomatic skills of
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, known in the West as the
former Soviet foreign minister who helped bring down the Iron
Curtain in the late 1980s. Shevardnadze has ordered his country's
border with Russia closed, and negotiated the presence of an
unarmed, nine-person contingent from the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe to observe the border.
</P>
<P>
   Shevardnadze, 77, running for reelection on April 9, bluntly
rules out Chechens, or Russians, crossing into Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible that it will happen, because Georgia is an
independent state and it can control its own border,'' Shevardnadze
told reporters in Tbilisi on Monday. ``And whoever will violate it
will be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   In private, Shevardnadze supporters are not so confident. To
guard the mountainous, 50-mile stretch against rebel infiltration
would require a force much larger than the small detachment of
border guards in Shatili.
</P>
<P>
   And to prevent the Russians from crossing is ``impossible,''
according to Revaz Adamia, a senior member of the Georgian
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Western observers doubt the OSCE presence would stop a Russian
advance to crush the rebels. And some Georgian observers suggested
that Russia is purposely pushing the rebels into Georgia to provide
an excuse to invade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia's leader is someone capable of provoking and esclating
tensions,'' said Georgian lawmaker Irakly Batiashvili. He was
referring to Russia's acting president, Vladimir Putin, who has
parlayed his hard-line stand on the war into an almost certain
victory in the presidential vote March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and other Russian leaders have charged that Georgia is
aiding the rebels by providing them sanctuary and supply routes out
of their landlocked homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia seeks every opportunity to increase its influence over
Georgia,'' said Georgy Khutsishvili, director of the International
Center on Conflict and Negotiations in Tbilisi. ``It takes a very
delicate approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is negotiating a US-backed pipeline project that would
carry billions of dollars worth of Caspian Sea oil toward Europe
without passing through Russia. Shevardnadze has sought US and
European military and economic support, stating Georgia hopes to
apply for membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in
2005.
</P>
<P>
   But before this can happen, there is another problem: what to do
with the Russian military bases still in the country. Russia in
November agreed to remove them within the next few years, but
Georgians will believe that when they see it.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia still depends greatly on Russia, its largest trading
partner. Russian peacekeepers monitor the border with the
separatist Georgian province of Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way is flexibility, and Shevardnadze understands that
quite well,'' said Gotcha Tskitishvili, who runs a political
polling firm in Tbilisi. ``It is a dangerous dance between two or
three superpowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Shevardnadze is skilled at the dance, but his government has
lost popular trust by failing to provide even heat and electricity.
A drive through the Georgian countryside outside Tbilisi reveals
entire regions that live by candlelight.
</P>
<P>
   In Tbilisi, the situation is only slightly better. Only
kindergartens, government buildings, hospitals and the five-star
hotel, where foreign visitors like to stay, have regular
electricity. So do residents who have found a way to bribe corrupt
energy officials. Each evening, diesel-fuel generators hum outside
the crumbling palaces that make up central Tbilisi, providing light
for the stores that occupy ground floors.
</P>
<P>
   Most people assume powerful crime groups are stealing
electricity, and that Shevardnadze is either too weak, or too
unwilling, to stop it, Khutsishvili says.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity is only the most tangible evidence of corruption
that spreads through all areas of daily life. Even border officials
were taking huge bribes from refugees from Chechnya who made it
into Georgia when the road in the Argun gorge was open. Other
Georgian officials have been accused by Russia of helping to arm
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Such charges are bound to increase when the spring comes.
Already, the tensions are evident in another icy gorge leading up
to the Chechen border, 40 miles east of Shatili. Here, in three
rough-hewn villages along the Alazania River long inhabited by
ethnic Chechens, 7,000 refugees jokingly refer to the area as ``the
only Chechnya we have left.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees here say more people will come as soon as the passes
open, rather than face detention, or worse, by Russian security
forces. Every day, someone up here receives news of the deaths of
family members in areas occupied by the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that rebels may try to infiltrate the region, Georgian
security forces have set up a roadblock, where officers search
anyone traveling the only highway to Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has frequently stated that as many as 1,500 rebels are
hiding out in the gorge. Last week, a Russian Su-25 attack bomber
appeared, making several low, threatening passes over the villages
before flying off across the Caucasus to the Chechen side of the
border.

ZIMBABWE WOES ERODE IDEALS FOR EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe _ Twenty years ago, President Robert Mugabe
ushered in Zimbabwe's independence with a promise to make quality
education free and available to all the country's children. He
succeeded. Within five years, Zimbabwe's school system became the
envy of Africa. Literacy soared.
</P>
<P>
   But as this southern African state slides deeper into its worst
economic and political crisis, Mugabe's government is shedding its
dedication to universal education, and Zimbabwe's early gains in
the classroom are being lost. Education is no longer free. Schools
are crumbling. Teachers are leaving the country, lured to better
jobs in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   Dropout rates, meanwhile, are climbing. Amid rising food prices
and rampant unemployment, poor parents are increasingly apt to send
their children to scrounge for work or food rather than to sit in
front of blackboards. Those who are rich enough are making
contingency plans to emigrate _ or at least to send their children
abroad to study.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got independence, the thrust was education. Throughout
the region, it was no secret that Zimbabwe offered by far the best
education, both in quality and quantity,'' said Peter Mabande, head
of the Zimbabwe Teachers' Association. ``Now people question why
the government did a turnaround on education. They were told it was
the passport to the good life. But in an economic crisis as we
have, parents might ask: `If my child is not doing well, why
continue?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe made two promises when he came to power: land reform and
universal education. The country's most arable lands were held by a
relatively small group of white commercial farmers. Schools were
grossly imbalanced according to race. The minority government of
Rhodesia, as Zimbabwe was known then, ensured white children
received excellent instruction, but neglected black schools.
</P>
<P>
   The two issues have followed different arcs since 1980, but both
now lie at the center of a political crisis as the country heads
toward parliamentary elections scheduled for April 29 and 30,
widely considered Zimbabwe's most important ballot since
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The war for liberation was fought over land. But agriculture is
the backbone of Zimbabwe's economy, and once in office, Mugabe
quietly made a deal with the white commercial farmers to leave them
alone if they helped keep the country afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Education reforms came fast on the heels of independence.
Schools were opened to all children, free of charge. Enrollment in
secondary schools nationwide rose by 700 percent between 1980 and
1985. Today, 90 percent of men are literate, according to
government figures, as are 82 percent of women.
</P>
<P>
   Despite early gains, however, several factors slowly eroded the
quality of education, as well as access to it. From the outset,
schools in high-density, low-income suburbs were forced to run two
half-day sessions to accommodate all students. In 1983, to further
ease overcrowding, the government decreed that all students must
advance whether or not they pass their classes. Standards slipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first five years after independence, students strove
hard to pass,'' said Solomon Rusirevi, a high school geography
teacher who was a pupil at that time. Liberation motivated people,
he said. ``Now, the future looks bleak. The educated ones can't
find job and the young are losing interest. There is a high rise in
social vices: boys in gangs, girls on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   The real difficulties, however, started in the 1990s. Facing
worsening economic conditions, the government accepted
belt-tightening measures under the International Monetary Fund. In
1992 southern Africa suffered its worst drought in a century. A
second drought followed in 1995. ``When agriculture sneezes, the
whole economy coughs,'' Mabande said.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the impact of economic structural adjustment,
drought, and an annual population growth of 3 percent, the
government was forced to abandon free universal education in 1996.
For the first time, parents were forced to pay school fees,
resulting, over time, in a serious discrepancy between the quality
of education in rural and urban schools.
</P>
<P>
   The past three years have been the worst. A worldwide tobacco
glut, economic mismanagement, corruption, and Mugabe's costly
participation in the war in Congo have created a foreign currency
crisis in Zimbabwe. Unemployment and inflation hover in the high
double-digits. The government cannot buy fuel or electricity, let
alone maintain school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are experiencing at the moment one of the hardest times
ever in terms of a projected future,'' said Matson Hlahlo,
president of the Affirmative Action Group, a promoter of small
black business. ``We expected the government to deliver
empowerment. But nothing is moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Educators like Mabande and Rusirevi fear that Zimbabwe's
education system is crumbling beyond repair. Last year, Rusirevi
had no textbooks for his students and no maps to help in his
geography lessons. Schools rely on student fees and additional
levies, but dropout rates are climbing as the economy worsens and
more families cope with AIDS. While about 5,000 new qualified
teachers enter the job market each year, Mabande estimates, only 10
percent take jobs. Many are lured to other countries, leaving
Zimbabwean classrooms in the hands of unqualified or underqualified
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Ilan Elkaim is a parent trying to chart the best course of
education for his children. Late last year, his 16-year-old
daughter took a series of standardized exams determining whether
she could continue onward through the final years of pre-university
schooling. The first two months of this year were tense, but not
because Elkaim wasn't confident in his daughter's abilities.
Rather, the government failed to pay the the board that corrects
the exams, even though parents were required to pay for the testing
service before the exams.
</P>
<P>
   The government and the board reached an undisclosed agreement in
late February, allowing students in Zimbabwe to learn their
results. Elkaim's daughter passed, but now he faces a new worry.
Next year his daughter will take college admission exams. Given
Zimbabwe's current economic crisis, he fears the government will
fail to meet its obligations again, and she won't be able to
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Elkaim is fortunate. He owns a textile factory, so he has means,
and he is married to an American, so he can emigrate. He says
people in his position are putting aside funds to pay the board
directly if the government falters.
</P>
<P>
   But in a country that once served as a model in Africa, it
saddens Elkaim to see the dream of universal education dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear is not so much what has happened up until now, but
what will happen in the future,'' he said. ``Parents would have to
source foreign exchange themselves to pay for the marking of their
children's exams. The rich will get recognition, the poor will not.
From the point of view of equality, which is what our schools are
supposed to offer, this is a huge problem.''

Vietnamese restaurant in Washington, has made contributions to this
column. Everyone loves her food. She has a light touch and sure
hand with seasonings, especially those from her native Vietnam. She
has lived in the United States for a long time and knows what
appeals to our palates.

   Today's recipe for grilled fish with greens is her take on
fusion cooking. In the original the fish is grilled outside, lots
of oil is poured over it after cooking and then it is topped with
lots of greens.

   The original recipe calls for much more oil than would ever fit
into the theme of this column, but after a few experiments I
discovered that a very reasonable facsimile could be concocted
without all the oil.
</P>
<P>
   For the recipe not only must you have the freshest fish but also
sprightly greens full of flavor because most of the flavor of the
dish comes from the greens.
</P>
<P>
   And since asparagus season is coming shortly _ California
asparagus is already on the market in abundance _ in keeping with
the spring green theme, asparagus has been combined with pasta for
the vegetable and starch dish.
</P>
<P>
   I have used a form of pasta _ pearl pasta _ that may not be
readily available. It looks a little like large whole tapioca.
Pearl pasta has a very appealing texture, but if you cannot find it
use some other small pasta like orzo.
</P>
<P>

MICROSOFT TO BACK A BROWSER KEYWORD SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By AMY HARMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ Microsoft Corp. is throwing its considerable
weight behind a keyword system that aims to enable Internet users
to navigate the Web without typing in the cumbersome addresses
known as URLs.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, developed by RealNames Corp. of Redwood City,
Calif., allows Web users to type in the name of a company or
product and go to the site of the entity that has paid RealNames to
lock up that keyword.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, company officials said Monday, Microsoft
will take a 20 percent equity stake in RealNames, which has filed
for an initial public offering of its stock. Microsoft's chief
executive, Steve Ballmer, is expected to make the announcement at
PC Forum, the annual technology conference here sponsored by
Edventure Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   RealNames charges large corporations $100,000 to $300,000 a year
to license a keyword, and 10 cents to $1 per visit generated. Small
businesses can buy a keyword for $100 a year.
</P>
<P>
   At least for now, the system also refers users in many cases to
the most likely result, even if the keyword has not been purchased
_ for example, Apple Computer if the word ``apple'' alone is typed.
Typing in generic terms like ``pizza''generates a list of search
results.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months Microsoft has incorporated the technology into
its Internet Explorer browser. It will now do so with its MSN
online service as well, enabling it to compete more effectively
with America Online, which has long used its own keyword system
within its proprietary network.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape Navigator, the other popular Web browser, which is
owned by America Online, does not use the RealNames keyword system,
but the deal with Microsoft does not prevent AOL from adopting the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The RealNames system includes an elaborate tracking scheme that
the company says allows it to measure the effectiveness of offline
advertisements that mention the keyword, and to share that
information with its customers. RealNames hopes keywords will
replace domain name addresses and 800 numbers in print and
television advertising. AltaVista, Inktomi and the Go Network are
among the Internet companies using the system.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Dyson, the host of the conference here, said that using
keywords would be a welcome new way to surf the Web. ``It's a very
nice concept,'' she said. ``There are lots of different ways to get
to URLs, and this is one of them. The world needs more creative
navigation interfaces. It needs point and click, it needs
pictorgrams.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added that just as with the system of allocating domain
names, which is being opened up to competition, there is a
potential danger of a keyword monopoly. ( Dyson is the chairman of
the group that is overseeing the new domain name system, but she
did not speak in that capacity because the organization works by
consensus and only sets policies for the domain system.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that they've done a deal with Microsoft, that obviously
puts them in a much stronger position,'' she said. ``Clearly, as
long as people have alternatives there are no issues, but when
people don't have alternatives, there are.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It's that time again. On Feb. 15, the Oscar nominations were
announced. Suddenly, five women underwent more stylistic scrutiny
than any supermodel or society girl ever has.
</P>
<P>
   Designers in New York, Milan, Paris and Los Angeles dropped what
they were doing to take note of these ladies, who are suddenly
Fashion's Most Desirable _ at least until March 27.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? One of these candidates could emerge as the next
Gwyneth Paltrow, a celebrity who gets as much attention for her
talent as she does for her sense of style. After all, it's not a
bad runway to show off the new trends for evening: only about a
billion people will be watching.
</P>
<P>
   No designer worth his or her sequins could ever hope for better
product placement _ a dress on an Oscar nominee is better than
having a commercial on the Superbowl.
</P>
<P>
   But will the first Oscar ceremony of the new millennium be any
different than the usual frenzied parade of ballgowns?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the worst things,'' Tom Ford notes, ``is seeing a dress
wear an actress rather an actress wear a dress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger,'' says noted New York celebrity hairdresser John
Sahag, ``is that in looking glamourous, many actresses end up
looking old fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   I decided to take a poll of fashion experts _ the designers,
hair stylists, makeup artists, clothing stylists, retailers and top
fashion editors _ to see what advice they can offer this new Top
Five.
</P>
<P>
   Some liked the challenge of glamming up the more serious
actresses, like Janet McTeer, Meryl Streep and Annette Bening.
``I'd love to see them in classic looks, sort of modernized Grace
Kelly,'' offers Jeanine Lobell, creator of Stila Cosmetics and a
veteran of Oscar makeup. ``If women like that do too much and get
too trendy, it's hard to pull off.''
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone agrees with Barneys New York creative director
Simon Doonan, who says: ``The general consensus is, it's time for
something new!'' That means no more ballgowns, beaded sweater sets,
evening separates, too-tight clothes, and death to the pastel
pashmina. But what else do Oscar fashionistas have up their silken
sleeves?
</P>
<P>
   Here, some pointers from the pros.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANNETTE BENING, for ``American Beauty'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's always had the body and the swagger to wear anything, but
Annette Bening is loyal to one man: Giorgio Armani. She usually
wears a black column dress or black evening tuxedo. This year, she
has another requirement: on March 26, she'll be nine months
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   DONNA KARAN: ``I want to dress Annette Bening. I like the red
evening column with a draped neckline that was a knockout on our
fall runway. I can seriously see Annette Bening in this, in either
the red or the black. I love dressing her. I think she has stature
_ divine! She is an American beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Even though I have not seen all the movies and I'm
not familiar with all the actresses, I believe Annette Bening has
an amazing and perfect American style.''
</P>
<P>
   AMY SPINDLER, New York Times Magazine: ``Annette Bening pretty
much always wears Armani. She's like the first lady of Hollywood
and she should dress like a first lady.
</P>
<P>
   PAMELA DENNIS: ``I love Annette, but I heard she's not going
because of the pregnancy. She's a classic beauty. Between her,
Julianne Moore and Hilary Swank, you can't do better than those
three. Not only do I respect them as artists, they also have
amazing bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   VERA WANG: ``In all fairness to Annette Bening, she's been
pregnant for eight months and she still managed to look elegant at
the Golden Globes. But I don't think for her it's a year she'll be
making a major fashion statement.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Annette likes Escada. I'd suggest
something cashmere. Maybe Randolph Duke. They're pretty, they're
comfy, they're sexy. I did one for Cindy Crawford when she was
pregnant. Thank God we're not in the days of having to hide it any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   CAROL SHAW, makeup artist, did Bening's makeup for the recent
Vanity Fair cover: ``I think she's just naturally luminescent. I
would do her either very understated or with a shiny red lip. Very
Old Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   SALLY HERSHBERGER, hairstylist: ``She always looks great, but
I'd like to freshen up Annette Bening's look a little. I'd brighten
up her color and smooth her short hair into an Audrey Hepburn-type
of style.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``I'd like to see her with
chin-length hair, with lots of layers. She needs slightly more
volume and movement in her hair. She's very, very sexy, but with
hair that's too extreme _ too short, too full. I'd also like to see
more of an amber-copper mix with her color. I'd also give her long
bangs.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Annette Bening dresses older than she
is. She wears Armani and Escada, and it's not the designs, her
choices are a little matronly. She doesn't have a typical face. Her
hair is too big. This is a woman who is more unique looking. She's
very sexy yet she doesn't dress sexy at all. I wish she would. She
has a great capacity for seduction.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JULIANNE MOORE, for ``The End of the Affair'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore always manages to set off those amazing red locks
with of-the-moment looks _ by Prada, Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, Ralph Lauren
_ without ever looking too fashiony or contrived. She walks the
line between fashionable and subtle without ever falling on her
heels.
</P>
<P>
   TOM FORD: ``Julianne Moore has the greatest style. I'd love to
dress her.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Julianne Moore is sexy and glamorous and she's the
one I'm most curious about.''
</P>
<P>
   TOMMY HILFIGER: ``I think Julianne Moore looks very good in
casual. I'd like to see her in our leather jeans and a cashmere
turtleneck.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``I'd put Julianne Moore in a simple dress in a
vivid color, perhaps violet to play off her red hair. She's so
alluring and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   HEIDI WEISEL: ``I have a beautiful brown cashmere dress in the
collection that would look great with Julianne Moore's red hair and
white skin. She should wear something fitted and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``For me, Julianne Moore is the
ultimate. You don't see many redheads on the screen. I would keep
her hair long, at about collarbone length, but I'd give it a bit of
angle between the cheekbone and jaws, with some long wispy layers
for movement. Her color is awesome _ I wouldn't change a thing
there.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Julianne Moore is an example of the perfect
redhead. She should always stay with the reds, but I would play
with red seasonally on her _ for a winter show like the Academy
Awards, I'd make her a rich auburn, and in the summer, I'd do a
gorgeous strawberry shade.''
</P>
<P>
   JAMES PURCELL: ``We need to get her to look more like a
glamorous actress than a Gucci ad. I would put Moore in something
neither over-the-top nor overly beaded, but simple and elegant with
a more dramatic hairstyle.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Of all the actresses nominated for
Best Actress, Julianne Moore likes clothes the most. She wears
Prada and Ralph and looks that are very simple. However, when Moore
wore a Ralph Lauren gown, the back was cut too close to the sides.
But she's very savvy not to wear looks that are too billowy or too
full. She always looks fuller than she is.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Julianne Moore could go vintage. She
could look great in a Henry James dress. I would suggest she go to
Galliano. She should have major impact on the red carpet. She's
just so beautiful. She should do a Victorian Henry James look.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JANET MCTEER, for ``Tumbleweeds'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1-inch British actress and Tony Award winner (for ``A
Doll's House'' on Broadway in 1997) is an enigma to designers but
says that what she'll wear to the Oscars is at the bottom of her
priority list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure somebody will come up with something nice for me to
wear,'' she said recently. ``I wore all British things to the
Golden Globes. Or I could be the first woman to wear pants to the
Oscars. But you don't often get to wear a really fancy frock in
your life, do you? So bring on the fancy frocks. I do hope all the
designers come calling. Stand in line, matey!''
</P>
<P>
   VERA WANG: ``Somebody I'd like to see make an effort is Janet
McTeer, because she's so sensual and so sexy in that film, and
she's someone who could look even better at the Academy Awards. She
has an incredibly sensual body. At the Golden Globes, she looked
like she wanted to escape it. I'm thinking something minimal but
beautifully cut, sophisticated and sensual.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Janet McTeer is a British actress who
blew everybody off the map when she did `A Doll's House.' She's a
very full-shaped lady, and tall, and designers should be aware of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Janet McTeer needs to do something dramatic for
the Oscars, because a lot of us don't know her well. If she does
something really different, it'll make everyone wake up and say `Oh
my God, that's her?' I'd cut her hair _ which is too long, by the
way _ very short, and I'd bleach it beige. Then I'd do a beige gown
and taupe lips. Then, I guarantee, everyone would be talking about
her after the show because she'd look so fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Janet McTeer is a very handsome
woman. She wore a twin set with a skirt with a bit of a dramatic
train to the Golden Globes. For an English woman, she looked
fantastic. She shouldn't try to upstage herself if she did well at
the Golden Globes. She looked very handsome.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN BARRETT, hairstylist: ``Janet has a stunning face. I styled
her for the Golden Globes, and I brought out her face, using her
hair as an accessory. I also added a little red to her hair. I'd
like to see her do something similar for the Academy Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA PASTER, stylist: ``The woman has so much presence. I'd
love to see her in something by Oscar de la Renta _ she's so
statuesque.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILLIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Someone like Janet McTeer, she's
waiting to be discovered. With her I would go with a beautiful
Badgley Mischka or Randolph Duke. She doesn't have to be
unpredictable. I love the fact that she's not a young starlet or an
older actress. I don't see her in something sexy, sexy. Maybe
Valentino or Armani. They're going through the Valentino archives.
I'm waiting for the sketches. Maybe something from the '40s. Or
there are some really great things from Chanel Couture. I could see
her in something fresh and spring-like.''
</P>
<P>
   ART LUNA, hairstylist: ``English women have these weird hairdos.
She would look so great with a short haircut. She has a
great-looking neck, that beautiful length that so many women don't
have. I'd do even a low ponytail with hair extensions at the nape,
emphasize the face and neck. That English look is such stoic
beauty. The more you add, the worse it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MERYL STREEP, for ``Music of the Heart'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is Streep's 12th Academy Awards nomination, which makes her
the most nominated female ever, tying with Katherine Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Meryl may have every bit as much talent as Hepburn _ but
if only she had half as much style. Maybe after 11 times at the
Oscars she'll finally get it right. As Tom Ford reiterated, ``Meryl
Streep may be brilliant, but fashionwise, she needs a little
help.''
</P>
<P>
   DONNA KARAN: ``I love Meryl,'' said the designer, scanning the
racks in her showroom for an example of the look she would
prescribe. She pulled out a turtleneck dress and declared it right,
with a few alterations: ``Just simple and beautiful, down to the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Meryl Streep is above and beyond fashion and her
style matches her personality: warm, elegant and superior.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Meryl Streep should go with
something very classic. She should do the Park Avenue Matron look
and wear a marvelous twin set, maybe an embroidered and embellished
sweater and full skirt, preferably Oscar de la Renta.''
</P>
<P>
   AMY SPINDLER, New York Times Magazine: ``Meryl Streep should
wear Michael Kors. It plays up to her sexiness. She's been playing
it down and needs to play it up. Or, she should wear Celine. Her
hair should be over one eye. Kors knows how to give the ladies of a
certain age some confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ART LUNA, hairstylist: ``I'd like Meryl Streep to cut her hair
off a bit, something off the shoulders, short around her face. Not
anything fancy, not extremely trendy. Something along the way of
very chic, above the shoulder. Then the weight line would be at the
right length.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Meryl Streep's been looking heavier. I
hope she'll be a little more glamorous at the Oscars. You don't
want her to look like the mother of the bride. I'd love to try
something a little corsety: emphasize the cleavage, suck in the
waist, push up the breasts. I rarely do black, but in this case I
might.''
</P>
<P>
   PAMELA DENNIS: ``I always wanted to dress Meryl Streep because I
respect her so much as an actress. She hasn't come off as sexy
lately, but I think she can be classy and sexy at the same time.''
For Streep, Dennis suggested a beaded white robe with pants.
</P>
<P>
   RANDOLPH DUKE: ``I'd liven up her look with a tailored jacket
and a wonderful skirt. I've spent time on the red carpet and I've
seen photographers and journalists clamoring for a quote from
Portia de Rossi, when Meryl Streep comes in and no one pays
attention to the greatest actress of our time. That's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   HEIDI WEISEL: ``Meryl Streep is a great actress, but I think she
could use a little help in the fashion department. I'd love to make
her look glamorous and beautiful in a black strapless gown with an
A-line skirt.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Of all the nominees, she's the one
that I'd most like to make over. First, I'd give her shorter hair _
something about chin length, keeping the ends soft and sexy,
something with a little volume so it's not just stuck to her head.
I'd keep her as a blonde, but give her some brighter highlights for
some depth.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Meryl Streep is the USA's perfect blonde. She can
wear any color blonde. If I were coloring her, I'd do a dark blonde
base with lighter tones in front and a little darker in back _ sort
of a surfer-girl shade. Her hair is too long right now.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``I suggest a look that's clean and simple and
something she's comfortable with, even if it's not fabulous. She
should look like herself. At this point, it doesn't matter what she
wears.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Meryl Streep is the one who needs the
most help. I don't think she cares enough. Maybe she should wear
Oscar de la Renta. He doesn't sacrifice a woman's elegance while
trying to make them look modern.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HILARY SWANK, for ``Boys Don't Cry'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's this year's Oscar It Girl, with all the dream elements a
designer's looking for: tall, thin, hip, stylish, great looking,
has talent _ and a good bet to win.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Karl Lagerfeld, Donatella Versace and Tom Ford have put
her on the ``Must Dress'' list. As InStyle's Hal Rubenstein puts
it: ``Hilary Swank will be drowning in dresses.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Hilary Swank has the greatest style.
She set the tone at the Golden Globes in a black Versace, and it
was a major coup for her and for Versace. She should stick with the
tried-and-true formula.''
</P>
<P>
   SIMON DOONAN, Barneys New York: ``It would be great if Hilary
Swank wore Comme des Garcons, or better yet, vintage Comme des
Garcons! My advice for the Oscars is vintage, vintage, vintage.
Hilary Swank could wear something vintage like a Dior `New Look'
dress.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Hilary Swank is changing her look so as not to be
framed with the character of her movie. I know her well _ she
attended my couture show in Paris and I'm happy to help her
again.''
</P>
<P>
   RANDOLPH DUKE: ``I would pick Hilary Swank (to dress), because
she'll get the most attention _ and this is no secret _ it's all
about who will get the most attention.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTINA PERRIN: ``I think Hilary Swank has the most fantastic
body and that beautiful short, cropped hair. She should wear
something very sleek and dark red.''
</P>
<P>
   CAROLINA HERRERA: ``I would like to see Hilary Swank in
something different beside a slinky embroidered dress. A red
strapless dress would be beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``Although Hilary Swank glammed it up in Versace
Couture at the Golden Globes, I think she should wear a satin
tuxedo for a feminine/masculine play. I don't really want to see
her in a ballgown or a long dress.''
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA PASTER, veteran Oscar and Hollywood stylist: ``I have
the thrill of dressing Hilary for the Oscars this year! I think
she's our young Mia Farrow, with a sensuality about her that's the
girl next door with a little edge. I am thinking about color this
time. The Golden Globes was Hilary's first time out. I predict
she's gonna have a little more fun at the Academy Awards. We're not
married to one designer.''
</P>
<P>
   JEANINE LOBELL, Stila Cosmetics and veteran Oscar makeup artist:
``I'd like to work on Hilary Swank. I just like the way she looks
and I think that she doesn't need a lot of makeup. She's the kind
of person you'd put one thing on _ a little eye or a little lip _
she's not someone you'd like to paint everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN SAHAG, hairstylist: ``Hilary Swank's hair looks like it's
growing out from the film. I definitely think that now that she
finished her movie she could go back to being feminine: grow the
sides, fringe, and back out, and go for something messier and more
tousled. I think that would be a nice contrast for the public to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Hilary should consciously play
against the androgyny we've seen of her to show her versatility.
I'd take her hair a little longer. I'd also give her soft bangs
that she could brush to the side, and layer her hair a bit on top
for volume. I'd also like to see her with some caramel highlights;
they'd give her hair a little sparkle and make it a little more
electric.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS, celebrity colorist, Avon Centre: ``Because she
played a boy in `Boys Don't Cry,' I'd tell her to arrive at the
Oscars totally femmed out _ big red lips, honey-colored hair,
something really high gloss, high glam. I'd dress her in a gorgeous
Badgley Mischka dress and get Kevyn Aucoin or Laura Mercier to do
really glamorous makeup on her.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It's that time again. On Feb. 15, the Oscar nominations were
announced. Suddenly, five women underwent more stylistic scrutiny
than any supermodel or society girl ever has.
</P>
<P>
   Designers in New York, Milan, Paris and Los Angeles dropped what
they were doing to take note of these ladies, who are suddenly
Fashion's Most Desirable _ at least until March 27.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? One of these candidates could emerge as the next
Gwyneth Paltrow, a celebrity who gets as much attention for her
talent as she does for her sense of style. After all, it's not a
bad runway to show off the new trends for evening: only about a
billion people will be watching.
</P>
<P>
   No designer worth his or her sequins could ever hope for better
product placement _ a dress on an Oscar nominee is better than
having a commercial on the Superbowl.
</P>
<P>
   But will the first Oscar ceremony of the new millennium be any
different than the usual frenzied parade of ballgowns?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the worst things,'' Tom Ford notes, ``is seeing a dress
wear an actress rather an actress wear a dress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger,'' says noted New York celebrity hairdresser John
Sahag, ``is that in looking glamourous, many actresses end up
looking old fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   I decided to take a poll of fashion experts _ the designers,
hair stylists, makeup artists, clothing stylists, retailers and top
fashion editors _ to see what advice they can offer this new Top
Five.
</P>
<P>
   Some liked the challenge of glamming up the more serious
actresses, like Janet McTeer, Meryl Streep and Annette Bening.
``I'd love to see them in classic looks, sort of modernized Grace
Kelly,'' offers Jeanine Lobell, creator of Stila Cosmetics and a
veteran of Oscar makeup. ``If women like that do too much and get
too trendy, it's hard to pull off.''
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone agrees with Barneys New York creative director
Simon Doonan, who says: ``The general consensus is, it's time for
something new!'' That means no more ballgowns, beaded sweater sets,
evening separates, too-tight clothes, and death to the pastel
pashmina. But what else do Oscar fashionistas have up their silken
sleeves?
</P>
<P>
   Here, some pointers from the pros.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANNETTE BENING, for ``American Beauty'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's always had the body and the swagger to wear anything, but
Annette Bening is loyal to one man: Giorgio Armani. She usually
wears a black column dress or black evening tuxedo. This year, she
has another requirement: on March 26, she'll be nine months
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   DONNA KARAN: ``I want to dress Annette Bening. I like the red
evening column with a draped neckline that was a knockout on our
fall runway. I can seriously see Annette Bening in this, in either
the red or the black. I love dressing her. I think she has stature
_ divine! She is an American beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Even though I have not seen all the movies and I'm
not familiar with all the actresses, I believe Annette Bening has
an amazing and perfect American style.''
</P>
<P>
   AMY SPINDLER, New York Times Magazine: ``Annette Bening pretty
much always wears Armani. She's like the first lady of Hollywood
and she should dress like a first lady.
</P>
<P>
   PAMELA DENNIS: ``I love Annette, but I heard she's not going
because of the pregnancy. She's a classic beauty. Between her,
Julianne Moore and Hilary Swank, you can't do better than those
three. Not only do I respect them as artists, they also have
amazing bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   VERA WANG: ``In all fairness to Annette Bening, she's been
pregnant for eight months and she still managed to look elegant at
the Golden Globes. But I don't think for her it's a year she'll be
making a major fashion statement.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Annette likes Escada. I'd suggest
something cashmere. Maybe Randolph Duke. They're pretty, they're
comfy, they're sexy. I did one for Cindy Crawford when she was
pregnant. Thank God we're not in the days of having to hide it any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   CAROL SHAW, makeup artist, did Bening's makeup for the recent
Vanity Fair cover: ``I think she's just naturally luminescent. I
would do her either very understated or with a shiny red lip. Very
Old Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   SALLY HERSHBERGER, hairstylist: ``She always looks great, but
I'd like to freshen up Annette Bening's look a little. I'd brighten
up her color and smooth her short hair into an Audrey Hepburn-type
of style.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``I'd like to see her with
chin-length hair, with lots of layers. She needs slightly more
volume and movement in her hair. She's very, very sexy, but with
hair that's too extreme _ too short, too full. I'd also like to see
more of an amber-copper mix with her color. I'd also give her long
bangs.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Annette Bening dresses older than she
is. She wears Armani and Escada, and it's not the designs, her
choices are a little matronly. She doesn't have a typical face. Her
hair is too big. This is a woman who is more unique looking. She's
very sexy yet she doesn't dress sexy at all. I wish she would. She
has a great capacity for seduction.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JULIANNE MOORE, for ``The End of the Affair'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore always manages to set off those amazing red locks
with of-the-moment looks _ by Prada, Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, Ralph Lauren
_ without ever looking too fashiony or contrived. She walks the
line between fashionable and subtle without ever falling on her
heels.
</P>
<P>
   TOM FORD: ``Julianne Moore has the greatest style. I'd love to
dress her.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Julianne Moore is sexy and glamorous and she's the
one I'm most curious about.''
</P>
<P>
   TOMMY HILFIGER: ``I think Julianne Moore looks very good in
casual. I'd like to see her in our leather jeans and a cashmere
turtleneck.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``I'd put Julianne Moore in a simple dress in a
vivid color, perhaps violet to play off her red hair. She's so
alluring and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   HEIDI WEISEL: ``I have a beautiful brown cashmere dress in the
collection that would look great with Julianne Moore's red hair and
white skin. She should wear something fitted and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``For me, Julianne Moore is the
ultimate. You don't see many redheads on the screen. I would keep
her hair long, at about collarbone length, but I'd give it a bit of
angle between the cheekbone and jaws, with some long wspy layers
for movement. Her color is awesome _ I wouldn't change a thing
there.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Julianne Moore is an example of the perfect
redhead. She should always stay with the reds, but I would play
with red seasonally on her _ for a winter show like the Academy
Awards, I'd make her a rich auburn, and in the summer, I'd do a
gorgeous strawberry shade.''
</P>
<P>
   JAMES PURCELL: ``We need to get her to look more like a
glamorous actress than a Gucci ad. I would put Moore in something
neither over-the-top nor overly beaded, but simple and elegant with
a more dramatic hairstyle.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Of all the actresses nominated for
Best Actress, Julianne Moore likes clothes the most. She wears
Prada and Ralph and looks that are very simple. However, when Moore
wore a Ralph Lauren gown, the back was cut too close to the sides.
But she's very savvy not to wear looks that are too billowy or too
full. She always looks fuller than she is.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Julianne Moore could go vintage. She
could look great in a Henry James dress. I would suggest she go to
Galliano. She should have major impact on the red carpet. She's
just so beautiful. She should do a Victorian Henry James look.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JANET MCTEER, for ``Tumbleweeds'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1-inch British actress and Tony Award winner (for ``A
Doll's House'' on Broadway in 1997) is an enigma to designers but
says that what she'll wear to the Oscars is at the bottom of her
priority list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure somebody will come up with something nice for me to
wear,'' she said recently. ``I wore all British things to the
Golden Globes. Or I could be the first woman to wear pants to the
Oscars. But you don't often get to wear a really fancy frock in
your life, do you? So bring on the fancy frocks. I do hope all the
designers come calling. Stand in line, matey!''
</P>
<P>
   VERA WANG: ``Somebody I'd like to see make an effort is Janet
McTeer, because she's so sensual and so sexy in that film, and
she's someone who could look even better at the Academy Awards. She
has an incredibly sensual body. At the Golden Globes, she looked
like she wanted to escape it. I'm thinking something minimal but
beautifully cut, sophisticated and sensual.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Janet McTeer is a British actress who
blew everybody off the map when she did `A Doll's House.' She's a
very full-shaped lady, and tall, and designers should be aware of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Janet McTeer needs to do something dramatic for
the Oscars, because a lot of us don't know her well. If she does
something really different, it'll make everyone wake up and say `Oh
my God, that's her?' I'd cut her hair _ which is too long, by the
way _ very short, and I'd bleach it beige. Then I'd do a beige gown
and taupe lips. Then, I guarantee, everyone would be talking about
her after the show because she'd look so fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Janet McTeer is a very handsome
woman. She wore a twin set with a skirt with a bit of a dramatic
train to the Golden Globes. For an English woman, she looked
fantastic. She shouldn't try to upstage herself if she did well at
the Golden Globes. She looked very handsome.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN BARRETT, hairstylist: ``Janet has a stunning face. I styled
her for the Golden Globes, and I brought out her face, using her
hair as an accessory. I also added a little red to her hair. I'd
like to see her do something similar for the Academy Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA PASTER, stylist: ``The woman has so much presence. I'd
love to see her in something by Oscar de la Renta _ she's so
statuesque.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILLIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Someone like Janet McTeer, she's
waiting to be discovered. With her I would go with a beautiful
Badgley Mischka or Randolph Duke. She doesn't have to be
unpredictable. I love the fact that she's not a young starlet or an
older actress. I don't see her in something sexy, sexy. Maybe
Valentino or Armani. They're going through the Valentino archives.
I'm waiting for the sketches. Maybe something from the '40s. Or
there are some really great things from Chanel Couture. I could see
her in something fresh and spring-like.''
</P>
<P>
   ART LUNA, hairstylist: ``English women have these weird hairdos.
She would look so great with a short haircut. She has a
great-looking neck, that beautiful length that so many women don't
have. I'd do even a low ponytail with hair extensions at the nape,
emphasize the face and neck. That English look is such stoic
beauty. The more you add, the worse it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MERYL STREEP, for ``Music of the Heart'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is Streep's 12th Academy Awards nomination, which makes her
the most nominated female ever, tying with Katherine Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Meryl may have every bit as much talent as Hepburn _ but
if only she had half as much style. Maybe after 11 times at the
Oscars she'll finally get it right. As Tom Ford reiterated, ``Meryl
Streep may be brilliant, but fashionwise, she needs a little
help.''
</P>
<P>
   DONNA KARAN: ``I love Meryl,'' said the designer, scanning the
racks in her showroom for an example of the look she would
prescribe. She pulled out a turtleneck dress and declared it right,
with a few alterations: ``Just simple and beautiful, down to the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Meryl Streep is above and beyond fashion and her
style matches her personality: warm, elegant and superior.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Meryl Streep should go with
something very classic. She should do the Park Avenue Matron look
and wear a marvelous twin set, maybe an embroidered and embellished
sweater and full skirt, preferably Oscar de la Renta.''
</P>
<P>
   AMY SPINDLER, New York Times Magazine: ``Meryl Streep should
wear Michael Kors. It plays up to her sexiness. She's been playing
it down and needs to play it up. Or, she should wear Celine. Her
hair should be over one eye. Kors knows how to give the ladies of a
certain age some confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ART LUNA, hairstylist: ``I'd like Meryl Streep to cut her hair
off a bit, something off the shoulders, short around her face. Not
anything fancy, not extremely trendy. Something along the way of
very chic, above the shoulder. Then the weight line would be at the
right length.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Meryl Streep's been looking heavier. I
hope she'll be a little more glamorous at the Oscars. You don't
want her to look like the mother of the bride. I'd love to try
something a little corsety: emphasize the cleavage, suck in the
waist, push up the breasts. I rarely do black, but in this case I
might.''
</P>
<P>
   PAMELA DENNIS: ``I always wanted to dress Meryl Streep because I
respect her so much as an actress. She hasn't come off as sexy
lately, but I think she can be classy and sexy at the same time.''
For Streep, Dennis suggested a beaded white robe with pants.
</P>
<P>
   RANDOLPH DUKE: ``I'd liven up her look with a tailored jacket
and a wonderful skirt. I've spent time on the red carpet and I've
seen photographers and journalists clamoring for a quote from
Portia de Rossi, when Meryl Streep comes in and no one pays
attention to the greatest actress of our time. That's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   HEIDI WEISEL: ``Meryl Streep is a great actress, but I think she
could use a little help in the fashion department. I'd love to make
her look glamorous and beautiful in a black strapless gown with an
A-line skirt.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Of all the nominees, she's the one
that I'd most like to make over. First, I'd give her shorter hair _
something about chin length, keeping the ends soft and sexy,
something with a little volume so it's not just stuck to her head.
I'd keep her as a blonde, but give her some brighter highlights for
some depth.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Meryl Streep is the USA's perfect blonde. She can
wear any color blonde. If I were coloring her, I'd do a dark blonde
base with lighter tones in front and a little darker in back _ sort
of a surfer-girl shade. Her hair is too long right now.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``I suggest a look that's clean and simple and
something she's comfortable with, even if it's not fabulous. She
should look like herself. At this point, it doesn't matter what she
wears.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Meryl Streep is the one who needs the
most help. I don't think she cares enough. Maybe she should wear
Oscar de la Renta. He doesn't sacrifice a woman's elegance while
trying to make them look modern.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HILARY SWANK, for ``Boys Don't Cry'' &LR;  &QL;

   She's this year's Oscar It Girl, with all the dream elements a

<P>
   JOHN SAHAG, hairstylist: ``Hilary Swank's hair looks like it's

<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Hilary should consciously play
against the androgyny we've seen of her to show her versatility.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It's that time again. On Feb. 15, the Oscar nominations were
announced. Suddenly, five women underwent more stylistic scrutiny
than any supermodel or society girl ever has.
</P>
<P>
   Designers in New York, Milan, Paris and Los Angeles dropped what
they were doing to take note of these ladies, who are suddenly
Fashion's Most Desirable _ at least until March 27.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? One of these candidates could emerge as the next
Gwyneth Paltrow, a celebrity who gets as much attention for her
talent as she does for her sense of style. After all, it's not a
bad runway to show off the new trends for evening: only about a
billion people will be watching.
</P>
<P>
   No designer worth his or her sequins could ever hope for better
product placement _ a dress on an Oscar nominee is better than
having a commercial on the Superbowl.
</P>
<P>
   But will the first Oscar ceremony of the new millennium be any
different than the usual frenzied parade of ballgowns?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the worst things,'' Tom Ford notes, ``is seeing a dress
wear an actress rather an actress wear a dress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger,'' says noted New York celebrity hairdresser John
Sahag, ``is that in looking glamourous, many actresses end up
looking old fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   I decided to take a poll of fashion experts _ the designers,
hair stylists, makeup artists, clothing stylists, retailers and top
fashion editors _ to see what advice they can offer this new Top
Five.
</P>
<P>
   Some liked the challenge of glamming up the more serious
actresses, like Janet McTeer, Meryl Streep and Annette Bening.
``I'd love to see them in classic looks, sort of modernized Grace
Kelly,'' offers Jeanine Lobell, creator of Stila Cosmetics and a
veteran of Oscar makeup. ``If women like that do too much and get
too trendy, it's hard to pull off.''
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone agrees with Barneys New York creative director
Simon Doonan, who says: ``The general consensus is, it's time for
something new!'' That means no more ballgowns, beaded sweater sets,
evening separates, too-tight clothes, and death to the pastel
pashmina. But what else do Oscar fashionistas have up their silken
sleeves?
</P>
<P>
   Here, some pointers from the pros.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANNETTE BENING, for ``American Beauty'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's always had the body and the swagger to wear anything, but
Annette Bening is loyal to one man: Giorgio Armani. She usually
wears a black column dress or black evening tuxedo. This year, she
has another requirement: on March 26, she'll be nine months
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   DONNA KARAN: ``I want to dress Annette Bening. I like the red
evening column with a draped neckline that was a knockout on our
fall runway. I can seriously see Annette Bening in this, in either
the red or the black. I love dressing her. I think she has stature
_ divine! She is an American beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Even though I have not seen all the movies and I'm
not familiar with all the actresses, I believe Annette Bening has
an amazing and perfect American style.''
</P>
<P>
   AMY SPINDLER, New York Times Magazine: ``Annette Bening pretty
much always wears Armani. She's like the first lady of Hollywood
and she should dress like a first lady.
</P>
<P>
   PAMELA DENNIS: ``I love Annette, but I heard she's not going
because of the pregnancy. She's a classic beauty. Between her,
Julianne Moore and Hilary Swank, you can't do better than those
three. Not only do I respect them as artists, they also have
amazing bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   VERA WANG: ``In all fairness to Annette Bening, she's been
pregnant for eight months and she still managed to look elegant at
the Golden Globes. But I don't think for her it's a year she'll be
making a major fashion statement.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Annette likes Escada. I'd suggest
something cashmere. Maybe Randolph Duke. They're pretty, they're
comfy, they're sexy. I did one for Cindy Crawford when she was
pregnant. Thank God we're not in the days of having to hide it any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   CAROL SHAW, makeup artist, did Bening's makeup for the recent
Vanity Fair cover: ``I think she's just naturally luminescent. I
would do her either very understated or with a shiny red lip. Very
Old Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   SALLY HERSHBERGER, hairstylist: ``She always looks great, but
I'd like to freshen up Annette Bening's look a little. I'd brighten
up her color and smooth her short hair into an Audrey Hepburn-type
of style.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``I'd like to see her with
chin-length hair, with lots of layers. She needs slightly more
volume and movement in her hair. She's very, very sexy, but with
hair that's too extreme _ too short, too full. I'd also like to see
more of an amber-copper mix with her color. I'd also give her long
bangs.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Annette Bening dresses older than she
is. She wears Armani and Escada, and it's not the designs, her
choices are a little matronly. She doesn't have a typical face. Her
hair is too big. This is a woman who is more unique looking. She's
very sexy yet she doesn't dress sexy at all. I wish she would. She
has a great capacity for seduction.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JULIANNE MOORE, for ``The End of the Affair'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore always manages to set off those amazing red locks
with of-the-moment looks _ by Prada, Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, Ralph Lauren
_ without ever looking too fashiony or contrived. She walks the
line between fashionable and subtle without ever falling on her
heels.
</P>
<P>
   TOM FORD: ``Julianne Moore has the greatest style. I'd love to
dress her.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Julianne Moore is sexy and glamorous and she's the
one I'm most curious about.''
</P>
<P>
   TOMMY HILFIGER: ``I think Julianne Moore looks very good in
casual. I'd like to see her in our leather jeans and a cashmere
turtleneck.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``I'd put Julianne Moore in a simple dress in a
vivid color, perhaps violet to play off her red hair. She's so
alluring and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   HEIDI WEISEL: ``I have a beautiful brown cashmere dress in the
collection that would look great with Julianne Moore's red hair and
white skin. She should wear something fitted and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``For me, Julianne Moore is the
ultimate. You don't see many redheads on the screen. I would keep
her hair long, at about collarbone length, but I'd give it a bit of
angle between the cheekbone and jaws, with some long wispy layers
for movement. Her color is awesome _ I wouldn't change a thing
there.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Julianne Moore is an example of the perfect
redhead. She should always stay with the reds, but I would play
with red seasonally on her _ for a winter show like the Academy
Awards, I'd make her a rich auburn, and in the summer, I'd do a
gorgeous strawberry shade.''
</P>
<P>
   JAMES PURCELL: ``We need to get her to look more like a
glamorous actress than a Gucci ad. I would put Moore in something
neither over-the-top nor overly beaded, but simple and elegant with
a more dramatic hairstyle.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Of all the actresses nominated for
Best Actress, Julianne Moore likes clothes the most. She wears
Prada and Ralph and looks that are very simple. However, when Moore
wore a Ralph Lauren gown, the back was cut too close to the sides.
But she's very savvy not to wear looks that are too billowy or too
full. She always looks fuller than she is.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Julianne Moore could go vintage. She
could look great in a Henry James dress. I would suggest she go to
Galliano. She should have major impact on the red carpet. She's
just so beautiful. She should do a Victorian Henry James look.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JANET MCTEER, for ``Tumbleweeds'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1-inch British actress and Tony Award winner (for ``A
Doll's House'' on Broadway in 1997) is an enigma to designers but
says that what she'll wear to the Oscars is at the bottom of her
priority list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure somebody will come up with something nice for me to
wear,'' she said recently. ``I wore all British things to the
Golden Globes. Or I could be the first woman to wear pants to the
Oscars. But you don't often get to wear a really fancy frock in
your life, do you? So bring on the fancy frocks. I do hope all the
designers come calling. Stand in line, matey!''
</P>
<P>
   VERA WANG: ``Somebody I'd like to see make an effort is Janet
McTeer, because she's so sensual and so sexy in that film, and
she's someone who could look even better at the Academy Awards. She
has an incredibly sensual body. At the Golden Globes, she looked
like she wanted to escape it. I'm thinking something minimal but
beautifully cut, sophisticated and sensual.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Janet McTeer is a British actress who
blew everybody off the map when she did `A Doll's House.' She's a
very full-shaped lady, and tall, and designers should be aware of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Janet McTeer needs to do something dramatic for
the Oscars, because a lot of us don't know her well. If she does
something really different, it'll make everyone wake up and say `Oh
my God, that's her?' I'd cut her hair _ which is too long, by the
way _ very short, and I'd bleach it beige. Then I'd do a beige gown
and taupe lips. Then, I guarantee, everyone would be talking about
her after the show because she'd look so fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Janet McTeer is a very handsome
woman. She wore a twin set with a skirt with a bit of a dramatic
train to the Golden Globes. For an English woman, she looked
fantastic. She shouldn't try to upstage herself if she did well at
the Golden Globes. She looked very handsome.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN BARRETT, hairstylist: ``Janet has a stunning face. I styled
her for the Golden Globes, and I brought out her face, using her
hair as an accessory. I also added a little red to her hair. I'd
like to see her do something similar for the Academy Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA PASTER, stylist: ``The woman has so much presence. I'd
love to see her in something by Oscar de la Renta _ she's so
statuesque.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILLIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Someone like Janet McTeer, she's
waiting to be discovered. With her I would go with a beautiful
Badgley Mischka or Randolph Duke. She doesn't have to be
unpredictable. I love the fact that she's not a young starlet or an
older actress. I don't see her in something sexy, sexy. Maybe
Valentino or Armani. They're going through the Valentino archives.
I'm waiting for the sketches. Maybe something from the '40s. Or
there are some really great things from Chanel Couture. I could see
her in something fresh and spring-like.''
</P>
<P>
   ART LUNA, hairstylist: ``English women have these weird hairdos.
She would look so great with a short haircut. She has a
great-looking neck, that beautiful length that so many women don't
have. I'd do even a low ponytail with hair extensions at the nape,
emphasize the face and neck. That English look is such stoic
beauty. The more you add, the worse it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MERYL STREEP, for ``Music of the Heart'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is Streep's 12th Academy Awards nomination, which makes her
the most nominated female ever, tying with Katherine Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Meryl may have every bit as much talent as Hepburn _ but
if only she had half as much style. Maybe after 11 times at the
Oscars she'll finally get it right. As Tom Ford reiterated, ``Meryl
Streep may be brilliant, but fashionwise, she needs a little
help.''
</P>
<P>
   DONNA KARAN: ``I love Meryl,'' said the designer, scanning the
racks in her showroom for an example of the look she would
prescribe. She pulled out a turtleneck dress and declared it right,
with a few alterations: ``Just simple and beautiful, down to the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Meryl Streep is above and beyond fashion and her
style matches her personality: warm, elegant and superior.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Meryl Streep should go with
something very classic. She should do the Park Avenue Matron look
and wear a marvelous twin set, maybe an embroidered and embellished
sweater and full skirt, preferably Oscar de la Renta.''
</P>
<P>
   AMY SPINDLER, New York Times Magazine: ``Meryl Streep should
wear Michael Kors. It plays up to her sexiness. She's been playing
it down and needs to play it up. Or, she should wear Celine. Her
hair should be over one eye. Kors knows how to give the ladies of a
certain age some confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ART LUNA, hairstylist: ``I'd like Meryl Streep to cut her hair
off a bit, something off the shoulders, short around her face. Not
anything fancy, not extremely trendy. Something along the way of
very chic, above the shoulder. Then the weight line would be at the
right length.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Meryl Streep's been looking heavier. I
hope she'll be a little more glamorous at the Oscars. You don't
want her to look like the mother of the bride. I'd love to try
something a little corsety: emphasize the cleavage, suck in the
waist, push up the breasts. I rarely do black, but in this case I
might.''
</P>
<P>
   PAMELA DENNIS: ``I always wanted to dress Meryl Streep because I
respect her so much as an actress. She hasn't come off as sexy
lately, but I think she can be classy and sexy at the same time.''
For Streep, Dennis suggested a beaded white robe with pants.
</P>
<P>
   RANDOLPH DUKE: ``I'd liven up her look with a tailored jacket
and a wonderful skirt. I've spent time on the red carpet and I've
seen photographers and journalists clamoring for a quote from
Portia de Rossi, when Meryl Streep comes in and no one pays
attention to the greatest actress of our time. That's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   HEIDI WEISEL: ``Meryl Streep is a great actress, but I think she
could use a little help in the fashion department. I'd love to make
her look glamorous and beautiful in a black strapless gown with an
A-line skirt.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Of all the nominees, she's the one
that I'd most like to make over. First, I'd give her shorter hair _
something about chin length, keeping the ends soft and sexy,
something with a little volume so it's not just stuck to her head.
I'd keep her as a blonde, but give her some brighter highlights for
some depth.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Meryl Streep is the USA's perfect blonde. She can
wear any color blonde. If I were coloring her, I'd do a dark blonde
base with lighter tones in front and a little darker in back _ sort
of a surfer-girl shade. Her hair is too long right now.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``I suggest a look that's clean and simple and
something she's comfortable with, even if it's not fabulous. She
should look like herself. At this point, it doesn't matter what she
wears.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Meryl Streep is the one who needs the
most help. I don't think she cares enough. Maybe she should wear
Oscar de la Renta. He doesn't sacrifice a woman's elegance while
trying to make them look modern.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HILARY SWANK, for ``Boys Don't Cry'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's this year's Oscar It Girl, with all the dream elements a
designer's looking for: tall, thin, hip, stylish, great looking,
has talent _ and a good bet to win.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Karl Lagerfeld, Donatella Versace and Tom Ford have put
her on the ``Must Dress'' list. As InStyle's Hal Rubenstein puts
it: ``Hilary Swank will be drowning in dresses.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Hilary Swank has the greatest style.
She set the tone at the Golden Globes in a black Versace, and it
was a major coup for her and for Versace. She should stick with the
tried-and-true formula.''
</P>
<P>
   SIMON DOONAN, Barneys New York: ``It would be great if Hilary
Swank wore Comme des Garcons, or better yet, vintage Comme des
Garcons! My advice for the Oscars is vintage, vintage, vintage.
Hilary Swank could wear something vintage like a Dior `New Look'
dress.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Hilary Swank is changing her look so as not to be
framed with the character of her movie. I know her well _ she
attended my couture show in Paris and I'm happy to help her
again.''
</P>
<P>
   RANDOLPH DUKE: ``I would pick Hilary Swank (to dress), because
she'll get the most attention _ and this is no secret _ it's all
about who will get the most attention.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTINA PERRIN: ``I think Hilary Swank has the most fantastic
body and that beautiful short, cropped hair. She should wear
something very sleek and dark red.''
</P>
<P>
   CAROLINA HERRERA: ``I would like to see Hilary Swank in
something different beside a slinky embroidered dress. A red
strapless dress would be beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``Although Hilary Swank glammed it up in Versace
Couture at the Golden Globes, I think she should wear a satin
tuxedo for a feminine/masculine play. I don't really want to see
her in a ballgown or a long dress.''
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA PASTER, veteran Oscar and Hollywood stylist: ``I have
the thrill of dressing Hilary for the Oscars this year! I think
she's our young Mia Farrow, with a sensuality about her that's the
girl next door with a little edge. I am thinking about color this
time. The Golden Globes was Hilary's first time out. I predict
she's gonna have a little more fun at the Academy Awards. We're not
married to one designer.''
</P>
<P>
   JEANINE LOBELL, Stila Cosmetics and veteran Oscar makeup artist:
``I'd like to work on Hilary Swank. I just like the way she looks
and I think that she doesn't need a lot of makeup. She's the kind
of person you'd put one thing on _ a little eye or a little lip _
she's not someone you'd like to paint everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN SAHAG, hairstylist: ``Hilary Swank's hair looks like it's
growing out from the film. I definitely think that now that she
finished her movie she could go back to being feminine: grow the
sides, fringe, and back out, and go for something messier and more
tousled. I think that would be a nice contrast for the public to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Hilary should consciously play
against the androgyny we've seen of her to show her versatility.
I'd take her hair a little longer. I'd also give her soft bangs
that she could brush to the side, and layer her hair a bit on top
for volume. I'd also like to see her with some caramel highlights;
they'd give her hair a little sparkle and make it a little more
electric.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS, celebrity colorist, Avon Centre: ``Because she
played a boy in `Boys Don't Cry,' I'd tell her to arrive at the
Oscars totally femmed out _ big red lips, honey-colored hair,
something really high gloss, high glam. I'd dress her in a gorgeous
Badgley Mischka dress and get Kevyn Aucoin or Laura Mercier to do
really glamorous makeup on her.'' &QL;

hair is too big. This is a woman who is more unique looking. She's
very sexy yet she doesn't dress sexy at all. I wish she would. She
has a great capacity for seduction.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JULIANNE MOORE, for ``The End of the Affair'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore always manages to set off those amazing red locks
with of-the-moment looks _ by Prada, Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, Ralph Lauren
_ without ever looking too fashiony or contrived. She walks the
line between fashionable and subtle without ever falling on her
heels.
</P>
<P>
   TOM FORD: ``Julianne Moore has the greatest style. I'd love to
dress her.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Julianne Moore is sexy and glamorous and she's the
one I'm most curious about.''
</P>
<P>
   TOMMY HILFIGER: ``I think Julianne Moore looks very good in
casual. I'd like to see her in our leather jeans and a cashmere
turtleneck.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``I'd put Julianne Moore in a simple dress in a
vivid color, perhaps violet to play off her red hair. She's so
alluring and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   HEIDI WEISEL: ``I have a beautiful brown cashmere dress in the
collection that would look great with Julianne Moore's red hair and
white skin. She should wear something fitted and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``For me, Julianne Moore is the
ultimate. You don't see many redheads on the screen. I would keep
her hair long, at about collarbone length, but I'd give it a bit of
angle between the cheekbone and jaws, with some long wispy layers
for movement. Her color is awesome _ I wouldn't change a thing
there.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Julianne Moore is an example of the perfect
redhead. She should always stay with the reds, but I would play
with red seasonally on her _ for a winter show like the Academy
Awards, I'd make her a rich auburn, and in the summer, I'd do a
gorgeous strawberry shade.''
</P>
<P>
   JAMES PURCELL: ``We need to get her to look more like a
glamorous actress than a Gucci ad. I would put Moore in something
neither over-the-top nor overly beaded, but simple and elegant with
a more dramatic hairstyle.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Of all the actresses nominated for
Best Actress, Julianne Moore likes clothes the most. She wears
Prada and Ralph and looks that are very simple. However, when Moore
wore a Ralph Lauren gown, the back was cut too close to the sides.
But she's very savvy not to wear looks that are too billowy or too
full. She always looks fuller than she is.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Julianne Moore could go vintage. She
could look great in a Henry James dress. I would suggest she go to
Galliano. She should have major impact on the red carpet. She's
just so beautiful. She should do a Victorian Henry James look.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JANET MCTEER, for ``Tumbleweeds'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1-inch British actress and Tony Award winner (for ``A
Doll's House'' on Broadway in 1997) is an enigma to designers but
says that what she'll wear to the Oscars is at the bottom of her
priority list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure somebody will come up with something nice for me to
wear,'' she said recently. ``I wore all British things to the
Golden Globes. Or I could be the first woman to wear pants to the
Oscars. But you don't often get to wear a really fancy frock in
your life, do you? So bring on the fancy frocks. I do hope all the
designers come calling. Stand in line, matey!''
</P>
<P>
   VERA WANG: ``Somebody I'd like to see make an effort is Janet
McTeer, because she's so sensual and so sexy in that film, and
she's someone who could look even better at the Academy Awards. She
has an incredibly sensual body. At the Golden Globes, she looked
like she wanted to escape it. I'm thinking something minimal but
beautifully cut, sophisticated and sensual.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Janet McTeer is a British actress who
blew everybody off the map when she did `A Doll's House.' She's a
very full-shaped lady, and tall, and designers should be aware of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Janet McTeer needs to do something dramatic for
the Oscars, because a lot of us don't know her well. If she does
something really different, it'll make everyone wake up and say `Oh
my God, that's her?' I'd cut her hair _ which is too long, by the
way _ very short, and I'd bleach it beige. Then I'd do a beige gown
and taupe lips. Then, I guarantee, everyone would be talking about
her after the show because she'd look so fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Janet McTeer is a very handsome
woman. She wore a twin set with a skirt with a bit of a dramatic
train to the Golden Globes. For an English woman, she looked
fantastic. She shouldn't try to upstage herself if she did well at
the Golden Globes. She looked very handsome.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN BARRETT, hairstylist: ``Janet has a stunning face. I styled
her for the Golden Globes, and I brought out her face, using her
hair as an accessory. I also added a little red to her hair. I'd
like to see her do something similar for the Academy Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA PASTER, stylist: ``The woman has so much presence. I'd
love to see her in something by Oscar de la Renta _ she's so
statuesque.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILLIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Someone like Janet McTeer, she's
waiting to be discovered. With her I would go with a beautiful
Badgley Mischka or Randolph Duke. She doesn't have to be
unpredictable. I love the fact that she's not a young starlet or an
older actress. I don't see her in something sexy, sexy. Maybe
Valentino or Armani. They're going through the Valentino archives.
I'm waiting for the sketches. Maybe something from the '40s. Or
there are some really great things from Chanel Couture. I could see
her in something fresh and spring-like.''
</P>
<P>
   ART LUNA, hairstylist: ``English women have these weird hairdos.
She would look so great with a short haircut. She has a
great-looking neck, that beautiful length that so many women don't
have. I'd do even a low ponytail with hair extensions at the nape,
emphasize the face and neck. That English look is such stoic
beauty. The more you add, the worse it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MERYL STREEP, for ``Music of the Heart'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is Streep's 12th Academy Awards nomination, which makes her
the most nominated female ever, tying with Katherine Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Meryl may have every bit as much talent as Hepburn _ but
if only she had half as much style. Maybe after 11 times at the
Oscars she'll finally get it right. As Tom Ford reiterated, ``Meryl
Streep may be brilliant, but fashionwise, she needs a little
help.''
</P>
<P>
   DONNA KARAN: ``I love Meryl,'' said the designer, scanning the
racks in her showroom for an example of the look she would
prescribe. She pulled out a turtleneck dress and declared it right,
with a few alterations: ``Just simple and beautiful, down to the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Meryl Streep is above and beyond fashion and her
style matches her personality: warm, elegant and superior.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Meryl Streep should go with
something very classic. She should do the Park Avenue Matron look
and wear a marvelous twin set, maybe an embroidered and embellished
sweater and full skirt, preferably Oscar de la Renta.''
</P>
<P>
   AMY SPINDLER, New York Times Magazine: ``Meryl Streep should
wear Michael Kors. It plays up to her sexiness. She's been playing
it down and needs to play it up. Or, she should wear Celine. Her
hair should be over one eye. Kors knows how to give the ladies of a
certain age some confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ART LUNA, hairstylist: ``I'd like Meryl Streep to cut her hair
off a bit, something off the shoulders, short around her face. Not
anything fancy, not extremely trendy. Something along the way of
very chic, above the shoulder. Then the weight line would be at the
right length.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Meryl Streep's been looking heavier. I
hope she'll be a little more glamorous at the Oscars. You don't
want her to look like the mother of the bride. I'd love to try
something a little corsety: emphasize the cleavage, suck in the
waist, push up the breasts. I rarely do black, but in this case I
might.''
</P>
<P>
   PAMELA DENNIS: ``I always wanted to dress Meryl Streep because I
respect her so much as an actress. She hasn't come off as sexy
lately, but I think she can be classy and sexy at the same time.''
For Streep, Dennis suggested a beaded white robe with pants.
</P>
<P>
   RANDOLPH DUKE: ``I'd liven up her look with a tailored jacket
and a wonderful skirt. I've spent time on the red carpet and I've
seen photographers and journalists clamoring for a quote from
Portia de Rossi, when Meryl Streep comes in and no one pays
attention to the greatest actress of our time. That's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   HEIDI WEISEL: ``Meryl Streep is a great actress, but I think she
could use a little help in the fashion department. I'd love to make
her look glamorous and beautiful in a black strapless gown with an
A-line skirt.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Of all the nominees, she's the one
that I'd most like to make over. First, I'd give her shorter hair _
something about chin length, keeping the ends soft and sexy,
something with a little volume so it's not just stuck to her head.
I'd keep her as a blonde, but give her some brighter highlights for
some depth.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Meryl Streep is the USA's perfect blonde. She can
wear any color blonde. If I were coloring her, I'd do a dark blonde
base with lighter tones in front and a little darker in back _ sort
of a surfer-girl shade. Her hair is too long right now.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``I suggest a look that's clean and simple and
something she's comfortable with, even if it's not fabulous. She
should look like herself. At this point, it doesn't matter what she
wears.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Meryl Streep is the one who needs the
most help. I don't think she cares enough. Maybe she should wear
Oscar de la Renta. He doesn't sacrifice a woman's elegance while
trying to make them look modern.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HILARY SWANK, for ``Boys Don't Cry'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's this year's Oscar It Girl, with all the dream elements a
designer's looking for: tall, thin, hip, stylish, great looking,
has talent _ and a good bet to win.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Karl Lagerfeld, Donatella Versace and Tom Ford have put
her on the ``Must Dress'' list. As InStyle's Hal Rubenstein puts
it: ``Hilary Swank will be drowning in dresses.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Hilary Swank has the greatest style.
She set the tone at the Golden Globes in a black Versace, and it
was a major coup for her and for Versace. She should stick with the
tried-and-true formula.''
</P>
<P>
   SIMON DOONAN, Barneys New York: ``It would be great if Hilary
Swank wore Comme des Garcons, or better yet, vintage Comme des
Garcons! My advice for the Oscars is vintage, vintage, vintage.
Hilary Swank could wear something vintage like a Dior `New Look'
dress.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Hilary Swank is changing her look so as not to be
framed with the character of her movie. I know her well _ she
attended my couture show in Paris and I'm happy to help her
again.''
</P>
<P>
   RANDOLPH DUKE: ``I would pick Hilary Swank (to dress), because
she'll get the most attention _ and this is no secret _ it's all
about who will get the most attention.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTINA PERRIN: ``I think Hilary Swank has the most fantastic
body and that beautiful short, cropped hair. She should wear
something very sleek and dark red.''
</P>
<P>
   CAROLINA HERRERA: ``I would like to see Hilary Swank in
something different beside a slinky embroidered dress. A red
strapless dress would be beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``Although Hilary Swank glammed it up in Versace
Couture at the Golden Globes, I think she should wear a satin
tuxedo for a feminine/masculine play. I don't really want to see
her in a ballgown or a long dress.''
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA PASTER, veteran Oscar and Hollywood stylist: ``I have
the thrill of dressing Hilary for the Oscars this year! I think
she's our young Mia Farrow, with a sensuality about her that's the
girl next door with a little edge. I am thinking about color this
time. The Golden Globes was Hilary's first time out. I predict
she's gonna have a little more fun at the Academy Awards. We're not
married to one designer.''
</P>
<P>
   JEANINE LOBELL, Stila Cosmetics and veteran Oscar makeup artist:
``I'd like to work on Hilary Swank. I just like the way she looks
and I think that she doesn't need a lot of makeup. She's the kind
of person you'd put one thing on _ a little eye or a little lip _
she's not someone you'd like to paint everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN SAHAG, hairstylist: ``Hilary Swank's hair looks like it's
growing out from the film. I definitely think that now that she
finished her movie she could go back to being feminine: grow the
sides, fringe, and back out, and go for something messier and more
tousled. I think that would be a nice contrast for the public to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Hilary should consciously play
against the androgyny we've seen of her to show her versatility.
I'd take her hair a little longer. I'd also give her soft bangs
that she could brush to the side, and layer her hair a bit on top
for volume. I'd also like to see her with some caramel highlights;
they'd give her hair a little sparkle and make it a little more
electric.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS, celebrity colorist, Avon Centre: ``Because she
played a boy in `Boys Don't Cry,' I'd tell her to arrive at the
Oscars totally femmed out _ big red lips, honey-colored hair,
something really high gloss, high glam. I'd dress her in a gorgeous
Badgley Mischka dress and get Kevyn Aucoin or Laura Mercier to do
really glamorous makeup on her.'' &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider it a classic Bill Schrader moment.
</P>
<P>
   At a big telecommunications convention in Geneva last October,
William L. Schrader, chairman of PSINet Inc., the biggest
independent Internet service provider, announced that PSINet had
just struck a deal to offer high-speed Internet access in Europe.
The partner, he said, was Winstar Communications Inc., an American
wireless carrier, allowing PSINet to bypass the Continent's
traditional phone systems.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, Winstar's top executives in New York knew nothing
about a deal with PSINet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Bill was predicting the future,'' William L. Rouhana
Jr., Winstar's chairman, said lightheartedly in an interview last
week, noting that his company never announced such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   All Schrader would say, by way of explanation, was that PSINet
had indeed negotiated a European deal with Winstar. ``The fact that
Rouhana didn't know isn't my problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Odd? Bizarre even? From another chairman at another company,
perhaps. But for Schrader, it was simply business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   In building PSINet from its modest roots in upstate New York to
international Internet powerhouse with a stock market value of $7.3
billion, he has never been afraid to get a bit ahead of himself _
or to risk alienating a potential partner. In fact, PSINet and
Winstar are now in preliminary discussions about working together,
according to executives close to those talks.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader, whose hobbies include target shooting, is an executive
who often fires from the hip, so to speak, aiming verbal shots at
allies and enemies alike and establishing a reputation as perhaps
the most iconoclastic executive of his stature in the
communications industry.
</P>
<P>
   PSINet, with fiber-optic lines around the globe, some of the
world's most advanced Internet systems and a fast-growing customer
base, looms as a highly attractive acquisition candidate _ one
whose shares are up nearly 300 percent since October, as investors
have noted its potential takeover value. It is the biggest of the
Internet access providers not already snatched up by telephone
companies looking to expand into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   But PSINet has been valuable for years. And Schrader, who owns
7.45 percent of the company, has always refused to sell, sometimes
leaving prospective buyers to walk away wondering if he is shrewd
or headstrong _ or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the real reason PSINet is still independent is Bill
Schrader,'' said Richard G. Ellenberger, chief executive of
Broadwing Inc., the former Cincinnati Bell. Broadwing recently
filed to reduce its stake in PSINet to about 11 percent but would
still be its largest shareholder. ``He has built it from the ground
up, and he's not through. He believes he's one of the new age of
executive leaders, and he's not ready to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrader, 48, may not be ready to quit because he has already
come so far. A biologist by training, he was a co-founder in 1985
of one of the first Internet operations, called Nysernet, which
initially linked academic computing centers in the cold reaches of
upstate New York. In 1989, when for-profit activity was still
ostensibly banned from the government-financed Internet, he founded
what was then called Performance Systems International Inc., moving
it to northern Virginia to be closer to the Federal agencies then
overseeing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   PSINet was not only one of the first providers of Internet
access service but one of the most innovative. In 1995, for
instance, PSINet was a pioneer in offering unlimited Internet
service at a fixed monthly fee to consumers across the nation. The
pricing was set in typical Schrader fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I asked him how they chose what to charge for
the flat fee,'' Ellenberger said. ``And he said, `Well, it was 1995
so we chose $19.95, and $19.95 sounded good to us.' And I asked
him, `You didn't do any economic modeling?' And he said, `Nope.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, PSINet's tactical focus has changed; the company got
out of the consumer Internet business in 1996, selling its consumer
unit to Mindspring Enterprises so it could focus on serving
business customers and acting as a carrier's carrier for smaller
Internet service providers. More recently, instead of merely
providing raw Internet links, PSINet has begun to add more advanced
and lucrative services by managing Web servers and computer systems
that deliver corporate software applications across networks.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's ultimate goal has remained constant. ``I would
like to build a system,'' Schrader said, ``that can deliver all the
media to all the customers on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold S. Wills, PSINet's president and chief operating officer
and a former executive at IBM and Xerox, first met Schrader in the
spring of 1996. ``I thought he was crazy,'' Wills said, recalling
his job interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill said, `We're going to kill the phone companies and we're
going to be bigger than AT&AMP;T, and it will be a lot of fun.' And I
said, `How much revenue have you got?' and he said, `Well, last
year we had $35 million.' And I said, `Well, how are you going to
do what you want to do?' And he began to explain in ways that I
hadn't understood before the power of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other people did not understand either. PSINet's stock
traded below $10 throughout 1996, 1997 and 1998. It was not until
last year, when PSINet generated more than $550 million in revenue,
that investors began climbing onto the PSINet bandwagon as a way to
play the growth of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And to ride the PSINet bandwagon is to hear none of the bland
modulations of boardroom-speak.
</P>
<P>
   One recent day, as he drove his silver-gray Lincoln Town Car (he
also owns a Porsche Boxster) from PSINet's headquarters in Herndon,
Va., to one of the company's nearby network centers, Schrader was
asked about one of his competitors, John W. Sidgmore. Sidgmore runs
UUNet, the No. 1 Internet carrier, which is now part of MCI
Worldcom Inc. and is also based in northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of where the market's going, we see eye to eye,''
Schrader said. ``But John is a typical executive who will say what
he thinks people want to hear and I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   (In an interview later, Sidgmore said, ``I'm willing to bet that
on Bill's report card in sixth grade it said something like,
`Doesn't play well with others.''')
</P>
<P>
   And do not even get Schrader started on Stephen M. Case,
chairman of America Online Inc. and another Virginia neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Case is a perfect example of someone who misrepresents the
truth for his own interest,'' Schrader said as he drove.
</P>
<P>
   He cited what he saw as America Online's about-face, after it
agreed to acquire Time Warner Inc., on the need for the government
to regulate the delivery of Internet data over cable television
systems. Before the deal, America Online had called for a
government role; after hooking up with Time Warner, the nation's
second-largest operator of cable systems, many people in the
industry perceived America Online as changing its stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like hypocrites, and Case is a hypocrite,'' Schrader
said. He peered over the wheel, then added: ``He is a self-serving
businessman who's into hypocrisy and I'm not. That's why he decided
to stop competing against us as an Internet service provider and
get into the content business.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement responding to those comments, America Online
said, ``Mr. Case's position on open access has been consistent from
day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrader reserves his deepest ire, however, for local telephone
incumbents, which he says are monopolists holding back the digital
future. Bashing the Bell companies is hardly unusual among smaller
communications carriers, but Schrader's company must also deal with
the Bells on a daily basis, renting their local communications
lines in order to reach customers.
</P>
<P>
   He is particularly outspoken about Bell Atlantic, the East Coast
giant with which PSINet does a significant amount of business. ``I
call them `Bell Atlantis,''' Schrader said, still dishing as he
drove. ``Bell Atlantis is dead. They cannot exist in tomorrow. We
know the customer better than they do and they can't keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   Why lash out at a such an important supplier?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I'm honest,'' Schrader said. Referring to Bell
Atlantic's chairman, he said, ``It's not in my best interest to
tell you that Ivan Seidenberg is a poor manager of a
multibillion-dollar company, because they're our major supplier.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for a corporate response, Susan Kraus, a Bell Atlantic
spokeswoman, replied: ``This is not even worth commenting on but
I'll say this. Consider the source. It's hard to take anything he
says seriously. This guy has a long history of making irrational
statements and taking gratuitous potshots at his competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Schrader's blunt style is
that it has not prevented him from garnering the deep respect of
his peers, even those he does not treat gently. As someone who
spoke up for and invested in the Internet early and often, Schrader
is often considered one of the handful of true Internet
visionaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has enormous courage and he's as smart as a fox,'' said
George H. Conrades, chairman of Akamai Technologies Inc. and former
chairman of BBN, one of the big three early independent Internet
companies, along with UUNet and PSINet. ``I admire him,'' Conrades
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sidgmore, of UUNet, also offered a compliment of sorts. ``I'm a
big supporter of Bill's, as wacky as he is,'' Sidgmore said.
``Whatever else you say, good or bad, he is steadfastly committed
to his vision for the company.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sidgmore said, ``I would not be surprised if you read
soon that we will do some investments together.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of all he has built, Schrader has been reluctant
to sell it, despite the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars
such a deal could bring him, considering his personal 7.45 percent
stake in PSINet.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, Internet providers of all size and
description have been snatched up by more traditional
communications companies. UUNet agreed to be acquired by MFS
Communications in 1996 just before MFS itself was acquired by
Worldcom Inc. In 1997, BBN was acquired by GTE Corp.
</P>
<P>
   That has essentially left PSINet as the last of the Mohicans,
holding out against assimilation with the communications giants.
Deutsche Telekom, for instance, has explored acquiring PSInet, but
those discussions were strictly preliminary. Far more likely
suitors are the new breed of communications carrier in the United
States, companies like Level 3, Qwest, Broadwing and Nextlink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to buy PSINet at least 10 times over the last few
years,'' Sidgmore said. ``Right after MFS bought us we tried to buy
him. I tried after Worldcom. I tried a bunch of times and he would
never sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, it comes down to Schrader being Schrader. ``He
always had the opinion that PSInet is worth 10 times whatever his
stock price is,'' Sidgmore said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that other Internet companies have sold out _ beyond
the financial incentives _ has been their executives' notion that
integrating into a bigger company can give them access to a broader
set of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Wills, PSINet's No. 2 executive, takes a slightly more pragmatic
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some day, they will buy us and we will be sold, and my job is
to make it more expensive for them every day that they wait,''
Wills said. ``What they could have bought for $200 million, they
will now probably have to pay $20 billion for.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Schrader about selling his company _ well, maybe it's better
not to ask. ``Why should I sell the company?'' he said, bristling.
``Tell me.''

 &HT;    Documentary highlights wrestlers' struggles
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's already been a big year for multimedia in professional
wrestling. The industry's shows dominate the cable television
ratings, their books have topped the New York Times bestsellers
list, wrestling video games are among the hottest-selling items and
wrestling Web sites are getting millions and millions of hits each
month.
</P>
<P>
   Now, wrestling goes Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   On March 3, the professional wrestling documentary, ``Beyond the
Mat,'' opened in limited release in New York, Los Angeles,
Charlotte, N.C., and Memphis, Tenn. On March 17, the movie opens
nationally with the backing of Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Although it failed to garner an Academy Award nomination in the
documentary category, word of mouth has been strong since director
Barry Blaustein gave the movie a screening in Los Angeles just
before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Blaustein's project was to follow the behind the scenes workings
of wrestlers in different organizations. As the movie's Web site
(beyondthemat.net) proclaims, ``(Beyond the Mat is) an honest,
intimate, revealing, highly entertaining, and critically acclaimed
documentary about wrestling. It takes viewers beyond the ring and
into the lives of the men and women who inhabit this colorful,
competitive, and surprisingly complex world.''
</P>
<P>
   While professional wrestling is complex, doing a documentary on
sports entertainment is just as complex. Blaustein, a former head
writer and supervising producer of Saturday Night Live, started his
project in 1995. It took him two years of hanging around and
informally meeting groups of wrestlers before he started to get
things down on tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been a wrestling fan for a long time and I had met a lot
of these guys and it always struck me how they talked about their
families and I'd say, 'They're not very different than me,' but
they are,'' Blaustein said. ``I thought it would be interesting to
see the inner working of wrestlers' lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaustein was amazed by the contrast of the control the
wrestlers appeared to have in the ring and the lack of control they
have in their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, getting the wrestlers to speak in front of the camera
as themselves and not their personas _ or to get ahold of them at
all was Blaustein's biggest obsticale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I joked with Terry (Funk) and Mick (Foley) that the only
reason they are in the movie is because they called me back,''
Blaustein said. ``You get the cold shoulder by guys, guys don't
show up, it really makes you want to give up. But I would not give
up.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Blaustein created a movie that he hopes wrestling
fans and nonwrestling fans will enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   The film begins with the wrestling beginnings of Darren Drozdov
of the WWF. Droz, who since the filming has suffered an in-ring
neck injury that has left him paralyzed, signs a deal with WWF
Chairman Vince McMahon to begin his professional wrestling career.
He earns such a deal on the strength of his professional football
career that is highlighted by his ability to vomit at will. As a
result, he becomes ``Puke'' in the WWF.
</P>
<P>
   And Drozdov calls home to tell of his good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, guess what? Your baby boy is now going to be called
Puke,'' he says excitedly into the phone.
</P>
<P>
   After a trip to the minor leagues to visit with All-Pro
Wrestling, the film spotlights a wrestling legend _ Terry Funk. At
the time, Funk was 53 and looking for a role in a large U.S.
wrestling organization. After splitting time between his ranch, an
acting career that never amounted to much and some wrestling gigs
overseas, Funk signed on with the fledging Extreme Championship
Wrestling. Known for his brawling style, Funk went to the extreme
when he joined ECW, involving himself in matches that spilled his
blood all over the arena. Despite the pleas from doctors to give
his body a rest, Funk continued battling wrestlers half his age.
</P>
<P>
   We watch as the wrestlers of ECW join head honcho Paul Heyman
around television screens in the locker room area to watch the
legend work, while Funk's family watches in pain as he absorbs more
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Funk's push toward retirement is sprinkled throughout the movie.
Finally he announces his retirement at an ECW party and wrestles
his final match in his hometown of Amarillo, Texas. The wrestling
show has all of the top stars, including Bret Hart, wrestling in
the main event against Funk.
</P>
<P>
   While Funk was saying this was his retirement, Blaustein knew
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first announced it at the retirement party, he said he
might do a couple shows over in Japan,'' Blaustein said. ``Then,
the night of the retirement matches I asked him, 'Terry is this
really it?' And he said 'this was his final match ... in Amarillo.'
I don't think wrestling fans were shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just loves it too much. He's in terrible shape _ I mean for
the beating he has taken he's in great shape _ but he loves the
roar of the crowd and the fans' reactions.''
</P>
<P>
   Funk now works for WCW and is one of their main performers at
age 55.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also re-introduces wrestling fans to Jake ``The
Snake'' Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the top heels for the WWF in the 1980s, Roberts fell on
hard times in the 1990s. When Blaustein catches up with Roberts, he
is traveling across the Midwest picking up shows wherever he can _
high school gymnasiums, converted livestock barns, etc.
</P>
<P>
   During one eight-hour trip, Roberts weaves a tale of his
horrific childhood and a wasted adult life complete with drug
addiction, crazed sexual escapades and children he hardly knows.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts attempts to reunite with his college-age daughter who he
hasn't seen in four years. But the meeting is too much for Roberts
to handle and he slinks away to buy crack.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Roberts has fallen, Mick Foley has risen from guy who
takes dangerous bumps in the ring to a wrestling superstar.
</P>
<P>
   His violent beginnings, the toll on his body and his family
along with the relationship between his family at home and his
family on the road are profiled. The movie picks up Foley as his
character is changed in the WWF and the real Mick Foley comes out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Vince that if they just let Mick be Mick he would be a
star,'' said Blaustein of a conversation with WWF's top man Vince
McMahon. ``Mick Foley is a lot more interesting than the characters
he plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaustein was right, and we watch as Foley is given the WWF
championship only to lose it in a brutal pay-per-view match. During
htat match his head is split open after taking 20-plus chair shots.
During the brutality, the Foley family (his wife and two small
children) watch in horror, until they can stand no more and leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mick called me a couple weeks after and wanted to know how the
filming came out,'' Blaustein said. ``I told him, 'Mick it looked
truly horrendous.' The reason why I wanted to show him the footage
is because as a father I thought he needed to see the footage. It
was hard for me to show it to him. I didn't want people to think
that he's a bad father, because he's not. He just made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching his children screaming at the sight of their
father being beaten, Foley's eyes were opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like such a good father anymore,'' he says in the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   In the scenes leading up to his viewing of the tape, Foley tried
to convince his children that it wasn't as bad as it looked. But as
they got older, the kids did not believe that the bloody mess their
father would become after a match was not without its pain.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the damage he had done to his body and because he
wants to be closer to his family, Foley wrestled his last match in
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he might come back in a year or two and do a match,''
Blaustein said. ``But I called him and asked how he enjoys
retirement and he said, 'You know, I really do enjoy it', so I
think he'll stay retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to write another book and a children's
series and do some acting.'' With the success of books from Foley
and The Rock, Americans can't seem to get enough of the
behind-the-scenes workings of professional wrestling. Not everyone
likes the access. Vince McMahon did not like the movie and is not
getting a cut of the pie, so he has refused to run the movie
trailers during WWF shows and has censored WWF wrestlers from
talking about the movie since Foley's appearance on ``Good Morning
America'' with Blaustein in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has hurt the movie,'' said Blaustein of McMahon's
actions. ``Not being on (USA's Monday night) `Raw' and (UPN's
Thursday night) `Smackdown' has kept us from getting to the casual
wrestling fan.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, World Championship Wrestling _ which wouldn't
sign releases for wrestlers to be in the movie, although Diamond
Dallas Page talked to Blaustein at length _ has run the trailer and
is helping Terry Funk promote the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I never did this movie for the money,'' Blaustein said.
``This is something along the line of a big home movie. I never
thought it would be up for some award or even have a threatrical
release. I just wanted to make it for people who could care less
about wrestling but are interested in people's stories.''

   From his official Web site, Chris Jericho said this about Hulk
Hogan: ``I think the time has come for Hulk Hogan to step down. His
promo on `Nitro' this past week was embarrassing and the man who is
a legend in the business, has now become a parody of himself. I
find it sad to watch as I have great respect for him, but I can't
condone how he constantly refuses to pass the torch and give the
rub to the future legends of this sport.'' Tell us how you really
feel Chris.

   ECW stars Tommy Dreamer and New Jack will guest star in an
episode of the CBS drama ``Early Edition'' in May. In other ECW
news, former tag team champs, The Pitbulls, could be returning.
</P>
<P>
   WWF has lost Billy Gunn to a shoulder injury for up to six
months. He had surgery on the torn rotator cuff last week.
</P>
<P>
   The release date for the WCW movie, ``Ready to Rumble,'' has
been moved up from April 14 to April 7.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to see suspended wrestler Scott Steiner back on WCW
telecasts beginning in April. Also Goldberg is expected to return
from his arm injury before the mid-April pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of WCW pay-per-views, wrestling expert Dave Meltzer
said the buy rate for February's ``Superbrawl'' is around a .15.
That is the lowest buy rate ever for one of the big two wrestling
companies. He also said it is lower than most ECW buyrates.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In their early incarnations, Internet retailers were chided for
spending more time creating pretty and entertaining sites than
actually delivering quality products, on time, to the right place.
Duly chastened, they spent 1999 building stronger fulfillment and
customer service systems.
</P>
<P>
   Now that those systems are mainly in place, many Web merchants
are devoting an increasing amount of time and money to implementing
audio and video features _ hoping to provide so entertaining an
experience that users will stay glued to the computer, credit cards
at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   These companies are taking advantage of faster connection speeds
and better technologies from audio and video providers to feed
users a multimedia experience that would have choked their
computers as recently as a year ago. But while technology is making
it easier for sites to create that experience, retailers are still
grappling with hard questions about how much media to mix with
their commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very fine line between offering an entertaining
interactive experience and alienating people who aren't as tech
savvy or who may not have the connection speed to make it work
well,'' said Ian Yolles, vice president of Nike.com. ``It's a very
delicate balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike's audio and video efforts have been steadily building since
the site's official rollout last summer. Now Nike.com includes
several multimedia programs, the most notable example being the
company's ``Cliffhanger'' promotion that worked in conjunction with
Nike television ads. The ads showed famous athletes involved in
chase scenes, and directed viewers to a Nike Web site to see
various endings of the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Yolles said the campaign was somewhat risky because it required
``a certain amount of technical sophistication'' on the part of the
users, including the most up-to-date software for viewing Internet
multimedia presentations. ``And the higher the bandwidth, the
better the performance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're interested in the younger consumer,'' Yolles said,
noting that those types of consumers are more apt to have both
high-speed connections _ as do most college students _ and the
newest software. ``So we really hit that sweet spot.''
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of that and other multimedia presentations,
Yolles said Nike's traffic to the site increased 50 percent in
January over the previous month, ``and we expect the same in
February.'' Yolles declined to cite sales figures, but said that
``the risk really paid off for us.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Elaine Rubin, an e-commerce consultant and
chairwoman of Shop-.org, an industry trade group, ``users are going
to see a lot more of this type of thing in the future,'' as Web
sites try to emulate the store environments made popular by Barnes
&AMP; Noble and NoodleKidoodle, a toy store ``where you take the kids
when there's nothing to do, and oh, by the way, buy four or five
things while you're there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that on the simplest level, e-commerce sites were
starting to include background music, just as stores do. Barnes &AMP;
Noble's online store (www.bn.com), for instance, recently rolled
out its ``BN Radio'' feature, enabling users to listen to a
selection of background music while browsing. Notably, the feature
allows users to continue listening as they surf other sites, since
the audio technology, made by RealNetworks, streams music in the
background of the Web browser's software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also see extending this to other areas,'' said Daniel
Blackman, vice president of music, video and software for
barnesandnoble.com. ``People could listen to a tax expert give
advice while they are looking at tax software.''
</P>
<P>
   Since a ``buy'' button displays the artist or speaker featured
in the audio, Blackman said, ``It not only extends our brand, but
it's a fantastic way to capitalize on the impulse buy.''

ENTREPRENEURIAL SIBLINGS; `PUSH TECHNOLOGY' RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (lh) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENTREPRENEURIAL SIBLINGS TAKE TO THE NET AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   These days, when an entrepreneur says he has a revolutionary
business plan that will forever change commerce using the Internet,
it's wise to raise an eyebrow, if not hit the mute button.
</P>
<P>
   But when the entrepreneurs in question are the brothers Jay and
Paul Shen, it may be worth listening in.
</P>
<P>
   The latest venture from the siblings Shen, each of whom already
has a hundred-million-dollar dot-com success to his credit, is
called myCustoms.com.
</P>
<P>
   The business, which is in a market test and set for a summer
rollout, is designed to enable e-commerce companies to expand their
overseas business by automating the import-export function.
</P>
<P>
   The Shens say they are seeking to solve what they describe as a
major kink in the international e-commerce pipeline. Most
e-commerce companies, they say, do not even entertain the idea of
overseas customers because they do not want to take the time and
energy to navigate myriad customs laws or calculate the duties and
value-added taxes of countless nations.
</P>
<P>
   Enter myCustoms.com, which the brothers say will calculate taxes
and inform buyers and sellers on import-export laws. ``Now the
entire process is very manual, very labor intensive, not applicable
to online,'' said Jay Shen, 27, the company's co-founder and
president. MyCustoms.com will enable people to ``trade globally as
they do locally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers say the site could also enable themselves to get
even richer _ even if the Shens could afford to retire already. In
1998, Jay founded Billpoint, a service that allows person-to-person
credit card transactions online, and sold it last year to eBay for
$125 million.
</P>
<P>
   His older brother Paul, 37, who is myCustoms.com's chief
executive, co-founded the iMedia Corp. in 1994. He sold iMedia,
which makes digital video software, to Terayon Communication
Systems last year for $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The third co-founder of the new venture is Manoj Karamchandani,
formerly vice president for international operations at eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Given their previous successes, why don't the brothers do what
so many other wealthy technology executives are doing these days _
sit back and invest their money in other people's entrepreneurial
efforts?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just looking for a financial gain,'' Jay Shen said.
``This product will really help society as a whole.''

   `PUSH TECHNOLOGY' RETURNS IN A FORM THAT IS MORE POLITE
</P>
<P>
   It was only a few years ago now that Pointcast's ``push''
technology was touted as the next big thing. But at the end of this
month the Pointcast news and information service will officially
become a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Pointcast has been living on borrowed time since last May, when
Launchpad Technologies acquired the company for $7 million and
formed a new company, Entrypoint. Now, Entrypoint has informed the
some 400,000 remaining Pointcast users that the service is being
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Pointcast, introduced in February 1996, automatically delivers
news and other information from the Internet to users' screens. But
while push technology quickly gained fame and garnered numerous
industry awards, it consumed more than five megabytes of the user's
hard drive and was notorious for clogging corporate networks. And
many people complained that Pointcast was simply too obtrusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a great idea in there,'' said Francis Costello,
president and chief operating officer of Entrypoint and former head
of Launchpad, which itself was a spinoff of the technology
incubator Idealab. ``They had not done some things that were fairly
obvious, like make it smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Entrypoint is hoping that it can avoid losing Pointcast's
customers altogether by converting them to its own information
delivery service. Called Entrypoint 2.0 (www.entrypoint.com), the
service displays information in an on-screen toolbar that has
various buttons linking users instantly to shopping, financial and
news sites of their own choice. Users can make purchases using
credit card information stored in an ``eWallet,'' _ technology that
Launchpad developed to simplify online purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Pointcast, which transmitted those megabytes worth of
data to an individual's hard drives whether the person wanted it or
not, Entrypoint sends only information the user has requested _
like updates on stock activity and the latest shopping deals.
</P>
<P>
   It is push technology, in other words, that is intended to be a
lot less pushy.

IDEAS INTO PRODUCTS, WITH THE WEB; WORKS IN PROGRESS BY YOUNG 
INVENTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's say you own a widget company whose research and
development team has invented a machine grease that was a failure
on the factory floor but unexpectedly turns out to be a superior
formula for furniture polish.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, you might have made some informal phone calls
to your network of business associates, discreetly trying to
license the idea to a more appropriate company. Now, however, you
have the option of posting the invention on one of a growing number
of online intellectual property trading sites that promise to make
such technological matchmaking swifter, easier and more precise.
</P>
<P>
   The newest of these sites, run by a privately held company in
Cambridge, Mass., contends that it offers a fundamentally different
approach to the swapping and selling of intellectual property
online. The company, yet2.com (www.yet2.com _ and, yes, that is
pronounced ``yet to come''), says it offers a place to trade not
just patents but also trade secrets, unpatented inventions and
simple technological know-how.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old model was that nobody shared anything with anybody,''
said Ben du Pont, the president of yet2.com and an
eighth-generation descendant of E.I. du Pont, the founder of the
DuPont Co. ``The new model is that anybody can register for free
with yet2.com to hear about new technologies and to hear about them
right away. It's a fundamental shift.'' Du Pont said he got the
idea for the site when he was an employee at DuPont and grew
frustrated in trying to license a promising new polymer.
</P>
<P>
   Chris De Bleser, the chief executive of yet2.com, said the
site's approach was influenced by the practices of patent lawyers,
who typically pride themselves on being able to disclose enough
information about a new technology to get a patent, but not so much
that a competitor can build a workable prototype by simply reading
the patent.
</P>
<P>
   A certain patent might disclose the formula for a new polymer,
for example. But what the patent will not say, De Bleser said, ``is
that in order to get the goo to come out of the vat, you need to
kick it a couple of times and twist the nozzle to the left.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to patents, the site will trade in technology
packages that might include engineering expertise or advice on
regulatory compliance. Du Pont says companies and inventors can
also use yet2.com to sell inventions long before they receive
patents. ``Because we're not only about patents, it's possible to
post very recently discovered technologies,'' he said. ``DuPont
will be posting over 100 recently discovered technologies, all of
which are patent-pending.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would companies post their unprotected technology on a Web
site where any corporate spy could take a peek? What you see on the
site are simply marketing documents that contain no real
proprietary information and that do not identify the company that
owns the technology.

   Works in Progress By Young Inventors
</P>
<P>
   College-age inventors descended upon Washington last week for a
convention sponsored by the Smithsonian's Lemelson Center and the
National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance. A dozen
teams displayed their works in progress. Among the inventions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bubble-imaging technology from the California Institute of
Technology that gives a lava-lamp quality to digital displays.
</P>
<P>
   _ A crescent-shaped pillow from Hampshire College that provides
needed arm support for women who have just had breast surgery.
</P>
<P>
   _ A battery-powered cart from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology that will lower an aging gardener into a kneeling
position, then lift him back up again.
</P>
<P>
   _ A special swing from the University of Colorado at Boulder
that enables a person who is unable to pump her legs to swing
without assistance.
</P>
<P>
   _ A permeometer _ a device that measures how quickly a fluid
flows through a material _ from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
It enables the paper-making and fabric industries to measure
permeability 10 times more accurately than is now possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ A combination toilet seat and bathroom scale from the
University of Nevada at Reno. ``It was sort of a practical joke to
start with,'' explained Phil Weilerstein, program manager at the
collegiate inventors alliance. ``But then it became more serious
when the students realized it could be used in hospitals to monitor
the weight of patients.''

DIGITAL COMMERCE: CASE ILLUSTRATES ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY'S 
COPYRIGHT POWER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month, after 62 days in operation, the Canadian Internet
company iCraveTV.com was shut down by a lawsuit filed by the Motion
Picture Association of America. Its business, apparently legal in
Canada, is to redistribute live broadcast television programming on
its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Motion Picture Association sued iCraveTV in federal court
because it is illegal in the United States to redistribute
television without first obtaining permission from the programs'
owners. And it claimed that viewers in the United States could
circumvent iCraveTV's simple barriers to non-Canadians, such as
entering an area code. If the company had not stopped operations
immediately, says its president and co-founder, William Craig, it
could have been liable for ``hundreds of millions of dollars in
damages.''
</P>
<P>
   The most chilling aspect of the case, and there are many, was
Craig's response. That is, he did not argue the legality of the
action against him, but instead responded by inventing a technology
that could stop the discussion dead in its tracks.
</P>
<P>
   He contends that the Internet's ``haphazard'' design makes it
impossible to determine precisely where a user's computer is
located, and thus the copyright laws that he or she is subject to.
If he wanted to keep his business, he says, ``we had to find
another barrier to determine that someone is indeed in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   So his company promptly developed a technological protection
mechanism _ he says patents are already being filed _ that will
pinpoint where users of iCraveTV are located geographically, thus
barring anyone under the jurisdiction of United States-style
copyright restrictions from viewing protected programming outside
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Although he would not provide specifics about the new system,
Craig said he was convinced that this ``enhanced geographic
screening technology'' would soon be required to make the Internet
attractive enough for rights holders to put their content on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collectively, the Internet has to evolve and adapt,'' Craig
says. To effect that evolution, he says, ``what we're trying to do
is create `country-area networks' where you can have a computer
just serve a certain territory.'' This, he says, would enable
conventional content providers to ``control their rights within
that territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people are likely to object strongly to Craig's balkanized
Internet. Privacy and free speech issues aside, they might say _
for good reason _ that such a system would devolve the Internet
into a model very much like the restricted, centralized control of
cable television.
</P>
<P>
   That is a business model with which the $65 billion media and
entertainment industries _ the very ones that nearly sued the pants
off Craig _ are quite familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every context that it can, the entertainment industry is
trying to force the Internet into its own business model _ the
perfect control of content,'' wrote the constitutional scholar
Lawrence Lessig, whose column about the iCraveTV case recently
appeared in The Industry Standard, the Internet-focused business
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The industry obviously has the influence to do so. ``I think we
want to nail them to the wall now,'' said Jack Valenti, president
of the Motion Picture Association, at the time the iCraveTV suit
was filed.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month later, iCraveTV pulled the programming from
its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   What is most alarming, however, is that the content industries
seem to have successfully secured the legal means by which they
will be able to enforce this perfect control.
</P>
<P>
   The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which was heavily
promoted by the entertainment industries, contains a provision
called ``anti-circumvention.''
</P>
<P>
   It imposes ``a new kind of liability even in situations of fair
use'' of copyright-protected information, says Peter Jaszi, a law
professor at American University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In copyright terms, ``fair use'' describes the conditions under
which someone can legally use or excerpt a copyrighted work. But
under the anti-circumvention provision, it is illegal to crack a
copy protection technology for any reason. And anyone who makes,
sells or uses a device _ including a computer _ that is capable of
circumvention is engaging in a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   It was the anti-circumvention law, for example, that allowed a
DVD industry group to call for the arrest of a 16-year-old
Norwegian boy who had deconstructed and published the protection
code for a DVD movie, even though his intent was not to make
illegal copies. He cracked the code because he wanted to watch the
movie, which he legally owned, on his Linux computer, but no DVD
decoding software existed for the Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   What is worrisome about the DVD story is that in one fell swoop,
the content industries completely eliminated fair use _ any
situation in which the making of a copy might be considered legal _
from the discussion. If they use technology to lock up their
content, the mere unlocking of it is an actionable offense. End of
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were a copyright case, the Linux people might be able
to demonstrate the social utility was high and the commercial harm
was low,'' Jaszi says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it is so clearly weighted toward proprietary
interests, people who want to argue they're making responsible
unauthorized use of copyrighted materials have no place to stand,''
Jaszi says.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, if Craig's protection technology makes it to market,
anyone who attempts to circumvent his system _ even, for example,
for a broadcast that would be perfectly legal to watch free on a
television _ could also be subject to criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, innovation has been linked conclusively with
the free exchange of information and ideas _ by means of the public
library system, in the previous millennium, and certainly via the
Internet today. If everyone hermetically seals their content with
technology, Jaszi says, ``we could well end up with a world where
we have very strong protection for a rather limited range of
ultimately not very interesting content.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessig wrote: ``We could build a network to give content
providers perfect control. We could design a network that would be
the envy of the Soviets, encoding content control far more
effectively than any possible law. But that is not our tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Copyright law was never meant to grant owners perfect control,
and such control is certainly anathema to the free-flowing Internet
and the entrepreneurs who are enthusiastically making it work to
their advantage. The content industry's traditional method of
dealing with these challenges _ trying to extinguish or suppress
new technologies _ did not work with the introduction of video and
audio cassettes.
</P>
<P>
   And Jaszi says it never will. ``There's a tremendous opportunity
to cooperate with, and not resist, this technology,'' he says.
``What people want is choice, the ability to control the experience
of cultural consumption. You can't force them back into the box
that they have now escaped.''

 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An unlikely prophet is voicing a plea for reason and restraint
in the increasingly chaotic stampede toward the technological
future.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking ranks with the customarily optimistic and
self-congratulatory high-technology industry, Bill Joy, the chief
scientist of Sun Microsystems, has issued an impassioned critique
of uncontrolled progress in digital, biological and material
sciences. He has challenged scientists and engineers to rethink
their ethical standards and step back from advances that might
ultimately threaten the human species.
</P>
<P>
   In a 20,000-word essay in the April issue of Wired magazine,
which goes on sale Monday, Joy, a computer industry pioneer and one
of the nation's leading technical authorities, writes that although
the world has survived any number of potentially devastating
technologies developed in the 20th century, several new branches of
research pose threats of technological devastation at the hands of
a small group or even an individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 21st century technologies _ genetics, nanotechnology and
robotics _ are so powerful they can spawn whole new classes of
accidents and abuses,'' he writes in the article, titled, ``Why the
Future Doesn't Need Us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most dangerously, for the first time, these accidents and
abuses are widely within the reach of individuals or small
groups,'' he writes. ``They will not require large facilities or
rare raw materials. Knowledge alone will enable the use of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Such warnings about unbridled progress are not new, but until
now they have typically come from social critics or scientists
outside the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Joy is a leading computer researcher who developed
an early version of the Unix operating system while a graduate
student at the University of California at Berkeley. He helped
found Sun Microsystems and more recently has been involved in the
development of powerful software technologies like the Java
programming language and Jini, a system for linking hundreds of
thousands of appliances and other devices by way of the Internet.
He also served as co-chairman of a presidential commission on the
future of information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Joy also wrote a more generally optimistic cover article
titled ``Digital Wonders'' for the March 6 issue of Fortune
magazine. In a telephone interview, he said the Fortune piece was
focused on short-term issues in the computer industry, while the
Wired article addresses long-term forces that will be more
difficult to control.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in Aspen, Colo., where he moved in 1989 from Silicon
Valley to set up a small laboratory that explores new technologies
for Sun, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Joy's critique is striking because computer industry
technologists, almost without exception, take a more sanguine view
of the social consequences of advances. They typically argue that
any negative effects will be far outweighed by the positive effect
of new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Myhrvold, a physicist who is on leave from his job as the
chief technology officer at Microsoft Corp., said in an e-mail
interview, ``People have made apocalyptic predictions about
technology constantly for as long as there has been technology. I
think it is because change frightens them. What is more, the most
common form these dire predictions take is `this next generation of
stuff _ wow! that is really different and really scary.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the new technologies will be more difficult to control in
the future, Joy argues, because most are being driven by the
commercial sector, not by the military, which in the past has
controlled many potentially dangerous technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Hillis, a computer scientist who founded Thinking Machines
Inc., an early supercomputer company, said of Joy: ``Bill is pretty
unusual. There are very few technologists who step back and try to
look at the whole picture. Most who do tend toward optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   Joy argues that advances are now on the horizon in each of the
three areas he addresses. In the field of robotics, he warns of a
generation of superintelligent machines that could compete with
their human creators for resources. Such possibilities have
recently been addressed by other technologist-authors, including
Ray Kurzweil (``The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers
Exceed Human Intelligence''), Hans Moravec (``Robot: Mere Machine
to Transcendent Mind'') and George Dyson (``Darwin Among the
Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence'').
</P>
<P>
   In genetics, Joy worries that the widening availability of
knowledge about powerful genetic engineering will lead to a ``white
plague'' _ a human-designed disease that can kill selectively.
</P>
<P>
   In nanotechnology, he describes the increasing possibility of an
accidental or intentional release of a submicroscopic
self-replicating mechanism that could cause widespread destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Such a calamity was first suggested by Kurt Vonnegut. In his
novel ``Cat's Cradle,'' a substance called ice-nine sets off a
thermal chain reaction that leads to the freezing of the oceans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have looked at all of this as science fiction,
and as a result they haven't taken it seriously,'' Joy said.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of his warning, he writes, is an attribute that has
not been true of destructive technologies until now but is a part
of all of the most compelling 21st-century technologies: the
ability to self-replicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``While replication in a computer or a computer network can be a
nuisance,'' he writes, ``uncontrolled self-replication in these
newer technologies runs a much greater risk: a risk of substantial
damage in the physical world.''
</P>
<P>
   Joy insists he is not a Luddite, and yet he also argues that the
issues raised by the convicted bomber Theodore Kaczynski have not
been adequately addressed by the nation's technologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kaczynski's actions were murderous and, in my view, criminally
insane,'' he writes. ``But simply saying this does not dismiss his
argument; as difficult as it is for me to acknowledge, I saw some
merit in the reasoning.''
</P>
<P>
   Joy suggests parallels between the ethical dilemma faced by
nuclear physicists in the invention and the use of the atomic and
hydrogen bombs and similar challenges facing technologists today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have learned a lesson from the making of the first
atomic bomb and the resulting arms race,'' he writes. ``We didn't
do well then, and the parallels to our current situation are
troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   He argues that today's scientists must find a path that was not
taken by physicists during World War II: ``I feel, too, a deepened
sense of personal responsibility _ not for the work I have already
done, but for the work that I might yet do, at the confluence of
the sciences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only realistic alternative I see,'' he writes in Wired,
``is relinquishment: to limit development of the technologies that
are too dangerous, by limiting our pursuit of certain kinds of
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the precedent of the decision by the U.S. government to
abandon the development of biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Verification in the case of genetics, robotics and
nanotechnology, however, will require that scientists adopt strict
codes of ethics, he writes.
</P>
<P>
   In the telephone interview last week, Joy said he doubted that
the development of advances could be reined in in the commercial
world, and he criticized scientists as being largely silent on the
inherently destructive potential of rapidly evolving technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought a technological species could expect to
survive the ever-accelerating evolution of its market-driven
technologies, Joy said: ``The answer is `yes, but not without
additional care.' I think it's possible _ but it's not a given.
Survival won't come for free.''

 &HT;    TECH INDUSTRY DESPERATE FOR FOREIGN WORKERS, DELL SAYS
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFAX, Va. _ High-tech companies are facing worker shortages
so severe that only an infusion of foreign labor can help, Dell
Computer Corp. chairman Michael Dell said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should move quickly to approve legislation raising the
annual limit on the number of high-skilled immigrants allowed to
enter the country on H-1B visas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cap should definitely be increased because there is a huge
shortage of workers,'' Dell said at the Global Internet Summit at
George Mason University in Northern Virginia. ``If you want to
bring wealth to this country, you'll bring in knowledgable
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's tight labor pool is driving up the cost of doing
business, he said. ``What happens is the limited supply of workers
who actually have the skills get bid up, just like Internet
stocks,'' Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   Spiraling wages in this country could spur U.S. employers to
expand overseas, he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering several bills that would boost the
annual limit on H-1B visas from 115,000 to as much as 195,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dell blamed the worker shortage on educators who are failing to
teach young people the skills they need to get jobs in the
economy's booming technology sector. ``The education system needs
to fundamentally embrace the idea of computing being a central
skill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Dell Computer can find workers in coming years, the
company has ``a massive opportunity'' to grow along with the
Internet, he said. Besides making personal computers, the company
will be focusing on building the Internet infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the Internet, ``there is a huge buildout that
has yet to come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said his company was hurt last year by a shortage of
components, but with that problem now solved, the company is ``in a
great position.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth of hand-held, high-tech devices such as the Palm
Pilot, are not a threat to Dell Computer because consumers still
want big-screen personal computers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a Palm Pilot or a cell phone, ``you just can't display that
much information,'' he said. In the future, people will use
phone-sized devices for ``for small bits of information,'' he said.
``But the PC takes on the role for (handling) more complex
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell also said that if Congress were to allow states to impose
sales taxes on interstate retail transactions, his company would be
able to adapt to the change without losing business. But he warned
that because cyberspace is borderless, U.S. online retailers might
move operations overseas to avoid taxes.

 &HT;    Some lessons on e-mail
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes I think I should give e-mail lessons. For
one thing, just because I've been using e-mail for more years than
some of my readers have lived, I have a lot of practice. For
another, I have made a living writing for a long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of that writing was at big advertising agencies,
convincing people to buy everything from bags of charcoal to boxes
of fruit. You've got to figure that, if I had been a bricklayer for
30 years or so instead of a writer, that even a slow student would
learn a few skills along the way. If a person does that sort of
work long enough and survives, he learns a little bit about using
words in an effective way.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us would like to do that with e-mail. But judging from
the e-mail I get, a lot of people out there don't take the time to
do it well. Whether you're using e-mail _ as I did the other day _
to complain to an airline about lousy service, or to network with
potential employers, or even just to stay in touch with friends,
there are some ways to do a better job.
</P>
<P>
   So today, I'll take off my techno-guru hat, put on my writer hat
and give you some advice about simple ways to make your e-mail more
fun and more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Rule One: Have something to say and say it positively. Spend a
little time trying to figure out how to craft what you want to say.
Since e-mail is such an instant communication, some people type
without thinking. This rule is especially important with business
mail. If you react angrily, or with a mean spirit, you've made
things worse. Remember that, with this type of e-mail, you are
often trying to accomplish something, to convince someone. And _
just as is true in face-to-face conversations _ insults or
posturing seldom accomplish much in a positive way.
</P>
<P>
   Rule Two: Use simple and direct sentences. There's nothing worse
_ and I get plenty of e-mail like this _ than a wordy e-mail that
leaves me wondering what that person is trying to say. I've
literally gotten some where I can't tell if the person is
complaining, praising or asking a question. Remember that, unlike
in spoken conversation, the reader can't ask what you mean, can't
see your expression (or in my case, the way I'm waving my arms
around), so if you have to choose between clarity and drama, pick
clarity. Use complete sentences, and read your mail back to
yourself to see if it would make sense to you if you'd never met
the person sending it.
</P>
<P>
   Rule Three: Be friendly, even when you don't feel that way. Some
people believe that _ to demonstrate their strong feelings _ they
have to start off an e-mail with an insult. That makes it difficult
for the reader to absorb the rest of the message with an open mind.
Unless the whole notion of the e-mail is to show how angry you are
(and there are times when that's appropriate), try to sound
reasonable and friendly. If you are trying to convince someone to
do something or think something or to listen to you, you'll
accomplish more by coming across as a reasonable person. You can
still disagree strongly without insulting someone. Let's say the
rental car folks messed up. In a face-to-face encounter you
wouldn't (I hope) stalk up to the car rental counter and say:
You're an idiot, and I want you to help me. You know that wouldn't
get you much help. Instead, you'd try to win the person over, get
him or her on your side. The same rules apply in e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Rule Four: Rely on facts, not just opinions. It's just another

 &HT;    Let your talking do your dialing
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Innovation comes in waves.
</P>
<P>
   The invention of the printed book saved us the hassle of having
to listen to someone tell a story. Then the radio came along and
saved us from having to read. Now we could listen to someone while
in our bathrobes if we wanted. Television meant we didn't have to
picture what the storytellers looked like anymore, and phones meant
we could let our fingers do the walking.
</P>
<P>
   But we still had to dial the seven, or 10, digits.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently. A company called Digital Acoustics has software
that lets you pick up a phone and dial a number as simply as saying
``Mom'' or ``pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   The software, Tell A Phone, works on any phone; special phones
are not needed. A user just picks up the telephone, listens for a
dial tone and speaks the name associated with a number he or she
wants dialed. The software confirms the number before it dials. The
process takes less than three seconds, according to the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, www.digitalacoustics.com/tellaph, offers some
basic information about the software:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can I use voice-dial from all the phones in my home?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, Tell A Phone works with every phone connected to the
same line as your compatible modem or Voice Dial Manager.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What if I have two phone lines in my home or office?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tell A Phone voice-dials on one line. If your modem is
connected on a line that is normally not used for your telephone
calls, you would need to add a compatible modem devoted for
voice-dialing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do I need to leave my computer on all the time?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, to use the features of Tell A Phone, you need to have
your computer turned on. This should not be a major issue or
expense. Modern computer power management uses less power than a
single, low-wattage light bulb. In standby mode, it is even less.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can I use my existing address book with the Tell A Phone
software?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tell A Phone uses its own phone book that imports from
personal information manager databases, including Lotus Organizer,
Microsoft Outlook, Symantec ACT and Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which family members can use Tell A Phone's voice-dialing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tell A Phone uses a speech-recognition engine that does not
require training. Once a name is typed into the phone directory, it
is available for voice-dialing. There is no age or gender
requirement, although our tests have shown that children under 6-7
years do not provide the speech patterns required for reliable
speech recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Tell A Phone language- or accent-dependent?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, Tell A Phone Version 2.3 works with ``American
English.'' Other accents and languages are available, such as
Canadian English, British English, French, Canadian French, Spanish
and 10 other languages.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can I dial by speaking partial names, rather than full names,
in my phone list?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tell A Phone offers the option of speaking any part of a
two-word name or phrase. If the option ``Recognize Partial Names''
is enabled, you can say ``John,'' ``Smith'' or ``John Smith'' to
dial the same number entered for ``John Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is Dial Logging?
</P>
<P>
   A: A feature available in Tell A Phone. Every time you dial,
Tell A Phone will record the digits you've dialed in your ``call
log.'' If you forget a number, Tell A Phone will have a record of
that number.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is a Caller ID announcement?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you subscribe to Caller ID through your local telephone
company, you can have Tell A Phone announce incoming calls from
your PC.
</P>
<P>
   To use Tell A Phone, you need a computer with a Pentium 90 or
greater processor, 32 megabytes of RAM, 20 megabytes of hard disk
space and a Windows 95 or newer operating system. You also would
need a Windows-compatible sound card and speakers, a serial or USB
port, and Caller ID for your telephone.

 &HT;    Surfing for personal pages brings fond Web memories
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the World Wide Web was young, it was an
amateurish place, in a good way. It was not nearly as commercial as
it is today. Besides the academic and government pages, there were
personal Web pages that gave a true glimpse of the lives of
ordinary people from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The personal pages are still there _ in fact, like every other
part of the Web, the number of them has grown greatly. However, the
personal aspect of the Web has diminished as it has become more of
a tool for selling and providing information.
</P>
<P>
   Since personal pages are difficult to find compared with
commercial ones, our starting point will be at one of the largest
providers of free home pages on the Web: GeoCities. Go to
geocities.yahoo.com/home/ and you will see that the pages are
organized in neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Simply click on one of the neighborhoods _ say, Hollywood _ and
you'll find that these pages have been grouped by a topic that
suits the name Hollywood. You'll find personal pages and those
created by organizations devoted to fandom.
</P>
<P>
   If you hanker for something even more personal, select the
Heartland neighborhood instead, where you'll find family home pages
and pages devoted to personal topics.
</P>
<P>
   One warning _ and GeoCities is a relatively clean town by Web
standards, so this applies to all the personal pages you'll see:
Home pages are not generally censored. So, if you make this search
a family activity, make sure that you screen any of the pages
before your children see them.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop is a fascinating collection of links to personal
home pages called Personal Homepages on the Web at
imc.iit.edu/internet.access/personalhomepages.html. Using the links
you find here, you'll be able to literally trace the history of
personal pages on the Web. For instance, click on the link for the
Well and you'll find a place (www.well.com:80/Community/) that, as
described on this page, was ``one of the earliest Internet service
providers ... a true community. Of course, it's in San Francisco,
so it's a different kind of community. ...'' It has all kinds of
pop culture represented, as well as San Francisco's (and other
cities') gay population.
</P>
<P>
   Other links on the compilation page will take you to personal
home pages selected for their novelty and interest by the Mining
Company, a professional Web search organization. You'll find those
Web pages at www.cs.ucla.edu/csd /people/undergrads.html.
</P>
<P>
   Still, from the compilation page, you'll be able to visit the
Web pages maintained by college students at schools such as UCLA
(www.cs.ucla.edu/csd/people/undergrads.html), Florida State
(www.cs.fsu.edu/people/undergrads.html), Carnegie-Mellon
(www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/usr) and Stanford
(www.stanford.edu/leland/dir.html).
</P>
<P>
   Soon you won't need any links or help, if you enjoy this type of
old-fashioned Web surfing (a term that is pretty much out of
fashion these days).
</P>
<P>
   One of the interesting things about visiting the lives of
strangers is that _ on at least half the pages _ you'll find links
to other personal Web pages maintained by friends and relatives.
And, with any luck, you'll meet people from around the world and
experience some of the feeling of what things were like in the
earliest days, when the surf was up.

 &HT;    Wireless now name of the game
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was once a big deal when a business installed a
computer network. The laying of the wires for that network signaled
a real advance in the way people worked.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, wires are out; wireless is in. You'll see exactly why
and how that is happening in the April issue of PC Computing. One
of the cover stories, ``The Wireless Revolution,'' says the key to
increased productivity now ``is cutting the cables. Smart companies
are using wireless technologies to work from anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In that same issue, look at the complex and sometimes mystifying
world of Internet domain names. If you're selling widgets, then the
Internet address of www. widgets.com (already taken, by the way)
can become a real asset to your business.
</P>
<P>
   The article is called ``The Name Game,'' and you'll learn why
some companies are paying as much as $7.5 million just for the
rights to use a specific name. You'll also find out how at least
one man is getting rich because of that.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Big brother just got some help watching the e-mail you send from
work. There's a new program, aimed at businesses, called
MailMarshal (from Networking Technologies) that watches for leaks
of confidential information and personal abuses by ``customized
filtering of all incoming and outgoing e-mail and attachments.''
</P>
<P>
   While you are unlikely to buy the product to use at home, you
may want to know about it if you are an employee or an employer.
Networking Technologies says the program is in use at
Scientific-Atlanta, Campbell Soup and Volkswagen of America.
</P>
<P>
   Oh baby! Now you can buy what is described on the package as a
``virtual bundle of joy.'' It's a program called Babyz from
Mindscape Entertainment, and what you get is an on-screen baby who
can learn to talk and who lives in a virtual computerized house.
Users design their own baby's appearance and then watch him grow.
The program is available for PCs with at least a Pentium
166-megahertz processor and sells for about $40.

   It's mid-March and almost time for the swallows to come back to
Capistrano. Legend has it that the swallows first came to an old
mission in the California city ``seeking sanctuary from an
innkeeper who destroyed their nests. ... They return to the site
each year to nest, knowing their young can be safe within the
mission walls.''
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to make sure that the swallows get home in good
shape this year, you can follow the progress at
www.sanjuancapistrano.org/theswallows.htm.

   If you're trying to do a better job investing your money but
need a little help in these volatile times for the stock market,
check out a Web site at
www.ragingbull.com/mboard/boards.cgi?board &QC; QA.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be able to leave questions and get answers. However, keep
in mind that the accuracy of those answers from other investors may
be suspect. The really successful ones may be out on their yachts,
not typing answers on a computer.

 &HT;    Free access to Internet
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Will you provide me with the companies that provide free
Internet access?
</P>
<P>
   _Larry Morrow Sr.,
</P>
<P>
   Sue: There are tons. Your e-mail address indicated you already
are using AOL. Do a simple Web search for ``free Internet,'' and
you'll find a slew of options.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Here are a few that we dug out: Juno (juno.com), Free ISP
(www.isps-free.com/) or freeinternet (www.freeinternet.com/).
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Freeinternet.com made getting online a piece of cake. In a
few clicks I downloaded the application and set up my computer. It
even has a Mac client.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Also, if you are currently not online, sweet-talk a buddy
who has Internet access into helping you sign up. Many sites will
ask you to register online, download configuration information and
necessary dial-up applications. Or many of them will ship you a CD
with everything you need.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I need help with e-mail, I just don't know how to: send link,
send page, forward message, carbon copy, blind copy. Can you
suggest anywhere I can get help?
</P>
<P>
   _Henry Reid, St. Simons Island
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You know, Henry, Jacki's trying real hard to finagle a trip
to St. Simons out of this. She's a lighthouse freak and always
dreams up excuses to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Hey, be nice. There are several tutorials at your
fingertips, depending on your e-mail client. If you are new to
e-mail, go to Newbie-U (www.newbie-u.com/) and click on the e-mail
link. You can pick up some basics.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Newbie-U also has links that explain specific information
about how to use three of the biggie e-mail clients: Microsoft,
Netscape and Eudora. You also could hit the FAQs or tech support
links for these clients. Microsoft:
support.microsoft.com/directory/; Netscape:
help.netscape.com/faqs/mail.html; or Eudora:
www.eudora.com/techsupport/tutorials/.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I have an iMac and an Epson 740 printer. When I changed from
Navigator 4.0 to Netscape Communicator 4.7, the printer prints tiny
print and pictures from the Net. The printer prints OK in
everything but Communicator. I installed Apple's firmware and patch
1.1. Suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   _William Akers
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: It sounds like your Page Setup needs a little tweakin'.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: From File, select Page Setup and change Page Attributes to
Netscape Communicator. In there you will see an option to Fit to
Page if possible. Deselect that option.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Also, take a look at Scale while you are in Page Setup.
Is it set to 20 percent or something? Bump up the percentage. Once
you've deselected it, be aware that you may end up printing extra
pages (usually blank) that pick up the edges of the page. When you
print, take a guess at how many pages it might be and change your
page range.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Page Setup options may vary depending on your printer
driver.

 &HT;    A little tough to tackle
 &HT;    By Dale Roe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Humongous Entertainment's Junior Sports division
has a new addition to the lineup. Backyard Football ($20,
www.humongous.com) lets kids organize pick-up games with some
familiar Junior Sports Backyard Bunch characters and adds
Humongously rendered kid versions of real NFL stars such as John
Elway and Jerry Rice. The game's interface is comparable to other
Junior Sports games (Backyard Baseball, Backyard Soccer) but play
is more difficult to master, perhaps because children in the game's
target age range (5-10) are less familiar with football than these
other sports. As in Backyard Baseball, kids can choose different
neighborhood fields on which to play, but the ability to designate
weather conditions is a fun, new feature exclusive to Backyard
Football. Humongous' new Junior Sports Network allows players with
Windows systems to play real-time with other children over the
Internet _ fun for them but a bummer for kids with Macs. We were
hoping for another Humongous touchdown, but this title might be
spending more time on the bench than in the CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   Backyard Football for Windows 98/95 requires a Pentium 90 or
better processor, 16MB RAM and a 4x CD-ROM. On a Macintosh, you'll
need a 133 Mhz or better PowerPC, System 7.5.3 or newer, 32 MB RAM
and a 4x CD-ROM.

POOR CHILDREN IN DETROIT ENTER THE COMPUTER AGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Small hands shot up when Daniel S. Varner asked his
after-school class of mostly poor, mostly African-American children
here, ``Who can tell me what the Internet is?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a big dictionary,'' said Jordan Nichols, 9. ``A new
way of communication,'' offered Stacey Blair, 12. And across the
room, Terrell Brazier, 13, said, ``It's a superhighway to anything
you want.''
</P>
<P>
   To these children, and others like them who grow up poor, the
Internet is all that and much more. It can be a path to the future,
all right, but its effect may be more profound on those who do not
know how to use it. With more and more jobs requiring computer and
Internet literacy, experts fear that children not exposed to those
skills will be left further behind in the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of Detroit lawyers who wanted to keep that from
happening have chucked their law careers to start an unusual
program here that helps poor children join the information age.
They draw hundreds of children into after-school sports leagues,
then offer free computer training. The children learn not only how
to use the computers, but also how to take them apart, fix them and
put them together again. The trophy they bring home is a
hand-me-down computer _ there are enough for everyone on the sports
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew kids needed the character that comes with team sports,
and we knew they needed the tools of the future that come with
access to technology,'' said Michael F. Tenbusch, who founded the
nonprofit group Think Detroit with Varner in 1997. Early on, the
group organized sports leagues for children.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the group began setting up 17 computer
laboratories in churches, schools and nonprofit agencies _ enough
to serve 2,000 people last year _ filling them with used computers
donated by area companies. But it became clear that closing the gap
in computer access would require reaching homes.
</P>
<P>
   So in November, Think Detroit switched strategies and began the
Balls and Bytes program _ combining baseball, soccer and basketball
leagues with computer classes for children over 10. The group has
donated about 30 computers and plans to give away 200 more this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Blair, a seventh grader at Westside Christian Academy,
said that when she joined the group's baseball team, she didn't
know she would also get a computer. spends about an hour a day on
the computer, and she came back to Varner's class to learn how to
use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Her first computer classes were intimidating. ``I can't do
this,'' Stacey remembered thinking. After the instructor took the
machines apart and ``showed us which spaces were for the
motherboard and the cards,'' she said, ``then I was like, this is
pretty easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show children like Stacey are at risk of being
bystanders inthe digital age. Although virtually the same
percentage of all children have some access to computers at school,
poor and African-American children are far less likely to use a
home computer, according to a poll conducted last month by National
Public Radio, the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard's John F.
Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the computer and the Internet can be such an important
set of skills to be marketable for the economy,'' said Mollyann
Brodie, a vice president of the Kaiser foundation. ``Any digital
divide will further exacerbate the gaps we've always had in our
country between the haves and have-nots.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit is a good example, since it is the nation's poorest big
city. Many poor children here will not go to college. In the past,
they might have had a Ford factory in their futures, at best. Now
few workers with only a high school diploma can pass the screening
tests auto makers require.
</P>
<P>
   Social workers say the gap may be even more acute for poor
people who are already out of school and have had little contact
with computers.
</P>
<P>
   Carris M. Carey, a social worker at Focus: Hope, a nonprofit
organization in Detroit that trains poor people to work in the auto
industry, said, ``The kids who are in the younger generation _ the
18-to-25 range _ have had some type of exposure to computers,''
even if it is not as much as the children of wealthy families have.
But, Carey said, older poor people are seldom familiar with
computers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That observation was echoed in the new national poll, Brodie
said. ``The gaps by income are just profound,'' she said. The poll
found that 56 percent of those in the 18-40 age group earning less
than $30,000 a year had a home computer, while 87 percent of those
earning more than $50,000 a year had one.
</P>
<P>
   Public schools here are struggling to keep up with their
counterparts in school districts that are better off. All 263
schools in the district have now been wired for computer access,
but not all schools have computers, particularly up-to-date ones,
to attach to the wires, said Stan Childress, a spokesman for the
Detroit Public Schools. ``None of our schools have computers in
every classroom, and that is a goal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the secondhand computers from Think Detroit will help
close the gap between technology haves and have-nots in two ways
First, more children each month are being given computers to take
home. Second, they are teaching older family members how to use
them.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Brazier, a sixth grader at George Crockett Academy, a
charter school here, brought home one of the Think Detroit
computers after playing baseball and basketball on one of the teams
set up by the organization.
</P>
<P>
   His mother works at a Target store and an older brother is a
security guard, so when he got the computer home, ``I had to teach
them, my mom and my brother, how to use it,'' Troy said during a
break from Varner's Internet class. ``I'm still trying to learn a
little more.''

PUSH FOR PATRON SAINT AIMS FOR A WEB HEAVENLY LINK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JUDITH GAINES   c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Pasta eaters have their own patron saint. So
do tax collectors, beggars, seekers of lost articles, supporters of
lost causes, students, people with sore throats or troubled
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   St. Giles guides the disabled, St. Expedito aids the
procrastinator, St. Raphael will get a friendship back on track.
But cyberspace, so far, is saintless.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as more people spend more time surfing the captivating but
sometimes soulless ocean of information on the World Wide Web,
there's a movement underway urging the Vatican to name a patron
saint of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a gift of God, an asset to the human
condition. Why shouldn't the Catholic Church endorse it in this
way?'' asked Thomas Groome, professor of theology at Boston
College.
</P>
<P>
   But Groome and others acknowledge that the campaign is
questioned, given that the Internet offers browsers plenty of
pornographic and other unholy sites.
</P>
<P>
   The effort began in Europe and is being pushed through petitions
and other communiques to the Vatican. So far, two candidates have
been suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The one who apparently has the most support is Saint Isidore of
Seville (560-636 A.D.), a Spanish theologian who spoke several
languages and was widely considered the most learned man of his
time.
</P>
<P>
   In an age of growing barbarism and contempt for learning, he
created the ``Etymologiae,'' a 20-volume encyclopedia of everything
from grammar to birds, beasts, medicine, road-making, clothing, and
furniture, as well as meditations on the divine.
</P>
<P>
   ``His works became a storehouse of knowledge freely utilized by
innumerable Medieval authors,'' said Internet Observation Services,
an Italian group that nominated Isidore.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he was a one-man Web.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidate is San Pedro Regalado (1390-1456 A.D.), a
Spanish priest known for his ability to appear at more than one
place at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that not precisely what we do on the Internet?'' said Luis
Angel Largo, who heads the Asociacion Amigos del Pisuerga, a
religious group in Valladolid, Spain. The organization is urging
the pope to pick Regalado _ who, as it happened, lived in
Valladolid.
</P>
<P>
   There is no official word from the Vatican, where the Pontifical
Council for Social Communication and the Congregation for Divine
Worship and Services sometimes designate patron saints. But the
Papacy does not have to give its seal of approval to such a
selection.
</P>
<P>
   More often, patron saints _ who already have been canonized _
are picked through popular devotion or custom. They become viewed
as a protector of a place, occupation, or activity. St. Francis,
for instance, was a nature lover who became the patron of
ecologists.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, saints are credited with an ability to aid
people with a particular malady, such as St. Giles, a disabled
priest said to have special sympathy for those who are similarly
afflicted.
</P>
<P>
   St. Clare of Assisi is the patron saint of television because
one Christmas, too ill to leave her bed, she allegedly saw and
heard a Christmas Mass miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether the Internet needs a saint is generating
hot debate in the plugged-in crowd, Catholics and non-Catholic
alike.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1369 Coffeehouse in Cambridge, where several customers
had set up their laptops to work while sipping their java, some
thought the Net could benefit from divine oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could use a saint to get rid of all my spam mail,'' quipped
Teanna Babcock, 43, a teacher of boxing and martial arts in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an Internet saint could help her upload more quickly, or
have less down time, Babcock mused. In any case, Isidore sounded
like a good choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope he's a secure server,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But others balked at the prospect of an ultimate webmaster.
</P>
<P>
   A few tables away, Anna Kazanjian, 35, a graduate student at
Bunker Hill Community College, was working on a physics assignment.
She thought a patron saint sounded too much like an exclusively
Catholic idea, and non-Catholics wouldn't take to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of the Internet is that it's open to anybody,
regardless of their religious beliefs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Others said many Internet users don't feel spiritually bereft.
And some wondered if the current nominees might be too old to guide
the ever-changing and unruly Web.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 30 billion screen-sized pages of all descriptions
available worldwide, the Internet is still the wild, wild West,
said Don Orifice, 46, executive director of the North Shore
Computer Society.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't sure Net surfers would want a saint, but, if they do,
he thought a better choice might be St. Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't he the one you appeal to if you're lost, or trying to
find something?'' he said, adding that this is often the plight of
Web users.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston University, Mark Girolami, 27, a law student
specializing in classical and medieval studies, said an Internet
saint should be a more modern soul than Regalado or Isidore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Gates is the one who comes to mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saint Bill?
</P>
<P>
   Even Groome thought someone such as Mohandas K. Gandhi, the
Indian nationalist revered for his message of nonviolence, would be
more appropriate. Or Dorothy Day, the founder of the ``Catholic
Worker,'' known for her deep commitment to peace, justice, and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ever there was a time to break open the Catholic
imagination, if ever there was a time to canonize a non-Catholic,
surely the time is now,'' he said. ``And what better subject than
the Internet, which crosses so many lines of class and culture?''

IT'S ALMOST HERE: A STREAM OF ARTS VIA YOUR COMPUTER

 By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Technology is rapidly changing the way Americans consume
entertainment. Some day in the not-so-distant future, all forms of
recorded entertainment will be available, on demand or via
subscription services, over the Internet. Programming will become
more interactive, especially when it comes to e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of these changes are enormous, and they're
already shaking up the entertainment industry. The music business,
in particular, is facing a complete realignment; controversial
outsiders such as MP3.com and Napster.com have already launched
services that make digital distribution of music (and, by
extension, music piracy) easy for anyone with a basic working
knowledge of the Internet. So far, the recording industry has
mounted a two-pronged defense: It is suing Internet start-ups over
licensing fees and piracy issues, and it is also struggling to
develop a standard to secure digital music. To date, both efforts
have been fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   But lawsuits and resistance aren't going to stop the technology
revolution, which has the potential to open up opportunities for
new artists and to provide consumers more entertainment options at
a lower cost. Admittedly, the technology is still in its infancy:
Quality is unreliable, and content is limited. But that isn't
holding back the early adapters. On college campuses and in church
halls, ordinary folks are already changing their viewing,
listening, and reading habits. Here's a look at people who are
doing what we'll all be doing within a few years. &QL; 
Internet radio
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Jasmine Francis had to scour the radio dial to
find programs that played reggae; she was limited to one or two
weekly programs on local stations. But now she listens to
radiojamaica.com on the Internet, and she can can have all reggae,
all day, at both work and play. ``It's a cultural thing,'' Francis,
33, explains.
</P>
<P>
   Francis, a computer technician in the Cambridge public schools,
moved here from Jamaica with her mother and brothers in 1974.
Internet radio keeps her connected with her native culture. Her
friends in Jamaica listen to some of the same radio programs;
sometimes, she sends in song requests via e-mail and asks the DJ to
send out a hello to her cousin at home.
</P>
<P>
   Radio, in fact, has made the transition to the Internet faster
than any other medium has. There are thousands of online radio
stations offering every possible genre, from Christian to classical
to cutting-edge music. Most traditional stations now simulcast
their programming online, while such startup operations as
www.gogaga.com and www.live365.com offer Internet-only programs.
Many Net-only stations post their playlists online and provide
links for listeners to purchase CDs from such e-commerce outfits as
amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream folks tune in for any number of reasons. Pamela
Fallon listens regularly to a radio station in Moscow; a publicist
for rock promoter Don Law, Fallon once did publicity for Mikhail
Gorbachev and is studying Russian. ``It helps me with my language
skills,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Another user, Northeastern University graduate student Mary
Churchill, tunes in to a station in New Orleans, where she spent
her honeymoon. ``It brings back memories,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Memories waft out of the computer at the Francis household,
where the machine is plugged into the Internet via a cable modem.
Francis has a passion for the Irie beat, even though her daughters,
Myasha, 10, and Nicqueta, 12, have a taste for American teen pop
and hip-hop. ``The Internet lets me introduce them to Jamaican
culture,'' Francis says. That's not to say the technology is
perfectly seamless; when Internet use is extremely high, audio
programs can stutter and spurt. But fine-tuning the machinery is a
family affair for the Francis clan. ``My 10-year-old daughter gets
around the problems by changing all the settings,'' Francis notes.
``She knows all the little tricks.'' &QL; 
Music
</P>
<P>
   Forget MTV. Today's youth are saying, ``I want my MP3.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Jacob Bouvrie, a 21-year-old electrical engineering student
at MIT. A music aficionado and a musician himself, he owns several
hundred CDs. Like most students, he moves frequently, and he is
tired of lugging around all that plastic. The solution? He
converted his CD collection to a digital file format called MP3, a
relatively simple process. He now stores his music on his computer.
``Every time I change dorm rooms, I just carry my hard drive with
me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The MP3 format, which allows high-quality music to be stored on
a computer and distributed over the Internet, is wildly popular on
college campuses, and it's spreading to the workplace as well. But
it is anathema to the music industry, since it makes piracy as
simple as clicking a mouse. The Recording Industry Association of
America is currently suing MP3.com and Napster.com, which
distribute digital music in controversial ways. And Napster uses a
program that eats up bandwidth, and as such, it has been banned on
many college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of other students, Bouvrie is aware of the
establishment's wrath, but he still regularly downloads MP3 files.
He posts music recorded by his own band, called B Field, on the
MP3.com site; he doesn't expect to land a big contract, but he
appreciates the free exposure. And Napster allows him _ and other
remote users _ to share music files online. ``Legally speaking,
it's piracy,'' he says, ``but I don't have any qualms about it. My
musical tastes are obscure, and more often than not, MP3s have
prompted me to go out and buy the entire album.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, digital distribution is still in its infancy.
Portable MP3 players only store an hour's worth of songs; legal
content is still limited and the technology is feasible only for
users with high-speed Internet access such as broadband or DSL
(digital subscriber lines). But attitudes about the very concept of
music itself are changing. Todd Hiers, an MIT senior, has a new
definition for the MP3 generation. ``I tend to think of music as
information,'' he says. ``As data. Not as a physical object at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic books
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Billy Strayhorn isn't one of those ministers who
pontificates from the pulpit, looking down on his congregation. No,
the leader of the First United Methodist Church in Joshua, Texas,
gets down with the parishioners, moving among the people, pumping
flesh and patting backs as he quotes scripture from a handheld
text. But he's not lugging around the Bible; instead, he carries a
Rocket eBook, a $200 electronic reader that can store thousands of
pages of printed material. Strayhorn stores his sermons and prayer
list on the device, which he uses for daily devotionals, Sunday
services, even weddings and funerals.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one wedding rehearsal, a bunch of folks were interested in
computers, and I got more questions about the Rocket than about the
ceremony,'' Strayhorn, 48, recalls.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described technogeek, Strayhorn bought his electronic
reader in April. The consumer device, which is about the size of a
paperback, hit the market in late 1998; users can download texts
free from a number of Web sites (including www.rocket-library.com
or http://promo.net/pg) or purchase trade books and textbooks from
such commercial vendors as Barnes &AMP; Noble. The electronic library
is limited to thousands of titles, ranging from esoteric technical
books to classic and contemporary fiction. But so far, Strayhorn
has been able to satisfy his eclectic taste, which runs from the
Bible to science fiction, murder mysteries, and ``good, ol' spy
thrillers'' by authors such as Stephen King. But he hasn't been
able to find an electronic copy of his favorite novel, ``To Kill a
Mockingbird'' nor any of the Harry Potter books. He did acquire an
electronic version of a popular book called ``Experiencing God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife calls me Rocket Boy,'' confesses Strayhorn, a jolly
sort with a healthy laugh and a Texas twang.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocket isn't the only way to read books electronically; some
avid readers are devouring novels on the tiny screen of the Palm
Pilot electronic organizer. Janice Karin of Malden, for instance,
reads about a dozen books a week on her portable organizer. The
27-year-old technical writer is legally blind, and the electronic
device allows her to adjust the size of the type to make reading
possible. ``It's certainly saved me from being bored out of my
skull on many occasions,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As for Strayhorn, he's not one to bore easily, but he carries
his reader with him all the time, just in case. And his newfangled
device has come in handy in one old-fashioned way: ``Sometimes some
of the men in the church think the preacher is way up there,
unapproachable,'' he says. ``But when they find out I'm into
computers, the quiet guys suddenly want to have a conversation.
It's an icebreaker, a point of contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Movies
</P>
<P>
   It all started with a movie series about a young man in a galaxy
far, far away.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the trailer for the prequel ``Star Wars: Episode I _
The Phantom Menace'' spread like a virus over the Internet, with
copies available for download on the official studio Web site as
well as on fan and bootleg sites. Steve Head, a 34-year-old
uberfan, watched the trailer online and in theaters. These days, he
and his friends watch trailers on the Internet all the time.
``We're all pretty fanatic about it,'' says Head, a computer
programmer from Weymouth.
</P>
<P>
   Head just launched a movie news site called filmforce.net, which
posts links to movie trailers online. The hottest trailer
circulating right now is the preview for ``The X-Men,'' a
futuristic comic-book thriller with the slogan ``Join the
Evolution.'' ``More people have seen the images from this trailer
via an online connection than have actually seen it in a theater,''
says Head. ``I know I have.''
</P>
<P>
   The trailer aired two weeks ago on ``Entertainment Tonight'' and
was posted on the Internet almost immediately. ``People get it on
tape and digitize it,'' explains Head. In fact, the sport of
watching trailers has become an entertainment form unto itself. So
why are people so nutty about short videos that are essentially
advertisements? ``There is a vicarious thrill of one-upmanship and
curiosity,'' says Scott Deering, a New Jersey computer consultant
who runs www.movie-trailers.com.
</P>
<P>
   Streaming video is still extremely limited because of bandwidth
and quality issues; even with a high-speed connection, the viewing
experience can be frustrating. But today's trailer addicts are
tomorrow's online entertainment audience. Some companies, like
www.den.net and www.atomfilms.com, are already producing shows made
for niche markets on the Internet, targeting Christian teens, dog
lovers, and break dancers alike. Many of these shows have a
built-in e-commerce mechanism; with the click of a mouse, viewers
can buy the items they see or the music they hear in any particular
program.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, early adapters such as Head are content with
the novelty of watching trailers. ``The downloading takes forever,
and the image is very small, but I have the opportunity to see it
online, any time I want,'' says Head. ``And that, I think, is
pretty cool.''

TRACKING PORTFOLIO ONLINE CAN SIMPLIFY TAX CALCULATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DOLORES KONG   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After AT&AMP;T spun off Lucent and NCR a few years ago, Duncan
Routh, a former Fidelity Investments account manager, tried to
figure out what the impact would be on his taxes when he sold the
stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really struggled at the time to find out what my cost basis
for AT&AMP;T was,'' recalled Routh, referring to the original cost of
investment that people must track, through spinoffs and other
changes, to figure their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my background, and I'm having a tough time,'' he said.
``How about all the millions of investors who own the stock?''
</P>
<P>
   That led Routh, along with his brother, brother-in-law, and
another former Fidelity manager, to start GainsKeeper.
</P>
<P>
   The Quincy, Mass. firm aims to help investors track their
portfolios online for spinoffs and other corporate actions for tax
purposes and monitor ``wash sales,'' a potential tax trap for some
people who buy and sell the same stock within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Www.GainsKeeper.com, online since January, is the latest entry
into Internet portfolio tracking, an increasingly competitive
service offered by such sites as:
</P>
<P>
   --www.Quicken.com
</P>
<P>
   --www.MoneyCentral.msn.com
</P>
<P>
   --www.Morningstar.com
</P>
<P>
   --www.CNBC.com
</P>
<P>
   --www.ClearStation.com
</P>
<P>
   Many mutual fund families and brokerage firms have Web sites,
too.
</P>
<P>
   While many people use online services to track a virtual
portfolio of stocks they may one day be interested in owning,
others rely on them to keep close tabs on the value of their actual
investments. The latest online tracking features allow people to
better monitor a real portfolio, although they may make little
difference for those who have set up a virtual one.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites require investors to type in their stock holdings and
transactions; others allow the importation of data from their
brokerage firm or home money management software. Some
automatically adjust portfolios for stock splits, while others
feature a pop-up window or e-mail alert but require the user to
type in the split transaction.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, these services are free. Here is a summary of
some of the sites:
</P>
<P>
   --www.GainsKeeper.com
</P>
<P>
   The latest entry promises to do more than other sites by being
accurate enough to use with Schedule D, the Internal Revenue
Service form for calculating capital gains and losses, even in the
most complicated situations such as a wash sale. IRS rules don't
allow people to write off a loss on the sale of a stock if they
bought back the stock within 30 days, requiring them to add the
dollar amount of the loss to the cost basis of the stock they
bought instead.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Am I even in a wash sale?' It's a difficult scenario to
identify. It's really one of those calculations better left to a
computer. We're ecstatic to be able to provide it to active traders
of the world,'' said Routh, GainsKeeper's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   His brother Cameron is vice president of marketing, his
brother-in-law Chad Cook is president, and Greg Alves is vice
president of operations.
</P>
<P>
   The service automatically adjusts registered users' online
portfolios for stock splits, spinoffs, mergers, dividend
reinvestments, and other actions for tax purposes; keeps track of
separate lots of a stock bought at different times; and allows
people to print out a report detailing short-term and long-term
capital gains and losses that can be attached to a Schedule D.
</P>
<P>
   But the drawback is that people have to type in their holdings
and transactions from elsewhere, because there is no way to import
data.
</P>
<P>
   For people who don't trade much, who keep good tax records, or
who would rather pay an accountant to figure it all out, it may not
be worth the extra effort.
</P>
<P>
   Routh said the company is working on forming partnerships with
brokerage firms that would allow clients' trades to be
automatically passed off to GainsKeeper for record-keeping, which
would reduce the amount of data entry people have to do. He hopes
to keep the new service free and to keep adding features to the
site.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held company, which just closed a $2.5 million
round of private financing and added the ability to track mutual
funds, has more than 10,000 registered users and is beginning its
first advertising campaign Tuesday, Cameron Routh said.
</P>
<P>
   --www.ClearStation.com
</P>
<P>
   This wholly owned subsidiary of E-Trade, which bills itself as
``The Intelligent Investment Community,'' also automatically
adjusts users' portfolios for splits, mergers, spinoffs, and other
corporate actions, said Will Winkelstein, vice president of
marketing for the San Francisco company.
</P>
<P>
   While ClearStation doesn't adjust for wash sales, it does allow
users to print out a Schedule D-like report, although the report
may not be detailed enough to file with the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The site's portfolio manager was rated in a 1999 Microsoft Press
book entitled ``Online Investing'' as ``the best on the Web that
does not require a software download.'' (That's because Microsoft's
MoneyCentral.msn.com site does require a software download.)
</P>
<P>
   --www.MoneyCentral.msn.com
</P>
<P>
   This site's portfolio tracker isn't designed for tax purposes,
but it allows users to import their investment data from certain
brokerages and financial software packages, such as Microsoft Money
or Quicken, and automatically adjusts for stock splits and dividend
reinvestments, said product manager Chris Jolley and product
planner Charles Hauck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The portfolio manager, because it's so powerful and so
customizable, really gives people the one-stop shopping they're
looking for,'' said Jolley, who cited such other features as online
graphs of individuals' portfolio data and a portfolio review tool
that analyzes asset allocation and other aspects of your
investments.
</P>
<P>
   --www.CNBC.com, www.Morningstar.com, www.Quicken.com
</P>
<P>
   None of these sites automatically adjusts online portfolios for
stock splits or other actions, or keeps track of tax consequences
of stock transactions, although each may offer a pop-up window or
e-mail alert to notify individuals of the changes they need to make
in their accounts as a result of corporate news.
</P>
<P>
   While officials representing each of the sites said automatic
stock-split adjustment and wash-sale tracking are on the list of
things to be added, they pointed to existing features found in few
other places.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Sheridan, executive producer of CNBC.com, cited the
e-mail alerts that users of the portfolio tracker can get,
notifying them a few hours in advance that the chief executive of a
company they hold in their portfolio will be on CNBC, or that a
stock they're watching has reached a certain price.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wright, director of tools and portfolio development for

 Webby Award Producers Catch Ecstatic Nominees by Surprise  
 By Carolyn Said   
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The contestants are off and running for this
year's Webby Awards, the digiteri's version of the Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Technology publisher IDG, which produces the awards, on Monday
announced 135 Web site nominees in 27 categories ranging from
activism to weird. Nominees range from sites with
megabuck-corporate backing, like MarthaStewart.com, Amazon.com and
ESPN, to the cheeky irreverence of gwbush.com, a parody site that
has incensed the likely Republican presidential nominee.
Thirty-five of the nominees are from the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   The awards _ a metallic spiral imprinted with zeros and ones _
will be handed out May 11 in a ceremony at the Nob Hill Masonic
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my gosh, we're ecstatic,'' said Lianne Morgan, chief
executive of the Marketing Store, a 35-person Web design company in
Sacramento. The firm broke out the champagne to celebrate snagging
a nomination in the fashion category for ``Solemates: The Century
in Shoes'' (www.centuryinshoes.com), a multimedia ``Web-umentary''
about how footwear reflects ``the changing passions, perspectives
and ideals of our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll help us help more folks out, and that ain't bad,'' said
Craig Newmark, founder of Craigslist.org, a San Francisco
classified-ads site nominated for Community. ``Maybe it will help
me launch other projects, like AskCraigsMom.com.''
</P>
<P>
   A 350-member panel of judges makes the nominations and picks the
winners. Celebrity judges include David Bowie judging in music,
actor Patrick Stewart in travel, cyber-guru Esther Dyson in
activism, Simpsons creator Matt Groening in humor, performance
artist Laurie Anderson in arts and commentator Arianna Huffington
in politics and law.
</P>
<P>
   Web surfers can also pick their favorites for the complementary
People's Voice Awards, casting ballots at www.webbyawards.com.
</P>
<P>
   Webby Award producers Tiffany Schlain and Maya Draisin were in
New York yesterday, along with a film crew, popping in unannounced
on nominees to tell them the glad tidings. ``I felt like Ed
McMahon,'' Schlain said. ``Usually we just call people and they're
crying, clapping, yelling _ we wanted to see it in person.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, a Webby staffer dressed as a bike messenger
delivered a cell phone to nominees and told them to press the call
button to hear the news.
</P>
<P>
   Schlain said soliciting entries from the whole Web community
helped ensure variety and diversity of the nominations. ``I worry
it's going to be like the Emmy's,'' with the same people and shows
up for awards year after year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Webby producers try hard to hammer home the
comparison to the Oscars, even hiring PricewaterhouseCoopers to
audit the voting, they differ in one important respect: Webby
winners can't ramble on ad infinitum; instead, they have exactly
five words to blurt their thanks.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Webby Awards' fourth year of existence. The ceremony
has grown from a nightclub event to a lavish fest expected to
attract 3,000 attendees.

INTEL, AMD GET NOSE TO NOSE AND LET THE CHIPS FLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ALEX PHAM   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNNYVALE, Calif. _ There's nothing Silicon Valley loves more
than a good old-fashioned chip war.
</P>
<P>
   And riveting the Valley today is a dogfight between the
industry's two biggest players _ Intel Corp., the $30 billion
chipmaker, and its much smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc.,
or AMD.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is nothing new to the Valley, where companies are
admonished to either eat someone's lunch or be someone's lunch.
What makes this contest interesting is the sheer audacity of AMD in
taking on Intel, one of the fiercest competitors in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, AMD, which hasn't had a profitable year since 1995,
seems to be scoring big. Last week, AMD made headlines by beating
Intel in introducing an ultrafast one-gigahertz chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a yappy little dog making a run at a pit bull,''
said Keith Diefendorff, editor in chief of the Microprocessor
Report, an industry newsletter. ``It's amazing that they've even
come close and have even beaten Intel. It's quite astonishing,
really.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the story in a nutshell: While both companies were
founded in the late 1960s at the dawn of Silicon Valley, Intel has
since buried its rivals with better talent, better designs, and
legendary drive, becoming the undisputed king-of-the-hill and
owning more than 80 percent of the $24 billion PC chip market.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AMD has struggled to remain alive by focusing on less
expensive chips. In the mid-1990s, AMD's scrappy chief executive
and founder, Jerry Sanders, decided to bet his company on a new
chip design that he hoped would let AMD compete head to head with
Intel. The gamble was huge, involving expenditures in the billions
of dollars to develop the chips and build state-of-the-art
factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bet their entire company on this,'' said Diefendorff.
</P>
<P>
   What resulted was the Athlon line of chips, which began shipping
in June. For the first time, AMD had a viable answer to Intel's
high-end microprocessors, which are the brains in computers. ``We
had never before been in the high-performance space before the
Athlon,'' said Stephen A. Lapinski, AMD's director of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   AMD began to see its market share creep up, particularly at the
high end of the market. In January 1999, Intel commanded 97 percent
of the sales in the United States for chips used in personal
computers that sold for $1,500 to $2,000, while AMD had 3 percent,
according to Stephen Baker, director of hardware analysis at PC
Data in Reston, Va. By January 2000, Intel's share was down to 53.5
percent, while AMD claimed 46.5 percent, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, AMD was able to pull off its greatest coup by
introducing the fastest chip on the market _ the one-gigahertz
Athlon processor _ two days before Intel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something nobody has been able to challenge Intel on,''
said Baker. ``It's a great marketing coup.''
</P>
<P>
   But a marketing victory may be the only meaningful prize AMD
will get for its troubles, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMD won the race but only by the narrowest of margins,''
Diefendorff said. ``It's so narrow that in the big scheme of
things, it's not going to be very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Diefendorff points to weaknesses in the Athlon chip that slow
down its overall performance. The biggest problem, perhaps, is that
the chip's cache, or internal memory, sits slightly apart from the
processor, forcing information to travel to the processor and
slowing down the chip by slivers of a second. Intel's cache sits on
the processor itself, saving time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we put our processor on a racetrack, it will have higher
performance in total,'' said Ralph Bond, an Intel spokesman, of the
Intel Pentium gigahertz compared to the Athlon gigahertz. ``We
wound up with the fastest processor in the world, but we didn't
have the fastest news release in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, AMD has reason to crow. Just as Bill Bradley forced Vice
President Al Gore to fine-tune his campaign, AMD has made Intel
more fleetfooted. The result: Consumers have benefited because
products such as the gigahertz chip have come out months ahead of
schedule and prices have come down faster than if Intel were
unopposed, analysts say. Aside from that, the rivalry has made for
good theater in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Said Diefendorff: ``You can't deny AMD's got guts.''

A HUMAN RESOURCE FOR SURFING THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PETER J. HOWE   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the next contestants in the dot-com derby will feature an
``intelligent agent'' for searching the Internet, combined with
state-of-the-art speech-recognition technology especially useful in
wireless Net access.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically: An actual human being who talks to you on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Five-month-old Quixi.com, a New York-based start-up going live
across the country in about 10 weeks, is cofounded by Newton, Mass.
native Robert Pines. It aims to cut through Internet hype and
technology overload by offering, for $20 a month, all the calls you
want to speed-dial to a personal assistant who will do your Net
surfing for you and also complete calls and e-mails for you.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the hoopla over using your wireless phone to get onto
the Net, Quixi promises what many may find to be a satisfying
technological leap backward: Use the phone to call someone to go on
the Net and find or buy what you are looking for, rather than drive
off the road or walk into a mailbox while you try to scroll down a
tiny screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It truly lets you do e-commerce wherever you are,'' said
Pines, a 1986 Harvard graduate whose mother is former state Senator
Lois G. Pines.
</P>
<P>
   Pines likes to call Quixi the country's first ``personal
bandwidth'' company. ``We're definitely going against the trend on
the technology side, but we think the human being is the best
interface,'' said Pines. ``Other technologies don't necessarily
save you time. We get things done for you by providing a real
person to do the work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a lot to do _ offload some of it on us'' is a line
Pines and cofounder Evan Marwell, also a Harvard grad, use to
explain the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, for $19.95 a month, Quixi subscribers will get
unlimited access to three services: Find, Shop, and Connect. Find
and Shop are ways to get access to people who will search the Net
for information you need _ the closest steakhouse to your Houston
hotel, for example _ and buy the flowers you should have bought
your spouse for your anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Quixi Connect is like a flesh-and-blood version of Wildfire, the
phone-and-messaging virtual ``assistant'' offered by Wildfire
Communications of Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   By giving Quixi your Rolodex, you can call in and say, please
connect me to Alice and Lisa, or send this e-mail to John. Pines
envisions Quixi being especially popular for people driving home at
night or for some of the 5 million US personal digital assistant
owners who may be running through an airport and can't flip open
the machine.
</P>
<P>
   The great and perhaps unanswerable question until it hits the
market is how many people are willing to pay $240 a year to have an
Internet serf at their beck and call, plus an old-fashioned ``Get
me Watson on the phone'' secretary to whom you hand over your
entire address book.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, many new-economy Americans say they would prefer
having more time than more money.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever used one of the new Internet-enabled wireless
phones to try to order a book from Amazon.com, for example, or get
directions to the Airport Sheraton in an unfamiliar city, you may
find it easy to imagine you could get the job done much faster by
using the phone like a phone and calling someone to do it _
especially using the keypad to write and send an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Quixi sees as one big customer base the 15 million of the 85
million US cell phone owners who use them more than 200 minutes a
week. But there is no reason you couldn't use it from any phone to
make exploiting the Net quicker and easier. Forrester Research has
estimated that nearly 40 percent of Net shoppers quit before
completing transactions they want to do because of the hassle.
</P>
<P>
   Pines has already made a fortune by founding a company called
InfonXX in Bethlehem, Pa. that provides directory assistance to
wireless telephone companies including Bell Atlantic Mobile,
AirTouch, AllTel, and some Cellular One franchises. To support
Quixi, an elite corps among the 2,000 InfonXX operators will be
trained as Internet Sherpas.
</P>
<P>
   Marwell and Pines already know a few things about the economics
of running a call center, where the 10 percent of pain-in-the-neck
customers may account for 50 percent of costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some big-name investors, including Flatiron Partners and
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, have shoveled $27.5 million into the
company. Much of the venture funding will go into a buzz-promoting
billboard campaign in New York and Los Angeles this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say we think we can make this work,'' Pines said.

IN `BANDWIDTH'-MAD MARKET, BILLIONS FLOW IN BET ON SYCAMORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PETER J. HOWE   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   McDonald's. CBS. Philip Morris. Compaq. Merrill Lynch. Pepsico.
Sycamore Networks of Chelmsford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   That's a list of companies Wall Street thinks are worth $40
billion, give or take a few billion. And no, little 300-employee
Sycamore is not a typographical error.
</P>
<P>
   In an ascent astonishing even by Internet-age standards,
Sycamore went public last Oct. 22 and its share price quintupled at
the end of the first day's trading to give it a $14 billion market
capitalization. Five months later, its stock value has rocketed up
another $27 billion. Within the last two weeks, Sycamore, which
makes optical networking systems for Internet carriers, has
eclipsed Gillette as the state's second-highest valued company,
after data storage giant EMC.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore is typical of the new breed of Internet companies
valued as much, if not more, for their promise than their
performance. Investors have bid up their stocks in the hopes that
one _ maybe Sycamore, maybe someone else _ could become the next
Cisco Systems or Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine what Sycamore could do for a second act
beyond merely living up to the epic expectations of investors and
surviving what seems like the inevitable shakeout facing richly
valued companies in every Net-related sector.
</P>
<P>
   But what is making Wall Street delirious are industry analysts'
projections that optical networking will become a market worth tens
of billions of dollars annually within three to five years _ with
Sycamore at the heart of it.
</P>
<P>
   The theory seems to be that, in a world where the Internet is
reshaping everything from business to entertainment to human
communication, demand for ``bandwidth'' _ carrying capacity on the
fiber-optic cables that link the world _ will only continue to
explode.
</P>
<P>
   Given the strength and breadth of its technology and the track
record of its founders, whose past start-ups include Cascade
Communications, Sycamore is widely seen as having as good a chance
as rivals, if not considerably better, at dominating this
insatiable market.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Hannigan, an analyst with Forrester Research, said of
Sycamore: ``It is not ordained that Lucent, Nortel, or Cisco are
going to be dominant in this space. These guys (Sycamore) have a
shot, a good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore's business is to provide the gear and management
systems that allow carriers to bring as much traffic as they can
handle to their networks, and to do it more cheaply than the
``legacy systems'' of traditional conduits for data such as AT&AMP;T or
MCI WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, ``wave-division multiplexing'' and other
technologies have radically boosted the capacity of existing
fiber-optic cables. One of Sycamore's specialties is systems to
better manage that capacity, somewhat analagous to converting a
private street into a toll road serving thousands of different
vehicles daily.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore may also be one of the first companies to market with
products supporting ``bandwidth on demand,'' or the capacity for
carriers to offer companies only the data-transfer capacity they
need when they need it.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what ESPN.com, for example, might pay for the power to
add capacity to support increased traffic to its Web site during
college basketball March Madness, then shut it down the day after
the championship. Or what any other company would pay to get only
the data capacity it needs this minute instead of reserving a ``fat
pipe'' of capacity for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Among investors, much of the enthusiasm for Sycamore can be
traced to respect for its chairman and cofounder, Gururaj ``Desh''
Deshpande, who formed the company in February 1998 with optical
networking whizzes Rick Barry and Eric Swanson from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Deshpande founded Cascade Communications Inc. of
Westford, a data networking company which in six years grew to $500
million in revenues and 900 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Cascade was bought in June 1997 by Ascend Communications for
$3.7 billion. Ascend, in turn, was bought by Lucent Technologies
for just under $20 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Deshpande ``has the Midas touch here in Massachusetts,'' said US
Representative Edward J. Markey, the senior Democrat on the House's
telecommunications subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore officials said they were unable to speak for this
article because they are in a ``quiet period'' imposed by the
Securities and Exchange Commission before their planned upcoming
secondary stock offering of up to 17.2 million shares, including
2.6 million that may be sold by insiders and early investors.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Sycamore has scored some big credibility-boosting
contracts that seem to carry far more weight with investors than
its reported $7.4 million loss on revenues of $48.6 million during
the August 1999 to January 2000 period.
</P>
<P>
   Enron Broadband Services, a unit of the Houston-based energy
giant, in January announced a three-year pact with Sycamore worth
up to $200 million. Williams Communications in November said it
would buy $400 million of Sycamore gear over four years. French and
Scandinavian telecom giants are also big buyers.
</P>
<P>
   At a forum at Boston College last week, MCI WorldCom chairman
Bernard Ebbers _ whose company is an investor in Sycamore _
estimated MCI could spend as much as $100 billion over the next
four years adding network capacity to meet bandwidth demand and
will be looking to Sycamore for a big chunk of that.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in January, Sycamore cemented its leadership position by
spearheading the creation of a 100-company consortium developing
open technical standards for optical networking. Such a move has
been compared to phone companies agreeing on a dial tone.
</P>
<P>
   The Interstate 495 belt in Massachusetts is home to a bevy of
optical networking companies that collectively are seen as far
ahead of Silicon Valley, New Jersey, and other optical hotbeds.
Among the many Bay State companies in the sector are Appian
Communications Inc. and Coriolis Inc. of Boxborough, Tenor Networks
Inc. of Acton, and Quantum Bridge Communications Inc. of North
Andover.
</P>
<P>
   The fiber-optic market generally consists of four parts:
long-haul traffic, metropolitan loops, individual connections to
businesses and homes, and switches and other devices that move
traffic among those three segments. Sycamore, unlike many of its
niche competitors, is involved or will be involved in every segment
of the market as well as the software-based systems for running
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Like a gambler buying every ticket in a lottery to ensure he
hits the jackpot, Wall Street collectively seems to be snapping up
every optical networking stock _ including Sycamore, Redback, JDS
Uniphase, Juniper, Ciena, and others _ in faith that at least one
will dominate the market in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   And along the way, whichever one is the ultimate winner may well
use its fabulously appreciated stock to take over several of the
runners-up _ a theory bolstered by Cisco's $7 billion purchase of
Sycamore rival Cerent Corp. last August. Cisco, in fact, may emerge
as one of Sycamore's toughest competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The last five years have seen a revolution in the world's
communications networks in terms of capacity within businesses and
their connections to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That revolution is now spreading to the core of the Internet, as
carriers begin to upgrade their long-haul pipes to handle the huge
increase in capacity and demand at the enterprise level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire public network is being rebuilt,'' said Forrester's
Hannigan. ``Sycamore is right in the middle of it, and their value
proposition is a huge increase in capacity and a huge increase in
efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gwynne, marketing vice president of Quantum Bridge
Communications in North Andover, Mass., a 100-person optical
start-up that focuses on the ``last mile'' connections, said: ``The
whole global telecommunications infrastructure is being replaced
right now with high bandwidth, and Sycamore is the leader in this
space.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynne, whose company plans to go public sometime next winter
but might be a logical takeover target for Sycamore, said of the
stock price: ``I would invest in it. I know exactly why people are
crazy over it. I'd buy the stock. I'd buy more. It's right on, if
not a little bit low.''
</P>
<P>
   But other voices urge caution.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Wery, the San Francisco executive vice president of the
communications practice at Renaissance Strategy Inc., a global
consulting firm, said while Sycamore is ``the best of breed in that
bucket in a whole industry that is hot . . . there is not enough
room for all these companies to succeed and to achieve the growth
objectives that Wall Street has for them.''
</P>
<P>
   While he would not give numbers specific to different optical
networking companies, Wery said many of the hot optical stocks
assume a 40 or 50 percent growth in revenues every year for the
next five to seven years even before the firms begin amassing
enough profits to justify current valuations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some true casualties along the way. You will
have only a few winners, and some very bad losers,'' Wery said. But
he added: ``These valuations may be relevant to a few, and Sycamore
may be one of them.''

</P>

   For the younger fan who may want to blast ``Purpose by Destiny''

the more meditative ``Give Me a Clean Heart,'' as Hammond seems to
be doing in his pinched, impassioned and muscular plea.
</P>
<P>
   And the tracks sure to shake the pews are the live recordings
``Jesus Be a Fence'' and ``Thank You Lord (For Being There),''
powerful throwbacks to the times when all it took to get the
worshippers out of the folding chairs was a drum set, a piano and a
hallelujah choir.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond and RFC wrench real spirit out of computer-driven
production, but they are smart enough to include what really
connects.

 &HT;    R&AMP;B baritone knows how to make you feel the pain
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Obviously Gerald Levert's patience with gold diggers has hit
rock bottom. The baritone starts his fourth solo album belting:
``When I didn't have money/ I didn't have you/ I didn't have
problems/ This much is true'' _ leading a listener to believe
(rightly so) that he's going to deal a lot with dollar-driven
women. But the smart songwriter sees unhealthy relationships from
varying sides of the coin. On the bluesy ``She Done Been'' he
empathizes with a woman in a situation where ``every guy you start
to dig comes with baggage and no (job).'' And ``Misery Loves
Company'' is a rare instance in music where a man tells another he
doesn't appreciate him taking advantage of his kindness.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't stay mired in dysfunction. But just when lithe
guitars ease you into such standard love songs as ``Heart Don't''
and ``It Hurts Too Much to Stay,'' ``Hurt'' ends with duet partner
Kelly Price saying she wants to kill his girlfriend to keep them
apart. Misery not only has company here, but a nicely crafted
soundtrack.

 &HT;    CD mini reivews

<P>
   Peter Case. Vanguard. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Add Peter Case to the long list of singer-songwriters who've
never outgrown the '60s, despite coming of age after the Age of
Aquarius. With his raspy vocals, intricate acoustic fretwork and
clever lyrics, Case is often compared to Bob Dylan and Woody
Guthrie. He is neither, of course. His lyrics plumb more personal
than universal themes, and have more bark than bite. But like his
predecessors, he's at his best when spinning story songs _ funny
and serious _ that walk the line between folk and jangly rock.
Case's seventh solo CD covers familiar ground: lamenting lost
chances (``Coulda Shoulda Woulda''), romanticizing his roots
(``Black Dirt &AMP; Clay'') and facing down Y2K angst (``Paradise
Etc.''). Not everything works: Some songs suffer from similar
pacing and structure. But the total package is worthy of his
musical parentage, giving a new generation of folkies plenty to
ponder and savor.

<P>
   Just when we thought one of the hard-core rap groups was calling
it quits, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony creatively splices together another
album that resurrects its authentic sound. Lyrically, the
Grammy-winning group has combined its most unapologetic poetry and
life experiences, rendering a list of tracks that negatively
influences (``Ecstasy''), positively inspires (``Change the
World'') and forcefully paints a vivid description of its world
(``Mind on Our Money''). Although the songs are contradictory at
times _ rapping about changing the world in one and then
glamorizing drugs in another _ the album is consistent musically,
with an appealing R&AMP;B sound.

 &HT;    Stars make pulp thriller watchable
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like ``Double Jeopardy,'' this serial killer drama is, at its
core, pure pulp filmmaking. It delivers plenty of sucker punches.
But thanks to the film's two talented stars _ Denzel Washington as
a brainy quadriplegic detective and Angelina Jolie as his equally
brainy forensics cop _ this thriller's got enough electricity to
make it watchable.
</P>
<P>
   The stars ignite a potent sexual chemistry that gives the film
added weight and helps mask the weakest point plots. (Priced for
rental on VHS; $26.98 DVD, including feature commentary from
director Phillip Noyce.)

   &QR;  ``Guinevere'' (R) _ A well-bred, well-off college grad (Sarah
Polley) moves in with a 50-ish raffishly scruffy bohemian
photographer (Stephen Rea) who's made something of a career out of
introducing much younger women _ his ``Guineveres'' _ to the joys
of sex, Sartre, jazz, art, etc. But what sounds like grist for a
grim feminist diatribe against our culture's wink-wink approval of
May/December liaisons is actually a sweet, rueful, somewhat
sorrowing love letter. The writing and direction are sharp as a
tack and the acting is gorgeous. Grade: A-

the Summer of Love had come and gone. Grade: B

 &HT;    Raise a toast to complex mix that is Ireland
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On St. Patrick's Day, everyone wants to be Irish. Not the
starving Irish of ``Angela's Ashes'' or the lamenting Irish of
``The Troubles.'' Just green-beer and leprechaun Irish. The two
best Irish movies ever made are John Ford's ``The Quiet Man'' and
John Huston's ``The Dead.'' They should not be missed. But here are
some other ideas, helpfully divided into light and dark, blarney
and bloody.
</P>
<P>
   BLOODY
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``In the Name of the Father'': Director Jim Sheridan reunites
with his Oscar-winning ``My Left Foot'' star Daniel Day-Lewis for
this true story of young Irishman Gerry Conlon, who was wrongly
convicted as an IRA terrorist in the early '70s. Worse, his
law-abiding father (Pete Postlethwaite) is also arrested as a
co-conspirator. The movie splits its attention between the
miscarriage of justice _ Emma Thompson is their steely-eyed lawyer
_ and the father-son jailbird bonding that takes place in prison.
Day-Lewis lost so much weight for the role that two fans stopped
him to ask, ``Are you all right? You were so handsome in `The Last
of the Mohicans.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Boxer'': Day-Lewis and Sheridan again. This time the
actor is a former IRA stalwart who, after 14 years in prison,
simply wants to resume his boxing career. But the suspicions of his
old IRA cronies and a rekindled romance with his old flame (Emily
Watson) make things difficult. In the best scene, a pointedly
apolitical bout between Day-Lewis and a Scottish champ erupts into
a full-scale riot. By this time, Day-Lewis was so identified with
Irish films that director Stephen Frears quipped, ``I knew Daniel
before he was Irish.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Informer'': In 1935, John Ford made this film about
friendship and betrayal during the Irish Rebellion of 1922. It's
still powerful. The screenplay won an Oscar, as did the director
(it was his first; he would win three more directing trophies, and
two of his films won documentary Oscars). The star, Victor
McLaglen, who later punched John Wayne all over Ireland in the
brawling finale of ``The Quiet Man,'' told his son: ``Laddie, I
guarantee you that if I get that part in `The Informer' I will get
the Academy Award.'' He did and he did.
</P>
<P>
   BLARNEY
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Into the West'': Pure enchantment. Directed by Mike Newell
(``Four Weddings and a Funeral'') and produced by Sheridan, the
movie follows the adventures of two young brothers as they flee the
appalling squalor of their Dublin tenement and ride west on the
broad back of a magical white horse. On their trail: their father
(Gabriel Byrne), an embittered ``traveler'' who's forsaken his
roots; a tracker (Ellen Barkin) in love with Byrne; a greedy
horseman who wants the animal for the show ring; and half the
police force of Ireland. Exquisitely balanced between gritty
realism and lyrical fantasy, the movie is funny, poignant, and, if
you know your Celtic lore and the legend of the Kelpie, a bit
chilling and not just for kids.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Matchmaker'': A shamelessly likable bit of Irish charm
about a senator's workaholic aide (Janeane Garofalo) who's sent to
find her boss' Irish roots for a photo op. She arrives in the
coastal town of Ballinagra, a place so quaint that it makes the
village in ``The Quiet Man'' look like Buckhead. She also happens
to arrive on the day of Ballinagra's annual matchmaking festival.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Darby O'Gill and the Little People'': Sort of the classic
faith-and-begorra movie. Disney wanted to make this tale of a wily
Irishman (Albert Sharpe) and the King of the Leprechauns (Jimmy
O'Dea) for almost 20 years. But don't mistake this for a kiddie
movie. Anyone who's seen it remembers with a decided shudder the
shrieking banshee and the mystical death coach.
</P>
<P>
   Note to readers: In last week's column, I wrote a joke that fell
flat. An item involving Max von Sydow mentioned how he played the
Grim Reaper in ``The Seventh Seal.'' Von Sydow was indeed the
knight who played Death in chess. Get it? Well, unfortunately some
people didn't. Next time, I'll be a better joke writer.

   TEHRAN _ Sunday morning, two men on a 1000cc motorbike shot and

Hajjarian, is a close friend and adviser of the reformist
president, Mohamed Khatami. And the motorbike? In Iran, 1000cc

   WASHINGTON _ Plans are being laid for a visit by George W. Bush,
the GOP presidential candidate, to Europe ahead of this year's
election. The aim would be to help him get to know some of the
leading figures on the world stage, but also to reinforce his
stature. For Bush, a trip abroad is essential; his ignorance of
foreign affairs has become increasingly, and embarrassingly,
evident. Bush may be a fine man, but apparently he thinks that
Canada is run by a plate of chips and cottage cheese. &QL;

glacier in the far north of Canada last summer when they stumbled
on a human hip protruding from the ice. They looked down to see the
perfectly preserved body of a prehistoric man who had fallen into a
crevasse 12,000 years ago. The icemen have come back to humanity,
after thousands of years, because the glaciers that entombed them
are melting _ at an alarming rate _ all over the world. Glaciers
now are smaller than at any time in the past 5,000 years, while the
ice covers at both poles are melting. &QL;

political role of ex-president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani _ once

A FEW TALKING POINTS TO KEEP US BUSY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK. Super Tuesday and Super Tuesday II are history.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining presidential primaries are like the final games of
the baseball season, those meaningless contests that must be played
even though playoff slots have been divvied up and fans are
counting the days until the World Series begins.
</P>
<P>
   The World Series of politics takes place this year on Nov. 7,
when citizens of the planet's lone remaining superpower elect a new
president. What do you suppose we'll talk about 'til then?
</P>
<P>
   Well, we could start by talking about the new poll that showed
Republican nominee-to-be George W. Bush leading Democrat Al Gore as
both candidates went about the business of adding to their delegate
totals in Tuesday's Southern primaries. The USA Today/CNN/Gallup
Poll put Bush's support at 49 percent among likely voters surveyed
with Gore grabbing 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When the pollsters asked respondents their preference in a
three-way race that included Pat Buchanan as the Reform Party
candidate, Bush won again with the Texas governor racking up 47
percent to 43 for Gore and 6 percent for Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers add up to bad news for the tireless Bush-haters
who've been sending nasty e-mails and leaving insulting messages on
my voice mail: As Bush demonstrated in his second campaign for
governor and in his current campaign for the Republican
presidential nomination, he is a resolute and resourceful
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   What about other polls, you say, the ones that show Gore leading
Bush? Aren't those surveys good news for Bush's detractors?
</P>
<P>
   Not really. When he needs to be, Bush is a determined and
resilient underdog _ as he proved conclusively in his first
campaign for governor against highly favored incumbent Ann
Richards.
</P>
<P>
   These people who claim to be absolutely certain that the
American people will never choose Bush to occupy the nation's
highest elective office should prepare themselves for the shock of
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Bush crowd is hereby invited, however, to go right on
underestimating the son of ex-president George Bush. George W. Bush
loves to be underestimated; surprising his critics makes his
victories all the more satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Gore might want to check with Richards before he decides to take
Bush lightly. Richards' re-election strategy consisted entirely of
taking cheap shots at Bush _ deriding his background, ridiculing
his family, questioning his qualifications and even his right to
seek the governorship.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on the other hand, ran a sharply focused campaign based on
his vision for the future of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Look for him to conduct a similar campaign against Gore _ or try
to. Bush would much rather discuss issues than trade insults with
opponents; but as John McCain learned in the primaries, Bush will
fight back if attacked.
</P>
<P>
   So if Gore plans to go after Bush the same way he went after
primary challenger Bill Bradley _ with misrepresentations,
half-truths and flat-out falsehoods _ the vice president should
understand that Bush will give as good as he gets.
</P>
<P>
   Even before voters went to the polls in Tuesday's last major
round of primaries, Gore had traveled to Texas to tell Bush's
elderly constituents that a Bush presidency would threaten Social
Security and Medicare. It was an outrageous lie, of course.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore studied the ancient art of lying/fear-mongering at the
right hand of the master, Bill Clinton, and the president's prize
pupil obviously thought it was important to toss an early mudball
at his opponent on the opponent's home turf.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today, meanwhile, reported that the Bush campaign had
unveiled ``the Gore Detector,'' a periodic report on Gore's
``adventures with the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore seems determined to lie his way into the White House, just
as Clinton did when he and Gore ran against Bush the Elder in 1992
and against Bob Dole in '96. Bush the Younger is determined to make
sure Gore doesn't get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   And we were wondering what we'd talk about 'til Election Day?

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ ``Super Tuesday'' saw more than just the triumph of
the two establishment candidates. It saw the triumph of the
ultimate establishment principle: dynasticism.
</P>
<P>
   Dynasties are in retreat in most of the rest of the world. The
Nehrus no longer rule India. Britain is retiring its hereditary
peers. Indonesia has kissed the Suhartos goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   But in the country that was born of a revolution against George
III, the next presidential election will be fought between George
II and Albert II.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's father was a long-serving senator who bullied his
local paper, the Tennessean, into splashing the news of his son's
birth on the front page.
</P>
<P>
   The crown prince then spent his childhood in Washington,
shuttling between his family's suite at the Fairfax Hotel and his
prep school, St. Alban's, passing his current official residence on
the way.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is even grander, the son of a president, the
grandson of a senator and the relative, one way or another, of 15
presidents.

   Dynastic politics is hardly a new development in America, of
course. The sixth president, John Quincy Adams, was the son of the
second, John Adams; the 23rd president, Benjamin Harrison, was the
grandson of the ninth, William.
</P>
<P>
   The Roosevelts and Kennedys are only the most successful of a
flotilla of political dynasties that include the Rockefellers,
Tafts, Longs and Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the dynastic principle sweeping all before it. The two
most important political figures of the past two decades, Ronald
Reagan and Bill Clinton, are both self-made men.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the dynastic principle looks as healthy today as it
ever has, perhaps healthier.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 contest will be the first all-dynastic race in American
history and the first all-Ivy-League race since 1912, says Stephen
Hess of the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Bush could be the first presidential son to end up in the White
House since 1824 (and the first one ever to do so as a member of
the same party as his dad).
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers are trying to start dynasties of their own. Hillary
Rodham Clinton seeks to trade on her husband's good name (if that
is the word for it) to become a senator for New York. Elizabeth
Dole could make a bid to be Bush's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the tip of the dynastic iceberg. Senior political
offices that have passed, albeit with interruptions, from father to
son include a Senate seat for Indiana and the mayoralty of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Frelinghuysen, a New Jersey congressman, is the sixth
generation of his family to serve in Congress. Members of the Udall
family hold House seats in both Colorado and New Mexico. (``Vote
for the Udall nearest you,'' jokes one of them.)
</P>
<P>
   The rising stars of the Democratic Party include Kathleen
Kennedy Townsend, Patrick Kennedy and Andrew Cuomo, the son of a
former governor of New York and the husband of a Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The dynastic principle is proving itself more than a match for
the new politics of race and gender. Jesse Jackson junior is the
congressman for some of the grittiest bits of his father's old
stomping ground, Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most prominent Latino members of the House, Charles
Gonzalez and Lucille Roybal-Allard, are the offspring of former
congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   It is so common for wives to inherit political perches from
their husbands when they die _ as Mary Bono did when Sonny died in
1998 _ that there is an academic study of the phenomenon entitled
``Over My Dead Body.'' &QL;

   It is hardly unusual for children to follow their parents into
the family business. And it is a little churlish to complain that
rich kids are going into politics rather than frittering away their
family fortunes, particularly given the dearth of talent in the
public sector.

<P>
   There is no question that the dauphins have to prove themselves
in hand-to-hand combat. Dynasties that lack the stomach for the
fight quickly disappear from the political stage. (One of America's
great autobiographies, ``The Education of Henry Adams,'' is a

   (UNDATED) _ ``Super Tuesday'' saw more than just the triumph of
the two establishment candidates. It saw the triumph of the
ultimate establishment principle: dynasticism.
</P>
<P>
   Dynasties are in retreat in most of the rest of the world. The
Nehrus no longer rule India. Britain is retiring its hereditary
peers. Indonesia has kissed the Suhartos goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   But in the country that was born of a revolution against George
III, the next presidential election will be fought between George
II and Albert II.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's father was a long-serving senator who bullied his
local paper, the Tennessean, into splashing the news of his son's
birth on the front page.
</P>
<P>
   The crown prince then spent his childhood in Washington,
shuttling between his family's suite at the Fairfax Hotel and his
prep school, St. Alban's, passing his current official residence on
the way.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is even grander, the son of a president, the
grandson of a senator and the relative, one way or another, of 15
presidents.

   FORT WORTH, TEXAS _ Art boosters in Texas have long boasted that
their state was a ``third coast'' of contemporary art in America.
Yet they were never really able to convince New York or California
to take them seriously, until now.
</P>
<P>
   The Texan claim to be a center of cutting-edge work will be
greatly advanced on March 23, when the 2000 Biennial Exhibition
opens at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   No Whitney Biennial is ever quite like its predecessor. And the
novelty this year is that the show's six curators have chosen to
take the Biennial's original brief to provide an American
cross-section with refreshing literalness.
</P>
<P>
   The forthcoming show has artists from a much wider regional
range than before, with Texas as the clearest beneficiary. There
are nine artists from the Lone Star State, the largest number of
Texan artists ever, and the largest from any one state outside New
York and California.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Auping, curator of the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth
and a Whitney selector, is naturally thrilled. But he is keen to
explain why without sounding like the local chamber of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Texan artists have made a breakthrough, he thinks, as a
recognized part of the contemporary mainstream, not because the
Whitney has suddenly embraced Texan lore and cowboy pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of art from Texas, in other words, is that it is no
longer Texan art.
</P>
<P>
   Among Texan artists the big change, in Auping's view, is that
they have dropped the wildcatter mentality of a generation ago and
abandoned any last trace of regional folksiness.
</P>
<P>
   The renegade mind-set, historically so much a part of Lone Star
culture, once led Texas artists to avoid the influence of New York
and Los Angeles (while longing for the exposure) and draw largely
on local tradition.
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of artists, he believes, now has the
self-confidence to look to New York and abroad to inform their
work. ``They don't want to be known as `Texas' artists; they want
to be known as good artists.''
</P>
<P>
   The work of the Texans at the Whitney Biennial includes
paintings, bronze sculptures and video productions. Of the nine
Texans, the best known are Vernon Fisher, Joseph Havel and James
Drake, veteran artists whose work has gone in new directions in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Biennial is supposed to showcase less well-known work that
has yet to make a splash in galleries and museums. So relative
unknowns such as Leandro Erlich, Trenton Doyle Hancock and Brian
Fridge are also among the Texas representatives.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing noticeably regional in their form or style.
Fridge uses a video camera to shoot the ice crystals growing in his
freezer. Hancock does autobiographical, ``stream-of-consciousness''
drawings about racial issues.
</P>
<P>
   That Texas art has become more cosmopolitan is not surprising,
given the demographic shift the state has experienced over the past
decade. The cities of Texas are among the fastest growing in
America, as people have moved in from both coasts to take jobs in
the booming high-tech sector.
</P>
<P>
   This growth has revitalized the downtown areas of Houston and
Dallas, where galleries put on local work. Both cities now have
thriving communities of artists, as newcomers drawn to an
``artist-friendly'' environment join the native Texans.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Valerie Cassel of the School of the Art
Institute of Chicago (and another member of the Biennial selection
committee), ``Texas has turned into very fertile ground for the
contemporary art world.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Auping, Cassel believes that art in Texas has mostly lost
its regional drawl. But she does not think this is peculiar to
Texas. Regionalism, she finds, is in decline across the country.
</P>
<P>
   If you can speak of any aesthetic divide in America nowadays, it
is more between rural art and city art. As artists train, paint and
sell in more and more different cities, the preeminence of New York
and Los Angeles is bound to decline.
</P>
<P>
   The end of a bipolar American art world is what the 2000 Whitney
Biennial at least glimpses. ``There is a level of confidence in art
communities outside of New York and Los Angeles that is both
cheering and deserved,'' Maxwell Anderson, the Whitney Museum's
director, says. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (50-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His recent tenure as director has not been without its upheavals
and controversies. But in this show, the ``Max factor'' seems to
have worked.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to break the hold of ``the two coasts'' and, after
initially agreeing on almost nothing, his six curators have
successfully obliged. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 50-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 900) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the Biennial selection was farmed out to
curators from outside the Whitney, none of whom live in New York or
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Auping and Cassel, four other curators travelled to
studios and galleries around the country before choosing the 97
participants.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, once the selections were announced, the sniping
began. The Whitney Biennial, known affectionately as ``the
exhibition everyone loves to hate,'' draws criticism every time for
whom the panel includes and excludes. The 2000 Biennial is no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   Some New York critics have turned up their noses at the
gate-crashers and the unwashed. Yet members of the panel stand by
their work, dismissing the complaints as a predictable occupational
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there weren't criticism, I would be disappointed,'' says
Cassel. ``It wouldn't be the Biennial.'' &QL;

A TIP OF THE CAP TO THESE WORKS ABOUT THE IRISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I &UR;  &LR; do not know US Representative Peter T. King, Republican of
New York, but I think I know the type. He seems to be an
against-the-tide type of politician. Last year he defied the
snarling House GOP leadership to vote against impeaching President
Clinton. Two weeks ago, he was point man in New York for the
insurgent candidacy of Senator John McCain, defying all the
Republican bosses crowded onto the bandwagon of George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   King had some choice things to say about the Catholic-bashing of
the proprietors of Bob Jones University, and the Texan's timidity.
He denounced Bush for his tongue-tied and inelegant cameo at Bob
Jones U., a bastion of narrow nativism where no blacks or Roman
Catholics need apply, never mind more exotic breeds. King seems to
be one of those Irishmen to whom the joy of combat comes naturally.
</P>
<P>
   But pugnacity in a politician can wear thin as quickly as
profanity from the lips of a woman. And King has put on exhibit in
a novel he has penned his softer side, except for the bloodthirsty
sentiments expressed about the British role in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   As co-chairman of the Congressional Ad Hoc Committee on Irish
Affairs, King knows a good deal about The Troubles in Ulster, and
his novel, ``Terrible Beauty,'' recounts the struggle of an Irish
Republican Army housewife in Belfast whose friends and relatives
are both victims and victimizers in the Balkans-style bloodletting
of that backward era.
</P>
<P>
   ``An extraordinary literary feat,'' testifies the book-jacket
blurb of Malachy McCourt, one of the brother act of Frank McCourt
et al., who have become the Flying Wallendas of Irish literature in
the United States. ``The work of a dead honest man,'' is the blurb
of Jimmy Breslin. And columnist Lars-Erik Nelson makes three,
saying King's ``role in the Irish peace accords helped to put an
end to the violence he so vividly depicts.''
</P>
<P>
   Unheralded roles of women and Protestant heroes of Irish
nationalism are themes of ``For the Cause of Liberty; A Thousand
Years of Ireland's Heroes'' by Terry Golway, New York Observer city
editor and columnist, who traces the millennium just past from
Brian Boru to John Hume.
</P>
<P>
   The eloquent embrace of death and the fear of dishonor recur
with remarkable frequency in Golway's retelling. After America's
Revolution, the Irish had another go at tossing off the Brits.
Wolfe Tone was captured and sentenced to be hanged, instead of
shot, as he preferred. He slashed his throat with a razor to cheat
the hangman, lingered for a week and died, aged 35. Sniffed Sir
George Hill, of the other persuasion: ``I would have sewed up his
neck and finished the business.''
</P>
<P>
   The British Army found soldiering on Irish soil easier than
here. ``In six months of fighting, 30,000 people had lost their
lives'' in Ireland's failed revolt, writes Golway. ``By comparison,
25,000 Americans had died in the six years it took for America to
win its liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   A century later, with Britain desperate for Irish recruits to
man its rifle battalions against the Boer rebellion in South
Africa, aged Queen Victoria was wheeled through Dublin as a
recruiting sergeant. William Butler Yeats, like Tone a Protestant,
penned a thunderous public letter of outrage: ``Whoever stands by
the roadway cheering for Queen Victoria cheers for the Empire,
dishonours Ireland, and condones a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Golway's thousand years ends with Gerry Adams and Martin
McGuinness taking their seats in Stormont, the castle symbolizing
British rule of the six counties of the North. The author credits
Bill Clinton with adroit moves in bringing Britain and the republic
to the peace table with the Ulster factions.
</P>
<P>
   He credits the economic boom of the '90s with reversing
Ireland's brain drain, as the young of Ireland ``eagerly embraced
the European Union, the global marketplace and secular politics . .
. Ireland in the 1990s also became post-Catholic, thanks in part to
a series of clerical sexual scandals that hastened the church's
weakening power and prestige in a country of well-educated young
people. Though still devout, Irish Catholics paid less attention to
church dictates than at any time since the days of Henry II and
Pope Adrian.'' The future, he concludes, ``has never looked
brighter.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the past that mesmerizes the Irish, and historian
Lawrence J. McCaffrey has updated his original 1976 book. What was
``The Irish Diaspora in America'' has been retitled ``The Irish
Catholic Diaspora in America.'' Why the change? ``A majority of
people in the US who now define themselves as Irish or partly Irish
are not Catholic,'' which will be a rude shock to folks in South
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But they may find ample succor in the richly illustrated ``A
Journey Through Boston Irish History'' by Dennis P. Ryan, full of
rogues and rascals as well as politicians and prizefighters,
including bachelor William Stanislaus Murphy, Harvard 1885, who
bequeathed his $50,000 estate to Harvard ``to assist any qualified
student'' named Murphy. On my annual St. Patrick's Day pub crawl,
whether it be in Doyle's, the Eire, Amrhein's, or the Farragut, I
shall hoist a jar to Bachelor Billy Murphy, who knew, like the
Irish bartender eyeing change on the bar, that in the end, money is
``made round to go round.''

A SMALL UPTICK FOR TOLERANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By conventional yardsticks, to use the terminology of the
omnipresent marketplace, this has been one tough first quarter for
gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   The year began with such promise, from the prospect of Vermont
becoming the first state to recognize same-sex marriages to the
casual acceptance of gay couples on the ABC game show ``Who Wants
to be a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the market correction: California voters declared the
only legitimate marriage to be between a man and a woman. Vermont
lawmakers concocted ``civil union'' as a politically palatable
alternative to gay marriage. Radio moralist Dr. Laura Schlesinger
expanded her audience for denunciations of homosexuals as
``deviants'' to television. And the Catholic Church apologized to
its alienated members without any mention of gay Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Here the marketplace metaphor collapses; social change is
charted on no public index. When it takes hold, it does so in
unexpected places. Nowhere was that more evident than at Melrose
(Mass.) High School this week.
</P>
<P>
   Melrose, to be clear, is not the People's Republic of Cambridge.
A small city just north of Boston, it is home to approximately
28,000 people, most of whom are white, middle-income, and
family-oriented, drawn to a community that has moved forward while
preserving the best of the past. Not the place where you would
expect the wedding announcements in the local paper to include a
studio portrait of two young women in white gowns and flowing
veils.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph did not go unnoticed. The letters column of the
Melrose Free Press, usually a repository for expressions of thanks
from such groups as a Cub Scout troop indebted to the benefactor
who supplied pizza for its last den meeting, has became a forum on
gay rights. There have been letters objecting to what one writer
called ``such parodies of the sacred marriage bond.'' But there
have been letters, too, congratulating the couple for their
courage.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, there were only cheers at Melrose High School
when Judy Hasselbrack and Maryanne Trasker stood during a meeting
to discuss the impact of sexual orientation on students in the
city's well-regarded schools. Sponsored by the city's Human Rights
Commission and the high school's new Gay-Straight Alliance, the
session attracted about 50 people, the curious as well as the
regular retinue of civic-minded meeting-goers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting a reaction,'' Trasker said of the decision to
publicize the commitment ceremony she and Hasselbrack celebrated
with family and friends. ``But I have been overwhelmed by the
support. We submitted the photograph because we hope it opens a
dialogue in every household in Melrose.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple took the step with the same care and deliberation
that has marked their relationship since high school, when neither
young woman realized she was gay. They dated for years in college
before telling their families. ``For myself, it was a period of
terrible ambiguity,'' recalled Hasselbrack. ``Could I be a happy,
healthy person and be gay at the same time?''
</P>
<P>
   Neither woman harbors those doubts any longer. In 1996, they
bought a house in Melrose, where they both grew up and where they
hope to raise a family. They are looking forward to their 10th high
school reunion this year, itself an impetus to declare their love
openly. ``We knew everyone would be whispering about us,'' said
Trasker. ``Why not just tell them?''
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbrack has been asked repeatedly ``why we would want to
announce our commitment in the paper like that. I say, Why wouldn't
we? All our classmates do when they get married. When I see you on
the street or I bump into you on the train, I want you to ask me,
`How's Mary?' just like I ask you. I think people in Melrose get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Patrick Guerrero certainly does. He arrived late Monday
night from the Fleet Center in Boston, flush with news that the
girls basketball team had won their divisional championship. ``Some
people told me I've lost their vote for my support of the
Gay-Straight Alliance. I told them, `I'm glad; I earned it.' I want
our schools, our city to be not only safe but nourishing places for
all of us,'' he said with a smile for Trasker, Hasselbrack, and the
gay students in the room. ``You have my support on good days and
bad days, in public and in private.''
</P>
<P>
   Take that, Dr. Laura.

JOURNALISM STUDENTS KNOW WHY MCCAIN DID SO WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though he is no longer a candidate there is an important reason
why John McCain was able to play the mischievous jester who for a
time snatched George W. Bush's scepter during the Republican
primaries. The reason is unbelievably simple: Customer service.
</P>
<P>
   This was brought home by my journalism students at Simmons
College. Their assignment was to cover the New Hampshire primary,
making their own arrangements to find an event where a candidate
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was not the first choice of most of the students. But in
the end more students covered him than any other candidate. Three
examples why are provided below by members of my opinion writing
class:
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Coppinger: ``I originally called Al Gore's campaign office
to find out where he would be during the New Hampshire primaries. I
found that the people at his campaign ofice were very rude and cold
and didn't want to offer me information on where Al Gore would be
during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor George Bush's office couldn't give out the governor's
schedule. Bill Bradley's events were three hours from Boston.
Finally, I called John McCain's headquarters. They couldn't tell me
for sure where he would be but tried their best to tell me where I
could look to find him. They took my number and told me if they
found out anything they would let me know. (The Manchester Union
Leader later told her that McCain would be at the Hudson Chamber of
Commerce. A friend drove her there.).
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's committee was setting up the function room,'' she
said. ``I explained to them who I was and asked if I would be able
to stand in the back during this event. They said they would make a
spot for me to stand in the back with the media. The Harvard
Republicans were there, and they were telling me how much John
McCain had made himself accessible compared to the other
candidates. During the middle of dinner, I walked up to the front
where McCain was sitting, shook his hand, and got my picture taken
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Paradis: ``Searching the Web, we discovered that McCain
was the only candidate with a set agenda. But we did not want to
see McCain, so I made a few telephone calls, after which I decided
to see McCain after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I telephoned the Gore campaign headquarters for the fifth time
in two weeks. At 7 p.m., the office had not yet received his agenda
for the next day. They referred me to the Nashua office, which
tried referring me back to headquarters. (The Nashua office) tried
telling me about Tipper's events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I telephoned Bradley's New Hampshire headquarters. His agenda
was not out yet for the next day. The operator said, `It's like
hitting a moving target.' She was more informal and personable, but
more discouraging than helpful. From previous calls to Bush
campaign offices, I did not bother trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I telephoned McCain's New Hampshire headquarters for the first
time. A perky but tired sounding woman answered. I asked if McCain
was still appearing at the Windham and Derry town hall meetings the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `He's been booked for weeks. He'll definitely be
there. Will you be joining us?' Of course, I replied and asked if
the event was open to all supporters. `Everybody can come. Bring
all your friends.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Munoz: ``Feeling that I had really gotten nowhere (after
several previous tries) with Gore, I decided to call Bradley's
headquarters. When I called, I didn't even get a human being to
answer the telephone. All I heard was a voice message asking me for
a fax number they could send information to. And so I decided to
continue trying my luck with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``That night I called back three times. All three times I felt
like I was getting the run-around. I left voice messages. I spoke
to people. I complained. I even asked them how they expected us to
write a story about Gore if we couldn't even get the information we
needed. They had no answer to my question. Yet they did ask me if I
could attend an event in Manchester, an event Gore wasn't even
going to be at.
</P>
<P>
   ``By this point I was frustrated and decided to change
candidates and go with McCain. I got on the Internet, went to his
Web page, and in a couple of minutes I had his entire schedule. I
ended up being one of the 350 attendees in Derry at his 113th town
hall meeting. And out of the approximately 10 people who were able
to ask him questions, I was one of them.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The irony that looms large in 23-year-old Harvard Law student
Rebecca Katz's life these days is this: It was only when the Fifth
Commandment's exhortation to ``Honor thy father and mother'' became
meaningful to her that she ran afoul of her parents.
</P>
<P>
   While Katz has always known she is Jewish, Judaism never played
a role in her life. Her family was so assimilated that every year
they decorated a Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Katz is on a journey to reclaim her Jewish
identity. Most Friday nights she celebrates Shabbat with other
Harvard students, reciting Hebrew prayers and pouring water over
her hands in a ritual before blessing the bread.
</P>
<P>
   She's learning Hebrew and thinking a lot more about God. Her
parents are not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother explicitly used the word `rebellion.' She feels very
much that I'm doing this to get back at her,'' Katz said. ``Before,
I didn't really care about honoring my mother and father. It's
strange, because now I feel very strongly about honoring them, but
there's this enormous strife.''
</P>
<P>
   College students and young adults reared in households where
religion was almost invisible are turning in significant numbers to
traditional forms of Judaism. They are called ba'alai tshuvah, or
``the returning.''
</P>
<P>
   To many of their parents, however, these young people aren't
``returning'' to anything at all. Rather, they are embracing
something that was never a part of their lives. Parents are
bewildered by daughters who won't wear pants or sons who wrap
tefillin around themselves to pray, alien offspring who seem to be
rejecting their upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first reaction was, `Oh my gosh, where is this coming
from?' '' said Harriet Gilman, a children's librarian who lives in
the Chicago area. Her daughter, Boston resident Joy Greenwald, 24,
started attending weekly services and keeping kosher when she was
an undergraduate at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a total departure from the way our family had lived,''
Gilman continued. ``We really didn't understand why she would
choose to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Even parents who strongly identify with Judaism and belong to
Reform or Conservative branches of the religion are weary of the
trappings of Orthodox Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sternberg, associate director of the Cohen Center for
Modern Jewish Studies at Brandeis University, several years ago
conducted a workshop exercise that revealed the intensity of
emotion swirling around the question of how to be a good Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg asked Jews to rate, in the abstract, a potential
son-in-law or daughter-in-law. Among the choices were a non-Jew and
a Hasidic Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Most parents said they would be less concerned if their child
married the non-Jew. Sternberg believes the results might be more
mixed today, given worries about how intermarriage could threaten
the future of American Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, many parents feel that a child who becomes very
religious is critiquing his or her elders' way of life more than a
child who shows little interest in Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Ask most Jews today, and they'll tell you about a son or a
cousin or a friend who has become observant in young adulthood.
Thirty to 50 students regularly attend Friday night dinners at
Chabad House of Boston, and the same number at Chabad House at
Harvard Square, both led by Lubovitch rabbis who make a life of
tutoring Jews to become more observant.
</P>
<P>
   The history of Jewish life in America helps explain why so many
young adults are examining their faith, suggested Jill Ringel, a
21-year-old Northeastern University student, who is ba'al tsheuvah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural occurrence in American society after
generations of assimilation,'' Ringel said. ``We had to go through
that pulling away so we can come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Several academicians buttress Ringel's point, noting that
today's young American Jews, usually fourth- or fifth-generation
Americans, have lost the craving to blend in that many of their
parents and grandparents felt.
</P>
<P>
   Those Jews who never ``assimilated'' have often constructed
their identity in secular ways by, for example, championing Israel,
said Jonathan Sarna, a professor of American Jewish history at
Brandeis. Now an established state, Israel is less likely to
``animate'' American Jews, Sarna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a turning away from an emphasis on ethnicity to an
emphasis on religion and faith as the glue that will hold Jews
together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While most young Jews today are less connected to Judaism than
ever, Sylvia Barack Fishman, professor of contemporary Jewish life
at Brandeis, said a core group _ 25 to 30 percent _ is actively
seeking to connect with its heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the numbers that are important, Fishman said.
``It's out of that smaller group that leaders are going to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Ringel, the Northeastern student, might become one of those
leaders _ certainly, she is as enthusiastic about religion as a
21-year-old could be. And that has strained her relationships with
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Ringel went to Hebrew School and grew up celebrating Jewish
holidays. But her family didn't keep kosher or light candles on the
sabbath. Nor did they consider themselves religious.
</P>
<P>
   Once in college, Ringel started reading about the symbolic
meaning behind Torah laws. ``It all seemed so beautiful to me,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, over a couple of years, she added more and more Jewish
customs to her daily life. She began by eating kosher food and
saying a blessing before her meals. (``Eating is not just eating,
it's connecting to God,'' she said.)
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Jews take literally the notion of Shabbat as a day of
rest. Turning on a lamp or a making a phone call qualifies as
``work.'' So Ringel first stopped watching television on Shabbat,
then stopped driving and later started unscrewing the light bulb in
her refrigerator on Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ringel, a senior studying physical therapy, wears long
skirts and sleeves that cover her elbows, for modesty's sake. She
observes a custom for single women, called shomer negiyah, which
dictates that she cannot touch men. She exudes zest for the laws
that her parents fret restrict her.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden I wanted so much to wear skirts all the
time,'' she said. ``It's very exciting. It's the first time you're
showing your Judaism to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Ringel easily found a community to support her, in places such
as the campus Hillel and Chabad House of Boston. In fact, the
strong sense of community is one big draw of Orthodox Judaism. But
Ringel also said she felt at odds with the people who had been in
her life. Friends took offense, for example, that she wouldn't go
out to clubs with them anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Ringel's parents, who live in New Jersey, were angry that she
didn't want to eat at home or go to favorite restaurants, that she
refused to drive to see her grandparents on a Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree. It's not my lifestyle,'' said Jeffrey Ringel,
who works in sports television. ``There's a separation in our
relationship, I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years, it's still difficult. While her parents deny
it, Ringel, like many ba'alai tshuvah, believes they see her
lifestyle as an implicit criticism of the way they raised her.
</P>
<P>
   Minor disputes often become flash points for serious conflict.
Harriet Gilman loves to cook, and it still pains her that her
daughter will not eat, say, her sausage lasagna.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it makes any logical sense,'' said Gilman's
husband, Alan, an oncologist, of kosher laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have anything to do with the modern world.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Gilmans remain close, as do the Ringels. Jill Ringel
canceled plans to go to Israel this summer specifically so should
could live at home and let her parents and brother become
accustomed to her new ways.
</P>
<P>
   And her parents, though still uneasy, have come to terms with
the life their daughter has chosen. ``She's still her,'' said her
mother, Barbara, a teacher. ``She' still silly, she's still
serious. She still laughs, she still cries.''
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Rabbi Shmuel Posner of Chabad House of Boston:
``After a while, the parents realize it's not crazy, it's not nuts,
it's Jewish!''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, said several rabbis, parents are inspired by their
children and become more observant themselves. In other cases the
child comes to realize that he or she may have been a little
self-righteous in the first blush of newfound passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, I almost wanted to change my parents,'' said
Alanna Goldberg, 24, who transformed from a self-described party
girl to a ba'al tshuvah while at Boston University. ``It took me a
while to learn to respect their lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   A common refrain of young, newly observant Jews is that little
is more important to them than paying respect to their parents and
to their ancestry. Amit Kiesel, 26, crams Torah study into his
hectic schedule at Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you so much more about the wireless industry or the
Internet than my father's religion and my father's father's
religion,'' said Kiesel. ``It makes me sad that I don't know
anything about Judaism because it's so much more important than
what I do know about.''

MY DAY WITH KOZMO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; 10:10 a.m.: Stagger in to work. Need stimulation. Gave up
coffee (for now). Gave up alcohol (on a trial basis). What's left?
Ah . . . a nice, fresh Poland Spring.
</P>
<P>
   I could walk 400 feet to the cafeteria, but who has the energy
for that? Instead, I log on to Kozmo.com and order the water
(itals)right from the computer where I'm working.(unitals) Delivery
is free even if I order the 60-cent Baby Ruth bar, and my order
arrives in less than an hour. In addition to the water, I tack on
an issue of Young &AMP; Modern magazine for girls, to check out their
hilarious ``Say Anything'' column, and a videocassette of Alfred
Hitchcock's ``Suspicion,'' which I can keep for three days. Total
order cost: $8.39.
</P>
<P>
   What's Kozmo? It's an instant gratification service for college
kids and the urban webocracy. It started in New York's grotty
Silicon Alley, where two entrepreneurs had the idea of delivering
essential life supplies _ food, video games, and toiletries (read:
condoms) _ to twentysomething Web slaves who worked more or less
around the clock. Free delivery, in under an hour. They've got a
ton of . . .
</P>
<P>
   10:45: It's here! That was quick. A full liter of Poland Spring,
plus I notice that my beloved ``Say Anything'' column has been
supplemented by a new, equally engaging feature, ``Ask Anything.''
(Sample question: ``There are squiggly lines on my chest! How did
they get there?'') And the video.
</P>
<P>
   Where was I? Oh, yes. Kozmo has a ton of venture capital and now
operates in San Francisco, Washington, and Seattle as well as in
Boston and New York. Just two years ago, the founders were
delivering videos themselves, on bicycles, in lower Manhattan to
help their messengers keep up with soaring demand. Now they're
planning to go public.
</P>
<P>
   How do you make money delivering stuff for free at
non-extortionate prices, e.g. a three-night video rental for $3.50?
First answer: Making money isn't always Goal Number One for dot.com
companies; building market share is. (In New York, Kozmo already
has a competitor, Urbanfetch.com.) Second answer: If you deliver a
whole lot of stuff, you'll make the same profit margins as the
bricks-and-mortar video shops and convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   12:25 p.m.: Hydrated and half-Hitchcocked _ I'm at the part
where Joan Fontaine is indeed entertaining ``suspicions'' _ I
depart for my lunchtime run. More of a slog, really.
</P>
<P>
   2:05: Famished. What's for lunch, Kozmo? Not much, alas. They'll
be adding sandwiches in the future, but the future isn't now. Now
is snack foods galore, microwaveable pizzas, milk, and ice cream
treats. I settle for some real grok: Cool Blue Raspberry Gatorade,
a stack can of Pringles BBQ Potato Crisps, and a peanut butter
Power Bar. Bon appetit!
</P>
<P>
   2:55: Kozmo man Aaron arrives in his van 10 minutes short of the
60-minute deadline. He's wearing the funny Kozmo jacket people talk
about and explains that he ran into some traffic tie-ups on the way
from Allston. Everything you see on the Web site _ the 20,000
videos, the 2,000 DVD titles, etc. _ is stored in a warehouse
across the street from the Harvard Stadium. From 10 a.m. until 1 in
the morning, space-age logistical software sends Kozmo's 125
carriers, about half of them on bikes, to their appointed rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Kozmo makes several thousand deliveries a week to
much of Boston, and all of Cambridge, Brookline, Somerville,
Belmont, and Watertown. Local manager Will Weddleton plans to add
ZIP codes as time goes on.
</P>
<P>
   What goes wrong with Kozmo? Not much. I had some browser
problems that may have had more to do with my medieval (1998)
computer than their system. At one point, they failed to process my
credit card but a customer service call cleared that up instantly.
And no, they didn't know I was writing about them.
</P>
<P>
   The newsmagazines on display at the Web site are a week old. The
book selection is pretty thin. But the video selection is, well,
awesome. They even had my latest candidate for Worst Movie Ever
Made, Bernardo Bertolucci's ``The Sheltering Sky.''
</P>
<P>
   3:20: This final order is more or less random, as the designer
and I try to call up objects of different shapes and sizes that
will photograph well. Combining our photographic and epicurean
urges, we order a pint of Ben &AMP; Jerry's Coffee Heath Bar Crunch,
Nirvana's ``In Utero'' CD, and a stick of Right Guard deodorant. By
now, I assume the goods will arrive in less than an hour, and they
do, 40 minutes later.
</P>

GYMS UPGRADE WITH HIGH-TECH GEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DICK LEHR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For years, Nick Tranquillo was ``just another guy on a
treadmill.'' He had his daily workout at the YMCA's Central Branch
just the way he liked it. In fact, the 67-year-old retired teacher
has a long record as a gym rat, going back to his boyhood in
Boston's North End.
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed to his routine, he saw little reason to pay attention
to the computer-linked fitness system that has become the hot trend
in the nation's workout culture and which his own branch of the Y
installed almost two years ago. ``Who wants to bother?'' Tranquillo
remembers asking himself when the gym went high-tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what it was, this thing they put in,'' he says
about the central computer, called the kiosk, and the hand-touch
computer screens, called ``training partners,'' that are attached
to most of the training equipment and which, together, are the
backbone of the Y's computer-aided workout. Tranquillo kept to his
own format, mixing aerobics and weight lifting, while eschewing the
new new thing in exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Then last year he tried it, and Tranquillo became a convert to
techno-exercise. ``It's like having a trainer at your side,'' he
says. Working out on the hip abduction machine, the small screen
attached to the training equipment notifies Tranquillo when he's
moving his legs too quickly, how many repetitions he has left, and
then, when he slams the weights together too hard, the computer
beeps and a mock-trainer message flashes: ``Don't let the weights
touch.'' Tranquillo laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a basic premise for the interactive workout is to extend
the reach of a gym's trainers. The computer hook-ups provide a
virtual hands-on experience, so that even if Tranquillo rarely sees
face-to-face the trainer the Y has assigned to him he might get
e-mail when he logs on and he knows the trainer is reviewing his
workout periodically from the computer terminal set up in the
office.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, the trend in interactive workouts is a great
equalizer in a fitness world where personal trainers have
traditionally been an option only the affluent could afford.
</P>
<P>
   To go high-tech, the Y went with FitLinxx Inc., of Stamford,
Conn., one of a handful of techno-exercise firms that have appeared
in the past few years. Netpulse, for example, features monitors
attached to the workout equipment so a user can watch TV, listen to
music, surf Web pages, read e-mail, or simply track a workout. The
company Schwinn Cycling and Fitness Inc. of Boulder, Colo., offers
a setup not unlike FitLinxx. For those who prefer home fitness to
the Y or private gym, there's iFit.com, where users hook up their
treadmills and stationary bikes at home to the company's Web site
and then interact in real time with a trainer via video camera.
Users can also watch training programs or tap into other online
workout services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old golf pencil and the workout card _ we've moved way
past that,'' says Melanie P. Adams, fitness director at the Boston
YMCA. The Y, like most gyms, is always looking for ways to attract
new members and retain those who start working out full of energy
but then lose interest, tail off, and even disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The fitness industry estimates that half of new exercisers drop
out within six months of beginning a fitness program. The
interactive workout, however, seems to be making a difference.
</P>
<P>
   At the central branch, says Adams, about 1,500 of the Y's nearly
5,000 members have become FitLinxx users. Overall, the Y has a
yearly membership drop-out rate of about 38 percent. But, notes
Adams, the dropout rate among those members who are
techno-exercisers has fallen to 27 percent. This is good news, says
Adams, meaning the Y is retaining the exercisers who are
interacting with a virtual trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about communication,'' says Adams. The Y has eight
trainers, she says, and ``it's impossible to keep track personally
of the all the members.'' Even if it's through e-mail, the gym's
computer network allows trainers to accomplish some ``one-on-one
hand holding'' that in the past was found only in expensive,
exclusive clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``FitLinxx enables the trainers to track members: Have they been
in recently? How often? How many miles have they run? How much have
they lifted?'' From home, or if out of town on business, members
can e-mail their trainers as well as gain access to their workout
regimen and data through the company's Web site, www.fitlinxx.com.
</P>
<P>
   At the Y, each FitLinxx member is assigned a trainer and
together they set up a workout regimen. Each visit, the member logs
on at the kiosk, the central computer that looks like an ATM. Many
of the weight-training and aerobic machines are hooked directly
into the FitLinxx system, which means the workout is not only
interactive but its results go directly into a member's file.
Members log their own workout data after using machines that are
not yet hooked up or after completing exercises _ like swimming
laps _ that cannot be connected to the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm visual, so it's great for me,'' says Liz Lender, a
32-year-old photographer. The screen attached to the leg curl
machine she's working out on reports that on her last visit she
lifted 50 pounds 13 times. The screen counts her repetitions and,
when she hits her target, she's rewarded with a round of beeping
sounds. Linder rolls her eyes. ``The salute,'' she says, ``is a
little bit much for my taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Tranquillo is standing at the kiosk. His ``workout notebook''
saves data for all his workouts, so he can review the past week,
month, or year and see totals for how much he has run or lifted.
Over time, the exercisers accumulate ``fitpoints'' _ one point for
every 10 pounds lifted, 10 points for every strength-training
station used, five points for every minute of cardiovascular
exercise _ and then the Y posts the monthly top point-getters by
age category and gender. Tranquillo's name often appears in the
monthly list of top 10 for his age group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you an edge, motivates you,'' says the Y regular, who
estimates he spends about four hours a day at the gym, between the
``workout, the socializing, showering, and watching some handball
matches.''
</P>
<P>
   When a young man enters the weight room, Tranquillo greets him
with a ``There's the man!'' Then he finishes punching in his
treadmill results. How long? Sixty minutes. How far? Three and
one-third miles. (``A fast walk,'' he nods. ``That's my pace.'')
Estimated calories burned? Six hundred and ninety-two. Never mind
that the estimate is inflated because he entered a high
``exertion'' level when he stepped onto the machine. He smiles,
nonetheless. ``That's great,'' he says. ``Breakfast gone.''

<P>
   ``Your grandmother loved all the Guerlain perfumes _ Shalimar,
Jicky. But I could never wear Jicky _ it just didn't go with my
skin.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother is telling perfume stories over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time your father and I went into the Guerlain shop in
Paris, and I tried on some Jicky. The girl had to take me back to
the employee washroom and scrub it off with strong soap. She wasn't
going to let me leave Guerlain smelling like that.''
</P>
<P>
   One perfume is much like another _ or so I used to think. Each
of the many odor receptors high in our nostrils can, in principle,
trigger thousands of different nerve-signal patterns that our brain
interprets as distinct smells.
</P>
<P>
   But we don't all make the same use of that equipment. In fact,
many of us have noses that are just face furniture _ which is a
shame, because we're living through a fragrance revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Our olfactory environment has been radically altered by
synthetic substances emerging from the labs of organic chemists.
Some of them are noxious, but the ones in perfumes are often
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after her set-to with Jicky, my mother settled into a
long relationship with Lanvin's Arpege. She chose the perfume with
the perfect name. A pretty scent is like a melody _ an arpeggio of
chemical notes, each one a compound of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen
atoms strung together in a ring, a chain or a combination of the
two.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens or hundreds of ingredients in a perfume, but
they evaporate on the skin and waft into the nose in three distinct
stages, or ``notes,'' called top, middle and base, depending on how
big and volatile their molecules are.
</P>
<P>
   Top notes are flighty molecules that come off within minutes and
then vanish _ citrus-peel molecules like bergamot, for instance.
Base notes may linger for a day or more. In the old days _ before
prices skyrocketed and customers revolted against the practice _
the base was often made from animal secretions such as musk (with
which the Tibetan musk deer marks its territory) or ambergris (a
kind of sperm-whale excretion).
</P>
<P>
   In between top and base lies the heart of the perfume, which
drifts off the wearer for hours and is often a harmony of floral
scents.
</P>
<P>
   When Arpege was released in 1927, it helped consolidate a
revolution that had been launched a few years earlier by Chanel No.
5. Both perfumes contain traditional essences of jasmine and rose.
But both rely for their impact on straight-chain carbon molecules
called aldehydes that have no equivalent in nature-pure laboratory
creations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Arpege, you have a floral bouquet,'' says Elisabeth Carre,
a chemist at L'Oreal, the French cosmetics giant that now owns
Lanvin. ``But it's thrown into a radically different light by the
massive addition of aldehydes, which make the floral notes fresher
and more brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then perfume creation has been a partnership of artist and
chemist. And the artists, who can remember a thousand smells and
compose new scents in their heads, do not resent the intrusion of
science.
</P>
<P>
   ``A century ago perfumers had 20 or 30 synthetic products to
work with,'' says Olivier Cresp, a perfumer at Firmenich, a Swiss
fragrance company. ``Today we have 3,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with so many odor molecules on their palette, companies
like Firmenich are under pressure to find new ones. But the
chemists face a fundamental problem: No one knows why things smell
the way they do. No one knows what happens when an odor molecule
meets a receptor in the nose. Thus you can't design a new odor from
first principles.
</P>
<P>
   What you can fall back on are empirical rules of thumb. If
you're looking for a new fruity note, for instance, it's a good bet
to start with an ester, an odorous compound common in fruits that
forms when an alcohol reacts with a carboxylic acid.
</P>
<P>
   What if a perfumer is looking for a molecule that will evoke,
say, jasmine and the sea, perhaps for a perfume targeted at young
women who are in touch with their femininity and nevertheless show
a self-confident, adventurous spirit?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what you want for a jasmine smell, roughly, is a
molecule with a central carbon atom that's surrounded by three
different things: a highly polar group, a weakly polar group and a
long chain of carbon atoms,'' says Charles Sell, head of organic
chemistry at Quest International, another fragrance firm. (A polar
group has a slightly positive charge at one end of its molecular
bond and a slightly negative charge at the other.)
</P>
<P>
   Nitriles _ molecules that contain a nitrogen atom triple-bonded
to a carbon _ are compounds that sometimes smell of algae. If you
were to stick a nitrile into the polar slot of your jasmine
template, Sell says, you just might get a scent of
jasmine-by-the-sea.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, fragrance chemists can also leave the lab to seek
novelty in nature. That's the specialty of Roman Kaiser of Givaudan
Roure in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 years ago Kaiser helped pioneer headspace
technology, in which a glass dome is placed over a flower or other
odor source to capture all the volatile molecules the chemist's
nose would capture if his head were in that space. The chemist can
then synthesize the molecules and try to reconstitute the live
scent.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's passion is capturing scents in the wild. He has trapped
and later reconstituted the smell of carnations wafting off an
island near Brittany. A few years ago he even nosed around above a
tropical rain forest in a hot-air balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one of our first flights from the camp in French Guiana,''
Kaiser recalls, ``we saw a tree that was covered in white blossoms.
When we got closer, it turned out to be a vine that was blooming,
not the tree itself. The smell reminded me right away of vanilla
ice cream with hot raspberry sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   The tasty smell of that vine, reconstituted in his lab, has
since become a component of a new line of women's shower gels and
shampoos.
</P>
<P>
   Food smells are popular these days. Cresp helped start that rage
a few years ago with Angel, a perfume that smells of chocolate and
roasted almonds. Apparently, food smells remind many perfume buyers
of their childhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'd never felt a bond to any smell, edible or not _
until I visited the offices of L'Oreal, and Elisabeth Carre gave me
a whiff of Arpege. It was an odd and even troubling experience:
Suddenly, I felt the presence of my mother.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the aldehydes or the fruity undecalactone. Or maybe
it was the rose notes rising from the heart. &QL;

<P>
   Restless? Hungry for adventure? Follow me on a thrilling journey
of discovery to the inner reaches of ... your mouth. There we shall
hunt the elusive taste receptor, and we'll investigate rumors that
these highly specialized nerve cells, which transmit chemical
information to the brain, show up in greater numbers and densities
in some mouths.
</P>
<P>
   For the expedition, you'll need a few friends, a flashlight, a
magnifying glass, a vial of blue food coloring and some cotton
swabs. Also, bring salt, sugar, instant coffee powder, lemon and
plenty of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on to the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 1 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early explorers found taste receptors more populous in some
regions of the tongue than in others. To confirm this, wet the end
of a swab, roll it in a pile of salt and probe the tip, center,
sides and the very back of the tongue, rinsing between touches.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of taste, which is roughly proportional to the
number of receptors, will vary considerably depending on the spot.
The front of your tongue should register a far greater reaction
than the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a new dab of salt on the swab, probe the back of your
palate and around the inside of your mouth. You should discover
taste receptors dwelling on the roof of your mouth. They're in the
esophagus too. (But don't venture there. That territory is
patrolled by the gag reflex.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 2 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle a few drops of blue food coloring onto your tongue.
Gently rub in the color with a clean swab, and inspect the results
in the mirror using the flashlight and magnifying glass. Your
should see pale, mushroomlike structures called fungiform papillae
_ home to your taste buds _ floating in a sea of blue. These little
bumps each contain hundreds of taste-receptor cells.
</P>
<P>
   Compare the numbers of papillae at the tip of your tongue with
those in the middle. Now make your friends paint their tongues blue
and compare papillae densities. About 25 percent of us qualify as
superstars because our tongues are tightly packed with taste buds.
Another 25 percent are nontasters, with fewer and more sparsely
distributed papillae. The rest of us fall in between.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 3 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the last century, explorers thought different regions of the
tongue were territories of specific flavor receptors: The tip of
the tongue, for example, should taste sweet more intensely. But
recent forays into the mouth reveal that, although individual cells
are most excited by just one of the four tastes (salt, sweet,
bitter or sour), those cells don't congregate in particular areas.
</P>
<P>
   See this for yourself: Coat a fresh, wet swab with salt, and
gently touch your tongue in different areas, recording where your
taste seems strongest. Then, gargle with water to thoroughly
cleanse your palate, use a swab coated with sugar on the same
spots, and record those results. Gargle again, and then swab with
lemon juice. After a final gargle, try coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Compare your reactions with your friends'. Your taste pattern
may reveal more than just gustatory preferences. Recent studies
suggest links between taster status and behavioral disorders. For
example, nontasters tend to have a higher incidence of alcoholism,
perhaps because liquor seems less bitter to them.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, supertasters may avoid nutritious but mildly bitter
foods such as broccoli, thus depriving themselves of a balanced
diet. With a magnifying glass in hand and a blue tongue, explore
your mouth and seek your destiny. &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   ``Your grandmother loved all the Guerlain perfumes _ Shalimar,
Jicky. But I could never wear Jicky _ it just didn't go with my
skin.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother is telling perfume stories over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time your father and I went into the Guerlain shop in
Paris, and I tried on some Jicky. The girl had to take me back to
the employee washroom and scrub it off with strong soap. She wasn't
going to let me leave Guerlain smelling like that.''
</P>
<P>
   One perfume is much like another _ or so I used to think. Each
of the many odor receptors high in our nostrils can, in principle,
trigger thousands of different nerve-signal patterns that our brain
interprets as distinct smells.
</P>
<P>
   But we don't all make the same use of that equipment. In fact,
many of us have noses that are just face furniture _ which is a
shame, because we're living through a fragrance revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Our olfactory environment has been radically altered by
synthetic substances emerging from the labs of organic chemists.
Some of them are noxious, but the ones in perfumes are often
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after her set-to with Jicky, my mother settled into a
long relationship with Lanvin's Arpege. She chose the perfume with
the perfect name. A pretty scent is like a melody _ an arpeggio of
chemical notes, each one a compound of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen
atoms strung together in a ring, a chain or a combination of the
two.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens or hundreds of ingredients in a perfume, but
they evaporate on the skin and waft into the nose in three distinct
stages, or ``notes,'' called top, middle and base, depending on how
big and volatile their molecules are.
</P>
<P>
   Top notes are flighty molecules that come off within minutes and
then vanish _ citrus-peel molecules like bergamot, for instance.
Base notes may linger for a day or more. In the old days _ before
prices skyrocketed and customers revolted against the practice _
the base was often made from animal secretions such as musk (with
which the Tibetan musk deer marks its territory) or ambergris (a
kind of sperm-whale excretion).
</P>
<P>
   In between top and base lies the heart of the perfume, which
drifts off the wearer for hours and is often a harmony of floral
scents.
</P>
<P>
   When Arpege was released in 1927, it helped consolidate a
revolution that had been launched a few years earlier by Chanel No.
5. Both perfumes contain traditional essences of jasmine and rose.
But both rely for their impact on straight-chain carbon molecules
called aldehydes that have no equivalent in nature-pure laboratory
creations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Arpege, you have a floral bouquet,'' says Elisabeth Carre,
a chemist at L'Oreal, the French cosmetics giant that now owns
Lanvin. ``But it's thrown into a radically different light by the
massive addition of aldehydes, which make the floral notes fresher
and more brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then perfume creation has been a partnership of artist and
chemist. And the artists, who can remember a thousand smells and
compose new scents in their heads, do not resent the intrusion of
science.
</P>
<P>
   ``A century ago perfumers had 20 or 30 synthetic products to
work with,'' says Olivier Cresp, a perfumer at Firmenich, a Swiss
fragrance company. ``Today we have 3,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with so many odor molecules on their palette, companies
like Firmenich are under pressure to find new ones. But the
chemists face a fundamental problem: No one knows why things smell
the way they do. No one knows what happens when an odor molecule
meets a receptor in the nose. Thus you can't design a new odor from
first principles.
</P>
<P>
   What you can fall back on are empirical rules of thumb. If
you're looking for a new fruity note, for instance, it's a good bet
to start with an ester, an odorous compound common in fruits that
forms when an alcohol reacts with a carboxylic acid.
</P>
<P>
   What if a perfumer is looking for a molecule that will evoke,
say, jasmine and the sea, perhaps for a perfume targeted at young
women who are in touch with their femininity and nevertheless show
a self-confident, adventurous spirit?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what you want for a jasmine smell, roughly, is a
molecule with a central carbon atom that's surrounded by three
different things: a highly polar group, a weakly polar group and a
long chain of carbon atoms,'' says Charles Sell, head of organic
chemistry at Quest International, another fragrance firm. (A polar
group has a slightly positive charge at one end of its molecular
bond and a slightly negative charge at the other.)
</P>
<P>
   Nitriles _ molecules that contain a nitrogen atom triple-bonded
to a carbon _ are compounds that sometimes smell of algae. If you
were to stick a nitrile into the polar slot of your jasmine
template, Sell says, you just might get a scent of
jasmine-by-the-sea.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, fragrance chemists can also leave the lab to seek
novelty in nature. That's the specialty of Roman Kaiser of Givaudan
Roure in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 years ago Kaiser helped pioneer headspace
technology, in which a glass dome is placed over a flower or other
odor source to capture all the volatile molecules the chemist's
nose would capture if his head were in that space. The chemist can
then synthesize the molecules and try to reconstitute the live
scent.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's passion is capturing scents in the wild. He has trapped
and later reconstituted the smell of carnations wafting off an
island near Brittany. A few years ago he even nosed around above a
tropical rain forest in a hot-air balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one of our first flights from the camp in French Guiana,''
Kaiser recalls, ``we saw a tree that was covered in white blossoms.
When we got closer, it turned out to be a vine that was blooming,
not the tree itself. The smell reminded me right away of vanilla
ice cream with hot raspberry sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   The tasty smell of that vine, reconstituted in his lab, has
since become a component of a new line of women's shower gels and
shampoos.
</P>
<P>
   Food smells are popular these days. Cresp helped start that rage
a few years ago with Angel, a perfume that smells of chocolate and
roasted almonds. Apparently, food smells remind many perfume buyers
of their childhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'd never felt a bond to any smell, edible or not _
until I visited the offices of L'Oreal, and Elisabeth Carre gave me
a whiff of Arpege. It was an odd and even troubling experience:
Suddenly, I felt the presence of my mother.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the aldehydes or the fruity undecalactone. Or maybe
it was the rose notes rising from the heart. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 2 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle a few drops of blue food coloring onto your tongue.
Gently rub in the color with a clean swab, and inspect the results
in the mirror using the flashlight and magnifying glass. Your
should see pale, mushroomlike structures called fungiform papillae
_ home to your taste buds _ floating in a sea of blue. These little
bumps each contain hundreds of taste-receptor cells.
</P>
<P>
   Compare the numbers of papillae at the tip of your tongue with
those in the middle. Now make your friends paint their tongues blue
and compare papillae densities. About 25 percent of us qualify as
superstars because our tongues are tightly packed with taste buds.
Another 25 percent are nontasters, with fewer and more sparsely
distributed papillae. The rest of us fall in between.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 3 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the last century, explorers thought different regions of the
tongue were territories of specific flavor receptors: The tip of
the tongue, for example, should taste sweet more intensely. But
recent forays into the mouth reveal that, although individual cells
are most excited by just one of the four tastes (salt, sweet,
bitter or sour), those cells don't congregate in particular areas.
</P>
<P>
   See this for yourself: Coat a fresh, wet swab with salt, and
gently touch your tongue in different areas, recording where your
taste seems strongest. Then, gargle with water to thoroughly
cleanse your palate, use a swab coated with sugar on the same
spots, and record those results. Gargle again, and then swab with
lemon juice. After a final gargle, try coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Compare your reactions with your friends'. Your taste pattern
may reveal more than just gustatory preferences. Recent studies
suggest links between taster status and behavioral disorders. For
example, nontasters tend to have a higher incidence of alcoholism,
perhaps because liquor seems less bitter to them.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, supertasters may avoid nutritious but mildly bitter
foods such as broccoli, thus depriving themselves of a balanced
diet. With a magnifying glass in hand and a blue tongue, explore
your mouth and seek your destiny. &QL;

   Restless? Hungry for adventure? Follow me on a thrilling journey
of discovery to the inner reaches of ... your mouth. There we shall
hunt the elusive taste receptor, and we'll investigate rumors that
these highly specialized nerve cells, which transmit chemical
information to the brain, show up in greater numbers and densities
in some mouths.
</P>
<P>
   For the expedition, you'll need a few friends, a flashlight, a
magnifying glass, a vial of blue food coloring and some cotton
swabs. Also, bring salt, sugar, instant coffee powder, lemon and
plenty of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on to the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 1 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early explorers found taste receptors more populous in some
regions of the tongue than in others. To confirm this, wet the end
of a swab, roll it in a pile of salt and probe the tip, center,
sides and the very back of the tongue, rinsing between touches.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of taste, which is roughly proportional to the
number of receptors, will vary considerably depending on the spot.
The front of your tongue should register a far greater reaction
than the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a new dab of salt on the swab, probe the back of your
palate and around the inside of your mouth. You should discover
taste receptors dwelling on the roof of your mouth. They're in the
esophagus too. (But don't venture there. That territory is
patrolled by the gag reflex.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 2 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle a few drops of blue food coloring onto your tongue.
Gently rub in the color with a clean swab, and inspect the results
in the mirror using the flashlight and magnifying glass. Your
should see pale, mushroomlike structures called fungiform papillae
_ home to your taste buds _ floating in a sea of blue. These little
bumps each contain hundreds of taste-receptor cells.
</P>
<P>
   Compare the numbers of papillae at the tip of your tongue with
those in the middle. Now make your friends paint their tongues blue
and compare papillae densities. About 25 percent of us qualify as
superstars because our tongues are tightly packed with taste buds.

TEENS GUIDE PARENTS THROUGH THE CRINGE YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA MATCHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When 16-year-old Zack Elias told his mother he ought to write a
book about all the ways parents embarrass their teenagers, her
response was surprisingly un-embarrassing. She actually encouraged
him.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Elias, vice president of Ballantine Publishing Group, had
a hunch such a book might find a sympathetic audience among other
clueless parents _ who seem to do nothing right while raising
teenage children. So, with his friend Travis Goldman, Zack Elias
spent the summer of 1997 working on a comprehensive guide to the
things parents should never do, say, wear, buy, eat, snicker at, or
comment on in or near their teenager's presence, to avoid utterly
humiliating them.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``How Not to Embarrass Your Kids,'' an 80-page
manual that spells out 250 ``don'ts'' for adults raising teenage
sons or daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The authors' premise is that parents not only mortify their
teenagers on a daily basis, but ``are actually oblivious to our
steady discomfort,'' they write in their introduction.
</P>
<P>
   The book leaves no source of humiliation undocumented. There are
prohibitions for eating in restaurants (``don't tell your life
story to the waiter''); attending movies (``don't yell out the
answers to the pre-movie trivia quiz show''); for driving (``don't
use the steering wheel as a drum or the dashboard as a keyboard'');
for fashion (``don't wear pants that stop above the ankle'').
</P>
<P>
   Some don'ts would probably seem reasonable enough to parents.
``Don't walk around in a bathrobe or your underwear'' and ``don't
call us by your pet nicknames in front of our friends'' might fall
into this category. Other no-no's are much less obvious (``don't
ask us to walk the dog when we are with a friend'' and ``don't ever
buy Jujubees or Jujyfruits'').
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know all these things were embarrassing,''
acknowledges Betsy Elias, citing the chapter on watching TV, with
such advice as ``don't use your index finger to work the remote _
always use your thumb.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I walk into the room and sit down and watch TV, all I've
done is watch TV,'' she says, in a telephone interview. ``It's not
like I've walked in and burped, or said something risque.''
</P>
<P>
   Elias and Goldman are 19 now and college freshmen _ Elias at
UMass-Amherst, and Goldman at Boston University. They had low hopes
for their book's publishing prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted a nice letter of rejection from a good company
that we could put in our college applications saying we'd tried to
publish a book but failed,'' says Elias.
</P>
<P>
   But Betsy Elias asked a friend to recommend an agent, who
shopped the manuscript around. As though Elias' mother wasn't
embarrassing enough already for Zack, her own company, Ballantine,
rejected it. But Warner Books jumped at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too far away from being a teenager myself, and I found
myself laughing out loud when I read it,'' says John Aherne, an
associate editor for Warner Books in his early 20s who acquired and
edited the book, now in its second printing with 17,000 books in
print. ``Everything they described was something my parents did to
me and my friends' parents did to them. They knew exactly what it
was that parents did to drive their kids up the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is one conclusion that can be reached from the book,
it's that the infractions cited by the authors are eerily familiar.
Is there a parent on the continent who has not violated the
following rules from ``How Not to Embarrass Your Kids'':
</P>
<P>
   --Don't ever say, when we are using the (television) remote,
``you're going too fast; I can't see what's on.''
</P>
<P>
   --Don't point to another kid whose shirt is tucked in and say
how nice he/she looks.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't make a whole big thing when you ask us what we did at
school all day and we answer ``nothing.'' For example, don't ever
say, ``OK, so you just sat and looked at the wall all day?''
</P>
<P>
   --Don't sing out loud to the golden oldies.
</P>
<P>
   Parents' ``general presence is embarrassing,'' says Elias,
interviewed in his unkempt UMass dorm room, the walls covered with
Led Zeppelin and movie posters, the floor with books and laundry.
He freely owns up to liking his parents a lot, but that doesn't
diminish his urge to crawl under a rock when, for example, his
father cheers too loudly for his ball team or quips to the man in
the turnpike booth, ``this is highway robbery.'' Goldman describes
the same urge to hide, but for different reasons _ his father's
tendency to wear sleeveless shirts, for instance, or his mother's
habit of ``dragging me by the arm into a clothes store and saying
to the clerk, `What would be cool for a person like my son here?'
''
</P>
<P>
   The boys argue no venue is safe for teens when they are
accompanied by their parents, not even when they're out of town.
Elias thought the coast was clear the time he went to Paris with
his mother, until he bumped into a friend from school while at the
Louvre. (The embarrassment was mitigated slightly by the fact that
the other boy was with his parents. ``We just gave each other a
look and went our separate ways,'' he recalls.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, family vacations bring a whole set of risks _ such as
being in one's parents' presence when they wear dorky hats, affect
local customs, such as kissing everyone on both cheeks while in
France, or attempt in vain to speak a foreign language. (Goldman
says his mother once mortified him in Spain by asking, ``Donde esta
the little girl's room?'')
</P>
<P>
   Elias maintains that the rule of thumb for parents when a
teenager is with friends is to keep a low profile. Very low. ``The
preferred distance is 3.5 miles.''
</P>
<P>
   One expert on teenagers thinks there is a better approach to
handling the embarrassment issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the solution is not to try not to embarrass your kid
because it's not possible,'' says psychologist Anthony E. Wolf of
Longmeadow, author of ``Get Out of My Life But First Can You Drive
Me and Cheryl to the Mall?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not work to walk on eggshells lest you mortify them,
and simply breathing mortifies them. If you talk, you run the risk
of enraging them.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Wolf says in an interview, ``When you say, `Good
morning my darling,' and they go, `Oh God,' just give them a big
hug, as though to say, `You can't stand me but I love you so much
anyway and I don't take it personally.' It absolutely works and
(deflects) their grumpiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he agrees that, for almost all teenagers,
commingling between parents and friends is ``embarrassment beyond
belief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once kids get into their teens, they develop an allergy to
their parents,'' Wolf says. ``It's a 100 percent normal thing.''
The hallmark of adolescence, as he writes in his book, is the
mandate to ``turn away from childhood and childish feelings.'' And,
since childhood is marked by domination by parents, it follows that
teenagers must experience themselves as independent. Reminders of
their parents' hold on them are simply, well, embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   There is good news, though. ``The nice thing is, it passes, as
they become more independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Zack Elias. ``Now when I come back from college, the
chances of being seen by my friends is a lot smaller,'' he says.
``The risk factor is much less.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE FIVE MOST EMBARRASSING OFFENSES BY PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1) Don't be seen in your underwear when your teenager's friends
are over.
</P>
<P>
   2) Don't tell the salesperson your life story or your kid's life
story.
</P>
<P>
   3) When your kid is shopping for clothes, don't ever say the
word ``crotch.''
</P>
<P>
   4) Don't cheer loudly for your kids when they are playing
sports, and if they get injured, don't rush up to them and say,
``Suck it up and deal.''
</P>
<P>
   5) Never go to the movies with your kids, and if you have to,
sit far away from them.

   (UNDATED) _ Anyone who thinks this year's American election
campaign is especially dirty should read a new book, ``American
Dreamer: A Life of Henry A. Wallace,'' and think again.
</P>
<P>
   As his sympathetic biographers recall, when Henry Wallace, the
vice president in Franklin Roosevelt's third term, had the temerity
to break with the Democratic Party and run on the Progressive
ticket for the presidency in 1948, he was demonized as a wild-eyed
fanatic bent on destroying the American way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, an agricultural scientist in Iowa before he went into
politics, described himself in that campaign as a ``progressive
capitalist,'' and he had the record to back the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Before he reformed American farm policy as the country's
secretary of agriculture during the Depression, he founded a
company called Pioneer Hi-Bred to promote hybrid maize.
</P>
<P>
   The business not only grew into a multinational that made
Wallace a rich man. It helped quadruple corn yields on American
farmland and, through a poultry subsidiary, accounted for
three-quarters of the egg-laying chickens sold commercially
worldwide before it was acquired by Du Pont.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by election day in 1948 his reputation was in tatters. He
had been transformed in the public mind into a frightening figure,
and he got a mere 1.2 million votes, fewer even than the Dixiecrat
candidate, Strom Thurmond.
</P>
<P>
   As his biographers, John Culver and John Hyde, put it: ``The
thoughtful scientist had become the impractical mystic.''
</P>
<P>
   The defender of the Second World War was transformed into an
appeaser and the ``deeply religious grandson of a Presbyterian
minister had become an apostle of godless totalitarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   How did it happen? Culver and Hyde point mainly to the smear
tactics of the successful candidate, Harry Truman.
</P>
<P>
   He represented Wallace as, at best, a fellow-traveller when, for
instance, he infamously urged him ``to go to the country he loves
so well (the Soviet Union) and help them out against his own
country if that's the way he feels.''
</P>
<P>
   But they also point to Wallace himself. He left himself
vulnerable to the red-baiters, they argue, by naively refusing to
distance himself from, still less disown, such Communist supporters
as Paul Robeson, an American singer and actor who went on to win
the Stalin Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there was something magnificent about the
Progressive Party's disastrous campaign. ``You can call us black,
or you can call us Red, but you can't call us yellow,'' said one of
Wallace's top aides, and he was right.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate refused to give in to mobs that pelted him with
vegetables and screamed racist abuse. In Southern states, he slept
in the homes of black supporters and ate from picnic baskets to
avoid segregated hotels and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his followers were as brave. When the Pittsburgh Press
in a crude effort at intimidation published the names, addresses
and places of employment of 1,000 Wallacites in western
Pennsylvania, only ten of them recanted.
</P>
<P>
   The Wallace story did not end there. Much of the Progressive
Party manifesto that seemed extreme to most Americans then is now
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   It called for desegregated schools and armed services, votes for
18-year-olds, equal rights for women, public day-care facilities
and home rule for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the loser of 1948 was, eventually, the winner. &QL;

CRUCIBLE OF WAR 
The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North
America, 1754-1766 
By Fred Anderson 
Knopf, 862 pp., illustrated, $40 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Historians now recognize the French and Indian War as not merely
some isolated frontier conflict, memorable as the background for
the historical novels of James Fenimore Cooper, but as the event
that created the conditions for the American Revolution. In its
guise as the North American component of the Seven Years' War _ the
first global conflict, waged also in Europe, in India, and at sea _
that frontier war also weakened the power of the European
empire-states. The argument is that defeat of the French in Canada
freed the English-speaking colonies from dependence on Britain for
military security and released the pent-up expansionist pressures
felt by the colonists.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Fred Anderson underscores that argument by bracketing
his account of the conflict between two set pieces involving George
Washington. Washington, it turns out, was in at the beginning _ a
frontier skirmish (a year before the better-known Braddock's
Defeat) in which a French emissary was hacked to death before his
eyes by Washington's Indian guides. (This is a brilliantly written
scene-setter which for Anderson is ``a clear example of a
historical moment when events . . . run out of control.'') As a
postwar planter and land speculator, Washington symbolizes the
aspirations of the colonists for economic freedom from British
control and for land in areas formerly under French or Indian
control. But these aspirations were blocked, in the first case by
taxation and trade-control measures, and in the second by Britain's
promises to its Indian war allies.
</P>
<P>
   Between these two events, Anderson has laid out the course of
the conflict as it moves from the North American frontier to Europe
and the Far East, and then back to the frontier. Anderson pays
particular attention to the important role the various Indian
tribes played in enabling the French to win a string of victories
in the early years of the war, including Braddock's Defeat, and
then their contribution to the final British victory after their
allegience had dramatically shifted.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point came in July 1759, when Iroquois warriors
joined the British forces at the siege of Fort Niagara _ to the
complete surprise of the French defenders. As Anderson carefully
notes, they were acting not out of some whim, but after
considerable deliberation in the preceding winter months by the
chiefs of the six Iroquois nations meeting at Onondaga. ``For the
first time in its history,'' Anderson writes, ``New France would
face its enemies alone.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also significant that much of the second half of the
750-page text is devoted to the political fallout of the war in the
North American colonies. Anderson's account of the 1766 campaign
for the Massachusetts House between ``the court party'' and ``the
country party'' is as lively as that of any contemporary
legislative campaign. It was, he writes, ``the first time in the
history of the Bay Colony (that) an attempt to to organize a
province-wide political campaign actually worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, a Harvard-trained historian now at the University of
Colorado, is also the author of ``A People's Army,'' a
well-regarded study of Massachusetts soldiers during the French and
Indian War. His ``Crucible of War,'' which expands on that work, is
likely to stand as the standard account of the French and Indian
War, if not of the global Seven Years' War as well. Its bulk
includes nine superbly executed maps and 63 illustrations from
historical sources, which Anderson uses as opportunities to treat
matters of geography and the characters of leading players.
</P>
<P>
   Readers for whom the French and Indian War has long held a
romantic fascination will want to pull out their copies of Francis
Parkman's ``Montcalm and Wolfe'' and compare his classic accounts
of Braddock's Defeat, the Battle of Quebec, and other events with
Anderson's. They will find that as a story-teller, Anderson
compares more than favorably _ that opening scene-setter at
Jumonville's Glen sets a vivid standard for the rest of the book _
and gets the edge with the benefit of the scholarship available to
a modern historian.

<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Anyone who thinks this year's American election
campaign is especially dirty should read a new book, ``American
Dreamer: A Life of Henry A. Wallace,'' and think again.
</P>
<P>
   As his sympathetic biographers recall, when Henry Wallace, the
vice president in Franklin Roosevelt's third term, had the temerity
to break with the Democratic Party and run on the Progressive
ticket for the presidency in 1948, he was demonized as a wild-eyed
fanatic bent on destroying the American way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, an agricultural scientist in Iowa before he went into
politics, described himself in that campaign as a ``progressive
capitalist,'' and he had the record to back the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Before he reformed American farm policy as the country's
secretary of agriculture during the Depression, he founded a
company called Pioneer Hi-Bred to promote hybrid maize.
</P>
<P>
   The business not only grew into a multinational that made
Wallace a rich man. It helped quadruple corn yields on American
farmland and, through a poultry subsidiary, accounted for
three-quarters of the egg-laying chickens sold commercially
worldwide before it was acquired by Du Pont.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by election day in 1948 his reputation was in tatters. He
had been transformed in the public mind into a frightening figure,
and he got a mere 1.2 million votes, fewer even than the Dixiecrat
candidate, Strom Thurmond.
</P>
<P>
   As his biographers, John Culver and John Hyde, put it: ``The
thoughtful scientist had become the impractical mystic.''
</P>
<P>
   The defender of the Second World War was transformed into an
appeaser and the ``deeply religious grandson of a Presbyterian
minister had become an apostle of godless totalitarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   How did it happen? Culver and Hyde point mainly to the smear
tactics of the successful candidate, Harry Truman.
</P>
<P>
   He represented Wallace as, at best, a fellow-traveller when, for
instance, he infamously urged him ``to go to the country he loves
so well (the Soviet Union) and help them out against his own
country if that's the way he feels.''
</P>
<P>
   But they also point to Wallace himself. He left himself
vulnerable to the red-baiters, they argue, by naively refusing to
distance himself from, still less disown, such Communist supporters
as Paul Robeson, an American singer and actor who went on to win
the Stalin Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there was something magnificent about the
Progressive Party's disastrous campaign. ``You can call us black,
or you can call us Red, but you can't call us yellow,'' said one of
Wallace's top aides, and he was right.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate refused to give in to mobs that pelted him with
vegetables and screamed racist abuse. In Southern states, he slept
in the homes of black supporters and ate from picnic baskets to
avoid segregated hotels and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his followers were as brave. When the Pittsburgh Press
in a crude effort at intimidation published the names, addresses
and places of employment of 1,000 Wallacites in western
Pennsylvania, only ten of them recanted.
</P>
<P>
   The Wallace story did not end there. Much of the Progressive
Party manifesto that seemed extreme to most Americans then is now
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   It called for desegregated schools and armed services, votes for
18-year-olds, equal rights for women, public day-care facilities
and home rule for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the loser of 1948 was, eventually, the winner. &QL;

IN JULIA CHILD'S OLD KITCHEN, KATHIE ALEX HOLDS FORTH

<P>
   CHATEAUNEUF DE GRASSE, France _ There was a moment during Kathie
Alex's apprenticeship on the Cote d'Azur two decades ago, in the
then three-star Moulin de Mougins restaurant, when she wondered
what she was doing. Forty years old and trying to keep up with a
very young all-male staff, she was too exhausted to do anything but
sleep on the beach during the afternoon break. In her real
``bedroom'' _ a friend's living-room floor _ she wasn't much better
off. ``I had a big house in California and a Mercedes in the
garage,'' Alex recalls. ``Sometimes it didn't make much sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But sunny California came with marriage problems. Sunny Provence
promised something else. She was the first woman ever to work in
Roger Verge's famous Mougins kitchen. If she stuck with it, who
knew what would come her way?
</P>
<P>
   Something quite wonderful, as it turned out. Alex now owns La
Pitchoune (The Little One), the light-filled stucco cottage that
Julia and Paul Child built on a former potato patch 35 years ago in
this small town on the eastern edge of Provence, near the French
Riviera. In the same kitchen where Julia Child tested recipes for
the second volume of ``Mastering the Art of French Cooking,'' Alex
runs a school she calls Cooking With Friends in France. The
students are mostly Americans. Probably the same Americans who
learned to cook from ``Mastering'' in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Child is pleased that Alex got her house. ``She's a darling
person,'' Child says on the telephone from her winter residence in
Santa Barbara, Calif. ``She's just charming. She knows the whole
area, and she's so friendly with everyone. What a nice way to learn
French cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   When Alex first began teaching in the house in the early '90s,
Child wrote to her. ``I hear everything's going well,'' she wrote.
``I'm counting on you to teach Americans about butter and cream.''
</P>
<P>
   The two met 20 years ago, when Alex came here to take a class
from Simone ``Simca'' Beck, Child's friend and ``Mastering''
coauthor, who died in 1991. La Pitchoune is located within Domaine
de Bramafam, a 62-acre compound owned by a cousin of Jean
Fishbacher, Beck's husband.
</P>
<P>
   Built with royalties from the first volume of ``Mastering,'' the
single-level house is surrounded by olive trees and a sun-drenched
patio. Like all French houses, it has a small and unadorned
kitchen. This one contains a simple four-burner stove, a
dishwasher, a work table that seats six, and pegboard to hang pans
and implements. Paul Child, Julia's husband, installed the board
and drew lines around each pot, a system he also used to organize
the Childs' Cambridge kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   It's not what students expect. To reach Bramafam, they have to
fly into Nice, rent a car, and drive the half-hour to Grasse, near
the famous perfume factories. They pass groves of olive trees, rows
of cypresses, and field after field of roses and grapevines. Once
they're inside the back door, Alex says, it's not uncommon to hear
someone say, ``Wow, this is small.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' she usually answers. ``This is the way it was.
You don't need a professional kitchen.'' But Child did cook on a La
Cornue range, which was gone by the time Alex arrived.
</P>
<P>
   And then the students settle in. They sleep in the Child cottage
or in a neighboring house that belongs to the Beck heirs, and they
spend a week cooking Provence's aromatic ingredients, sampling
local cheeses, visiting the street markets and Alex's own
purveyors, touring a two-star kitchen, and eating meals under a
mulberry tree on the patio, where lavender hangs over the wall and
the air smells of rosemary.
</P>
<P>
   Alex's guest book is filled with her students' enthusiasm. Early
in the week, everyone seems to overcome the small-kitchen worry.
``Some segments of `The French Chef' were done in this kitchen,''
says Alex. She has painted the little room and meticulously redrawn
Paul Child's outlines on the pegboard _ even though she doesn't own
the pots that were once there. ``If I can put out a meal in three
hours from this basic stove,'' she tells her students, ``you can
too.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julia and Paul Child had spent many years in France when Paul
worked for the United States Information Service. Once they went
back to the United States, they liked the idea of returning to
France for vacations. They decided they wanted a house in the
south, Julia Child recalls, ``and Simca said, `We'll lend you some
property.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't more official than that. ``It was understood through a
handshake that we would leave it one day,'' says Child.
</P>
<P>
   They had a simple house built, with three bedrooms. Julia and
Paul each had one, and there was a third for guests. While the
Childs were in the States, Simone Beck furnished the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simca also put in all the lawn and so forth.'' Child says she
wouldn't have landscaped it as well: ``I would have had pots of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fishbachers took care of the house. When the Childs would
arrive for their winter stay, ``the heat was on and the fridge was
full,'' says Child. ``Simca was very, very generous _ rather
un-French. They were just lovely to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Child tested recipes in the kitchen and could walk between the
olive trees to confer with Beck. Since the 1950s, Beck and her
husband had lived in the ``mas,'' the property's 300-year-old
farmhouse, which once housed both the landowners and their animals.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Child used a tiny two-room house next to La Pitchoune,
called the ``cabanon,'' as his painting studio. Alex now uses it as
her office and its basement as the wine cellar (the Childs did
too). When students are at La Pitchoune, Alex sleeps in the
cabanon.
</P>
<P>
   There are several similar little houses all over the property,
once used by workers. ``Italians walked down here from the Piedmont
to pick olives,'' says Alex.
</P>
<P>
   She began renting La Pitchoune when Julia Child stopped coming,
the year after Beck died. Child went for the last time in 1992,
just before her 80th birthday. Jean Fishbacher had died, Paul Child
was in a nursing home in Lexington, Mass., and the place held too
many memories for her, she told an interviewer after returning that
last time.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Fishbacher's sister, France Thibault, inherited the
property. She sold La Pitchoune to Alex a year ago _ and if she
hadn't, Alex might not have gotten it. Thibault died last month,
and her sons made the transaction difficult, Alex says. Alex now
owns 1 1/4 acres of land, which, according to local law, is the
minimum lot for a house.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Windows, shutters, and wiring all need attention, so Alex is
renovating slowly. Some things she won't touch. ``Julia is a note
person,'' says Alex. The bedroom that she used still has a packing
list tacked inside the closet door, pinned high so the 6-foot-2
cook didn't have to stoop to read it. ``Stockings &AMP; u/wear'' are on
the list, as are ``passport &AMP; dollars,'' ``eve purse,'' and
``make-up (all).'' Paul's list includes ``razor, t-brush, etc,''
``pills (all),'' and ``handk &AMP; underwear &AMP; ties.''
</P>
<P>
   Some notes were addressed to housekeepers, and those, of course,
were in French. Over the dishwasher, one reads: ``Ne pas ouvrir et
ne pas stopper en cours de route'' (``Don't open or stop during the
cycle''). Another lists what equipment should never go into the
washer: kitchen knives, iron frying pan, things made of wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love it,'' says Alex. ``I want to keep it the way it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex takes nothing for granted. She is grateful to be living
here, and when students come, she puts on the dog. Weeklong classes
cost $1,950, and the groups don't exceed eight people, just the
right number to fit into the kitchen. The rate includes six nights'
lodging, breakfast and lunch, five lessons, and excursions. Alex
arranges for a local chef to come in and teach one of the days,
often Christian Morisset of La Terrasse in Juan-les-Pins, a
Michelin two-star restaurant. The chef cooks while Alex translates.
</P>
<P>
   Classes are held only during May, June, September, October, and
November, since winters are chilly in Provence and summers hot and
crowded. Alex does take students outside her regular months when
she can.
</P>
<P>
   She is a confident but unpretentious cook. One day recently, she
hadn't had time to prepare anything for lunch guests, and she
opened the refrigerator to see what was there. Students had just
finished a special weeklong winter truffle program. She found some
roasted peppers, fresh tomato sauce, a few eggs, and big slabs of
butter, and turned them into the classic piperade. Along with salad
greens tossed with a mustardy vinaigrette and some local goat
cheese, she presented a fine lunch, served on traditional Provencal
pottery in deep olive and mustard, on a colorful yellow cloth
typical of the region, on the table under the mulberry tree.
</P>
<P>
   The winter sun was warming, and the setting was just about
perfect. ``Look,'' Alex says, pointing to some chips around the
edges of the plates. The thrifty French Chef had ``painted'' them
with marker pens to cover the chips; the colors weren't quite the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Alex wouldn't dream of buying new ones.

GLENN FINDS HIS OFFSEASON DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was ready to hit the road Tuesday, 12 hours nonstop from
Columbus, Ohio, to Boston, so he would be in Foxborough in time for
this morning's team meeting, the first of the Bill Belichick era.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Glenn said he has made a commitment to the new Patriots
coach to take part in the team's strength and conditioning program.
He's also making the commitment to himself and to the fans to be
the go-to guy, especially with Bruce Armstrong, Ben Coates, and
Shawn Jefferson no longer with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want that,'' said the Pro Bowl wide receiver, who will be
entering his fifth year with the Patriots. ``I want to be the guy.
I'm ready for that. I have been ready for that. I thought I did
well when I was thrown the ball last year. I think everyone knows I
can make things happen when I get the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be strange not seeing Ben and Bruce and Shawn
around here, but I know Ben and Bruce will hook on someplace else
and I know Shawn, who came into this league as a ninth-round draft
pick, finally has a chance to make his money and take care of his
family. I'm happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ben and Bruce can't find a place to play, it would great
for both of them to come back here. That would make our team that
much better.''
</P>
<P>
   With two pass catchers gone, the pressure on Glenn almost
certainly will increase.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Brown, who is now the highest-paid receiver on the team,
will be the No. 2 and maybe even the No. 3 guy if Tony Simmons is
able to move up. And between now and September, the Patriots may
add another veteran.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever happens, Glenn knows the focus will be squarely on
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with a new offense that will mix things up and keep
the defense off-balance _ which is what I think Charlie (Weis) is
going to have here _ the sky's the limit for us,'' said Glenn. ``We
know we have an excellent defense, and with Bill running that, you
know we're going to be a top team offensively. If we can plug in a
few holes between now and the start of the season, we're going to
be a very productive offense. When you have Drew (Bledsoe) out
there, good things are going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn just bought a new house in a Columbus suburb, and except
for spending a few days in Honolulu for the Pro Bowl, he has been
taking courses at Ohio State this offseason. He was scheduled to do
his workouts with Ohio State conditioning coach Dave Kennedy, but
Belichick wants Glenn in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   After the team meeting, Glenn will return to Columbus to take
exams, then make it back for the official start of the strength
program Monday. The program runs through the first week of June.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Bill wants and that's what I'm going to do,'' said
Glenn. ``Bill has called me a couple of times and explained the
importance of all of us being around for the program since this is
the first year, so I understand that and I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   While Glenn concedes ``it's not my first preference,'' he said
he's aware that star players need to set an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited about this season,'' said Glenn, who played
in the first 15 games last season before coach Pete Carroll
suspended him, allegedly for breaking team rules when he had the
flu. Glenn still has a grievance pending on the suspension; it
could be heard by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn doesn't have to worry about playing for Carroll
anymore, and Belichick, who had a close relationship with Glenn in
1996 in New England, has said he will not look to deal Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Receivers coach Ivan Fears was one of the few assistants
retained from the Carroll regime, and Glenn also looks forward to
teaming up with Weis again. Weis was New England's receivers coach
in Glenn's rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going to his house and having hamburgers,'' said
Glenn. ``Charlie took me in and made me feel welcome. When I got
here in '96, we had key people in place like Drew and Curtis
(Martin), and I think having the big receiver was the key piece
that was missing and I was able to fill that. Now, Drew and I are
in place and we're trying to find the running game.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who thought some of his teammates had turned on him when
he wasn't able to play in the final game of '99, thinks the air is
clear and there are no more issues surrounding him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to win,'' said Glenn. ``It was frustrating at
times last year. There's no reason the players on this team can't
rally together and produce an excellent team. I'm going to try hard
to do that.''

&HT;     AQUARIUM PUBLISHES EATERS' GUIDE OF FISH NOT TO EAT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTEREY, Calif. _ It is a hot item on the restaurant menu, but
the Patagonian toothfish is quickly disappearing from southern
ocean waters off the United States, along with orange roughy,
redfish, Atlantic swordfish, Georges Bank cod and other fading
stars.
</P>
<P>
   To alert eaters about what is really hot and what is barely
surviving in the ocean, the Monterey Bay Aquarium has issued
``Seafood Watch: A Guide for Consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the size of the fish populations and how well they are
managed by government regulators and fishermen, the aquarium is
providing three lists: ``best choices,'' ``proceed with caution''
and ``avoid.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal, said Monterey Bay Aquarium Executive Director Julie
Packard, is to use market pressure to conserve ocean species and
healthy diets.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say that overfishing has plundered the ocean. As of
1993 nearly 80 percent of the commercially valuable fish _ those
whose status is known _ were overfished or ``fished to their full
potential,'' according to the National Marine Fisheries Service, a
branch of the U.S. Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   A report to Congress by 40 scientists said that almost all of
the important fish stocks off the northeastern, southeastern and
Gulf of Mexico coasts of the United States are either overfished or
nearing that status.
</P>
<P>
   Through its new guidebook, the aquarium, backed by information
from a panel of scientists and the Audubon Living Oceans Program,
warns restaurant-goers and cooks away from those fish whose
populations have been dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   Seafood is placed on the ``avoid'' list if the numbers are
depleted or the method of fishing them also kills turtles or
incidentally takes tons of other fish, called the by-catch.
</P>
<P>
   American lobster, bluefin tuna, lingcod, rockfish, monkfish,
shark, trawl-caught spot prawns and farmed salmon, among others,
are on that list.
</P>
<P>
   Farmed salmon and shrimp also are on the ``avoid'' list because
they sometimes create waste, disease and, in the case of salmon,
occasionally escape into a wild population.
</P>
<P>
   On the ``best choice'' list are albacore tuna, squid, Dungeness
crab, California and Alaska wild salmon and Alaska halibut. The
eat-up list also includes the following farmed animals: oysters,
clams, rainbow trout, catfish and striped bass.
</P>
<P>
   Some fish that make the ``proceed with caution'' list are
petrale and English sole, snow crab, Bay scallops and shrimp, and
wild Washington and Oregon salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The Packard Foundation, which founded the Monterey Bay Aquarium
in 1984, is spending $3 million this year to support consumer
education, eco-labeling and certification programs for well-managed
fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   A well-managed fishery signifies that its operation is
environmentally friendly, that it is not taking more fish than can
be replenished naturally or not killing other species through
harmful fishing practices. A certified fishery can earn a ``Forever
Fish'' logo on its products, telling customers that the fish has
been taken in an environmentally sound way.
</P>
<P>
   One certification group being supported by the Packard
Foundation is the Marine Stewardship Council, a London-based
nonprofit organization set up in 1996 by World Wildlife Fund and
Unilever, a major food supplier in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago, the council opened its first U.S. office in
Seattle. At a seafood show in Boston last week, the council
certified its first two fish _ the Western Australian rock lobster
and the Thames River herring _ because the industry that brings
them to the market has sound fishing operations. They now bear a
``Forever Fish'' logo.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Alaska Fish and Game Department requested a
``Forever Fish'' certification from the council, which is
evaluating the state's five runs of salmon: Chinook, coho, sockeye,
pink and chum.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the California fishing industry is talking to
the Sierra Club and other environmental organizations about
starting labeling that would appear on packages denoting which fish
are in season, which are particularly healthful and which come from
sustainable fisheries, said Zeke Grader, executive director of the
Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Association.
</P>
<P>
   Grader consulted with the Monterey Bay Aquarium on its guidebook
list, which was revised in February based on comments from
fishermen in his group.
</P>
<P>
   One fish that didn't make it on the ``best choice'' list but
should have was the sardine, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one fish we should be promoting because it's being
managed on a sustainable basis,'' Grader said. ``It's taken us 50
years to rebuild the stocks, and I think we've learned from our
mistakes of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Other populations of fish that aren't doing as well are rockfish
and groundfish, including lingcod, pacific red snapper, sablefish
and butterfish. But new regulations put in place recently by the
Pacific Fishery Management Council, a regional regulatory agency,
should improve the situation.
</P>
<P>
   In Islip, N.Y., Carl Safina, Audubon's vice president for marine
conservation, said it was worth saving the endangered species of
fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have those fish to eat in the future, and the
quality of peoples' lives depends on these things we like so much
maintaining a presence in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of power to protect sea life lies with consumers and
restaurateurs, he said. The Audubon Living Oceans program next
month will publish a 120-page full-color ``Seafood Lover's
Almanac.''

&HT;     FOR MANY SOUTH ASIAN IMMIGRANTS, PARENTS STILL PLAY THE DATING
GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JULIE CHAO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Cultural rifts that divide generations have
been part and parcel of the American immigrant experience. The
Indians from South Asia _ 1.2 million strong in the United States _
are no exception.
</P>
<P>
   For many other second-generation Indian women in the United
States, issues of dating and marriage will plague them until they
walk down the aisle (or around the fire, if they choose a
traditional Hindu ceremony).
</P>
<P>
   ``For a girl to grow up and have a successful marriage and
children is fulfilling some part of her duty,'' said Ketu H.
Katrak, director of Asian-American Studies at the University of
California at Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   In India, marriage is traditionally more a union based on social
and economic interests rather than romantic love between
individuals, a decidedly more Western notion. While some immigrants
from India do allow their daughters to love American style, others
insist they maintain as many Old World customs and beliefs as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents become even more traditional after arriving in the
United States because they fear their children will get too
``Americanized,'' said Katrak, who left India in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, the kind of patriarchal control that exists within the
Indian context certainly continues within the diaspora and often
gets more pronounced,'' she said. Some parents believe that ``if
you don't assert those cultural values, you might lose that
culture, or lose your children to Americanization, quote unquote.''
</P>
<P>
   Bina, a vivacious, attractive doctoral student in Palo Alto, is
33 and under intense parental pressure to find a husband. Not just
any husband will do. He must be Indian, and he must be Hindu.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're extremely worried,'' said Bina, who preferred not to
give her last name. ``It's a daily talk: `You're getting older. You
need to start thinking about marriage. If you don't start now, you
won't find any Indian boys.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents and friends are forever introducing her to potential
mates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a job search,'' she said. ``It's much more
systematic as I get older because I don't have as much time.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to generalize about the Indian subcontinent, an
immensely diverse region, with several major religions, dozens of
languages and subcultures, and vast class divisions. And, to be
sure, cultural and generational conflicts abound in every immigrant
family.
</P>
<P>
   But for Indian daughters, the question of when they marry is one
they will all have to answer. The pressure comes in numerous forms,
from an occasional inquiry, to a ``daily talk,'' as with Bina's
parents, to set-ups, to matrimonial ads placed in Indian newspapers
or on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   How daughters deal with parents' concerns is just as varied. The
dozen or so women interviewed for this article, many of whom would
give only their first name for fear of embarrassing their families
with details of their personal lives, rejected or subscribed to
their parents' beliefs to differing degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Some try to do what their parents want. Some date on the sly.
Some try to urge their parents to accept new ways. Some refuse to
do set-ups, while others reluctantly agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a huge sense of responsibility for making my family
happy,'' Bina said. ``I think Indian women get the party line told
to them, which is, `We've done so much for you to make you happy,
this is the least you can do to make us happy.' I think that level
of guilt is something I haven't been able to work through.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonima Khan, a sophomore at the University of California at
Berkeley, said her parents, who are Muslims from Bangladesh, had
forbidden her to date but expected her to marry when she was 24 or
25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel like, why are they even sending me to school
if they're just going to marry me off?'' she said. ``I feel like my
whole life has been a scam. They've raised me to be this perfect
eligible bachelorette.''
</P>
<P>
   Khan, 19, said she wanted to travel, establish her career and
become financially independent after graduating, but would probably
marry by the time she was 25 ``because anytime after that, my mom
would seriously go into depression.''
</P>
<P>
   Khan, who left Bangladesh _ formerly a province of Pakistan _
when she was 2, would prefer a South Asian spouse for cultural
reasons, but her parents insist that he be Muslim as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy is, we're all pretty much the same _ Pakistan,
India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka,'' she said. ``I don't see why we
should all divide. Our culture and beliefs are a lot alike. I don't
differentiate between Bengalis and Hindus and stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents place more emphasis on character than ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (my two children) a long time ago, they can marry
anybody they want to, but a nice person,'' said Aruna Reddi of
Fremont, whose son, 31, and daughter, 24, are both single. ``I just
want them to get married.''

</P>
<P>
   For some parents from India or its South Asian nations, playing
matchmaker for their children _ as well as those of friends,
relatives and neighbors _ is viewed as a pleasure if not a duty.
But unlike traditional arranged marriages where the whole family
meets the other family, arranged dates these days are usually
little more than a phone number or e-mail address passed on to the
daughter to use if she chooses.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude has definitely changed,'' said Jasmin Patel, a
30-year-old legal research and writing instructor at the University
of California at Berkeley law school. ``In high school or college,
my parents setting me up with someone? No way.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Patel said, she'll meet the guy ``as long as we're clear
with expectations. ... If we don't get along, I'm not obligated to
see him again.''

   His lunch customers would be happy with a bag of chips and a
slice of pizza. But, he wants them to have the pasta e fagioli soup
and fettucini in tomato-alfredo sauce.
</P>
<P>
   They might be fine with chicken patties and tater tots. But, he
feels better if they have sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, and
garlic and chili green beans.
</P>
<P>
   They are students.
</P>
<P>
   He is Garth Petracca, food service director.
</P>
<P>
   Everyday he heads into a school cafeteria kitchen to wage a
culinary war to conquer young stomachs - and he's winning, it
seems.
</P>
<P>
   The April issue of Restaurant Hospitality magazine recently
recognized Petracca's efforts at Bristol-Plymouth (Mass.) Regional
Technical High School with the Best Kids Menu in America award.
Petracca was chosen from among 200 applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Now designing menus for the Duxbury, Mass. school system, he won
for his five-week rotating menus featuring theme days and ethnic
dishes like Honduran tomato soup, soy and ginger cabbage, broccoli
fra diavolo and Teriyaki chicken stir-fry.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity and the concepts made Petracca the winner, said
Katie Smith, who helped coordinate the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The trick to good menus is to treat students like real diners,
says Petracca. ``I really don't think of it as food service,'' said
34-year-old Mashpee, Mass. resident. ``I think of it as my little
restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Petracca's passion for preparing meals has paid off. One of the
most unusual items he got students to eat was hot and sour soup.
``Once they tried it, they got a big kick out of it because it was
unlike anything they had eaten.''
</P>
<P>
   But Petracca knows the battle to win students' tastebuds isn't
over: he left out the tofu in the hot and sour soup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my limits.''

 By FRANK RICH  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In the old rehearsal snapshots from 1957, three of the four men
who created ``West Side Story'' look as cool as the Jets and
Sharks.
 &HT;    The choreographer Jerome Robbins, the playwright Arthur Laurents
and the composer Leonard Bernstein are all dressed in '50s hip.
Only the true kid of the group, the 27-year-old lyricist making his
Broadway debut, seems out of place.
 &HT;    Stephen Sondheim is in a tie and a loud, boxy sports jacket, his
hair slicked back, his grin forced _ a geek trying to cut it with
the popular crowd.
 &HT;    Yet the appearance is deceiving. Perhaps even more than his
collaborators, he was a rebel advancing a cause: a new, jarring,
adult kind of Broadway musical.
 &HT;    Like most Sondheim efforts to come _ among them the landmark
shows ``Company,'' ``Follies,'' ``Sweeney Todd'' and ``Sunday in
the Park With George'' _ ``West Side Story'' wasn't the smash
commercial hit of its season. It lost the Tony Award to ``The Music
Man.''
 &HT;    But it also upended the genteel conventions of an American art
form then exemplified by ``My Fair Lady.'' The future's
possibilities seemed boundless, for both the musical theater and
the four young artists retooling it.
 &HT;    Now that future has come _ and gone. Bernstein and Robbins are
dead, having deserted Broadway long before their passing. Laurents
is still a busy playwright at 82, but musicals aren't high on his
agenda. That leaves Sondheim, who turns 70 on March 22.
 &HT;    So obscure in 1957 that he wasn't even mentioned in The New York
Times review of ``West Side Story,'' he is now the greatest and
perhaps best-known artist in the American musical theater.
 &HT;    But that is a somewhat empty distinction. Sondheim may be the
last major creator of Broadway musicals, period, still actively
devoted to the trade. He may have even outlived the genre itself,
which was long ago exiled by rock music from center stage to niche
status in American culture and is now barely a going concern.
 &HT;    Sondheim doesn't dispute that he is a dinosaur. ``It's
discouraging,'' he says, as he lists his vanished contemporaries
and concludes that ``only John and Freddie'' _ Kander and Ebb, the
songwriters of ``Cabaret'' and ``Chicago'' _ remain as active in
musical theater as he is.
 &HT;    Nor is the Broadway of 2000 the one of his youthful dreams. For
nearly two decades, the Winter Garden, where ``West Side Story''
jump-started his career, has been monopolized by ``Cats.''
 &HT;    ``You have two kinds of shows on Broadway _ revivals and the
same kind of musicals over and over again, all spectacles,''
Sondheim says. ``You get your tickets for 'The Lion King' a year in
advance, and essentially a family comes as if to a picnic, and they
pass on to their children the idea that that's what the theater is
_ a spectacular musical you see once a year, a stage version of a
movie. It has nothing to do with theater at all. It has to do with
seeing what is familiar. We live in a recycled culture.''
 &HT;    Using his imminent birthday as an excuse, Sondheim and I are
meeting for a series of conversations to take stock of his life,
his career, the theater. We convene in the Turtle Bay area
townhouse he has lived in since 1960 but which he spent two years
rebuilding after a devastating 1995 fire.
 &HT;    Sondheim's arm was in a sling after a fall in London, and as he
puts it: ``I'm not particularly upbeat these days. The last year
has not been good.''
 &HT;    A revue of his songs, ``Putting It Together,'' was closing after
only three months on Broadway. The recent off-Broadway workshop of
his new musical, ``Wise Guys,'' a project that he feels has
consumed too much of the past decade, went awry and was, he says,
``a waste of time.''
 &HT;    I first met Sondheim just as his reputation was starting to
skyrocket _ when he was 41 and I was 21 _ after he wrote me a
letter about my college newspaper review of the Boston tryout of
``Follies.'' He was the first professional writer to give me the
courage to believe I might be one too.
 &HT;    Long before that, he played a role in shaping my lifelong
passion for theater, for ``Gypsy'' and ``A Funny Thing Happened on
the Way to the Forum'' were formative events in my theatergoing
childhood.
 &HT;    ``If Mama Was Married,'' a song from ``Gypsy,'' was the first
song I'd ever heard about being a child of divorce, which I had
recently become, and it pointed me toward Sondheim before I knew
his name.
 &HT;    Our initial real-life encounter led to a spotty acquaintanceship
that was over well before my 14 seasons of reviewing theater for
The New York Times, during which I had no contact with him at all.
 &HT;    In those years, ending in 1993, my adoration of ``Sunday in the
Park'' was offset by my unenthusiastic reviews of Sondheim's
saddest Broadway failure, ``Merrily We Roll Along,'' and one of his
rare crowd-pleasers, ``Into the Woods.''
 &HT;    When a book of my criticism was published after we had
re-established contact, he told me, ``I'd forgotten how rough you'd
been about my shows.'' But he didn't seem cross about it. By this
point, we shared too much else, including our alarm that Broadway
was turning into a theme park.
 &HT;    Sondheim thinks I was right to end my full-time engagement with
the theater just before the Disney deluge, yet he hasn't moved on
and never would.
 &HT;    The man who wrote ``I'm Still Here'' may despair over Broadway,
but it would never occur to him to leave it. Though he has outlived
not only the traditional Broadway of his childhood but also the
new, more urbane Broadway he ushered in for my generation, his tone
is more regretful than angry. The only time he cut me off was when
I began a question with the phrase, ``When you grew up ...''
 &HT;    ``I never grew up,'' he interjected, with a finality that
foreclosed any follow-up. This may explain how Sondheim has
remained an artist and why, for all his sophistication, he can seem
guileless, even naive.
 &HT;    Over tea, dinner, nightcaps, he was willing to answer any
question, whether speaking unsentimentally of the ``very
unpleasant, paranoid, suspicious'' Robbins (``I can't even say that
I miss Jerry _ I miss Jerry's impact on shows'') _ or of other
Broadway songwriters or his often-solitary personal life. He rarely
went off the record.
 &HT;    At the time of our meetings, he was also, despite his recent
setbacks, surprisingly sunny (for him) about the future. And though
he doesn't think 70 is a big deal _ ``I don't want to spend the
next six months being iconized'' _ some special events this spring
tickle him.
 &HT;    In May, the New York Philharmonic will stage a three-nights-only
concert performance of ``Sweeney Todd'' starring Bryn Terfel and
Patti LuPone.
 &HT;    The Museum of Television and Radio is saluting Sondheim for
three months on both coasts, even unearthing kinescopes of TV
scripts he wrote in the '50s.
 &HT;    In Washington, a Library of Congress concert will include his
1974 adaptation of Aristophanes' ``Frogs'' as well as non-Sondheim
material _ songs culled from a cheeky, revelatory list Sondheim
drew up with the title ``Songs I Wish I'd Written (At Least in
Part).''
 &HT;    Sondheim has also taken heart from the New York premiere, at
off-Broadway's Second Stage, of his novice professional effort,
``Saturday Night,'' written before ``West Side Story'' and
abandoned when its producer died. The show had been consigned to a
trunk for nearly half a century.
 &HT;    For those of us who don't find Sondheim's songs pretentious and
unfeeling, the lyric at the top of ``Saturday Night,'' sung by
lonely young men in Brooklyn desperate for romance _ ``so what can
you do on a Saturday night, alone?'' _ encapsulates the deeply felt
Sondheim signature emotion: the aching, ambivalent and often
thwarted desire to connect with someone.
 &HT;    It's the naked yearning that also runs through ``With So Little
to Be Sure Of,'' ``Too Many Mornings,'' ``Being Alive,'' ``Pretty
Women,'' ``Not a Day Goes By,'' ``Finishing the Hat.''
 &HT;    Sondheim talks about the days when, with Hal Prince, who in 1957
would be a producer of ``West Side Story,'' it was possible to ``go
down the street and see somebody else's show and know that we were
all talking the same language.''
 &HT;    Rock 'n' roll was exploding then, but Sondheim says: ``Rock
didn't affect me because the overlap was when shows were still
popular so I could afford to ignore it. It was not part of my
generation; it was the generation 10 years under me.
 &HT;    ``To be 24 in 1954 as opposed to being in your teens is all the
difference. I knew where I was and what I wanted to do. And through
the '50s and '60s, the kind of shows I liked were still viable:
those that developed stories through song in which the songs had
individual voices. There was enough success going around, and so
you were encouraged to do more.''
 &HT;    By the '80s, however, Sondheim could no longer ignore the
reality that rock, rising costs and what he sees as ``dumbing
down'' were endangering his Broadway.
 &HT;    ``The source of what was popular in music had shifted from
movies and shows to records,'' and even the number of musicians in
Broadway pit bands had been downsized by half.
 &HT;    ``What's happened to the theater,'' he says, ``is one thing that
does depress me a lot because it is such a large part of my life.
You'd go and see other shows that would stimulate you, that would
make you want to write. Now it makes you not want to write because
you think the audience isn't there anymore. The audience that is
there is not an audience who would either like or respond to the
kind of stuff I write except with, if anything, kind of detached
bemusement instead of getting involved.''
 &HT;    The Broadway community has fled too. ``There's none whatsoever.
The writers write one show every two or three years. Who
congregates at Sardi's? What is there to congregate about? Shows
just sit in theaters and last.''
 &HT;    We commiserated about the latest Broadway calamity _ the
eviction of the nonmusical play. The theater district used to be
ablaze with musicals, dramas, star vehicles and fluffy comedies all
side by side. At one point this season, there wasn't a single
recently written comedy or drama running on Broadway _ a grim
historic first.
 &HT;    ``When was the last time you saw a straight play when you
couldn't wait to get on the phone and tell your friends?'' Sondheim
asks rhetorically _ then gives an excited answer to his own
question, sounding like a boy still infatuated with the theater
after all: ``'How I Learned to Drive.' I saw it with Arthur
Laurents. I loved it! We danced out of there. I got on the phone _
we couldn't wait to see something else on the stage _ anything!''
 &HT;    But ``How I Learned to Drive'' was produced off-Broadway, not
on, and three years ago.
 &HT;    Not that Sondheim is romantic about Broadway's past. He sees it
too lucidly. As for his own music, Sondheim says: ``I'm accused so
often of not having melodic gifts, but I like the music I write.
Harmony gives music its life, its emotional color, more than
rhythm.''
 &HT;    Among the composers Sondheim most admires is, fittingly, George
Gershwin, who also spanned the gamut from Tin Pan Alley to
``serious'' musical theater.
 &HT;    Sondheim thinks ``stars are great'' for the theater, but doesn't
believe the theater has any stars now except itinerant visitors
from movies and TV.
 &HT;    Bernadette Peters comes closest, he says, but when ``she does a
show that's a hit like 'Annie Get Your Gun,' she has to stay with
it for two years. In the old days, Bernadette would have done at
least as many shows as Merman, a couple of dozen. She's done maybe
10 shows.''
 &HT;    Sondheim's own favorite star performances in musicals, his or
others? Among male performances, he unequivocally cites two: Alfred
Drake in ``Kismet'' and John McMartin in ``Follies.'' The list of
women is longer, including Peters in ``Sunday in the Park,'' Angela
Lansbury in ``Sweeney Todd'' and ``obviously, Ethel (Merman) was
thrilling in 'Gypsy.'''
 &HT;    He misses much of old New York, including the local steak house,
Christo's, where he wrote some of ``A Little Night Music'' in a
booth. Nor is he enamored of the malled Times Square.
 &HT;    ``I'm nostalgic for the things that aren't there anymore,'' he
says. ``I want things to be the way they were because that staves
off mortality. So I feel threatened by change.''
 &HT;    Sondheim has mentored many young songwriters, including Adam
Guettel, whom he finds ``dazzling,'' and the late Jonathan Larson,
of ``Rent'': ``Jonathan was on the path of making that bridge
between the bus-and-tunnel audience and the young audience. But
nobody else does that because other writers into pop don't have
Jonathan's interest in the tradition of musical theater.''
 &HT;    Still, Sondheim is surprised by the steady contacts from young
writers who want to emulate him. But he dispenses realistic advice.
 &HT;    ``I say write it and put it on any place you can. I warn them
Broadway is no longer an outlet for new work. I'm lucky I get my
shows on.''
 &HT;    Indeed the vulnerable quality that makes Sondheim's songs so
haunting _ those aesthetic stutters that illuminate the cracks in
people's lives _ is to me always visible in the man.
 &HT;    Sondheim is well defended with intellectual armor, yet he is
still the precocious, awkward kid in the rehearsal photos of ``West
Side Story,'' ``the boy in the bubble,'' as he described himself to
his biographer, Meryle Secrest.
 &HT;    I'm eager to give Sondheim the reassurance he once gave me, and
start to say that since he has always defied the crowd, he might
endure even if Broadway does not.
 &HT;    But Sondheim deflects this emotional plea on his behalf as soon
as he detects it.
 &HT;    ``I've never been popular,'' he reiterates quickly, as if to
say, What's the use of wondering if there's any other way his story
could have turned out.

 By FRANK RICH  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In the old rehearsal snapshots from 1957, three of the four men
who created ``West Side Story'' look as cool as the Jets and
Sharks.
 &HT;    The choreographer Jerome Robbins, the playwright Arthur Laurents
and the composer Leonard Bernstein are all dressed in '50s hip.
Only the true kid of the group, the 27-year-old lyricist making his
Broadway debut, seems out of place.
 &HT;    Stephen Sondheim is in a tie and a loud, boxy sports jacket, his
hair slicked back, his grin forced _ a geek trying to cut it with
the popular crowd.
 &HT;    Yet the appearance is deceiving. Perhaps even more than his
collaborators, he was a rebel advancing a cause: a new, jarring,
adult kind of Broadway musical.
 &HT;    Like most Sondheim efforts to come _ among them the landmark
shows ``Company,'' ``Follies,'' ``Sweeney Todd'' and ``Sunday in
the Park With George'' _ ``West Side Story'' wasn't the smash
commercial hit of its season. It lost the Tony Award to ``The Music
Man.''
 &HT;    But it also upended the genteel conventions of an American art
form then exemplified by ``My Fair Lady.'' The future's
possibilities seemed boundless, for both the musical theater and
the four young artists retooling it.
 &HT;    Now that future has come _ and gone. Bernstein and Robbins are
dead, having deserted Broadway long before their passing. Laurents
is still a busy playwright at 82, but musicals aren't high on his
agenda. That leaves Sondheim, who turns 70 on March 22.
 &HT;    So obscure in 1957 that he wasn't even mentioned in The New York
Times review of ``West Side Story,'' he is now the greatest and
perhaps best-known artist in the American musical theater.
 &HT;    But that is a somewhat empty distinction. Sondheim may be the
last major creator of Broadway musicals, period, still actively
devoted to the trade. He may have even outlived the genre itself,
which was long ago exiled by rock music from center stage to niche
status in American culture and is now barely a going concern.
 &HT;    Sondheim doesn't dispute that he is a dinosaur. ``It's
discouraging,'' he says, as he lists his vanished contemporaries
and concludes that ``only John and Freddie'' _ Kander and Ebb, the
songwriters of ``Cabaret'' and ``Chicago'' _ remain as active in
musical theater as he is.
 &HT;    Nor is the Broadway of 2000 the one of his youthful dreams. For
nearly two decades, the Winter Garden, where ``West Side Story''
jump-started his career, has been monopolized by ``Cats.''
 &HT;    ``You have two kinds of shows on Broadway _ revivals and the
same kind of musicals over and over again, all spectacles,''
Sondheim says. ``You get your tickets for 'The Lion King' a year in
advance, and essentially a family comes as if to a picnic, and they
pass on to their children the idea that that's what the theater is
_ a spectacular musical you see once a year, a stage version of a
movie. It has nothing to do with theater at all. It has to do with
seeing what is familiar. We live in a recycled culture.''
 &HT;    Using his imminent birthday as an excuse, Sondheim and I are

townhouse he has lived in since 1960 but which he spent two years

 &HT;    Dandy weed wields incredible nutritional power
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you had to spend some time on a desert island and could
choose just one plant to sustain you, which would you choose?
Spinach, cabbage, turnips, beans and corn probably come to mind.
But would you think of dandelions? Probably not. In most Americans'
minds, dandelions are pesky, unsightly, lawn-destroying weeds that
we pull or poison at every opportunity. You should know, however,
that nutritionally, the humble dandelion is nothing short of
amazing. Scientific studies in Europe and the United States,
including one from the University of California, suggest that
dandelions are one of the most, if not the most, nutritionally
potent plants nature has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Take beta carotene, the substance the body converts into vitamin
A and that's generally thought to lower the risk of cancer and
heart disease: Carrots are considered to be loaded with beta
carotene, with 6.1 milligrams per 10 grams. Dandelions contain 8.4
milligrams for the same amount, according to USDA figures.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do dandelions contain more beta carotene than carrots,
but they have more potassium than bananas, more lecithin than
soybeans and more iron than spinach. In addition, they are
particularly rich in fiber, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, the B
vitamins thiamin and riboflavin and a veritable alphabet of other
vitamins and minerals. They also are rich in rare micronutrients
such as copper, cobalt, zinc and boron.
</P>
<P>
   So why do Americans, who are seemingly so diet- and
health-conscious, do all they can to eradicate dandelions every
chance they get?
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gail, a botanist and author who has spent the past 37
years studying how various cultures use weeds as food and medicine
and a major figure in the dandelion underground, says it's a
generational thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dandelions were a staple up to and throughout the Depression
and World War II. They were not only used for food but for medicine
and in some cases kept people alive. Then came the GI Bill,
suburbs, lawns, pesticides and supermarkets that stocked iceberg
lettuce and it was goodbye dandelions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Europeans are a lot more appreciative of
dandelions, regarding them highly on their tables and in their
medicine cabinets. For centuries dandelions have been used as a
restorative for the entire system, especially for the blood, liver,
stomach, spleen and pancreas.
</P>
<P>
   If you are craving a true spring tonic and a time-honored way to
capture a surge of spring energy, you need only go as far as the
nearest dandelion patch. To reacquaint yourself with the remarkable
dandelion, here are some tips about gathering them, some
informative Web sites and recipes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  TIPS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gather dandelion leaves when they are young, before flowers
appear. After they finish flowering, cut them back to the top of
the roots and continue to harvest the young greens as they keep
coming back until November.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pick plants growing in the shade. They will be bigger and less
bitter than those growing in full sun. If you want to add
dandelions to your garden, plant them under pole beans, tomatoes or
other tall crops.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dandelion roots are efficient but nondiscriminating miners of
all the minerals in soil. They will take up lead, mercury and
pesticides along with the good stuff. As far as auto pollutants,
studies have shown that it is safe to collect dandelions 75 feet or
more from the roadside. Also look for those growing behind a
structure, like a house or barn, that protects them from airborne
pollution. And certainly avoid picking any that are on chemically
treated lawns, parks or fields.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  You may have sampled dandelions way back when, recoiled at the
bitter taste and never tried them again. Yes, mature dandelion
greens eaten straight up can be bitter, but not any more so than
some other greens eaten that way. There are growing and harvesting
techniques and imaginative recipes that will reduce the bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't forget, you can enhance the nutritional value of soups,
stews, salads and just about any dish by adding a few dandelion
greens. Dressing them with a simple raspberry vinaigrette works
nicely, too.
</P>

 CHATEAUNEUF DE GRASSE, FRANCE: ... new ones.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Alex jumped on a plane in California in 1979 to come here
for Beck's classes, it was on a whim. Beck undoubtedly took to
Alex. In the photographs that rest on tables at La Pitchoune, the
resemblance between the regal, blond, bespectacled Beck and the
young, blond, bespectacled Alex are striking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simca was my first mentor,'' she says. Alex returned in 1981.
``I'd gone back home to study French.'' In 1983, Beck arranged an
expensive weeklong ``stagiaire'' (apprenticeship) at Mougins for
Alex. ``You had to pay almost $1,000, but Simca got the week for
free,'' says Alex.
</P>
<P>
   After seven days, Verge asked Alex if she wanted to stay on for
three months. She mulled it over. Things at home weren't great, and
her only son was grown. When she got right down to it, there was no
reason not to stay. Then Simca, to whom she went for advice,
weighed in. `` `Do you think it's going to change anything if you
go home now?' '' Simca asked.
</P>
<P>
   So she joined Verge's staff. ``It changed my life.'' There were
no women in the kitchen, and the young men _ many of whom had been
cooking since they were teenagers _ had much more energy than she
did. ``I worked just like anyone else, which means a double
shift.'' In France, most of the top restaurants serve both lunch
and dinner. All employees are expected to work both meals.
Afternoons, while Alex napped on the Riviera, the rest of the
kitchen went outside for an impromptu game of soccer (what the
French call ``football'').
</P>
<P>
   ``It was grueling,'' says Alex. ``I weighed the least I had
weighed since I was 16. It melts off you.''
</P>
<P>
   After her apprenticeship, Verge wanted her to open a cooking
school in San Francisco. ``I was an accountant,'' says Alex. ``He
thought I would certainly have lots of money.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't, but Verge opened other doors. Alex returned to
California and became a regular assistant to other top chefs who
taught at Mondavi Winery's ``Great Chefs of France'' cooking
program.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 years ago, she moved back to France to live in Antibes;
she cooked on yachts and in private villas, and assisted Beck. Then
the opportunity came to move to La Pitchoune.
</P>
<P>
   Alex is at home now, very friendly with several top chefs and
their wives. She seems to know everyone. At the local pizza house,
she greets the proprietor, then goes over to say hello to the cook
before sitting down. She points out four people in the middle of
the restaurant. ``Chefs on their night off,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   They start laughing. At first it's just the loud, throaty laughs
of heavy smokers, and then they get going and they can't stop.
They're howling with laughter, and it just keeps erupting every
time it seems to be dying out. The whole restaurant joins in, not
really knowing what was funny in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Alex starts laughing too. She's enjoying the spectacle. When the
place finally settles down, she sits back in her chair, slightly
flushed. The table is littered with an empty pitcher of red wine
she and her guests have polished off, remnants of several small,
smoky, wood-baked pizzas, and Provencal salads. She looks enviably
relaxed and happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``How wonderful life turns out,'' she says, ``when you least
expect it.''

OEUFS A LA PIPERADE
</P>
<P>
   (Eggs with red peppers and tomatoes)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 pound red peppers, roasted, peeled, seeded, and chopped
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   8 extra-large eggs
</P>
<P>
   Fresh basil leaves, chopped (for garnish)
</P>
<P>
   In a large nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat, heat the
olive oil. Add the onion and saute it until limp. Add the garlic
and continue cooking until the onion is a light golden color. Add
the tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer
for 20 minutes or until tomatoes are softened. Add the peppers and
continue cooking for 10 minutes or until all the liquid has
evaporated from the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the mixture from the pan and wipe out the pan. Melt 2
tablespoons of the butter and, before it browns, add the eggs. Cook
them over low heat, stirring with a spoon. After 1 minute, add 1/4
cup of the pepper-tomato mixture. Continue stirring 1 minute more.
Add the remaining 3 tablespoons butter and cook until the eggs are
scrambled but soft. (Save the remaining tomato mixture to use as a
sauce for pasta.) Sprinkle with basil and serve at once. Serves 4.

CROSTINI DE PAIN PERDU AVEC FRUITS DE SAISON
</P>
<P>
   (Crusty brioche with sauteed fruits)
</P>
<P>
   This is a typical cooking-class recipe. The brioche is made into
what we call French toast, known in France as ``pain perdu''
(``lost bread,'' because the bread, generally stale, is useless for
anything else).
</P>
<P>
   For the fruits:
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup currants
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dark rum
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   4 Golden Delicious apples, peeled, cored, and quartered
</P>
<P>
   2 Bartlett pears, peeled, quartered, and cored
</P>
<P>
   1 cup strawberries, halved
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 orange
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   For the bread:
</P>
<P>
   4 extra-large eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 extra-large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 vanilla bean, split
</P>
<P>
   2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   8 3/4-inch slices of brioche or other egg bread, such as challah
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 stick unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 pint vanilla ice cream, or 1/2 pint heavy cream, whipped
(optional)
</P>
<P>
   For the fruits: In a bowl, soak the currants in the rum for 10
minutes. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the 4
tablespoons of butter, stir in the 1/2 cup sugar, and cook,
stirring, until the sugar dissolves. Add the apples and pears and
cook them for 15 minutes or until they are soft and golden. Stir in
the currants with the rum, the strawberries, and the orange and
lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   Simmer until the liquid reduces by half. Remove the pan from the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   For the bread: In a bowl, beat together the eggs, extra yolks,
and 1 1/2 cups sugar. With a sharp knife, scrape the vanilla seeds
from the bean into the bowl. Add the milk and stir until blended.
Soak each slice of bread for 2 minutes in the egg mixture, then
remove with a slotted spatula and place on a rimmed baking sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Using a strainer, sift some of the confectioners' sugar over
each slice to cover them evenly.
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter over medium
heat. Add enough brioche slices, sugared side down, to fill the
pan. Cook them until browned on the bottom. Sift more
confectioners' sugar over the tops, turn, and brown the other side.
Add more butter to the pan if necessary. Remove the slices from the
pan and transfer to a baking sheet. Keep them warm in a low oven.
Repeat with more butter and the remaining slices.
</P>
<P>
   To serve: Cut the toast in triangular pieces. Place them on
heated plates and spoon over the warm fruit. Add vanilla ice cream
or whipped cream if you like. Serve at once. Serves 8.

 &HT;    Potpie perfection? Got it covered
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Diane Phillips tested dozens of recipes over a year's time for
her cookbook ``Pot Pies: Comfort Food Under Cover, '' (Doubleday,
$24.95). In that same year, her husband gained 20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry. You won't gain that much, because you probably
won't try 85 different kinds of potpie. But from the recipes below,
we hope you'll add one or two to your dinner rotation.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't made a potpie in a while _ or ever _ start with
the chicken potpie. Don't let the length of the recipe scare you.
It has the kind of details a novice will appreciate, but they are
guidance, not dire warnings.
</P>
<P>
   And if you try these recipes but are just not happy because you
are a double-crust person, then check out the directions for double
crusts on the flaky pie dough recipe. You can even have a pastry
crust on the bottom and one of the more innovative crusts on the
top.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Simple Chicken Potpie
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 45-55 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   We found this classic, well-tested recipe in a 1996 Cook's
Illustrated. You can make the filling ahead of time and chill it
overnight, then reheat before topping with the crust and baking.
</P>
<P>
   1 recipe Rich Flaky Pie Dough (see below)
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts and/or thighs
</P>
<P>
   2 cups homemade chicken broth or 1 (15-ounce) can low-sodium
chicken broth with water added to equal 2 cups
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium-large onion, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 medium carrots, peeled and cut crosswise 1/4 inch thick
</P>
<P>
   2 small celery ribs, cut crosswise 1/4 inch thick
</P>
<P>
   Salt and ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup ( 1/2 stick) butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons dry sherry
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup frozen green peas, thawed
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves
</P>
<P>
   Make pie dough (directions below) and refrigerate until ready to
use. Adjust oven rack to low-center position; preheat oven to 400
degrees. Put chicken and broth in small Dutch oven or soup kettle
over medium heat. Cover and bring to a simmer; simmer until chicken
is just done, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer meat to large bowl,
reserving broth in measuring cup.
</P>
<P>
   Increase heat to medium-high; heat oil in the empty pan. Add
onion, carrots and celery; saute until just tender, about 5
minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. While vegetables are
cooking, shred meat into bite-size pieces. Transfer cooked
vegetables to bowl with chicken; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Heat butter over medium-high heat in the empty pan. When foaming
subsides, add flour; cook about 1 minute. Whisk in chicken broth,
milk, any accumulated chicken juices and thyme. Bring to simmer,
then continue to simmer until sauce fully thickens, about 1 minute.
Season to taste with salt and pepper; stir in sherry.
</P>
<P>
   Pour sauce over chicken mixture; stir to combine. Stir in peas
and parsley. Adjust seasonings. (Can be covered and refrigerated
overnight; reheat before topping with pastry.) Pour mixture into
13-by-9-inch pan or any shallow baking dish of similar size. Top
with pie crust (follow directions in pie crust recipe below); bake
until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly, about 30
minutes. Serve hot.

   Rich Flaky Pie Dough
</P>
<P>
   Makes one 9-by-13-inch crust
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Chilling time: 30 minutes or more
</P>
<P>
   The crust is the key to a good potpie, and this one can work
well on any recipe. If you like a double crust, then double the
recipe, halve and make two crusts. For the bottom crust, press the
dough into the bottom of a pan and pre-bake for at least 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, chilled and cut into 1/4-inch
pieces
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons chilled all-vegetable shortening
</P>
<P>
   Ice water
</P>
<P>
   Mix flour and salt in workbowl of food processor fitted with the
steel blade. Scatter butter pieces over the flour mixture, tossing
to coat butter with a little of the flour. Cut butter into flour
with five one-second pulses. Add shortening; continue cutting in
until flour is pale yellow and resembles coarse cornmeal, keeping
some butter bits the size of small peas, about four more one-second
pulses. Turn mixture into medium bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle 3 tablespoons ice-cold water over the mixture. Using
rubber spatula, fold water into flour mixture. Then press down on
dough mixture with broad side of spatula until dough sticks
together, adding up to 1 tablespoon more cold water if dough will
not come together. Shape dough into ball, then shape into a
rectangle and flatten to about 3/4 inch thick. Wrap in plastic and
refrigerate 30 minutes while preparing pie filling.
</P>
<P>
   Roll dough on floured surface to approximate 15-by-11-inch
rectangle, about 1/8 inch thick. Lay dough over potpie filling.
Tuck edges down into the pan side. Cut at least four 1-inch vent
holes. Proceed with potpie recipe.

   Rich and satisfying, this recipe drew raves from tasters. It
also makes a pretty presentation. It's easy to prepare, and the
stew can be refrigerated overnight.
</P>
<P>
   For the beef stew:
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch chunks
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, mashed
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 cups beef broth
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons chopped fresh sage, or 1 teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
   3 carrots, cut into 1-inch chunks
</P>
<P>
   2 cups 1-inch potato cubes
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fresh, or frozen and defrosted, corn kernels
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fresh, or frozen and defrosted, petite peas
</P>
<P>
   For the Sage Parmesan Biscuits:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups Bisquick
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried sage
</P>
<P>
   For the stew: Sprinkle beef with salt, pepper and garlic. In a
3-quart ovenproof casserole or Dutch oven, heat the oil. Add meat,
browning it on all sides for 6 to 8 minutes. When the meat is
browned, add broth, stirring to scrape up any bits that have stuck
to the bottom of the pan. Add sage, carrots and potato cubes. Cover
and simmer 35 minutes. Add corn and peas and continue to cook for
another 10 to 15 minutes. The sauce will appear thin, but it will
thicken when the biscuits bake. (The stew can be refrigerated at
this point for 2 to 3 days, or frozen for up to 2 months. Allow to
come to room temperature before baking.)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   For the biscuits: In a large mixing bowl, combine Bisquick and
Parmesan cheese. Add milk and sage, stirring with a fork to
combine. Turn the dough out onto a floured board and knead 5 times.
Roll the dough out to 1/2 inch thickness, cut out individual
biscuits with a 2-inch cutter and place on top of stew. Or transfer
the entire crust to the top of the stew, cutting it to fit. Bake
the stew in the preheated oven for 17 to 20 minutes, or until the
biscuits are browned and the stew is bubbling. _ From: ``Pot Pies:

   Because the crusts are baked separately, this is really a faux
potpie. But the end result is the same _ delicious. While the sauce
is stewing, bake the pastry tops. If you want to make this richer,
add a touch of cream to the tomato sauce. If you don't like the
selection of seafood added at the end of the recipe, then add your
preference. You'll need about 1 3/4 pounds.

</P>
<P>
   1 (28-ounce) can Italian plum tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon milk
</P>
<P>
   1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
</P>
<P>
   1/2 yellow bell pepper, diced
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces wild striped bass, skin removed, cut into 1-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   5 ounces calamari, cut into rings
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces shrimp, tail on, peeled and deveined
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces bay scallops
</P>
<P>
   Combine the shallot, wine, salt and water in a medium saucepan
and bring to a simmer. Add the mussels and cook, covered, until the
shells are open, about 2 minutes. Remove the mussels from the shell
and set aside, loosely covered. Discard the shells. Strain the
cooking liquid through double layers of damp cheesecloth, and set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a medium straight-sided saute pan over medium
heat. Add the garlic and onion and cook until soft, stirring
occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add anchovies; cook another 2
minutes, stirring. Raise heat to medium-high; add the tomatoes,
breaking them up slightly with the back of a spoon. Add reserved
mussel liquid and red pepper flakes, and cook until the sauce has
thickened, about 25 minutes. Transfer the sauce to a bowl of a food
processor or blender and puree until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 425 degrees. Place six 6-ounce ramekins on a baking
sheet and set aside. In a small bowl, combine the egg and milk and
set aside. Lay the puff pastry on a clean surface. Using a round
cookie cutter or the rim of a glass, cut out six pastry rounds a
bit larger than the rims of the ramekins. Place pastry on
parchment-lined baking sheet; brush with egg wash. Bake until
golden brown and puffed, 9 to 12 minutes. Set aside in a warm
place.
</P>
<P>
   Return sauce to saute pan; stir in yellow peppers, thyme and
parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in all seafood;
distribute mixture evenly among ramekins. Place on a baking sheet;
bake until juicy and bubbling, 15 to 20 minutes. Place a round of
puff pastry on top of each cup and serve immediately. _ From:

<P>
   Shepherd's pie, with its mashed potato crust, is in the potpie
family. Here, goat cheese gives the mashed potatoes an edge.
Cooking time is based on potatoes that are mashed and ready to go
(deli mashed potatoes could be a timesaver).
</P>
<P>
   For the lamb filling:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds boneless lamb, cut in 1-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   1 cup 1/2-inch-thick onion slices
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 cup red wine
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   For the mashed potato crust:
</P>
<P>
   4 cups mashed potatoes
</P>
<P>
   5 ounces goat cheese
</P>
<P>
   2 to 4 tablespoons milk
</P>
<P>
   To finish:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   For the filling: In 5-quart Dutch oven, heat oil. In small bowl,
combine flour, salt and pepper. Toss lamb cubes in mixture, then
brown meat in hot oil, a few pieces at a time, about 6 to 8 minutes
per batch. (You can use two pans at a time to speed browning, then
combine in the Dutch oven.) When the lamb is browned, add the onion
and garlic and saute until the vegetables are soft, about 3 to 4
minutes. Pour in the wine and scrape up any browned bits that may
be stuck to the bottom of the pan. Add the broth, thyme and bay
leaf, stirring the sauce. Cover the pan and bake in the preheated
oven for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For the crust: Place the potatoes in a mixing bowl and beat in
the goat cheese, thinning the mixture with the milk. Keep a fairly
stiff consistency. Remove the lamb stew from the oven and remove
the bay leaf. Remove the lamb and onions from the pot and put in
small bowl and set aside. Put pan on stove over medium-high heat
and boil the mixture to reduce it by one-third. Return the lamb and
onions to the pan. Spread the potatoes over the stew and dot the
top with butter. Bake uncovered for an additional 20 minutes. _

   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chopped fresh sage, or 1/2 teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
   For the white cheddar and bacon crust:
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup ( 1/2 stick) butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped green onion
</P>
<P>
   2 cups crumbled corn bread
</P>
<P>
   8 slices bacon, cooked, drained and crumbled
</P>
<P>
   1 cup freshly grated white cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chicken broth, or as needed
</P>
<P>
   For the filling: In a 4-quart saucepan, melt the butter and add
the zucchini, squash and carrot. Saute the vegetables for 2
minutes, then sprinkle with the flour. Stir the mixture until the
flour begins to bubble. Whisk in the broth and stir until the sauce
is thick and smooth, about 4 to 6 minutes. Stir in the turkey or
chicken, salt, pepper and sage. Transfer the mixture to a 3-quart
ovenproof baking dish.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   For the crust: In a saute pan, heat the butter and add the green
onion. Saute for 2 minutes, until the onion begins to soften. Place
the corn bread in a large mixing bowl. Transfer the onion-butter
mixture to the bowl along with the bacon and cheddar cheese.
Drizzle some of the broth over the corn bread to moisten it. When
the mixture is crumbly, sprinkle it over the turkey in the baking
dish.

   OK. This one stretches the definition of potpie. Some might
argue it's more like a casserole. But it was so delicious, we had

HIGH RISK ISN'T ANSWER FOR NONPERFORMING BANK FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I enjoyed your rant about buying mutual funds at banks. Even
though I had been warned not to, I bought mutual funds through two
local banks. Each sold me the worst fund from the fund family
involved. Neither one said a word about what happens if the fund
turns out to be a dog, let alone a super dog. They just collected
fees for services not rendered _ a total of $430. I don't know if
they are irresponsible nitwits or just enjoy cheating old people.
Most inexperienced investors have no idea they can transfer money
from a bad fund to a good one. Shouldn't people receive some kind
of information for the fees they pay? A friend bought $30,000 worth
of mutual funds at a bank after he had lost $9,000 at a different
one. Needless to say, he won't be making many trips to Cancun with
the profits.
</P>
<P>
   My money is now in the funds listed above. I hope you are wrong
about the days of double-digit returns being numbered. I'd like to
get back some of the money I've lost in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   J.C., Umatilla, Ore. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I agree, it's risky to buy funds at banks, where the adviser
sometimes appears to know little more about investing than the
customer. But it's also a risky to scan the offerings within any
fund family and put your money into the fund or funds that show up
at the top of the recent performance list. Following that approach,
you usually end up buying funds that invest in the riskier sectors
of the market, and those whose risks have been rewarded by hot
current markets.
</P>
<P>
   It's dizzying to look at a record such as the 146.2 percent 1999
advance of Invesco Technology I (and the 47.76 percent gain so far
this year). But figures such as those can also be interpreted to
mean that the prices are pretty overblown by now. Note, for
example, the 56.6 percent portfolio average price-to-earnings ratio
for the same fund, 150 percent of that of the Standard and Poor's
500 Index.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to have some funds like that _ they supply the spice,
the potential for big wins. But such funds also bring the potential
for big losses.
</P>
<P>
   Your portfolio is like a meal that begins with a brownie,
progresses to a slice of chocolate layer cake, and finishes with
cherries jubilee. You're taking on a lot of risk _ a very great
deal of risk.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that the bank's sales people didn't do all that
horribly by you. You don't specify your age. So they probably
pushed the traditional button, choosing bond funds that would
supply you with a good income stream. Alas, with rising interest
rates and the prospect for more ahead, the last couple of years
have been terrible ones for bond and bond fund owners, and when you
look at the offerings of various fund families, the recent returns
almost invariably show the long bond funds at the bottom of the
list. That doesn't make them the worst funds in a family. It simply
means they are, by charter, obligated to invest the owners' money
in a market category that has been taking a pasting.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock side, you can say the same for value-oriented
funds. I'll bet bucks to bananas that if you look at the 10-year
results of these funds, they are quite respectable. Bond funds do
work for retired people, but you must have the stamina to ride out
the inevitable slumps in the bond market and take a decade-long
perspective on your investment.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion is that you abandon your attempt to make up your
losses with the very aggressive portfolio you have chosen. At the
very minimum, I suggest you put at least half of your money in
traditional and proven funds, such as Janus fund and Fidelity
Puritan fund. And I'd be happy if you moved another quarter of your
portfolio into a solid fixed-income fund such as Fidelity GNMA. You
could then spread the final quarter among your favorites of the
high-fliers that you now hold. Such a portfolio might not take you
to the luxury suites at Cancun all that quickly, but it would bode
fair to keep you off Skid Row.

   Q. My husband is taking early retirement; I expect to work until
age 67. My 401(k) plan at work will be our major supplement to our
retirement income. With 13 more years to contribute and with
additions of about $6,000 a year, how much can I reasonably expect
to have when I retire? We have 25 years to go on a 30-year mortgage
at 9 percent, with a balance of about $146,000. If we pay an extra
$100 a month against the principal, how much sooner can I expect to
pay off the mortgage? What computer program would I need to make
similar calculations myself?
</P>
<P>
   A.K., Buena Park, Calif. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you add $500 a month to your 401(k) program for 13 years,
and if you achieve average market returns of 10 percent, you would
amass $357,480 at the end of the period. Given your current
holdings and allocations, I think that's a reasonable expectation.
</P>
<P>
   As for the mortgage, I estimate your current payment is $1,189 _
a figure unlikely to be precise but probably pretty close. If you
added $100 to each monthly payment, you would cut five years and
five months from the payment schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those calculations were made with a computer program
called Interest Vision Special Edition, which I got free from
Parsons Technology Inc. many years ago. I subsequently purchased
Interest Vision Professional from the same company but found the
enhancements so insubstantial that I rarely use it. Parsons' Web
address is www.parsonstech.com, but I had a terrible time locating
the product, and found it only after doing a Google search under
Interest Vision, where it popped right up. Interest Vision 2.0
(which is newer than the Interest Vision Professional version that
underwhelmed me) costs $24.95. I haven't tried the 2.0 version, but
it should do the job my software does plus a lot more.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Money Musings: While we're in this vein, does anybody know of a
program for calculating the effects of projected inflation at
various rates and over various time periods? I use one at the
Merrill Lynch Web site, but would love to find a similar product I
could download and use offline. The Merill Lynch calculator can be
found at: www.ml.com/family/inflation-calc.html

 &HT;    Potpie, the ultimate comfort food

   For a cold, everyone knows chicken soup with noodles and a
clear, soothing broth restores.
</P>

   But for pure comfort, creamy chicken and vegetables under a
blanket of flaky pie crust is what the soul really desires.
</P>

   Potpies are popular again. There they are on the April cover of
Food &AMP; Wine magazine and in Martha Stewart's ``Favorite Comfort
Foods,'' (Clarkson Potter, $22.) Potpies also are featured on the
new menu for Northwest Airlines _ first class, no less.
</P>
<P>
   And cookbook author Diane Phillips has written a whole book
devoted to them _ ``Pot Pies: Comfort Food Under Cover''
(Doubleday, $24.95.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to beg my parents to go out so we could have a
babysitter, because she always gave us Swanson's potpies,'' said
Phillips. Such nostalgia is behind the comfort food craze in
general and the return of potpies in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with all the fears about Y2K and a new age, many of us
wanted to go back to what's comfortable,'' Phillips said. ``We want
to make our homes a center for our family. And there's nothing that
makes you feel better than coming home after a long day to the
aroma of a potpie.''
</P>
<P>
   To create that comfy scene on a weeknight, get a head start. The
night before, roast the meat and prepare the crust. You can get two
meals for one if you serve roasted chicken and vegetables with
biscuits one night, then convert the leftovers into a potpie the
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a great vehicle to stretch your food dollar,'' said
Phillips. ``If you have two cups of chicken leftovers and some
biscuits or chive mashed potatoes, you've got a meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Or while you are eating dinner the first night, pop a turkey or
chicken breast in the oven along with a batch of corn bread.
They'll be ready for assembly on the second night, and you'll have
a potpie in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   There are even shorter cuts _ precooked chicken, turkey or ham
and frozen puff pastry or phyllo dough or refrigerated biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   It's that versatility that makes potpies a good family meal.
``If you don't have all the ingredients a recipe calls for, don't
let that stop you,'' Phillips said. ``Go ahead and make a potpie
with what you have in the pantry or freezer.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips prefers to put a crust on the top only for ease and
because bottom crusts get soggy. And while a pastry crust is the
classic, crusts of bread crumbs, corn bread, mashed potatoes or
biscuits all work beautifully. Seasonings like chives, pesto and
rosemary can really fancy up a crust. To stretch the concept even
further, Phillips experimented with vegetable toppings such as
pureed beans.
</P>
<P>
   Fillings can be innovative, too. Everything from steak to
monkfish can be sauced and blanketed. Inside we offer a classic
chicken potpie, a hearty beef stew pie, spicy seafood topped with
puff pastry and an easy taco pie that's a busy weeknight delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a meal you can put on the table in under an hour,''
said Phillips. ``And you can have a good time doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   MAKE IT UP AS YOU GO WITH CREATIVE COMBOS
</P>
<P>
   All it takes to create a potpie is imagination. After trying the
recipes inside, consider mixing and matching these options. Combine
meat and vegetables with thickened stock or sauce. Then top with
your choice of blankets.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It was 10:30 on the evening of Dec. 28, but darkness had
descended over central Tibet just an hour before.
 &HT;    Sunset comes late here because Tibet runs on the same clock as
Beijing, 2,000 miles to the east.
 &HT;    In the remote, beautiful monastery of Tsurphu, the seat of the
17th Karmapa, head of the Karma Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism,
most of the monks were already busy with their evening studies.
Others were settling down to watch the 10:30 news on the television
set that only recently had been installed.
 &HT;    Parked outside the monastery was a Mitsubishi SUV, ostensibly to
take one of the senior monks on a fund-raising trip to northwest
Tibet. The driver waited behind the wheel, nervous but resolved.
 &HT;    Only a few hours earlier, he had been admitted to a secret that,
had it been betrayed, would have brought the immediate arrest of
all involved. The 17th Karmapa was about to try a daring escape
from Tibet.
 &HT;    Earlier that day, the 14-year-old religious leader had entered
what had been announced as an eight-day religious retreat in his
private apartment.
 &HT;    Up in his personal quarters, though, the Karmapa was making an
unusual set of preparations.
 &HT;    He laid aside his maroon monk's robes and dressed in a pair of
trousers, a down jacket, a warm hat, a pair of spectacles and a
scarf. Then he opened his bedroom window and, followed by his
elderly attendant, climbed carefully onto the roof of the shrine
hall that housed the effigy of the Karma Kagyu's protective deity,
Mahakala.
 &HT;    The old man and his young charge worked their way along the roof
toward the end of the building, a route that took them directly
over the roof of a guardhouse. It was a drop of less than 10 feet
to the ground, then only a few yards to the waiting vehicle.
 &HT;    But as the two crept along the roof, they heard the voice of
their accomplice, the monk who was preparing to depart for his
supposed fund-raising tour. He was engaged in a loud conversation
with an unseen man below _ perhaps one of the many monks at Tsurphu
who were paid to report signs of disloyalty to the Chinese regime.
 &HT;    The Karmapa and his attendant froze and crouched down on the
roof until the conversation ended and the straying monk had stepped
back inside. Finally they dropped to the ground and ran to the SUV.
Amid a tense silence, the four men drove off.
 &HT;    More than two months later, the consequences of the lama's
dramatic flight are still being played out.
 &HT;    As he stole off into the night, the Karmapa could not have
suspected that within days of his arrival in northern India he
would be regarded by many as a possible future leader of the
100,000 exiled Tibetans, the potential temporal successor to the
exiled ruler of Tibet, the Dalai Lama.
 &HT;    Nor could he know _ though he certainly feared _ that
embarrassed Chinese authorities would reportedly detain his parents
as well as close the Tsurphu monastery to visitors and reshuffle
its security personnel and management.
 &HT;    It is also unlikely that he anticipated the worldwide sensation
his flight would cause, or the diplomatic crisis it would touch off
between India and China _ a crisis so severe that the Karmapa
himself would be forbidden to speak publicly of why or how he fled.
 &HT;    This is the story of that escape, based on the account of a key
participant who, fearing for the safety of friends, associates and
family in Tibet, would not allow himself to be identified.
 -0- 
 &HT;    In 1992, at the age of 7, Ugyen Trinley Dorje _ the Karmapa's
given name _ had been recognized as the reincarnation of the
deceased 16th Karmapa and plucked from his nomad family in eastern
Tibet.
 &HT;    Shortly thereafter, in a ceremony attended by about 20,000, he
was enthroned in the 12th-century Tsurphu monastery in the
Drowolung valley in central Tibet, some 40 miles northwest of
Lhasa.
 &HT;    An appealing child with a remarkably direct gaze, Ugyen Trinley
had impressed his followers with his intelligence and seriousness
of purpose. As a high incarnate lama recognized both by Beijing and
the Dalai Lama, Ugyen Trinley enjoyed a privileged existence even
in today's Tibet.
 &HT;    The Chinese government indulged him, hoping to use him to
legitimize its rule over Tibet and to blunt the impact of the Dalai
Lama's international campaign for autonomy. At the same time, he
was worshiped by the followers of Karma Kagyu, one of the most
influential of the four schools of Tibetan Buddhism around the
world.
 &HT;    But now Ugyen Trinley was 14, and the red-cheeked nomad boy had
grown into a young man nearly six feet tall, and he was looking for
something more than toys and kind words from Beijing. He had
reached an age when the tradition of the Karma Kagyu demanded that
he begin to receive the teachings of his lineage _ that he become
the latest link in a chain of oral transmission that stretches
back, unbroken, for nearly a thousand years.
 &HT;    Each previous incarnation of the Karmapa had received the
teachings from a master lama (the word lama simply means
``teacher'') who had himself received them from a previous
incarnation of the Karmapa.
 &HT;    But how was Ugyen Trinley to receive those teachings? Tai Situ
Rinpoche and Gyaltsab Rinpoche, the masters anointed to teach him,
were both in India, part of the vast Tibetan diaspora that had
formed in the aftermath of the failed 1959 uprising against the
Chinese.
 &HT;    Ugyen Trinley had made repeated requests to travel to India to
study with them. They, in turn, had asked for permission to visit
him in Tibet. But since Tai Situ Rinpoche's last trip, in 1993,
Beijing had refused.
 &HT;    At same time, the young Karmapa was developing a mind of his
own.
 &HT;    Kagyu monks tell of the Karmapa's reluctance to pay homage to
the Panchen Lama (the second most important reincarnate lama, who
was chosen by the Dalai Lama against the wishes of the Chinese and
then disappeared with his family after being apprehended by Chinese
security forces). Or of the time the Karmapa slapped the face of a
Gelugpa lama in a dispute in 1995.
 &HT;    Then there was his general reluctance to toe the Communist Party
line. When the local party representative asked him last year to
read a speech prepared by local party officials, he refused.
 &HT;    ``Do you wish me to say,'' the Karmapa inquired, ``that I am
giving this speech on your behalf?''
 &HT;    The startled party representative explained that the speech was
to be delivered as though it were his own.
 &HT;    ``In that case,'' said the Karmapa, ``I have no need of this
text.''
 &HT;    No speech was given.
 &HT;    Word of the Karmapa's discontent inevitably filtered out. The
Dalai Lama was alarmed to hear last year that the Karmapa wanted to
leave; he feared for the boy's safety. A message was hastily sent,
counseling patience.
 &HT;    The Karmapa waited, but with a growing conviction that the
longer he did, the harder it would be to escape. Already he was
under surveillance.
 &HT;    In addition to the spies and informers, uniformed security
personnel controlled access to the monastery and scrutinized the
Karmapa's mail. He could not leave the monastery for any reason
without the permission of his Chinese-appointed management. He had
begun to feel like a prisoner.
 &HT;    To escape was a terribly risky enterprise. But for his
followers, the Karmapa is a ``bodhisattva,'' a manifestation of the
Buddha, whose vision goes beyond the mundane. He saw his flight as
his spiritual destiny.
 &HT;    Entrusting the planning to one man in his entourage _ who in
turn had chosen two more _ the Karmapa had insisted that his escape
must be accomplished before the Lunar New Year, which was Feb. 5.
That left just over two months to prepare.
 &HT;    The three men had been under no illusions about the scale of the
challenge: to smuggle Tibet's most prominent reincarnate lama out
of a heavily guarded monastery, run for a border that at its
closest point was about 200 miles away, cross that border unnoticed
and somehow reach Dharamsala in northern India, the exile home of
the Dalai Lama. It was a project so audacious that many continued
to believe it was impossible, even after it had been successfully
completed.
 &HT;    The route the party took was one of several they had considered,
each with its own set of dangers. It ran through western Tibet to
Mustang, in Nepal, about 400 miles from Lhasa. It was extremely
long but relatively unguarded.
 &HT;    Among its other advantages, the road, while not good, was
passable with the right vehicle as far as the border, and the
border crossing itself was often unmanned.
 &HT;    Finally, to cross into Nepal a traveling businessman did not
need a passport but only a permit, which could be obtained from an
army camp near the border. The planners knew that once they got
over the border, whatever difficulties they encountered would be
secondary. They also knew that until that moment, there would be no
second chances. They had prepared meticulously, and they knew
exactly what lay ahead.
 &HT;    A few weeks earlier, two of them had obtained permits for a
business trip and had reconnoitered the route as far as Lo
Manthang, just inside Nepal. They had taken photographs and noted
all the potential dangers _ primarily, Chinese checkpoints (manned
on some occasions but not others) or army barracks.
 &HT;    They returned to Tibet _ their mission apparently unnoticed by
the security services _ with a detailed understanding of what they
had to do. They submitted their plan, along with the photographs,
to the Karmapa for his approval.
 &HT;    They knew that good cover stories were essential. Neither the
fund-raising trip nor the business trip were unusual events. The
purchase of the Mitsubishi _ a more suitable vehicle than the truck
that had been used for previous fund-raising trips _ was made
without attracting attention.
 &HT;    Finally, the Karmapa announced his intention to observe an
eight-day religious retreat in his private chambers. The retreat,
nothing out of the ordinary for him, provided eight days in which
the watching eyes of the monastery spies would not expect to see
him. Only his teacher and his cook would attend him behind the
closed door of his private apartments.
 &HT;    The date had been set for the 21st day of the 11th month in the
Tibetan calendar _ Dec. 28.
 &HT;    And from the moment they drove away from the monastery, with a
long journey ahead and a border to cross, stopping only to change
drivers, all night and all the next day, their plan worked well.
Even the checkpoints that the two scouts had so carefully logged
were all unmanned.
 &HT;    It was not until 11:30 p.m. on Dec. 29, the second night of
their escape, that they reached a section of the road that they
knew to be dangerous. They were nearing the border, and the road
ran within 800 yards of the first of two Chinese army camps.
 &HT;    It was already dark, but not, they decided, dark enough for the
risky passage ahead. Two of them were to drive past the camp
without lights. The rest, including the Karmapa, would take to the
mountains on foot and rendezvous back on the road, beyond the
danger zone.
 &HT;    They waited until 1:30 a.m., then three men and the Karmapa
slipped out of the vehicle and began their arduous climb. In the
dark, they picked their way through thorn scrub, frequently
stumbling in the night. It took four hours to reach the other side
of the mountain, their hands lacerated by thorns and their legs
bruised from frequent falls. To their dismay, there was no sign of
the Mitsubishi.
 &HT;    Had the others been captured, they wondered. Had they missed
them in the dark? If the vehicle had simply missed them, perhaps
they could still meet up.
 &HT;    It was still dark, but dawn was not far off. They decided to
head for the border on foot, even without provisions and despite
the bitter weather, and stay on the road as long as it was safe. An
hour later, to their inexpressible relief, they made out the
Mitsubishi driving slowly toward them. It had overshot its
destination and, as they predicted, was coming back to look for
them.
 &HT;    Half an hour after driving through the second army camp
unchallenged, they reached Nyichung, passing the pillar that marks
the unmanned border with Mustang, Nepal. They drove across.
 &HT;    On the Nepalese side of the border, the track was hardly fit,
even for an SUV. Besides, the party had no permit to drive their
vehicle in Nepal, and they did not want to attract official
curiosity. So they left the vehicle in the care of a family on the
Mustang side of the border, telling them they would come back for
it in a few days.
 &HT;    To continue their trek, they hired horses and rode to Lo
Manthang, two hours away. There, in the house of a Karma Kagyu
devotee, they had their first night's rest since fleeing Tsurphu.
Early the next morning, Dec. 31, they rode on.
 &HT;    They traveled without a break for another complete day and night
until 7:30 the following evening, when they reached the Manang
district, a popular spot for trekkers in the shadow of the
Annapurna Range. They spent the night there in a tourist lodge.
 &HT;    The next day, Jan. 2, they rode by helicopter _ in this terrain,
it is either yaks or helicopters _ to the outskirts of Katmandu,
the Nepalese capital, then took a taxi across the border into
India. The Nepalese border guards were happy to accept a bribe to
overlook their lack of travel documents.
 &HT;    From the Indian border, their incredible journey continued. They
took a rickshaw to the nearest railway station _ at Gorakhpur _
where they boarded a train to Lucknow. In Lucknow, they hired
another taxi.
 &HT;    After a further 24 hours of continuous driving, they reached New
Delhi, the Indian capital, on the evening of Jan. 4. There they
changed taxis and drove on through the final night of their journey
to Dharamsala, the home of the Dalai Lama.
 &HT;    Disaster threatened on the final leg of the journey as their car
skidded off the road in a fog. Miraculously, as the Karmapa's
followers see it, nobody was injured. Finally, at 10:30 on the
morning of Jan. 5, they reached Dharamsala.
 &HT;    Since leaving Tsurphu eight days previously, they had slept only
twice in a bed. Their euphoria was tinged with fear for those left
behind.
 &HT;    On Jan. 31, they telephoned the Karmapa's residence from Nepal.
A stranger answered the telephone and they heard noises and
shouting in the background, so they quickly hung up. The fates of
the Karmapa's teacher and his cook remain unknown.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Exhausted, the group checked into the Bhagsu Hotel in McLeod
Ganj, a little town uphill from Dharamsala.
 &HT;    Less than an hour later, the Karmapa, painfully thin and
windburned, with lacerated hands and open sores on his feet, strode
into the audience chamber of an astonished but delighted Dalai
Lama.
 &HT;    ``It was a moment of great emotion,'' says one monk who
witnessed the meeting. ``Leaving aside everything else, they are
two great bodhisattvas, and the understanding and affection between
them was very moving.''
 &HT;    The Dalai Lama ordered the group moved to Chonor House, the
government-in-exile's official guest house, and sent his doctor to
examine them. After a brief reunion with Tai Situ, the exhausted
Karmapa went to bed and slept until 11 the next morning.
 &HT;    As news of his sensational escape raced around the world, the
Indian and Chinese governments were caught off balance.
 &HT;    Beijing issued a hasty statement. The Karmapa, it said
unconvincingly, had left a note in the monastery explaining that he
had gone to get his crown, a ritual object that is presently in
Rumtek monastery, the former seat of the 16th Karmapa. The Karmapa
had made it clear, according to Beijing, that he did not intend to
stay away or to ``betray'' the ``motherland.''
 &HT;    In New Delhi, the reaction was a mixture of anxiety and
disbelief _ anxiety about the Chinese response and disbelief that
such an escape was possible without either the assistance of
Tibetans in India or the connivance of the Chinese government.
 &HT;    New Delhi dispatched intelligence officers to Dharamsala to
interview the escapees. While it waited for the results of its
inquiries, the government asked the Dalai Lama's officials to
ensure that the Tibetans said nothing that would inflame the
already delicate situation.
 &HT;    With that, an official silence descended on the subject of the
Karmapa's escape.
 &HT;    The Karmapa himself was moved to a monastery on the outskirts of
Dharamsala, where Indian army guards now strictly limit access to
him. The few who gain admittance are searched minutely. In the
short term, at least, the Karmapa had exchanged one set of
restrictions for another.
 &HT;    Within days of the Karmapa's dramatic appearance in India, the
senior lamas of the Karma Kagyu were flocking to Dharamsala to pay
homage to their spiritual leader and to consult with the Dalai Lama
about the boy's future.
 &HT;    An elderly Kagyu monk has been named the Karmapa's tutor, and
now the young Karmapa divides his time between his studies and his
hobby of writing poems and songs. But New Delhi remains silent on
the matter of his exact status, and many questions still hang over
his future.
 &HT;    Among the most intriguing of those questions is the role that
the Dalai Lama envisages for a young companion whom he never
expected to meet.
 &HT;    The Dalai Lama will be 65 this year and is well aware that
Beijing is waiting expectantly for him to die. With the Dalai Lama
out of the way, the Chinese could hope that the Tibet issue will
begin to fade from prominence.
 &HT;    Without its spiritual leader, moreover, the community in exile,
prone as it is to disputes and sectarian quarrels, might very well
fragment. Divided and leaderless, it would no longer present a
problem to Beijing.
 &HT;    But the arrival of the Karmapa offers a different possible
narrative. He is young and charismatic and could clearly provide a
focus in the future for Tibetan loyalties.
 &HT;    A respected spiritual leader and already a forceful character,
the Karmapa could be well positioned to speak for his people in the
absence of the Dalai Lama or during the infancy of the Dalai Lama's
next reincarnation.
 &HT;    If the Dalai Lama keeps the young Karmapa close _ and succeeds
in passing on his own vision for the future _ Tibetans could find a
new leader, and China could face a new and formidable adversary.

would be regarded by many as a possible future leader of the
100,000 exiled Tibetans, the potential temporal successor to the
exiled ruler of Tibet, the Dalai Lama.
 &HT;    Nor could he know _ though he certainly feared _ that
embarrassed Chinese authorities would reportedly detain his parents
as well as close the Tsurphu monastery to visitors and reshuffle
its security personnel and management.
 &HT;    It is also unlikely that he anticipated the worldwide sensation
his flight would cause, or the diplomatic crisis it would touch off
between India and China _ a crisis so severe that the Karmapa
himself would be forbidden to speak publicly of why or how he fled.
 &HT;    This is the story of that escape, based on the account of a key
participant who, fearing for the safety of friends, associates and
family in Tibet, would not allow himself to be identified.
 -0- 
 &HT;    In 1992, at the age of 7, Ugyen Trinley Dorje _ the Karmapa's
given name _ had been recognized as the reincarnation of the
deceased 16th Karmapa and plucked from his nomad family in eastern
Tibet.
 &HT;    Shortly thereafter, in a ceremony attended by about 20,000, he
was enthroned in the 12th-century Tsurphu monastery in the
Drowolung valley in central Tibet, some 40 miles northwest of
Lhasa.
 &HT;    An appealing child with a remarkably direct gaze, Ugyen Trinley
had impressed his followers with his intelligence and seriousness
of purpose. As a high incarnate lama recognized both by Beijing and
the Dalai Lama, Ugyen Trinley enjoyed a privileged existence even
in today's Tibet.
 &HT;    The Chinese government indulged him, hoping to use him to
legitimize its rule over Tibet and to blunt the impact of the Dalai
Lama's international campaign for autonomy. At the same time, he
was worshiped by the followers of Karma Kagyu, one of the most
influential of the four schools of Tibetan Buddhism around the
world.
 &HT;    But now Ugyen Trinley was 14, and the red-cheeked nomad boy had
grown into a young man nearly six feet tall, and he was looking for
something more than toys and kind words from Beijing. He had
reached an age when the tradition of the Karma Kagyu demanded that
he begin to receive the teachings of his lineage _ that he become
the latest link in a chain of oral transmission that stretches
back, unbroken, for nearly a thousand years.
 &HT;    Each previous incarnation of the Karmapa had received the
teachings from a master lama (the word lama simply means
``teacher'') who had himself received them from a previous
incarnation of the Karmapa.
 &HT;    But how was Ugyen Trinley to receive those teachings? Tai Situ
Rinpoche and Gyaltsab Rinpoche, the masters anointed to teach him,
were both in India, part of the vast Tibetan diaspora that had
formed in the aftermath of the failed 1959 uprising against the
Chinese.
 &HT;    Ugyen Trinley had made repeated requests to travel to India to
study with them. They, in turn, had asked for permission to visit
him in Tibet. But since Tai Situ Rinpoche's last trip, in 1993,
Beijing had refused.
 &HT;    At same time, the young Karmapa was developing a mind of his
own.
 &HT;    Kagyu monks tell of the Karmapa's reluctance to pay homage to
the Panchen Lama (the second most important reincarnate lama, who
was chosen by the Dalai Lama against the wishes of the Chinese and
then disappeared with his family after being apprehended by Chinese
security forces). Or of the time the Karmapa slapped the face of a
Gelugpa lama in a dispute in 1995.
 &HT;    Then there was his general reluctance to toe the Communist Party
line. When the local party representative asked him last year to
read a speech prepared by local party officials, he refused.
 &HT;    ``Do you wish me to say,'' the Karmapa inquired, ``that I am
giving this speech on your behalf?''
 &HT;    The startled party representative explained that the speech was
to be delivered as though it were his own.
 &HT;    ``In that case,'' said the Karmapa, ``I have no need of this
text.''
 &HT;    No speech was given.
 &HT;    Word of the Karmapa's discontent inevitably filtered out. The
Dalai Lama was alarmed to hear last year that the Karmapa wanted to
leave; he feared for the boy's safety. A message was hastily sent,
counseling patience.
 &HT;    The Karmapa waited, but with a growing conviction that the
longer he did, the harder it would be to escape. Already he was
under surveillance.
 &HT;    In addition to the spies and informers, uniformed security
personnel controlled access to the monastery and scrutinized the
Karmapa's mail. He could not leave the monastery for any reason
without the permission of his Chinese-appointed management. He had
begun to feel like a prisoner.
 &HT;    To escape was a terribly risky enterprise. But for his
followers, the Karmapa is a ``bodhisattva,'' a manifestation of the
Buddha, whose vision goes beyond the mundane. He saw his flight as
his spiritual destiny.
 &HT;    Entrusting the planning to one man in his entourage _ who in
turn had chosen two more _ the Karmapa had insisted that his escape
must be accomplished before the Lunar New Year, which was Feb. 5.
That left just over two months to prepare.
 &HT;    The three men had been under no illusions about the scale of the
challenge: to smuggle Tibet's most prominent reincarnate lama out
of a heavily guarded monastery, run for a border that at its
closest point was about 200 miles away, cross that border unnoticed
and somehow reach Dharamsala in northern India, the exile home of
the Dalai Lama. It was a project so audacious that many continued
to believe it was impossible, even after it had been successfully
completed.
 &HT;    The route the party took was one of several they had considered,
each with its own set of dangers. It ran through western Tibet to
Mustang, in Nepal, about 400 miles from Lhasa. It was extremely
long but relatively unguarded.
 &HT;    Among its other advantages, the road, while not good, was
passable with the right vehicle as far as the border, and the
border crossing itself was often unmanned.
 &HT;    Finally, to cross into Nepal a traveling businessman did not
need a passport but only a permit, which could be obtained from an
army camp near the border. The planners knew that once they got
over the border, whatever difficulties they encountered would be
secondary. They also knew that until that moment, there would be no
second chances. They had prepared meticulously, and they knew
exactly what lay ahead.
 &HT;    A few weeks earlier, two of them had obtained permits for a
business trip and had reconnoitered the route as far as Lo
Manthang, just inside Nepal. They had taken photographs and noted
all the potential dangers _ primarily, Chinese checkpoints (manned
on some occasions but not others) or army barracks.
 &HT;    They returned to Tibet _ their mission apparently unnoticed by
the security services _ with a detailed understanding of what they
had to do. They submitted their plan, along with the photographs,
to the Karmapa for his approval.
 &HT;    They knew that good cover stories were essential. Neither the
fund-raising trip nor the business trip were unusual events. The
purchase of the Mitsubishi _ a more suitable vehicle than the truck
that had been used for previous fund-raising trips _ was made
without attracting attention.
 &HT;    Finally, the Karmapa announced his intention to observe an
eight-day religious retreat in his private chambers. The retreat,
nothing out of the ordinary for him, provided eight days in which
the watching eyes of the monastery spies would not expect to see
him. Only his teacher and his cook would attend him behind the
closed door of his private apartments.
 &HT;    The date had been set for the 21st day of the 11th month in the
Tibetan calendar _ Dec. 28.
 &HT;    And from the moment they drove away from the monastery, with a
long journey ahead and a border to cross, stopping only to change
drivers, all night and all the next day, their plan worked well.
Even the checkpoints that the two scouts had so carefully logged
were all unmanned.
 &HT;    It was not until 11:30 p.m. on Dec. 29, the second night of
their escape, that they reached a section of the road that they
knew to be dangerous. They were nearing the border, and the road
ran within 800 yards of the first of two Chinese army camps.
 &HT;    It was already dark, but not, they decided, dark enough for the
risky passage ahead. Two of them were to drive past the camp
without lights. The rest, including the Karmapa, would take to the
mountains on foot and rendezvous back on the road, beyond the
danger zone.
 &HT;    They waited until 1:30 a.m., then three men and the Karmapa
slipped out of the vehicle and began their arduous climb. In the
dark, they picked their way through thorn scrub, frequently
stumbling in the night. It took four hours to reach the other side
of the mountain, their hands lacerated by thorns and their legs
bruised from frequent falls. To their dismay, there was no sign of
the Mitsubishi.
 &HT;    Had the others been captured, they wondered. Had they missed
them in the dark? If the vehicle had simply missed them, perhaps
they could still meet up.
 &HT;    It was still dark, but dawn was not far off. They decided to
head for the border on foot, even without provisions and despite
the bitter weather, and stay on the road as long as it was safe. An
hour later, to their inexpressible relief, they made out the
Mitsubishi driving slowly toward them. It had overshot its
destination and, as they predicted, was coming back to look for
them.
 &HT;    Half an hour after driving through the second army camp
unchallenged, they reached Nyichung, passing the pillar that marks
the unmanned border with Mustang, Nepal. They drove across.
 &HT;    On the Nepalese side of the border, the track was hardly fit,
even for an SUV. Besides, the party had no permit to drive their
vehicle in Nepal, and they did not want to attract official
curiosity. So they left the vehicle in the care of a family on the
Mustang side of the border, telling them they would come back for
it in a few days.
 &HT;    To continue their trek, they hired horses and rode to Lo
Manthang, two hours away. There, in the house of a Karma Kagyu
devotee, they had their first night's rest since fleeing Tsurphu.
Early the next morning, Dec. 31, they rode on.
 &HT;    They traveled without a break for another complete day and night
until 7:30 the following evening, when they reached the Manang
district, a popular spot for trekkers in the shadow of the
Annapurna Range. They spent the night there in a tourist lodge.
 &HT;    The next day, Jan. 2, they rode by helicopter _ in this terrain,
it is either yaks or helicopters _ to the outskirts of Katmandu,
the Nepalese capital, then took a taxi across the border into
India. The Nepalese border guards were happy to accept a bribe to
overlook their lack of travel documents.
 &HT;    From the Indian border, their incredible journey continued. They
took a rickshaw to the nearest railway station _ at Gorakhpur _
where they boarded a train to Lucknow. In Lucknow, they hired
another taxi.
 &HT;    After a further 24 hours of continuous driving, they reached New
Delhi, the Indian capital, on the evening of Jan. 4. There they
changed taxis and drove on through the final night of their journey
to Dharamsala, the home of the Dalai Lama.
 &HT;    Disaster threatened on the final leg of the journey as their car
skidded off the road in a fog. Miraculously, as the Karmapa's
followers see it, nobody was injured. Finally, at 10:30 on the
morning of Jan. 5, they reached Dharamsala.
 &HT;    Since leaving Tsurphu eight days previously, they had slept only
twice in a bed. Their euphoria was tinged with fear for those left
behind.
 &HT;    On Jan. 31, they telephoned the Karmapa's residence from Nepal.
A stranger answered the telephone and they heard noises and
shouting in the background, so they quickly hung up. The fates of
the Karmapa's teacher and his cook remain unknown.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Exhausted, the group checked into the Bhagsu Hotel in McLeod
Ganj, a little town uphill from Dharamsala.
 &HT;    Less than an hour later, the Karmapa, painfully thin and
windburned, with lacerated hands and open sores on his feet, strode
into the audience chamber of an astonished but delighted Dalai
Lama.
 &HT;    ``It was a moment of great emotion,'' says one monk who
witnessed the meeting. ``Leaving aside everything else, they are
two great bodhisattvas, and the understanding and affection between
them was very moving.''
 &HT;    The Dalai Lama ordered the group moved to Chonor House, the
government-in-exile's official guest house, and sent his doctor to
examine them. After a brief reunion with Tai Situ, the exhausted
Karmapa went to bed and slept until 11 the next morning.
 &HT;    As news of his sensational escape raced around the world, the
Indian and Chinese governments were caught off balance.
 &HT;    Beijing issued a hasty statement. The Karmapa, it said
unconvincingly, had left a note in the monastery explaining that he
had gone to get his crown, a ritual object that is presently in
Rumtek monastery, the former seat of the 16th Karmapa. The Karmapa
had made it clear, according to Beijing, that he did not intend to
stay away or to ``betray'' the ``motherland.''
 &HT;    In New Delhi, the reaction was a mixture of anxiety and
disbelief _ anxiety about the Chinese response and disbelief that
such an escape was possible without either the assistance of
Tibetans in India or the connivance of the Chinese government.
 &HT;    New Delhi dispatched intelligence officers to Dharamsala to
interview the escapees. While it waited for the results of its
inquiries, the government asked the Dalai Lama's officials to
ensure that the Tibetans said nothing that would inflame the
already delicate situation.
 &HT;    With that, an official silence descended on the subject of the
Karmapa's escape.
 &HT;    The Karmapa himself was moved to a monastery on the outskirts of
Dharamsala, where Indian army guards now strictly limit access to
him. The few who gain admittance are searched minutely. In the
short term, at least, the Karmapa had exchanged one set of
restrictions for another.
 &HT;    Within days of the Karmapa's dramatic appearance in India, the
senior lamas of the Karma Kagyu were flocking to Dharamsala to pay
homage to their spiritual leader and to consult with the Dalai Lama
about the boy's future.
 &HT;    An elderly Kagyu monk has been named the Karmapa's tutor, and
now the young Karmapa divides his time between his studies and his
hobby of writing poems and songs. But New Delhi remains silent on
the matter of his exact status, and many questions still hang over
his future.
 &HT;    Among the most intriguing of those questions is the role that
the Dalai Lama envisages for a young companion whom he never
expected to meet.
 &HT;    The Dalai Lama will be 65 this year and is well aware that
Beijing is waiting expectantly for him to die. With the Dalai Lama
out of the way, the Chinese could hope that the Tibet issue will
begin to fade from prominence.
 &HT;    Without its spiritual leader, moreover, the community in exile,
prone as it is to disputes and sectarian quarrels, might very well
fragment. Divided and leaderless, it would no longer present a
problem to Beijing.
 &HT;    But the arrival of the Karmapa offers a different possible
narrative. He is young and charismatic and could clearly provide a
focus in the future for Tibetan loyalties.
 &HT;    A respected spiritual leader and already a forceful character,
the Karmapa could be well positioned to speak for his people in the
absence of the Dalai Lama or during the infancy of the Dalai Lama's
next reincarnation.
 &HT;    If the Dalai Lama keeps the young Karmapa close _ and succeeds
in passing on his own vision for the future _ Tibetans could find a
new leader, and China could face a new and formidable adversary.

 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Not everyone wants to be an ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, I wrote about how James Daley, the former owner of
the Copley Plaza hotel, had bought himself a nomination as
ambassador to the Eastern Caribbean. The price: $271,000 in
campaign donations to President Clinton and the Democrats since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Daley is part of the Boston Five, Clinton's own Boston bank of
five deep-pocketed contributors he has turned to time and again,
most recently to write big checks to fund his legacy and
presidential library. Which got me wondering: If Daley gets to cash
out as Ambassador Deluxe, what about the rest of the Boston Five?
</P>
<P>
   At 52, Jack Manning, chief executive of Boston Capital Corp., is
too young to cash out. But he and his fabulously successful
investment firm may be in line to cash in. The immediate goal: an
exclusive contract to build housing for the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the story.
</P>
<P>
   The military, at the prodding of Congress, has turned to
privatization _ hasn't everyone? _ as the answer to rebuilding the
decrepit housing on bases around the country. With the military in
need of more than 200,000 new or renovated units, the initative
could be a gold mine for private developers while saving the
government billions by getting it out of the housing business. But
five years after it was authorized, virtually nothing has been
done; a congressional hearing this week is asking why.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Capital wants a piece of the action. The firm is one of
the biggest owners of affordable housing, with 110,000 apartments
nationwide. With money for affordable housing slowing down, the
chance to rebuild the nation's military housing is just too good to
pass up.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Capital is starting with the Air Force. In particular,
the firm is going after a pilot program to build 550 houses and
town houses on Florida's Patrick Air Force Base near Cape
Canaveral. But that could only be the beginning: Manning estimates
the Air Force alone needs 60,000 units of housing, costing maybe
$10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The base had been proceeding on a traditional competitive
bidding process until recently, when Boston Capital made what
Manning calls ``an unsolicited proposal.'' The Air Force listened
and has deferred the bidding process to allow Boston Capital to
make an exclusive proposal. Why? ``That decision was made at the
Pentagon level,'' says Ken Warren, a spokesman for the base.
</P>
<P>
   Manning says this is far from a done deal. If the Air Force does
not like Boston Capital's proposal it can still put the contract
out for bid. He says Boston Capital must pick up all expenses. ``We
are doing this without a net,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not doing it without friends. Manning is one of the
most prominent FOBs in Boston, holding a $25,000-a-pop reception
for the president at his Back Bay home and golfing with Clinton and
John Kerry in Edgartown. When Clinton summoned his most faithful
contributors to his Park Plaza suite in January, Manning was there
with the rest of the Boston Five.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Capital, in fact, is well wired on both sides of the
aisle. Since 1991, Boston Capital and its top executives (and
Manning's wife's own firm) have given nearly $1 million to the
Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Meanwhile, Boston Capital chairman Herbert F. Collins and other
executives have contributed about $465,000 to the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no politics involved at all,'' Manning says.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Jim Daley would say, too. And they may be right, of
course. Maybe the only return on their investment these businessmen
were expecting was a good government, a good economy, and a good
round of golf with the president. But when the numbers get so huge
who is going to believe it _ and isn't that just the problem with
our current campaign finance system?
</P>
<P>
   If Alan Solomont, Howard Kessler, or Fred Seigel _ the rest of
the Boston Five _ turn up with another ambassadorship or another
exclusive contract, let's just say we will not be surprised.

 By AMY BLOOM  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    I have been treating a young girl since her father's sudden
death six months ago.
 &HT;    One Saturday night, while her mother is out with her new
gentleman friend, she makes what we in the business call a
``suicidal gesture,'' which is much less than a full-fledged
attempt, but obviously a sign that all is not well, and not likely
to be, anytime soon.
 &HT;    She is in the hospital from Sunday to Friday. On Friday, the
``discharge planner'' calls to notify me that my young patient will
be returning home that afternoon.
 &HT;    Her five days of covered hospitalization are now up, and since
she is no longer a threat to herself (no suicidal gestures during
the four full days of her hospital stay), and was never a threat to
others, the HMO says it is time to go. Moreover, it won't pay for
family therapy.
 &HT;    I suggest that a weekend of hanging around with her mother and
the new beau is not a great treatment plan for an impulsive,
nonverbal kid. A few more days might give her a chance to connect
to the other kids on the unit, to have several sessions of family
therapy with her mother, to come to terms with having found herself
in a hospital in the first place.
 &HT;    I tell the planner what a great girl this is (she is not a great
girl yet. Right now she is a sad, confused, self-pitying and
irritable girl, but she might become a great girl, with some help)
and the planner sighs.
 &HT;    ``Well,'' she says, ``how about medication?''
 &HT;    It is the consensus of her treatment team, including me, that
what is needed is more talking, more strolling around the grounds
with the sympathetic nurse's aide, whose own father died in a car
accident, some intensive help for her and Mom at the hospital and
more room to grieve.
 &HT;    ``Medication for what?'' I ask.
 &HT;    ``For whatever. We could probably keep her another 11 days with
a medication trial.''
 &HT;    Prescribing psychotropic medications for school-age children is
a booming business these days. Ritalin's production alone is up 700
percent since 1990, and stories like mine are commonplace.
 &HT;    As a result, a battle has arisen between the pro-medication and
anti-medication camps: heated, public and utterly spurious. Some
children need medication; others don't. The real trouble lies in
how we make that assessment.
 &HT;    This process begins before the doctor ever sees the patient. The
person with the cash, the power and even the transportation usually
gets to identify the patient, setting the stage for all subsequent
decisions.
 &HT;    Which is why women without children were called ``barren'' and
men without were just unlucky; why Freud treated the obstreperous
Doras but not their parents; why aged, uncertain parents find
themselves in nursing homes against their will.
 &HT;    It is especially so when the murky questions of behavior and
psychology are raised: Is it adolescent moodiness or pre-Columbine
sociopathy? Was she born that way or did we make her that way?
 &HT;    The theoretical basis of family therapy _ and common sense _
holds that the most vulnerable point in the family structure will
reveal its stress first. And the way children show stress is often
called ``symptoms.'' Parents, of course, do not always wish to
interpret the symptoms, nor are family doctors always trained to
read them. Even well-intentioned parents who wish to make things
better, quickly, may override their child's experience and capacity
to express it.
 &HT;    For American children right now _ especially the fidgety, the
distractible and the extra-lively _ their vulnerability is made
worse by a ghastly convergence of social anxiety, overwhelmed and
uninspired schools and widespread fixation on the bottom line.
 &HT;    Find a symptom, find a treatment, treat it and, in a modern
twist, make it no one's fault. Fix them, we say.
 &HT;    And these new drugs do ``fix'' them _ quickly, inexpensively and
inappropriately. We fix them at a younger and younger age _ these
days even when they're toddlers. And we do so even when we use
medications intended for adults. As a result, 4 million children
are on Ritalin and 2.5 million are on antidepressants.
 &HT;    Attention deficit disorder and hyperactive disorder (both
formerly known as minimal brain damage, but nicely renamed by the
drug companies) do exist, and it would be cruel to withhold Ritalin
from children who suffer from them. Just as it would be unfair to
stigmatize them as spoiled brats and ridiculous to blame their
concerned parents.
 &HT;    But these drugs are being wildly prescribed because they are
cheaper and less time-consuming than psychotherapy and much easier
to sell, both to the consumer and to the average family doctor.
Prescriptions are less work than conversation and careful
evaluation. And handing out medication at lunchtime is easier than
creating classes that keep intelligent and curious kids from
squirming, daydreaming and talking back.
 &HT;    Most of all, we prescribe medications for children who don't
need them because the medications are available, and a cure for
parental vanity and irresponsibility _ along with the single-minded
greed of HMOs _ is not.

 By AMY BLOOM  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    I have been treating a young girl since her father's sudden
death six months ago.
 &HT;    One Saturday night, while her mother is out with her new
gentleman friend, she makes what we in the business call a
``suicidal gesture,'' which is much less than a full-fledged
attempt, but obviously a sign that all is not well, and not likely
to be, anytime soon.
 &HT;    She is in the hospital from Sunday to Friday. On Friday, the
``discharge planner'' calls to notify me that my young patient will
be returning home that afternoon.
 &HT;    Her five days of covered hospitalization are now up, and since
she is no longer a threat to herself (no suicidal gestures during
the four full days of her hospital stay), and was never a threat to
others, the HMO says it is time to go. Moreover, it won't pay for
family therapy.
 &HT;    I suggest that a weekend of hanging around with her mother and
the new beau is not a great treatment plan for an impulsive,
nonverbal kid. A few more days might give her a chance to connect
to the other kids on the unit, to have several sessions of family
therapy with her mother, to come to terms with having found herself
in a hospital in the first place.
 &HT;    I tell the planner what a great girl this is (she is not a great
girl yet. Right now she is a sad, confused, self-pitying and
irritable girl, but she might become a great girl, with some help)
and the planner sighs.
 &HT;    ``Well,'' she says, ``how about medication?''
 &HT;    It is the consensus of her treatment team, including me, that
what is needed is more talking, more strolling around the grounds
with the sympathetic nurse's aide, whose own father died in a car
accident, some intensive help for her and Mom at the hospital and
more room to grieve.
 &HT;    ``Medication for what?'' I ask.
 &HT;    ``For whatever. We could probably keep her another 11 days with
a medication trial.''
 &HT;    Prescribing psychotropic medications for school-age children is

YALE START-UPS BOOST NEW HAVEN AS MAJOR BIOMEDICAL CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Alfred ``Buz'' Brown is every bit the tour
guide.
</P>
<P>
   To persuade the founder of a biotechnology start-up to locate
his company in this city, home of Yale University, Brown drove him
around some tony nearby suburbs where the entrepreneur's family
might live. He told him that more than 90 percent of local students
go to good public schools and that property values are high and
taxes reasonable. In the town of Madison, Brown crowed, residents
pay only $30 a year to use the Surf Club, the posh town-owned beach
on Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot: William Rice decided to start his company, Achillion
Pharmaceuticals Inc., in downtown New Haven, just a block from Yale
Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buz did a sales job on me and said so up front,'' Rice
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Brown isn't a salesman, real estate agent, or even a
businessman.
</P>
<P>
   He is director of Yale's Office of Cooperative Research, which
besides licensing technology developed at the school has recently
gotten into the start-up game. That includes finding entrepreneurs,
helping to write business plans, and arranging financing _ services
Ivy League universities rarely provide to industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``MIT and Stanford would never do this,'' chuckled Brown. ``But
then they don't need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford
University, which have spawned bicoastal high-technology meccas
over the past 30 years, Yale is a late bloomer in fostering
economic development.
</P>
<P>
   But now, New Haven, long known for its declining economic base,
is getting a shot in the arm with the blossoming of a biotechnology
industry spurred by Yale's research and fed by close ties to the
299-year-old university, the nation's third-oldest.
</P>
<P>
   In the emergence of biotech in New Haven, Yale serves as a
catalyst, in much the same way that universities have always spun
off technology and ideas through ties with private industry and the
commercialization of university research.
</P>
<P>
   Only within the last 4 1/2 years has Yale, the Ivy League
university that dominates New Haven, begun to come down from its
ivory tower and recognize the importance of economic development
near the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Yale has gone from an insular focus on basic research to
``acknowledging in the early 1990s that there are exciting
commercial opportunities'' in biotechnology and information
technology, said Leonard Bell, a former Yale professor who is
founder and chief executive of Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc., one of
the oldest and largest New Haven-based biopharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   The strategic change began under longtime faculty member Richard
C. Levin, who has been Yale's president since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, Levin announced plans to spend $500 million on
university biomedical programs aimed at turning New Haven into a
major biomedical center over the next 10 years. He also committed
another $500 million to promote basic science, engineering, and
clinical research programs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those funds will be used to build laboratory facilities
near New Haven's Science Park, an aging industrial park with a
troubled history that is home to a handful of companies started
with technology developed at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Greater New Haven is home to 15 biotech- and
bioscience-related companies employing about 800 people in
high-paying, skilled jobs.
</P>
<P>
   That's equivalent to just a small office park in Massachusetts,
where the Cambridge-to-Worcester corridor is home to more than 120
biotechnology companies that employ more than 13,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this first wave of New Haven companies in biotech and
genomics _ the study of genes for targeting the cause of diseases _
represents a nascent industry that could help New Haven stem a
brain drain of technical and professional workers.
</P>
<P>
   New Haven's bioscience growth, however, could pose problems for
some Massachusetts companies in the competition to hire young,
educated employees. With its college-town amenities, lower housing
costs, and promixity to New York City (a 90-minute drive), New
Haven can be alluring to young professionals, the city's boosters
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really not competing with Cambridge, but for young
researchers looking for jobs, this area now offers an
alternative,'' said E. Jonathan Soderstrom, managing director of
Yale's Office of Cooperative Research.
</P>
<P>
   To promote economic development, Yale has been stepping up its
activity with business start-ups since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four years, Soderstrom's office has launched
technology transfer practices aimed at bringing the university's
discoveries to private industry, particularly near the campus.
</P>
<P>
   And while the strategy fosters economic development and job
creation, it's also designed to attract and retain Yale faculty
members who are looking for commercial outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Yale receives stock for helping to launch start-ups
and cash for multiyear licensing of university-developed
technology. Last year, Yale received $40.7 million in license
revenue, an eightfold increase over the $5 million it reported in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Soderstrom said his office launches three to four companies per
year.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is PhytoCeutica Inc., a company involved in herbal
drug discovery and founded with research from Yung-Chi Cheng, a
Yale professor.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng is also the faculty founder of Achillion, which is
developing a drug to treat the AIDS virus and hepatitis B.
</P>
<P>
   Yale's bioscience efforts are getting a boost from several other
sources. These include venture capitalists from New York and
Boston, who routinely visit New Haven, and Connecticut Innovations,
a quasipublic agency that provides equity financing and manages the
state's $30 million in facility improvement loans to young
companies. Ten-year-old Connecticut Innovations has been providing
financing for biotech and genomics companies for several years.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Connecticut Innovations has spent nearly $16 million on
developing laboratory space for eight companies and nearly $7.6
million has been invested in six New Haven-area biotech firms.
</P>
<P>
   The largest investment, $4.8 million, went to Genaissance
Pharmaceuticals Inc., which helps drug makers tailor medications to
an individual's genetic makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is to achieve a critical mass of 30 or so companies
in the greater New Haven area within the next five years,'' said
Victor R. Budnick, president and executive director of Connecticut
Innovations. The agency's mission is similar to that of the
Boston-based Massachusetts Technology Development Corp., which has
helped back a burgeoning group of Route 128 companies over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   Originally started from the proceeds of state bond funds,
Connecticut Innovations is now self-sustaining, thanks in part to a
wildly successul bet on CuraGen Corp., New Haven's most successful
publicly traded biotech firm, which was formed with technology
licensed by Yale. Connecticut Innovations' $600,000 investment in
CuraGen is worth more than $20 million following a recent 2-1 stock
split.
</P>
<P>
   CuraGen, a genomics company founded in the basement of Yale
scientist Jonathan Rothberg in 1993, is using biology and
information technology for drug discovery. In its posh headquarters
overlooking Long Island Sound, where the quiet is broken only by
the humming of machines that analyze DNA, CuraGen is developing
technology to predict which drugs will cause toxic side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The 300-employee company, which competes with Millennium
Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Cambridge, tracks how drugs affect genes in
human tissue, particularly cells from the liver, kidney, and heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the right place at the right time, and we are seeing
a lot of interest by the state, Yale, and investors that was just
not there when I first started CuraGen,'' said Rothberg, who grew
up in New Haven and holds a doctorate in molecular biology from
Yale.
</P>
<P>
   The largest concentration of biotech and genomics companies is
in Science Park, in a bleak industrial area bounded on one side by
Yale Divinity School and on another by some of the poorest sections
of New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the companies in the park occupy buildings that once
turned out Winchester rifles and ammunition for U.S. Repeating Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to make shell casings here,'' said Richard S.
Judson, vice president of informatics for Genaissance
Pharmaceuticals Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In an airy, brightly lit converted factory, Genaissance uses
rows of high-speed machines to decode human and chimpanzee DNA in
order to help drug makers design more effective medicines tailored
to individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The science park was started 17 years ago as something of a
social experiment _ to provide the community with jobs in high-tech
fields. But over the years, the park deteriorated, getting a cold
shoulder from businesses and little attention from civic leaders.
It was also beset by vandals. In the last five years, the park has
begun a turnaround, attracting bioscience companies.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the industrial park will depend on whether it can
continue to attract biotech start-ups and build new facilities,
including a cafeteria and health club, said Alan Kessman. He is
president of Vion Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Science Park tenant
that's developing anticancer drugs, using technology licensed by
Yale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science Park may thrive if it becomes more employee
friendly,'' he added. ``There also has to be more laboratory
space,'' he said, referring to a shortage of such facilities in New
Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Carter J. Winstanley hopes to alleviate the shortage. He is
managing partner in a family-owned business in Concord, Mass., that
last month acquired a 550,000-square-foot building in downtown New
Haven. A block from the medical school, this former phone company
building will house Achillion and three other companies this year.
The nine-story facility, with paint peeling from the exterior, is
already outfitted with fiber-optic communication systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are planning a combination of laboratory space for biotech
start-ups and offices for information technology and
telecommunications start-ups,'' Winstanley said.
</P>
<P>
   While there are few critics of New Haven's growth, not everyone
is convinced that Yale's betting on entrepreneurs is the best
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university has realized that good ideas come from the
young start-ups, but we are reaching a transition point where Yale
must appeal to more experienced business-savvy companies rather
than rely on small players,'' said Gualberto Ruano, the founder and
chief executive of Genaissance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love New Haven and Science Park, and bioscience is here to
stay. But we are reaching the point where Yale needs to go beyond a
dependence on small start-ups.''

 DESPITE GOOD TIMES, JOBS STILL ELUDE SOME
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   The letter was short and to the point.
</P>
<P>
   The writer, a middle-aged Massachusetts man who had obtained a
master's degree in criminal justice but had yet to find a
professional position in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Despite talk that a booming economy and a labor shortage have
created more job vacancies than employers can fill, the letter
writer felt he had been left out of the equation:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Diane, I continuously read in The Boston Globe and trade
magazines how tight the labor market is throughout the United
States; how employers are offering free training and hiring bonuses
for new applicants. Am I missing something?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last May, I graduated from Suffolk University with a master's
of science degree in criminal justice. Since that time, I have
actively pursued job opportunities in that profession. I have
attended career counseling seminars, searched the Internet, spoken
with politicians, and networked at seminars sponsored by criminal
justice organizations. Unfortunately, my job search has not been
successful . . . sometimes I think I'm overqualified. Any
suggestions?'' (K.H.)
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, K.H. described himself as a
blue-collar worker who had delayed going to college for several
years after graduating high school. After obtaining a bachelor's
degree, he worked as a security guard while pursuing a master's. He
had assumed an advanced degree in criminal justice would help him
secure a position as a probation or parole officer.
</P>
<P>
   K.H. felt deceived. In the past, an uncle or father or brother
could get you a position, he said. But what happens when you don't
have those contacts?
</P>
<P>
   Because people move around so much, many of those old networks
or ties have been severed. As a result, colleges and universities
are expected to reach out to prospective employers. Certainly, they
cannot guarantee a job.
</P>
<P>
   I contacted Suffolk University's career placement office. Paul
Tanklefsky, director of career services and cooperative education,
said the university offers lifetime career assistance at not cost
to alumni, and suggested that K.H. come in. ``We are more than
willing to work with students and graduates to help them get to
where they want to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior employment specialist George Zeller said K.H. should look
more closely at his job search strategies and ``attack'' the hidden
job market. ``He should try speaking directly to people who
graduated from that program five to 10 years ago,'' he said.
``These people can keep their eyes open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second, he should look at organizations that have hired
graduates from the program in the past. Call those firms; bypass
the human resources person, and go directly to a manager or
supervisor in charge of hiring.'' The names of hiring managers
should be available at Suffolk's career center.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, K.H. may be competing against people in their 20s
and 30s with more experience. How to get around that? ``He should
say straight out that he is looking for an opportunity, an
entry-level position that permits advancement,'' noted Zeller, of
Jewish Vocational Services, which offers counseling and job search
assistance. ``He may need two resumes: one for a higher position
and one for situations where the employer is likely to assume that
the advanced degree makes him too qualified or too expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reader wrote: ``I am one of those legions of people on
the outside looking in. I see that you mentioned (in another
column) a team that helps the Commonwealth's pink-slipped legions
regain their footing, remake their lives, and find new work. How
can I contact them? Do they help writers, like myself, find new
work? A phone number or a contact would be extremely helpful.
Freelancing . . . doesn't pay the bills.'' _ N.B.
</P>
<P>
   These readers are hardly the first to question whether an
ongoing labor shortage is benefiting all members of the nation's
work force. Such cynicism, though based solely on personal
experience, is justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the economy is operating at full employment levels and,
among college graduates, the rate of unemployment is extremely
low,'' noted Paul Harrington, an economist at Northeastern
University's Center for Labor Market Studies.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not true for all graduates, he added. The highest
rate of demand continues to be for graduates with business degrees
or science and technical backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   So what does this mean for all the other college graduates?
Often, it means underemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 10 years, the fastest-growing sector of the work
force is expected to be the service industry. So there is a paradox
here, since demand will continue to be concentrated in the two
opposite poles of the employment line _ the sciences and high-tech
sector at the top, and low-wage retail jobs at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   So pronounced is this growth that of the 20.3 million jobs to be
added to the US work force between 1998 and 2008, 19.1 million of
them will be service producing, according to the federal
government. By 2008, service sector jobs will account for three out
of every four US jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said even though the overall unemployment rate for
all college graduates is below 2 percent and will probably remain
low, underemployment continues to be a problem for these workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still substantial numbers of college graduates who
are employed outside their fields of study or in jobs that do not
require a college education, or low-paying jobs,'' he said. ``In
any given year, 10 to 15 percent of all college graduates are in
positions that typically do not require a college degree.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do? Get trained in an area where demand is high.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, a number of universities have targeted
new programs to such employees. Boston University, Worcester
Polytechnic Institute, and Northeastern each have programs that
help people in nontechnical fields find work in information
technology-related fields, where jobs are plentiful, wages are
good, and demand is expected to increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that there is a huge shortage of skilled people to
work in the IT world, and so we got together with people in the
industry and asked how we could design a program that would suit
both their needs and a college graduate's needs,'' said Susan K.
Moulton, director of corporate outreach at Northeastern.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Information Networks Professional Program, this
training is being offered during the day. The 25-week program
begins May 22, three days a week at the Burlington campus, from 9
a.m. to 1 p.m. The cost: $10,000. However, financial aid is
available. There is also an evening program for people in the
industry who wish to keep their skills up to date.
</P>
<P>
   The networks program also offers a seven-week primer for those
who know nothing about computers but wish to break into the field.
Moulton calls it a ``jump-start primer.'' This training begins
March 27 in Burlington. Moulton said last week that upon completion
of the training, participants will be placed in internships and
will receive help with the job search. ``We have an advisory
committee made up of companies that will be eager to find out who
these folks are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One new training program, Aquent SpringBoard (www
</P>
<P>
   .aquent.com), is being offered free by Aquent, a Boston IT and
computer graphics and design staffing firm with offices around the
country. Like many other US firms, Aquent is facing increased
demand for information technology professionals but is finding few
qualified takers in a field where unemployment is a scant 1.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aquent screens applicants and then it picks 24 people for two
separate monthly training sessions,'' said Mariela Azcuy, a company
spokeswoman. ``The company will fly them to Boston if they are from
out of town and will house and feed them. During the training
period, they receive intensive instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they graduate, Aquent places them in a job and they are
required to stay with Aquent for at least six months,'' she
continued. ``After that, they can continue to work through Aquent
or they can go out on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Azcuy says pay varies from $25,000 to $50,000 or more for those
with the right skills. Will such training help reader number two
land a permament job? I can't say. It might help him get his foot
in the door. But once there, it will probably take more training to
advance.

SPORTS MAGAZINES TAP A NEW MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   March is a big month for women's sports, and a good time to find
out whether women's sports magazines will finally take off.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA women's basketball tournament and high school
tournaments are played this month, and women's hockey teams compete
for championships. March also marks the start of six other sports
played in college and by some high schools _ softball, crew,
lacrosse, track, golf, and tennis. And women, much like men, are
gearing up for the warmer months of the year, concerned about
shaping up for a more active existence.
</P>
<P>
   After testing the market for two years and being placed on hold
temporarily, Time Inc. chose to begin publishing Sports Illustrated
for Women on a bi-monthly basis beginning with the March/April
edition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout 1998 we did a lot of focus groups, a lot of
research and we studied a lot of e-mail that came in after our two
test issues were published in 1997,'' said the editor, Sandy
Bailey. ``The common denominator for the women who read us most was
that they played sports, they weren't just spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not just, `I want to read a great big story about a
star athlete. It was, `I'd read it if it was inspirational to me,
and motivated me to do my sport.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the results in circulation and advertising, Sports
Illustrated for Women eventually might be published monthly or 10
times per year.
</P>
<P>
   The cover of the bi-monthly launch, now on the newsstands,
features Anna Kournikova, in a photographic expression of what
Sports Illustrated for Women strives to be about: providing
information on training for athletes, equipment, nutrition, health,
fashion, and beauty.
</P>
<P>
   So do not expect to read about Kournikova's trials and
tribulations as one of the Top 10 money winners on the WTA tour
last year, and certainly nothing about her engagement to the NHL
star Pavel Bure. Instead, Kournikova joins four other prominent
women athletes _ the LPGA's Kelli Kuehne, Olympic sprinter Inger
Miller, cyclist Alison Dunlap and Olympic swimmer Jenny Thompson _
in offering tips about workouts geared specifically for
participants in their sports.
</P>
<P>
   Although the issue features a report on figure-skating gold
medalist Tara Lipinski's fledgling career as an actress, the piece
deals largely with the motivational and emotional aspects of her
twin pursuits and how they compare, while discounting some of the
more gossipy angles of a prominent life in sports and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our target is the 18- to 34-year-old woman, even younger, say
a 16- or 17-year-old preparing for college, who is interested in
sports as a participant,'' Bailey said. ``As we did all of the
testing and research, what we realized is that no one else was
really doing a book like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The planning for Sports Illustrated for Women actually began in
1996. The two test issues were published in 1997. But then the
concept was then shelved throughout 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of SI changed. Don Elliman moved on and Mike
Klingensmith came in from Entertainment Weekly,'' said Bailey,
explaining the delay. ``But perhaps the biggest factor was the
startup of ESPN The Magazine, and the need for us at SI to really
concentrate on the core SI.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, the wait was probably a good thing. We were not
nearly as focused on what Sports Illustrated for Women was, and how
we are different from the men's magazine, as we are now,
certainly.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the success of the WNBA and the breakthrough of women's
team sports spurred last summer by the Women's World Cup, the
concept for the magazine was pulled off the shelf for four
``special editions'' published in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers that are indicators of success for us are all
strongly positive, and even stronger since 1999,'' Bailey said.
``Now, one out of every two and a half women played a varsity sport
in high school. When we started the planning in 1996, it was one
out of three. That compares to back in 1971 when it was one out of
27.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Sports Illustrated for Women taken the bi-monthly
plunge, the circulation of a competitor, Conde Nast's Women's
Sports &AMP; Fitness, has jumped from 475,000 in January 1999 to
650,000 this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the largest percentage increase of any Conde Nast
publication in the past eight years,'' said Mistrella Egan, its
director of public relations. ``Women's sports are getting more
attention than ever, and we reap the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we changed our title in June 1998 and added the word
fitness, it really helped us take off. Women really identify with
fitness and they see fitness and sport as one in the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another, smaller publication, Amy Love's Real Sports circulates
bimonthly to about 150,000 readers nationwide. Based in San Jose,
Calif., it is part of the ADL, Inc. publishing group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically just the three of us, nationally,'' Love said.
``And we all have different approaches to women's sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the magazines can survive is an open question,
considering that they still need to firmly establish themselves in
the market. But people at both magazines say they ultimately see
more that is complimentary than in conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their demographics are a bit lower, both younger and less
prosperous,'' Egan said. ``We celebrate the active lifestyle,
including travel and fitness and features on athletes who are
women. They are more sport- and participant-oriented, with a heavy
emphasis on the high school or college athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers will play a major role in the magazines' success or
failure. A Massachusetts athletic shoe manufacturer, New Balance,
advertises in both.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, the thing that attracted us was the equity
of the SI name,'' said John Donovan, New Balance's manager of
marketing services. ``Second, it's targeting the kind of audience
we want to target, very active women, 18 to 35. She runs. She plays
sports. She's into fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is a good investment for what we are hoping the
payoff eventually will be.''

FOR THE REVOLUTION, A NEW SEASON, OLD QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution are going where no area
first-division professional soccer team has gone before. They will
begin their fifth season when they trek to Fort Lauderdale to meet
the Miami Fusion Saturday, surpassing the modern-day staying power
of the Boston Rovers (1967), Minutemen ('74-76), and New England
Tea Men ('78-80).
</P>
<P>
   But despite the stability provided by strong local ownership,
persistent fan interest, and Major League Soccer's foundation, the
Revolution's prospects for this season are nearly as mysterious as
they were in their first campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Fernando Clavijo and director of soccer operations Sunil
Gulati have taken strong steps to place their stamp on the team,
and the Revolution have prospered in the preseason, compiling a
5-2-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many questions remain. Clavijo is seeking to present a style
of play that will blend the flair of Leonel Alvarez, Wolde Harris,
Eduardo Hurtado, and Mauricio Ramos with the directness of John
Harkes and Ivan McKinley. He also hopes to rejuvenate the team with
youngsters such as Shaker Asad, Adam Eyre, Rusty Pierce, William
Sunsing, and Fabio Zuniga.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see a change in style,'' Clavijo said Tuesday. ``It
will be a very attractive way of playing. I don't like to lose the
ball because it takes a lot of hard work to get it back. So you
will see the team keep possession of the ball most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous Revolution coaches have announced similar intentions,
then were unable to produce the proper chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, you will see the team win a lot of games,'' Clavijo
said. ``I want them to go out and work hard and give everything
they have. Every game they play has to be like the last game they
are ever going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Hurtado are capable of matching the departed strike
force of Joe-Max Moore (Everton, England) and Giovanni Savarese
(Viterbese, Italy), though Harris will likely start as a lone
striker in a 4-5-1 alignment Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The midfield will revolve around the creative instincts of
Ramos, who is expected to provide a spark the way countryman Marco
Etcheverry does for D.C. United. Ramos is an uninhibited marksman
from distance and likes to combine a short passing game in midfield
with long-range distribution to the wings.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive midfield support will be provided by Alvarez and
Harkes, the strongest leaders on the team. The Alvarez-Harkes-Ramos
midfield triangle will set the tempo.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest questions, though, are in outside midfield positions
and in central defense.
</P>
<P>
   Midfielders Imad Baba and Johnny Torres have been inconsistent,
but Clavijo has faith in them and they responded during the
preseason. The outside backs will be Ted Chronopoulos, who has
played 100 games for the Revolution, and Pierce, at least until
Mike Burns (groin injury) recovers. Burns has captained the team in
102 of its 130 MLS games.
</P>
<P>
   Clavijo used seven central defenders before settling on Brian
Dunseth and McKinley, who were paired briefly during the
Revolution's most disastrous season, 1998. Clavijo is not
comfortable with the situation, and he is pursuing Juan Samuel
Caballero, a 25-year-old Honduran who made a strong impression in
the CONCACAF Champions Cup and Gold Cup tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution also must overcome the stigma of past failures.
They won only 16 games in regulation time in the last two seasons,
and many of those wins resulted from the scoring of Moore and the
goalkeeping of Walter Zenga.
</P>
<P>
   Keeper Jeff Causey will not come close to Zenga's level but will
provide consistency. Jurgen Sommer, acquired from Columbus for a
third-round draft pick Tuesday, is expected to become the starter
once he recovers from injury. Sommer, who has played in England for
the US national team, has had cruciate ligament surgery on both
knees in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a risk but it's a good risk to take,'' Clavijo said.
``He is one of the best goalkeepers in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, the Revolution have players with national team
experience: Alvarez (Colombia), Baba, Burns, Dan Calichman,
Chronopoulos, Harkes, Harris (Jamaica), Hurtado (Ecuador), McKinley
(South Africa), Ramos (Bolivia), Sunsing (Costa Rica). Dunseth is a
US Olympic team candidate and Jamar Beasley, Carlos Parra, Pierce,
and Torres have played for US junior national teams. The Revolution
have always had sufficient talent but never a winning combination.
</P>
<P>
   And, as in the past, the team is setting its sights high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to say anything about winning the
championship,'' Clavijo said. ``Attitude is the key and the
attitude of the players who aren't playing is the key. It will take
20-22 guys to win the championship.''

RHETORIC CRANKS UP

<P>
   TAIPEI _ Unfortunately for the ruling Nationalist Party,
23-year-old Iris Liu speaks for a lot of people in Taiwan in
explaining why she supports the opposition party candidate in the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nationalist Party has been in power too long,'' she said.
``We need a new party, with new views.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 years of political domination by the Nationalists,
also known as the Kuomingtang, or KMT, could come to an end
Saturday as Taiwanese go to the polls to elect a president in what
has been a highly-charged and extremely close three-way race.
</P>
<P>
   As the opposition candidate gains momentum in the final days of
the campaign, with fresh endorsements from prominent academics and
business people, the Nationalists have ratcheted up the rhetoric,
warning voters that economic and political instability could result
if anyone other than Vice President Lien Chan is elected.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Taiwan's stock market suffered the largest single-day
decline in its history, falling 6.6 percent in what some analysts
said was a reflection of fears of a victory by the Democratic
Progressive Party's Chen Shui-bian. The Nationalists have portrayed
Chen, a former Taipei mayor, as someone who would provoke China
into war and destabilize Taiwan's economy if he were president.
</P>
<P>
   For people under 40, who make up the bulk of Chen's supporters,
such talk does not ring true. To them, Chen will solve what they
see as the biggest problem in Taiwan: corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Nationalist party is completely rotten,'' said
Patty Lai, 30. ``They have money. They have power. They don't care
about the people. We need reform, even if that means instability.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainland China's repeated recent threats to use force if a
pro-independence candidate wins also do not scare supporters of the
Democratic Progressive Party, even though its party platform
advocates independence for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If China is going to take military action, they'll do it no
matter who is elected,'' said Liu, who finished a degree in
international relations last year and hopes to go to the United
States for graduate studies.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nationalist's message has sunk in for some people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want the election to make Taiwan more chaotic,'' said
Shu Lin Hsieh, 32, who supports Lien. ``I'm quite scared. Taiwan is
prosperous. We have everything we need. I want stability.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalists have been working hard to get the youth vote,
holding break-dancing rallies in the streets of Taipei and
distributing pamphlets saying it's not shameful to vote for the
ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Although corruption is one of the top issues for Taiwanese
voters according to polls, relations with mainland China overshadow
just about everything on this island of 22 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalist Party, once the ruling party of China, fled to
Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to the communists. It ruled
Taiwan with an iron fist for decades, jailing political dissidents
_ including members of the Democratic Progressive Party _ and using
martial law for almost 40 years to curb free expression.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing still regards Taiwan as a wayward province to be
reunified with the motherland. But as Taiwan's economy flourishes
and its democracy becomes one of the most vibrant in Asia, native
Taiwanese feel more and more distant from their communist brethren
across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
   For people like Fred Chiou, who support eventual peaceful
unification with China, Lien is the candidate who will most likely
maintain harmonious relations with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taiwan's safety is the most important issue. There's a lot of
pressure from China. We need a president who can negotiate with
China. For Asia and the rest of the world, it would also be
beneficial,'' said Chiou, who headed the Chinese Community
Federation of Atlanta, an umbrella group of 14 organizations, until
earlier this month when he left Atlanta to join an Internet
start-up company in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chen has pledged he will not declare independence and
even hopes to visit the mainland as a trust-building measure, many
voters doubt his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're afraid of Chen Shui-bian, but we don't believe Lien
Chan,'' said Chuen Huei Wang, who teaches economics at a college in
Taipei. ``He (Lien) is old government, old politics, with many
money scandals.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang, 40, joined the Nationalist Party when he was just 15
because his father was a long-time member, but he said he quit 15
years ago because he was disgusted with it. His vote is going to
James Soong, a longtime Nationalist insider and former Taiwan
governor who broke away from the party last year to run an
independent campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
   David Yu, chairman of Summit National Bank in Atlanta, said he
assumed most of his business and professional acquaintances in
Taipei would be Lien Chan supporters but was surprised to find they
are going for Soong. Like many Taiwanese living overseas, Yu holds
dual citizenship and returned to Taipei this week to vote. He
declined to say which candidate he supports.
</P>
<P>
   With just days remaining, all three candidates are holding
massive rallies with tens of thousands of people throughout Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Negative campaigning has also climbed to new heights, with no
insult too low to sling. Lien recently called Soong a person with a
``wolve's heart and dog's lung,'' meaning a person of no integrity.
Both Soong and Chen camps blamed Monday's stock tumble on
manipulation by the Nationalist party, which controls many of the
country's financial institutions. Some of Chen's relatives held a
press conference Tuesday calling him a liar and cheat.
</P>
<P>
   The level of negative campaigning is far beyond that in the
United States, said Yu.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not really debating the issues facing the country,''
he said. ``They try to dig up dirt on each other, which is not very
healthy. Unfortunately, the voters pay a lot of attention to the
negative campaigning.''

   KEY DATES IN TAIWAN'S DEVELOPMENT
</P>
<P>
   -1945: Taiwan, which had been ruled by the Japanese for half a
century, is returned to China's
</P>
<P>
   control.
</P>
<P>
   -1949: Republic of China government relocates from mainland to
Taiwan as a result of civil war on mainland. Government enacts
decrees limiting personal freedoms and restricting formation of
opposition political parties.
</P>
<P>
   -1971: China's seat in the United Nations is taken away from the
ROC and given to the mainland People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   -1979: United States withdraws its diplomatic recognition of the
ROC. Political opposition forms a coalition and begins publication
of Formosa magazine, mouthpiece for Taiwan's democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   -1986: Policy of liberalization begins.
</P>
<P>
   -1987: Martial law is abolished, and new freedoms are granted to

</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN'S PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES
</P>
<P>
   -Lien Chan, candidate of the long dominant Nationalist Party,
also known as the Kuomingtang or KMT. Lien is currently Taiwan's
vice president. He has spoken of moving relations between Taiwan
and the mainland to greater mutual confidence and contact.
</P>
<P>
   -James Soong, popular independent candidate, former Nationalist
Party superstar and former Taiwan provincial governor. He says
China-Taiwan relations should be ``quasi-international'' rather
than ``state to state'' and envisages signing a 30-year non-
aggression treaty with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   -Chen Shui-bian, candidate of the Democratic Progressive Party.
Chen has moderated his views on China by pledging not to declare
independence unilaterally, but his party includes many independence
supporters. The former mayor of Taipei has offered to journey to
Beijing to talk face-to-face with China's leaders on any issue.

SWEENEY PONDERS UPCOMING FREE AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He's 33 years old, a terrific skater, and one of the
few Bruins who has had a season about which he can be happy. He's
also a mobile, physical defenseman who is due to become an
unrestricted free agent on July 1, so it was no surprise that Don
Sweeney's name was being bandied about as the trade deadline
approached.
</P>
<P>
   However, the 3 p.m. threshold came and went and Sweeney remained
a Bruin. After the departures of icon Ray Bourque and veteran wing
Rob DiMaio, it wasn't a shock that the Bruins held onto one of
their few veterans, one who has played his entire 12-year NHL
career in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens on July 1, when Sweeney can walk away? Sweeney
said his agent, Mark Witkin, and Bruins president/general manager
Harry Sinden had lunch Monday but it was more to quell trade rumors
than to hammer out a new deal. Assistant GM Mike O'Connell said the
Bruins very much want to keep Sweeney, but with his first chance at
unrestricted free agency, the defenseman is in the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have asked me about contracts and trades,'' said
Sweeney. ``I've said the same thing since Day One of training camp:
I only want to focus on this year. Obviously, we've had a lot of
things go on. We're not out of a playoff race. We've got the
excitement of winning a couple of games and we could've probably
won all three (of the last three), and that is all I'm focused
on.''
</P>
<P>
   With two more teams set to join the league, enlarging it to a
whopping 30, Sweeney's services could be in very high demand. As
the father of twin sons, he said, part of his decision will be
based around his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've enjoyed the time away from the rink moreso than ever with
my kids and my wife,'' he said. ``I'd have to reevaluate with her
what her preference would be. I don't have anything else to go on.
I haven't been presented with anything so I'll have to take things
as they come. If they present me a contract, I'm obviously going to
get a chance to evaluate that. If they don't and somebody else
does, then I'll have to evaluate that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been in a free agent situation. I don't know what
comes next, believe it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls Boston home year-round, he likes the lifestyle here,
the city, the fans, the team. He hasn't spent a lot of time on
possible scenarios down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys would rate that as a financial decision, some guys
would rate that as an opportunity to go to a warm city, there are
all kinds of things to evaluate,'' he said. ``I've been very
comfortable here. It's not like I haven't understood my role or
position or enjoyed that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we're going through a playoff stretch here but we've got
an evaluation period going on here as well. I think that's been
openly admitted. I read (owner Jeremy Jacobs's quotes) and they're
going through an evaluation in terms of anyone involved in this
organization. So there is going to be some sorting out.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you look at it, it appears to be a win-win
situation for Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly an interesting time,'' he said. ``I'd be the
first to admit that because I've never been in the position before.
I'm going to have to take time when all that stuff sorts itself
out. During the course of the year, it just hasn't been that time.
The Bruins have implied they would like to try to sign me but I
have no comment on the contract side of things because I haven't
heard or done anything about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he'd like to go to a contender _ as his mentor and
friend Bourque did _ Sweeney said of course he wants to win,
everyone wants to.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the excitement of just winning a couple of
games,'' he said. ``It does a lot for the psyche of everybody. But
I like things that are in front of me that I can analyze and
process. My options are what they are.''

DICKENMAN MAKES A DIFFERENCE FOR CENTRAL CONNECTICUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. _ Stand-up comedians of the world, breathe
easy. Central Connecticut State fourth-year coach Howie Dickenman
has a flair for one-liners, but guiding the program from a
laughingstock 4-22 finish two seasons ago to this year's NCAA
tournament is proof he's too exceptional a basketball mind to
consider another line of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know who we used to recruit against? Nobody,'' said
Dickenman with a raspy, low-toned delivery that is vintage
Dangerfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd ask my assistant, `Who's involved with this kid?' He'd
say, `Us and nobody.' I'd say, `How are we doing?' He'd say, `We're
like 50-50.' We think we lost a couple of kids to nobody. They're
at Stop &AMP; Shop now, packing bags or something. People say, `How do
you lose a kid to nobody?' I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Central standout player and University of Connecticut
assistant coach is now getting the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   After posting the second-best turnaround in Division 1 last
season (19-13), CCSU captured the Northeast Conference title and
its first NCAA tournament bid this season, culminating a 25-5
campaign that included a school record-tying 15-game winning streak
and a 54-50 triumph over Providence for the school's first win over
a Big East opponent in 17 tries.
</P>
<P>
   The 15th-seeded Blue Devils meet second-seeded Iowa State (29-4)
in the first round of the Midwest Regional Friday in Minneapolis at
approximately 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome, many feel this year's campaign is the
start of something big at Central, a program filled with players
overlooked by most other schools who have come together to carve a
niche in a state that is UConn crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Entering this season, the last time Central had sold out a game
at 3,200-seat Detrick Gymnasium was during the 1984-85 campaign,
when the University of Bridgeport came to town with Manute Bol.
This season, the team not only had an overflow crowd of 3,275 for
its regular-season finale against Quinnipiac but led the NEC in
home attendance (2,249 average).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got people calling in advance for tickets. The school's
on a high, and now the state's been following us,'' said Dickenman.
``We're the new kid on the block, going to the NCAA. UConn's an
automatic every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit Dickenman, an intense, emotional mentor, for turning
around the program in its 14th season in Division 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils are ninth in the nation in rebounding margin
(plus 6.3 per game) and fifth in field-goal percentage defense
(37.6 percent). While averaging 45 percent shooting from the floor,
Central has four players in its rotation averaging at least 10
points a game and five averaging at least five boards a game.
</P>
<P>
   Central is led by senior point guard and NEC player of the year
Rick Mickens (17.7 ppg, 2.8 assists), who grew up in nearby
Newington a UConn fan. He didn't receive any other scholarship
offers and opted for Central Connecticut rather than a walk-on role
at Storrs.
</P>
<P>
   He became one of Dickenman's first recruits, along with Victor
Payne, a senior forward who is the first player from Barbados to
receive a Division 1 scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Those two, now cocaptains, helped provide the nucleus for a
program Dickenman was brought in to help turn around after it had
endured 11 straight losing seasons _ including two four-win
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   His hiring came less than two months after Central endured one
of its lowest points as a Division 1 team _ a 116-46 loss to
Connecticut at Hartford. ``I was one of the first ones out of the
UConn locker room that day,'' said Dickenman, embarrassed by his
alma mater's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet turning the program around was anything but easy. There was
a 9-13 first season, then the 4-22 debacle. The latter season,
Central was the youngest team in Division 1. Attendance averaged
less than 500 a game, and the team failed to qualify for a
Northeast Conference tournament the school hosted.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest point, said Dickenman, came during the second year,
when he had to put a 117-75 loss to Long Island University behind
him to speak at a social engagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 31 turnovers; I remember 31 because people in the
second and third row were ducking all day because of balls we were
throwing out of bounds,'' said Dickenman.
</P>
<P>
   ``One lady got hit in the fourth row, broke her glasses. Two
guys had to go to the hospital . . . I'm kidding a little bit
there, but you got to be careful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started three or four freshmen that day. They pressed us
baseline to baseline. It was like hot potato: `I don't want it; you
take it. No, I don't want it; you take it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You really cherish wins when you don't win much,'' added
Dickenman. ``I remember when we were at UConn, we won about 30
games a number of times. You don't cherish 30. But when you win
four, whoa boy, you love every one of those four. They're
priceless.''
</P>
<P>
   The team turned things around last season when it won its first
four games, a first for the school at the Division 1 level. It lost
in the NEC final to Mount St. Mary's but had a taste of things to
come.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of Fairfield transfer John Tice, a blue-collar
point guard who had helped the Stags to an NEC title and near upset
of North Carolina in the NCAA tournament in 1998, many figured
Central _ the closest Division 1 program to ESPN's headquarters
(less than 15 minutes) _ had the toughness and experience to
achieve a breakthrough season and gain notice.
</P>
<P>
   Then the setbacks struck.
</P>
<P>
   First, the team could not use the gym for two weeks during
preseason because the floor had been resurfaced poorly and had to
be redone. Then the bleachers, which were supposed to be redone in
August, weren't taken care of until the latter part of October,
forcing Central to move an exhibition game to a local high school.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest blow came when the season began: Payne and
Mickens were suspended five games by the NCAA for reportedly
misusing their scholarship funds to purchase books for five
nonscholarship athletes and one nonathlete. John Tice and Harvey
Van Stein were also involved and received three-game bans.
</P>
<P>
   The school initially took steps to handle the situation
internally; the students were given books, and the players had to
do community service before returning to the team. None had tried
to gain monetarily from the venture, but rather had been trying to
help fellow student-athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the NCAA upheld its sanctions. ``After the suspensions
were upheld, it felt as if everything was going wrong,'' said
Payne. ``But we looked at the positives: A lot of people played
while were were out, and they got experience in the long run. We
knew we could count on them when we came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Central spread the suspensions over the first six games. The
only contest that all the players missed was at La Salle, a 70-60
loss.
</P>
<P>
   When the Blue Devils returned to full strength, they were a more
determined bunch, as evidenced by their win at Providence. It was a
major boost to the program and to the league, which ended a 36-game
losing streak against Big East competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when people identified us as being a good basketball
team,'' said Dickenman.
</P>
<P>
   That was the second of 15 consecutive victories, a streak that
at the time tied Central with Long Beach State for the longest in
Division 1. The streak was snapped by Fairleigh Dickinson in
mid-February and a loss to Robert Morris followed, but Central
regrouped to win three tournament games by an average of 11.6
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning of the year,'' said Mickens, ``we knew that
as long as we played up to our potential, I had the utmost
confidence'' the team would reach such heights.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils returned home from the NEC final at 4:30 a.m.
and received a police escort from Interstate 84, where they were
greeted on campus by more than 200 fans, who braved the cold to
welcome the winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This basketball team, we are humble and appreciative,'' said
Payne. ``We know where we came from. We still hug people we don't
even know.''
</P>
<P>
   No one at Central has any illusions about what this team has
accomplished in comparison with the defending national champions.
Connecticut is, and alway will be, UConn territory. But people at
Central are happy with the spotlight they're basking in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Connecticut basketball is the team to follow,'' said Mickens.
``They're big-time college basketball. We're just trying to play
hard and we have our fans, too. We have a lot of pride, and we just
go out and win basketball games.''

&HT;     THE END IS NIGH FOR AMERICA'S LOVEFEST WITH IRISH FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Movies about Ireland, elbowing into America's theaters year
after year after year, may have finally elbowed themselves out the
door.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade more than a dozen movies have been filmed
in Ireland, including box office hits ``Waking Ned Devine'' and
``The Commitments.'' But the three that debuted this year haven't
made much of an impression. Movies about the Emerald Isle may be
running out of audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela's Ashes,'' at the top of the New York Times bestseller
list for 40 weeks, did not last long in the theaters. Neither did
``Agnes Browne,'' the story of an Irish widow juggling a big
family. And ``The Closer You Get,'' a tale of Donegal men
advertising for American wives, may not last long _ it was slapped
by critics for presenting yet another stereotypical view of
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than enough stereotypes of Ireland floating
around. For a country of 3.7 million people, it has claimed an
inordinate amount of attention from Hollywood and London. A casual
glance through a film encyclopedia finds more than 60 movies about
Ireland since the 1935 version of ``The Informer,'' which won four
Oscars for its portrayal of Dublin as home to intrigue, betrayal,
zealots, misfits, thick drinking and cosmic sadness.
</P>
<P>
   Movieland's image of the Irish hasn't changed much since 1935.
Dublin is seen as odd, from ``Ulysses'' in 1967 and ``Portrait of
the Artist as a Young Man'' in 1979 to John Huston's honestly
affecting ``The Dead'' in 1987. In the British-produced Barrytown
Trilogy from author Roddy Doyle in the 1990s _ ``The Commitments,''
``The Snapper'' and ``The Van'' _ the view of Dublin is best
described in ``Commitments'' as ``the Irish are the blacks of
Europe, Dubliners are the blacks of Ireland and Northside Dubliners
are the blacks of Dublin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Commitments'' also philosophizes that ``the Irish wouldn't
be shooting the arse off each other if they had soul,'' and ``We're
a Third World country, what can you do?'' Other thoughts on the
Irish come from ``Ryan's Daughter'' (``Talk _ this whole cursed
country will capsize with talk''), ``The Informer'' (``Why must we
be killing one another? What good will it do?'') and ``Cal''
(``There are bad bastards on both sides'').
</P>
<P>
   Movie views of Irish life, particularly rural life, careen
between the bleak and giddy. Giddiness dominates John Ford's
classic 1953 movie about Inisfree, ``The Quiet Man,'' and Disney's
1959 hit, ``Darby O'Gill and the Little People'' _ their
unrelenting images of feisty, lovable villagers make Brigadoon seem
like Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
   Ford rolled out the biggest Irish American names for ``The Quiet
Man,'' including Maureen O'Hara and Barry Fitzgerald, whose
one-liners have never been topped (``Impetuous,'' he says, looking
at the broken remains of a honeymoon bed). In the wake of ``Quiet
Man,'' the Irish villager has gone from feisty and lovable to dumb
and hateful (``Ryan's Daughter,'' 1970) to dumb and lovable
(``Waking Ned Devine,'' ``The Closer You Get''). While offering its
own variations on those themes, the 1997 U.S.-Irish production,
``The Butcher Boy'' goes one step further, suggesting villagers are
so crazy that a whacked-out, throat-cutting, red-haired youngster
can walk among them as easy as you please, carrying the guilt of
betrayal, zealots, misfits and cosmic sadness on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Butcher Boy,'' filmed in County Monaghan, centers on a
snow-thick village in 1962, its craziness played to a background of
``Mack the Knife'' on Hawaiian guitar. John F. Kennedy shares wall
space with the Virgin Mary, just as Elvis would share wall space
with the Pope in ``The Commitments'' 30 years later. ``Butcher
Boy'' also made good use of the current generation of Irish-movie
actors, including Ian Hart, the lead in ``The Closer You Get.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Closer You Get'' is in the best carpetbagging tradition of
Irish movies. Produced, directed and written by an Italian, Scot
and Englishman, it follows in the steps of ``Waking Ned Devine,''
``Dancing at Lughnasa'' and ``The Matchmaker,'' wallowing in a
down-to-earth Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Locations manager Stephen Killen says he was looking for a
village that recalled the Scottish fishing town in ``Local Hero.''
He settled on Kincaslough, a coastal village in Donegal, but it was
altogether too clean and modern-looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the houses were very bright and just didn't fit in
with the feel that we were after,'' said production designer Tom
McCullagh. ``The whole village had to have a kind of weariness, a
tiredness to it, like nothing ever changed there that much.''
McCullagh's crew ``painted everything down a few shades,'' covered
the center line of the town's road with gravel and changed the
church interior because ``it was a bit too extravagant for the feel
that we were after.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking liberties with the look of Ireland is nothing new to
filmmakers, who have also taken liberties with their ``Irish''
leads. Britain's James Mason is an IRA kingpin in the ``Odd Man
Out'' (1947), a surprisingly even-handed British look at the Irish
Republican Army. Scottish poster boy Sean Connery is an Irish
farmer in ``Darby O'Gill,'' Helen Mirren, the Briton later to star
in the crime series ``Prime Suspect,'' is an Irish Catholic in
``Cal.'' American Chris O'Donnell is all Irish in ``Circle of
Friends,'' a variation on ``The Group'' set in the postcard
villages of County Kilkenny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan's Daughter'' is the prime example of pseudo-Irish actors
moving through an Irish landscape _ in this case the Dingle
peninsula. Trevor Howard, the ranking officer in every other
British war film, plays a hardscrabble Catholic priest. Britain's
Sarah Miles is Ryan's daughter, while John Mills, Sir John Mills,
plays the village idiot. Leo McKern of ``Rumpole of the Bailey''
fame is the town barkeep _ yet another guilt-ridden betrayer of the
Irish dream.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Darby O'Gill,'' the standard for Irish pap and twaddle,
Albert Sharpe plays Darby as a kind of Gabby Hayes from
Knocknasheega. The movie is full of stereotypes _ dancing
leprechauns, shrieking banshees, lies told over a glassful of
Guinness, Connery singing about pretty colleens while Janet Munro
smiles hard enough to break her face _ but it is also a pleasant,
optimistic look at the Auld Sod, the flip side of all the IRA
movies made in the 1980s and 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Cal'' in 1984 to ``In the Name of the Father'' in 1993 to
``Michael Collins'' in 1996 and ``The Boxer'' a year later, each
IRA film has had an ax to grind. There's agreement the killing
should stop, but once that's said there's no agreement at all _
much like the on-again, off-again negotiations over the future of
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   To balance the long run of bombs-and-blood films about the
North, movieland turned to a more innocent Ireland, cashing in with
the giddy ``Waking Ned Devine.'' ``The Closer You Get'' is trying
to follow up with much the same formula, but it could be too late.
</P>
<P>
   The American capacity for Irish movies may, at long last, be
filled to the brim. Wobbling between the ever-bleak and the
always-giddy, between ``Angela's Ashes'' and ``The Closer You
Get,'' Americans may have had enough of cinematic Ireland for a
while.

   HIGH-TECH-VISAS (Washington) _ A bipartisan coalition of House
members on Wednesday introduced legislation that would boost the
ceiling on visas for foreigners with high-tech skills to 200,000
over the next three years. This year, the lid stands at 150,000. It
would be the second lifting of the cap on so-called H1-B workers in
two years and is similar to legislation moving through the Senate.

8 WEB SITES MAKE TRAVEL PLANNING SIMPLE

 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the
``t'' travel news and ``l'' lifestyle news files.)  
 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER  
 &HT;    There are hundreds of Web sites that claim to make travel
better, cheaper and faster. But no one needs to visit all of them
to plan a trip. The fact is that many of these sites duplicate each
other, others are blatantly commercial and many are just not very
good.
 &HT;    To keep life simple on the Internet, here are eight travel sites
worth bookmarking. They each do one thing very well. But
paradoxically, in doing so, they're the veritable Pandora's box
that a good Web site should also be.
 TRAVELOCITY.COM AND EXPEDIA.COM  
 &HT;    The first thing everyone needs in their travel tool kit is a
proactive site, so start with an online travel agency.
 &HT;    Travelocity.com and Expedia.com are the best of the bunch. Both
of them are easy to use, with relatively uncluttered home pages and
clear graphics. They have information that a user can access at a
glance, without spending a lot of time trying to figure out the
site. At this stage of research, travelers need less to read, not
more.
 &HT;    Both Travelocity.com and Expedia.com have a rare and welcome
professionalism. Their fare-finders, the meat and potatoes of such
sites, allows users to plan round-trip flights, as well as
itineraries with multicity stops.
 &HT;    They give users the power to quickly change the time, date and
airport, and they come loaded with the fares of all the major
carriers, which saves travelers the considerable trouble of
visiting half a dozen airline-owned Web sites in the hunt for the
lowest fare.
 &HT;    Travelocity's ``Been There,'' a section written by Travelocity
employees, is like getting a postcard from a friend reporting on
their trip and brings a welcome narrative voice. Their ``Mountain
Resort Guide'' gives instant fares and snow depths from a home city
to ski destinations.
 &HT;    Users can quickly read the different airline's baggage
restrictions at a glance and learn how to grab the seat of their
choice when they book a flight.
 &HT;    Expedia's Fare Calendar allows users to look months ahead to
find the cheapest fares between two airports. The site's Airport
Survival Guide is an airport-by-airport guide that shows
restaurants, gate locations and airport hotels.
 &HT;    Expedia.com also offers a fare-finder to a vast range of hotels,
thanks to the company's recent acquisition of travelscape.com. They
now have access to thousands of hotels at so-called ``preferred
rates'' of 20 to 70 percent off the published rate.
 &HT;    Their new Golf Travel section, done in conjunction with
TheGolfer.com, means that golfers can book travel and tee time to
more than 11,000 courses around the country.
 SMARTERLIVING.COM  
 &HT;    Most active travelers are already receiving free e-mail
notifications from airlines such as American, Continental,
Northwest, TWA and U.S. Airways.
 &HT;    Every week, these airlines offer many international and domestic
sale fares, mostly last-minute deals for quick getaways. But as
convenient as that may seem, it's still necessary to scroll through
dozens of fares, regulations and restrictions in order to reach
those that apply to a traveler's home airport. That's why every
busy traveler should sign up for free e-mails from
Smarterliving.com (smarterliving.com).
 &HT;    This site culls and collates e-fares from most major carriers
and only sends out those that depart from a single airport or from
multiple airports near the traveler's home.
 &HT;    It also sends out deals from carriers such as Icelandair,
airlines that may not have weekend-only fares but offer
longer-lived specials with fewer restrictions.
 DIGITAL CITY  
 &HT;    Digital City (www.digitalcities.com) is easily the best city
guide on the Web. The site hones in on the dining, shopping and
movie listings for more than 60 cities nationwide, with links to
local papers and local reviewers. It's a great site for travelers
who want to feel like a local.
 &HT;    If someone wants to know what's playing off-Broadway, or when
the Cleveland Indians are in their hometown or where to find the
best Mexican food in Phoenix, this is the place to go.
 QUIKBOOK  
 &HT;    For a city weekend getaway, check out the discount hotel broker
Quikbook (www.quikbook.com). Figure on discounts from 15 to 40
percent off published rates in major U.S. city hotels in 15 cities
(based on availability, of course).
 &HT;    New York, Orlando, San Francisco and Seattle are among the towns
in which they operate. They have competition, of course, like Hotel
Reservations Network (http://www.180096hotel.com), but Quikbook
seems better informed, with a Web site that cuts to the chase.
 CULTUREFINDER.COM  
 &HT;    CultureFinder.com (www.culturefinder.com) can tell travelers
who's starring in the Indiana Repertory Theatre, what the Alhambra
Dinner Theatre in Jacksonville is performing or how to find New
York City Opera tickets, with more than 350,000 events listed.
 FAMILY.COM  
 &HT;    For family travel, Family.com (www.family.com) is Disney's site
and has vacation advice of all kinds, helping parents plan trips by
location and by type. It's smart and savvy, for those traveling
with teens or tots.
 YAHOO.COM  
 &HT;    Finally, for travelers who need to find the British Tourist
Authority, a fly-fishing guide in Montana or a ferry schedule for
Monhegan Island, Maine, there's Yahoo (www.yahoo.com).
 &HT;    Yes, there are loads of other search engines, from Lycos
(www.lycos.com) and Dogpile (www.dogpile.com) to Infoseek
(www.inforseek.com), Ask Jeeves (www.askjeeves,com) and Alta Vista
(www.altavista.com). But Yahoo is a powerful timesaver _ and saving
time is really what it's all about.

 &HT;    It was a wrong turn, but one that led to an unforgettable
adventure. Instead of heading toward the museum, the couple came
upon a charming Parisian neighborhood filled with houses of
distinctive local architecture and quaint shops, like the bakery
with its aroma of baking bread that teased both the nose and taste
buds.
 &HT;    They couldn't help themselves, so they entered the shop to buy a
baguette. Before the bread was bagged they were engrossed in
conversation with the owner, who provided directions to a creative
jeweler down the street.
 &HT;    It was a morning of discovery for the couple from Nevada, who
found themselves taking an impromptu walking tour of a Parisian
suburb. And they still enjoy relating the experience to friends.
They remember every detail _ the baker's attire, the taste of the
bread, the bracelet displayed so proudly at the jewelry store, even
the dampness of the freshly washed sidewalks.
 &HT;    A walking tour is a popular way for mature travelers to explore
a vacation destination because it enables them to immerse
themselves in local culture, try local foods, stay in
bed-and-breakfasts or inns and talk with the people who actually
live and work in the region. It is an intimate form of travel that
stresses camaraderie of small groups and gives those who
participate the feeling of personal accomplishment.
 &HT;    A number of travel companies offer walking journeys. Some
specialize in trips just for those ages 50 and over, or just for
women, while others concentrate on particular regions, such as the
English Lake District, or areas of special interest, such as
gardens, wines or architecture.
 &HT;    Some companies, such as Abercrombie &AMP; Kent, are large; others
are operated by a one-person group leader who has an in-depth
knowledge of a country or a hobby. And the company names are
wonderful: Walking the World, Back Roads, Walk Your Way Into the
Heart of England, Country Walkers, Look Again Tours, English
Ramblers, The Wayfarers.
 TOURS FOR THE SENIOR SET  
 &HT;    Ask your travel agent to help you find the right walking tour
for your interests and abilities. The following companies offer
tours created especially for mature travelers:
 &HT;     _ Walking the World  has hiking trips just for seniors with
destinations that include Utah's parklands, Hawaii's volcanos, New
Zealand's Milford Track and Provence, France, among others. For
more information: (800) 340-9255; www.walkingtheworld.com.
 &HT;     _ Walk Your Way into the Heart of England.  Rosemary Quick, who
grew up in England, leads a few low-key hikes through places such
as the Cotswolds, Dorset Villages and the Lake District. Most trips
are easy _ more like strolls than walks _ and many are described as
``circular walks,'' which means they begin and end in the same
village and average five miles. Quick's walking tours for 2000
start with a trip on the Isle of Wight from May 11 to 22. For more
information: (970) 881-2709; Rosemary Davenport Quick, P.O. Box
231, Red Feather Lakes, Colo. 80545.
 &HT;     _ ElderTreks'  series of worldwide trips, which are limited to
active seniors, often includes backpacking and camping out in
places such as the Australian Outback, Borneo and the Galapagos
Islands. The 2000/2001 brochure showcases 36 trips, each rated by
the level of activity. For more information: (800) 741-7956;
www.eldertreks.com.
 &HT;     _ Mount Robson Adventure Holidays' ``Fifty Plus Adventures'' 
include short scenic walks in the shadow of Canada's highest peak,
plus birdwatching, canoeing and rafting. While tour dates haven't
been finalized for 2000, tours are likely to take place toward the
end of June. Each 14-day trip, priced at $719, double occupancy,
includes a canoe trip, a rafting float trip and guided hikes. For
more information: (250) 566-4386.
 &HT;     _ Nifty Over-Fifty Tours , led by Jan Coyle, bring participants
to New Zealand. This year, Coyle is expanding her company's
offerings with a ``Springtime in Australia'' tour from Oct. 13 to
27. For more information: (650) 595-2090; www.pacificpathways.com.
 &HT;     _ Look Again Tours of Sacramento  offers annual walking trips
to the British Isles for those ages 50 and older. For more
information: (916) 448-7202; e-mail lookagain(AT)midtown.net.
 &HT;     _ Going Places  develops walking trips for women ages 50 to 55.
A dozen walking trips are planned this year, from Scotland on June
2 to Vermont (to see the turning of the leaves) in late September.
 &HT;    The easiest trips offered by Going Places require less than
eight miles of walking per day on flat or rolling terrain. For more
information: (707) 935-0595; www.goingplacestours.com.
 YOUR STAMINA  
 &HT;    Each travel company works hard at educating prospective
tour-goers about the amount of walking that is required for each
trip and the geography to be covered. Many evaluate the difficulty
of their own tours. For example, a typical scale from one of these
companies might rate a trip ``easy'' if it covers four to six miles
per day on gentle terrain, such as the Coast of Maine or the
Galapagos Islands.
 &HT;    A ``moderate'' walking trip might require five to 10 miles of
walking per day over rolling to hilly terrain, with some ascents to
1,200 feet.
 &HT;    A ``challenging'' tour might include six to 12 miles each day
over hilly, rugged terrain that can hit altitudes beyond 1,200
feet. The pace is calculated at about 2.5 miles an hour.
 &HT;    A leader of a well-run tour will match the day's walk to the
group's abilities, weather and the terrain to be found underfoot.
 &HT;    One enthusiast described the lodges where he stayed each night
as ``real hotels'' _ inns or bed-and-breakfast establishments with
an owner on site who knew the area.
 &HT;    Support vans and wagons carry tour-goers' luggage, with one van
often designated as the ``sag wagon'' to transport those who find
the day's activities too rigorous.
 &HT;    Some walking trips are combined with other aspects of travel.
For example, walking tours on the Galapagos Islands are often
combined with island cruises. A walk in the French countryside
might include a barge trip on a river through wine country. Many
walking tours give travelers a day off during the week so that they
can take a tour, ride a boat or rent a car for some personal
explorations.
 &HT;    With nearly 30 million pairs of walking shoes sold in the United
States, and with nearly 15 million Americans claiming to be fitness
walkers, walking tours may very well be the future of leisure
travel.
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: TRAINING AND GEAR  
 &HT;    _ Before booking any walking tour, consult your doctor about
your physical fitness and the difficulty of your tour of choice.
 &HT;    _ Three to four weeks before the trip, take walking tours of
your own neighborhood in some measured fashion. Use your car's
speedometer to determine the actual length of your walks. These
local strolls will help build your endurance _ and break in your
walking boots.
 &HT;    _ Think about what you'll need to purchase before taking your
tour. Items to consider: a backpack or fanny pack, rain gear, a
camera and binoculars.

&HT;     THE NRA'S NOT-SO-SHARP SHOOTER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The National Rifle Association doesn't shoot
people, it shoots itself in the foot.
</P>
<P>
   What in blazing six-guns was the NRA's Wayne LaPierre thinking
when he said that President Clinton ``needs a certain level of
violence in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton needs is a certain level of the NRA talking about
violence. When it gets down to LaPierre's level it embarrasses even
Republicans and responsible gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA has handed the Democrats a winning position on an issue.
You can be sure that George W. Bush knows that LaPierre is
Clinton's concealed weapon. If conservatives know what's good for
them, they'll put a gum-lock on LaPierre's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   In other gun issues: Salon magazine has an article by Jonathan
Rauch advocating the ultimate deterrent to gay-bashing: In states
where carrying concealed weapons is legal, gays should carry guns.
</P>
<P>
   Rauch calls his proposal ``Pink Pistols,'' but I don't know
about that. Is that a pink pistol in your pocket, or are you just
happy to see me?
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times was bought by the Tribune Co. of Chicago,
and suddenly Angelenos are moaning about the ``colonization'' of
Los Angeles by outside corporations. This comes after years of Los
Angeles colonizing the world via television, records, movies and
Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   It's all a lot of hooey. When Disney bought ABC, did anyone in
New York complain about the colonization of Gotham by Anaheim?
</P>
<P>
   Cities aren't colonizing cities. Corporations are merging,
getting fewer and bigger, and it just happens that some cities lose
out. It's likely that everybody loses out.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Well, Hugh McColl hasn't been losing out. First, the chief
executive of Bank of America took the bank's headquarters from San
Francisco to Charlotte, N.C. Now he's reportedly been given $50
million in bonuses despite the bank's poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   So that's where all those charges Bank of America lays on us
have been going. So that's why the bank pays such puny interest.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about colonized. I feel McCollonized.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   The census form arrived, and it was so official-looking I almost
threw it out, thinking Ed McMahon had finally done it, printing
``Your response is required by law'' on the envelope.
</P>
<P>
   People keep violating the law. In the census 10 years ago,
834,000 Californians, and 21,000 San Franciscans, weren't counted.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask me who counted these folks who weren't counted, but
maybe that outfit should be hired to replace the current U.S.
Census Bureau _ which is so incompetent it misaddressed 115 million
census forms.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Prewitt, director of the Census Bureau, called the
mistake ``cosmetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up my main objection to the census form. It's one
more thing that makes me and millions of other Americans feel bad
about the color of our skin.
</P>
<P>
   White men can't jump. White men can't dance. Now we have one
more: White men can't check multiple boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The census form allows you to check one or more boxes, such as
white, African-American, American Indian, Chinese, Filipino and a
few others, with room to fill in a race of your choice, and a
separate category for Spanish/Hispanic/Latino.
</P>
<P>
   If you check ``white'' and ``Chinese,'' though, you'll be
counted as Chinese. This is like the old days of the South when any
bit of black blood made you black.
</P>
<P>
   There's something insulting about having to check ``white.''
Sure, we get our share of privileges, like not being pulled over
and shot by cops as often as people of other colors. But after all
these years of discovering our Irish, Italian or Polish heritage,
the U.S. government tells us we're just white.
</P>
<P>
   And some of us are kind of mottled.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   The dog daze continues. A Virginia animal lovers group has just
donated another $50,000 to the reward fund to find and convict the
miscreant who threw Leo the bichon frise into San Jose traffic.
</P>
<P>
   That brings the total reward to $100,000, and a lot of us are
probably thinking about taking Fido for a one-way ride.
</P>
<P>
   Naw, we wouldn't do that. But where is people's sense of
proportion? What about all those dead skunks on the highways, huh?
Where's the reward for whoever's tossing them into traffic?
</P>
<P>
   And what about a reward for the capture of those guys driving
sleds in the Iditarod race in Alaska?
</P>
<P>
   There's a lesson here. If you're a vicious murderer on death
row, and you want to create sympathy for a stay of execution,
forget about finding Christ or discovering your Native American
roots.
</P>
<P>
   Discover your roots as a bichon frise.

 &HT;    GROUP CALLS FOR SHARP INCREASE IN VISAS FOR SKILLED WORKERS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers representing several high-tech hot spots
Wednesday joined forces to push for a sharp increase in visas for
highly skilled foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shortage of skilled workers is a threat to our strong
economy,'' said House Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier,
R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Dreier led a group of 18 House members from both parties
sponsoring legislation that would raise the limit on H-1B visas to
200,000 in each of the next three fiscal years. The visas allow
well-educated foreigners, such as engineers and computer
programmers, to work in this country for up to six years.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, co-chair of the House Information
Technology Working Group, said the fast-growing tech companies in
central Texas need more H-1B visas because they must attract ``the
best and brightest, not only from all over the country but from all
over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill contains a provision to boost the fee employers pay for
each visa from the current $500 to $1,000. The money is used for
worker training and high-tech education. The bill also has
provisions aimed at improving administration of the visa program.
</P>
<P>
   Dreier's legislation is similar to a Senate bill that cleared
the Senate Judiciary Committee last week.
</P>
<P>
   But in the House, it must compete with a bill recently
introduced by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the
immigration subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's bill would boost the number of H-1B visas from the
current 115,000 to 160,000 in this fiscal year. But that relief
would be only temporary. The number of visas would fall to 107,500
in fiscal 2001 and 65,000 the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's far from clear which bill will gain momentum in the
House, backers of Dreier's legislation say they have the support of
members of the Republican leadership and key Democrats. Doggett
said he believed President Clinton, who has backed the idea of
increasing visas, would support the Dreier bill.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups that have been cool to the Smith bill rushed to
praise Dreier's package. Calling it ``a well-balanced bill,''
Sandra Boyd, chair of American Business for Legal Immigration,
cheered the bipartisan effort. ``There is an immediate need for
educated professionals who possess math, science and engineering
skills to fill the technology jobs that are being created,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-immigration groups and lobbyists for engineers and other
U.S. workers oppose increases in H-1B visas, saying labor shortages
are vastly overstated.
</P>
<P>
   Co-sponsors of the Dreier bill include Reps. Zoe Lofgren,
D-Calif.; Tom Davis, R-Va.; Adam Smith, D-Wash.; Anna Eshoo,
R-Calif., and John Linder, R-Ga. The sponsors represent such
high-tech meccas as Atlanta; Austin, Texas; the Silicon Valley;
Northern Virginia, and Seattle.

GREEN WITH ENVY: IRISH FOOD LEAPS BEYOND CORNED BEEF AND CABBAGE,
B'GOSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL NUCKOLS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   People don't go to Ireland for the food.
</P>
<P>
   But they would, if they knew more about it.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland, where lamb stew and Guinness stout come to mind. Where
salmon reign in the cold, fast-flowing rivers and the icy Atlantic
beyond. Salmon that end up poached or delicately smoked.
</P>
<P>
   Where cream _ whipped alongside your wedge of chocolate cake or
gently piled atop your Irish coffee _ is tinted slightly yellow,
butterlike. Where rainfall averages up to 100 inches a year and the
term ``Emerald Isle'' is no misnomer _ it's an understatement. The
cows are fat and their cream is rich.
</P>
<P>
   Even oatmeal tastes better here. With a texture so chewy that it
sometimes resembles barley, it's more filling, too. Of course, it's
cooked in whole milk and drowned in _ you guessed it _ cream. No
wonder it tastes so good.
</P>
<P>
   So when you're asked, ``Would you like cream with that?'' say
yes. This is not the time or place to worry about your cholesterol
level or your calorie intake. This is the time, and the place, to
enjoy fine cuisine or simple, hearty fare, prepared with care from
high-quality ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   'Tis true that Ireland doesn't immediately come to mind when the
subject is haute cuisine. And yet, a culinary renaissance has been
quietly taking place for 10 or 15 years. Chefs train on the
Continent or in England, or they undergo a two-year training
program sponsored by the Irish government. Local farmers and
producers supply hotels and restaurants with top-notch meats,
cheeses, herbs and vegetables. Thanks to a booming economy and a
youthful, well-traveled and sophisticated population, Ireland's
demand for fine food is growing. And it is being met.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is a time of renaissance for Irish food,'' says Declan
Ryan, owner of the Arbutus Lodge in Cork. ``It's the most exciting
time ever.'' Ten or 12 years ago, ``There were only six or eight
serious restaurants in the country _ like little lighthouses in the
fog.'' Now, he can't count all the fine-dining establishments.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Curran, general manager of the Aghadoe Heights Hotel in
Killarney, credits the economy. Instead of relying primarily on
agriculture, the economic base has diversified, fueled by a strong
high-tech industry. ``The Irish have a lot more money to spend, and
it's socially acceptable to eat out and talk about food,'' Curran
says. ``People are prepared to pay good money for good food.'' As a
result, restaurants have improved, along with the scope and quality
of locally available ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland's culinary history goes way back, Ryan says.
``Unfortunately, ours was interrupted by the famine,'' he said,
referring to the Great Potato Famine of the 1840s. ``Everything
ceased and started all over again.'' Before that catastrophe, the
island was blessed with fine cheeses, among other delicacies.
``Now, nobody even knows what the cheese tasted like.''
</P>
<P>
   He used to import cheese from France. ``Now I have nothing but
local cheeses on the board _ all farmhouse cheeses, nothing from
the factory,'' he says. In the past, he had to grow fresh herbs on
the premises. ``Now I have a choice of three different herb
growers.''
</P>
<P>
   As a tourist destination, Ireland is becoming increasingly
accessible, thanks to more direct flights. ``We're seeing a growth
in hotels and restaurants,'' Curran says. ``It's possible to make
money out of a restaurant.'' Or out of supplying a restaurant, he
adds, mentioning ``the local person that makes the bread or makes
the marmalade for breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Irish may not (yet) be known for their cuisine,
their friendliness and warmth are renowned. Kenneth Broderick, a
bartender at Shannon International Airport, where Irish coffee is
said to have originated, was asked whether he could make a decaf
version of that concoction. ``Well, it wouldn't exactly be an Irish
coffee,'' he replied. But he was quick to amend, ``If you want, I
can do it that way, no problem.'' And to share the recipe, too.
</P>
<P>
   At the Twelve Pins Lodge in Barna, County Galway, disappointment
at the unavailability of mussels sent the waitress scurrying back
to the kitchen to dispatch a boy to the pub across the road to see
if it had any of the tasty bivalves. Alas, the pub didn't, but her
effort exemplifies the eager-to-please charm of the Irish.
</P>
<P>
   So forget the corned beef and cabbage. Why bother, when you can
feast on roasted rack of lamb on a bed of creamed spinach served
with gratin potatoes, followed by Baileys souffle in a chocolate
cup at the Beaufort Bar and Restaurant near Killarney? Or
whole-meal bread (a version of Ireland's ubiquitous brown soda
bread) or rich, intensely flavored chicken-liver terrine at The
Purple Heather in Kenmare? Lightly fried Galway Bay oysters; lean,
salty bacon; silken foie gras; artfully arranged seafood cassoulet
in phyllo pastry; heady cream of tomato soup _ the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   So the remark of a satisfied diner, upon completion of an
elaborate meal at the Arbutus Lodge, seems apropos:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not really in Ireland; we're in heaven.''

 BUSH DOESN'T NEED McCAIN  
 (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Campaign
Countdown commentary column.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Campaign
Countdown, a rotating campaign-commentary column written by former
Democratic vice-presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro and by
MSNBC host Laura Ingraham.) 
 By LAURA INGRAHAM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    In politics, the ``W'' word is the kiss of death.
 &HT;    Just ask former President George Bush. His standing as a former
star athlete and bomber pilot didn't keep him from being labeled a
wimp, a tag which hurt him among the electorate.
 &HT;    The same hazard lies in wait for his son, who has the double
handicap of being nicknamed ``W'' after his middle initial. If
George W. Bush listens to the olive-branch crowd now urging him to
make nice with defeated rival John McCain, he'll find it impossible
to dodge that word.
 &HT;    Imagine the bumper stickers: ``W   W.''
 &HT;    The moment it was obvious that Bush had locked up the nomination
on Super Tuesday, television's conventional-wisdom crowd rushed to
advise him that he needed to move quickly to court McCain's
supporters.
 &HT;    McCain's advisers, anxious to keep their man in play, lost no
time in intimating to the press that McCain's enthusiastic
endorsement of Bush would not be forthcoming unless Bush moved
toward the Arizona senator's position on campaign-finance reform.
 &HT;    Last week, as Bill Bradley took his medicine and rallied behind
Gore, McCain went on vacation, merely wishing Bush well. Meanwhile,
angry McCain backers began buzzing about a possible third-party
run.
 &HT;    Suddenly Bush found himself facing the first major leadership
test of the post-primaries campaign season. A defeated John McCain
seemed even more difficult to deal with than a surging John McCain.
 &HT;    ``Seemed,'' I say, because things weren't quite the way they
looked.
 &HT;    Karen Hughes, communications director for Bush, had it right
last week when reporters asked her about the status of Bush-McCain
negotiations.
 &HT;    ``Negotiations?'' she said. ``Gov. Bush won. We hope that Sen.
McCain would help enact the campaign-finance reforms that Gov. Bush
laid out.''
 &HT;    A collective gasp swept the airwaves. Pro-McCain forces seized
on Hughes' response as evidence that Bush isn't a real reformer or
that he's back to his old, cocky self again. A Bush snub of McCain,
the media mavens howled, would drop all those independents and
moderates into Gore's lap.
 &HT;    But all this pressure to ``make peace'' is total nonsense. Sure,
Bush should act respectfully and cordially toward McCain, but
anything more than that will backfire.
 &HT;    During the next few months, Bush needs to convince America that
he believes in his political philosophy so strongly that he's
willing to lose John McCain completely. A strong leader doesn't
kowtow to his political rivals _ the more time Bush spends
extending olive branches in McCain's direction, the weaker he will
appear.
 &HT;    Bush's views _ including, presumably, those on campaign finance
_ helped him to coast-to-coast primary victories. Changing those
views now to accommodate a defeated rival would only alienate his
core supporters, while reinforcing the doubts swing voters have
about Bush.
 &HT;    McCain's appeal was due largely to his past heroism and his
plain-spoken approach, not to his views on particular issues.
Contrary to what media coverage would have you believe, exit polls
indicate that campaign finance is not a burning issue among the
electorate.
 &HT;    So far, the Bush team seems to be hanging tough. But the longer
the speculation about a McCain third-party run lingers, the more
the brain trust in Austin will be tempted to arrange a tete-a-tete,
one that would culminate in some sort of compromise on campaign
finance.
 &HT;    The pressure isn't coming solely from McCain boosters. Bush
backer Jack Kemp, who is an expert on losing to Al Gore, is
promoting a Bush-McCain kiss-and-make-up, going so far as to urge
Bush to pick McCain as his running mate. So is Bob Dole, whose
vaunted political savvy wasn't enough to keep him from losing even
to a scandal-tarred Bill Clinton in 1996.
 &HT;    Instead of pandering to McCain, Bush must continue his strategy
of taking his message directly to McCain's voters. He has to call
upon them to help him put an end to the hodgepodge foreign policy
of the past eight years, to Gore's allegiance to the hard left, to
the Clinton-Gore history of fund-raising abuses, to the missteps
with OPEC that led to today's high gas prices and to Gore's
politics of racial division a la Al Sharpton.
 &HT;    It isn't as if Bush were doomed without a McCain rapprochement _
a new USA Today poll shows the Texas governor 6 points ahead of
Gore.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, though, the beat goes on. McCain co-chair Warren
Rudman predicted disaster if Bush refuses to take up the McCain
campaign-finance mantle.
 &HT;    ``I don't think he'll do anything to hurt the ticket,'' Rudman
said disingenuously, ``but I'm not sure how much enthusiasm he'll
have for the ticket.''
 &HT;    This is the sort of low-grade political extortion that Bush
should spurn.
 &HT;    John McCain's voters were attracted to his straight talk,
honesty and toughness under pressure. It is foolhardy for Bush to
think that the way to attract those same voters is by scraping and
bowing to a man whom he handily defeated.

   FLOOD-BEACH _ OAK ISLAND, N.C. - Just weeks from the start of

recover from chronic erosion, worsened by Hurricane Floyd six
months ago. Some coastal experts predict that the state could lose

   Home Section stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Thursday, March 16.
</P>
<P>
   HARLEM-RENEWAL (New York) _ The predominant language in
south-central Harlem these days is the language of renewal. This is
not the retail turnaround of 125th Street, the Main Street of
Harlem, with its glossy mall, its new Old Navy and corner
Starbuck's. This is a modest renaissance that encompasses renovated
brownstones, storefront restaurants and new church- and
mosque-sponsored condominiums. Once nearly destroyed by drugs,
crime and debilitation, the square mile area is on the way up. By
Tracie Rozhon.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-DEVELOP (Wuensdorf, Germany) _ The train from Berlin to
Dresden makes a local stop at Wuensdorf, a dot on the map 25 miles
south of the German capital. For most of the past century,
Wuensdorf led a secret double life: a sleepy Prussian village
twinned with a forbidden city of soldiers. Now it is a city of
civilians _ the site of the biggest settlement project in Germany
whose success may inspire similar projects throughout eastern
Europe. By Jan Otakar Fischer.
</P>
<P>
   FOUR-COLOR-PENS (Undated) _ A pen is a pen, you'd think.
Especially a ballpoint. You lose it, you buy another for $2.99.
They stop making your kind, you switch. No biggie. Except, the pen
is my life. Literally. Bic's four-color ballpoint is the organizing
principle of my Week At-A-Glance diary: blue for work-related
entries; red for personal; black for illness, public appearances
and acts of God; green for extra-curricular projects. Much more
than just a pen, it's my personal Palm Pilot. You know the pen I'm
talking about: fat plastic barrel with four plungers _ blue, red,
black and green. Maybe you had a BIC 4C in school and thought
they'd stopped making them. They haven't. What they have done is
changed them. By Rick Marin.

<P>
   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered. By Dora
Galitzki.
</P>
<P>
   GE-RECALL (Undated) _ Should consumers with defective GE
dishwashers rewire them or buy new ones? And how much of the cost
should GE pick up? From April 1983 to January 1989, General
Electric produced 3.1 million dishwashers with a defective slide
switch (Heated Dry/Energy Saver) that has the potential to melt or
ignite, creating a fire hazard. Although there have been no
injuries from the switch, there have been about 50 incidents, three
of which damaged homes. About 900,000 of the dishwashers were still
being used by consumers and property managers when the recall began
last year. By Rosalie Radomsky.
</P>
<P>
   NIKKO-FIRS (New York) _ The Nikko firs rose 70 feet over our
heads, their soft needles and elegant branching more suggestive of
a mountain on the coast of Japan than the rivers of traffic around
their home at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. But this
rare stand of 30 trees, which includes a few American and
Mediterranean firs, is in trouble. By Ann Raver.

&HT;     INTERNET COMPANY LICENSES COMPETITOR'S MEDIA PLAYER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MATT BEER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ RealNetworks, which publishes the popular
software that lets users listen to music over the Internet, has
announced that it is licensing software from a formidable foe: the
Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It is the result of a strategy that harks back to the Microsoft
behavior that embroiled the company in a historic antitrust battle
with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The technology, called Windows Media Player, allows Microsoft to
gain a grip on an emerging Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows Media is poised to become an audio standard,'' Will
Poole, the general manager of Microsoft's digital media division,
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Microsoft also announced
Tuesday that Yahoo, the world's most visited Web site, is licensing
the Microsoft technology.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes against a backdrop of fierce feuding
between Microsoft and RealNetworks. Rob Glaser, the RealNetworks
chief executive, has appeared as a witness in the federal antitrust
trial against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Glaser told the Senate Judiciary Committee
investigating Microsoft business practices that the company had
sabotaged a new version of Glaser's Real Audio audio player.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft denied the charge and blamed Glaser's software for the
glitch. It also dismissed Glaser's complaints as the carping of a
disgruntled former employee. Glaser had worked at Microsoft in
Redmond, Wash., for 10 years before launching RealNetworks in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives bragged during Tuesday's announcement that
the Windows Media Player had gained an 80 percent share of the
Internet audio player market, according to New York-based Media
Metrix, an online ratings service.
</P>
<P>
   Just eight months ago, RealNetworks controlled 85 percent of the
Internet streaming market, according to Media Metrix, but that lead
was eaten away by Microsoft when the software titan included a free
copy of a full-featured Media Player with its Windows 98 and
Windows 2000 operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   RealPlayer has to be downloaded from the Internet. The company
charges $30 for a full version of its software.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks had no comment on Tuesday's announcements.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario, said Zona Research chief Internet analyst Clay
Ryder, recalls another bruising Internet battle: Microsoft's
death-cage match with Netscape Communications Corp. of Mountain
View.
</P>
<P>
   In that battle, Microsoft began distributing a free version of
its Web browsing software with its Windows operating system after
Netscape had captured a majority of the market with its Navigator
browser software. A browser lets a user view information on the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape withered and was acquired by America Online. Microsoft
emerged from that battle holding a lion's share of the browser
market _ and a federal judge's opinion that the company had engaged
in illegal corporate arm-twisting to gain that foothold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does have that flavor of a Netscape scenario,'' Ryder said.
``By including a free media player in their operating system, it
pushed out the company that charges for the software. It was
inevitable.''

&HT;     YAHOO, EBAY WON'T COMMENT ON MERGER SPECULATION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MATT BEER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Yahoo Inc., the Internet's most popular
destination, and the on-line auction house eBay Inc. are not
commenting on reports that they are getting ready for a
cyber-marriage.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC, the cable and Internet financial network, quoted unnamed
sources Tuesday as saying that Yahoo Inc. is considering buying
eBay Inc.
</P>
<P>
   EBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove said it is a company policy not
to comment on ``speculations, gossip, rumors or the like.''
Similarly, a Yahoo spokesman said, ``Yahoo doesn't comment on rumor
and speculation, and this is clearly what this all is.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Jerry Yang, the co-founder of Yahoo, said recently
that ``everyone wants to talk deals with us.''
</P>
<P>
   According to CNBC, ongoing delicate discussions between the two
companies range from a ``deep partnership'' to an outright eBay
buyout by Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Such a merger would create a company with a combined market
capitalization of some $116 billion, smaller than the $140
billion-plus market cap of Internet giant America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation is being fueled by the ongoing merger frenzy in
the media and Internet worlds, including the giant Time Warner/AOL
deal in January and this week's announcement that the parent
company of the Chicago Tribune will buy the Los Angeles Times and
other properties.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, according to CNBC, has been feeling pressures from these
acquisitions, which could end up creating entities that would
dilute its market lead.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo has also been in reported talks with Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp., which has been actively seeking corporate alliances with
Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   An eBay/Yahoo deal would make the on-line auction market a major
sales channel, said Munjal Shah, president and chief executive of
Andale Inc. in Mountain View. Andale publishes software to help
sellers track their Internet auction sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would make the business world see this as a legitimate
e-commerce venue,'' he said. However, a merger could close Yahoo's
own auction sites, which don't charge for listings.

   The  &UR; New York Times News Service &LR;  is planning an expanded
weather package, with a planned starting date of Monday, March 20,
to be transmitted Sunday, March 19. The package, consisting of a
weather map as a graphics file and a text file to accompany the
map, is available to graphics clients of the News Service.
</P>
<P>
   The new map grows to 4 columns in width (52 picas), from 3, and
is 6 inches deep; the old was 4\ inches deep. This new size permits
the insertion of cloud cover information, previously a separate
map, and the addition of many new cities (see list below).
</P>
<P>
   The map is available both in color and in black and white.
Because the map is much more detailed, we have devised an entirely
new palette of colors to make it easier to read the added
information.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of the new map is available at Wieck, Newscom,
Presslink and AP's GraphicsNet.
</P>
<P>
   Some papers using the old map may need extra time to make the
transition to a 4-column format. We will, for a limited time,
produce a 3-col version of the new map, but with only some of the
new map's additional cities.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of this information is included in each day's Graphics
Budget.

<HEADLINE>
A ST. PATRICK'S DAY PRIMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHO WAS ST. PATRICK?
</P>
<P>
   St. Patrick was the man responsible for converting most of the
Irish to Christianity. His life remains shrouded in mystery, with
most facts coming from the ``Confessions,'' written near his death.
He was born to a wealthy family in what is now Scotland near the
end of the fourth century. At 16, he was kidnapped by pirates and
sold into slavery. During his six-year captivity, he turned to
Christianity for strength.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he escaped and headed to Britain. According to his
writings, God had come to him in a dream and told him to leave
Ireland. While in Britain, Patrick wrote that an angel told him to
return to Ireland as a missionary. Most Irish people practiced a
nature-based religion at the time; however, there was a small
number of Christians on the island.
</P>
<P>
   For about 40 years Patrick was a missionary in Ireland,
baptizing, preaching, establishing churches and schools. He mingled
native Irish religion with Christianity in order to win converts.
It's believed that he died on March 17, around 460.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHEN DID ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADES BEGIN?
</P>
<P>
   St. Patrick's Day has been observed as a religious holiday for
more than a thousand years in Ireland. On St. Patrick's Day, which
occurs during the Christian season of Lent, Irish families
traditionally attended church in the morning and celebrated in the
afternoon. Prohibitions against the consumption of meat were lifted
on St. Patrick's Day, and families ate, drank and danced in
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The first St. Patrick's Day parade took place on March 17, 1762
in New York City. Irish soldiers serving in the English army
marched through the streets of New York City in an effort to
reconnect with their Irish heritage and meet fellow Irishmen
serving in the army.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HAS ST. PATRICK'S DAY ALWAYS BEEN POPULAR IN AMERICA?
</P>
<P>
   Most Irish immigrants, until the mid-19th century, were part of
Ireland's Protestant middle class. In 1845, the Great Potato Famine
swept through Ireland, bringing almost a million poor, uneducated
Catholic Irish to America. They were greatly discriminated against
because of their religion and accents. When Irish-Americans filled
city streets to celebrate St. Patrick's Day, newspapers portrayed
them in cartoons as drunken, brawling monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Irish soon realized that their great numbers
afforded them strong political power. They organized a voting
block, known as the green machine, and became highly influential in
politics. In a snap, St. Patrick's Day parades, once a spectacle
subject to scorn, became a show of pride for Irish-Americans and a
must-attend event for political hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Today, St. Patrick's Day is celebrated in a number of countries,
including Canada and Australia. It has been celebrated even in
Japan, Russia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHY IS THE SHAMROCK ASSOCIATED WITH ST. PATRICK'S DAY?
</P>
<P>
   It's thought that St. Patrick used the shamrock, or three-leaf
clover, to convey the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. The
shamrock was also called a seamroy by the Celts. It was held sacred
in ancient Ireland because it symbolized the coming of spring.
After the English began to seize Irish land and prohibit the use of
Irish language and the practice of Catholicism, many Irish wore
shamrocks to symbolize pride in their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHY ARE LEPRECHAUNS ASSOCIATED WITH ST. PATRICK'S DAY?
</P>
<P>
   ``Lobaircin,'' meaning ``small-bodied fellow,'' is the Irish
name for leprechauns. In Celtic folk tales, leprechauns were cranky
little men who mended shoes and were known to use trickery to
protect their fabled treasure. Originally, they were not a part of
St. Patrick's Day. Walt Disney's 1959 movie ``Darby O'Gill and the
Little People,'' introduced Americans to a friendly, upbeat
leprechaun, totally different from the moody little guy of Irish
folklore. The cheerful leprechaun is an American invention that
quickly came to be associated with St. Patrick's Day.

&HT;     ENRIVORNMENTAL GROUPS ATTACK PRESIDIO PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GERALD D. ADAMS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Sierra Club and eight other environmental
groups say the proposed George Lucas digital arts center at the
Presidio would produce serious water problems, require far too much
construction and violate the development plan for the new national
park.
</P>
<P>
   The charges, among the fiercest criticisms of the proposed Lucas
complex in a public document to date, are part of the Presidio
Trust's 423-page environmental appraisal that gauges how the
project may affect San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The critiques are directed at what would be the Presidio's
largest alteration contemplated by the trust, which runs the former
Army base. The Lucas project at the old Letterman Hospital site is
seen as the trust's principal cash cow, estimated to rake in $3.8
million to $5.7 million in revenue toward satisfying a
congressional demand that the Presidio raise its own $40 million
operating cost by 2013.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas is the creator of the ``Star Wars'' films.
</P>
<P>
   With neighborhood support, Lucasfilm was chosen by the Presidio
Trust board of directors from among 17 rivals last June to develop
the 23-acre Letterman site with a research and film production
center, including a seven-acre green for public use.
</P>
<P>
   The nine environmental groups complain of ``significant flaws''
in the trust's draft environmental impact statement on the Lucas
center scheduled to be published Friday by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency. The groups charge that the proposal:
</P>
<P>
   _ Foresees more new construction of greater magnitude and
sensitivity than was contemplated in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fails to evaluate the effect on the Presidio's views, trees,
wildlife and visitor experiences.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lacks housing for the employees who would work there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Would cause ``serious water quality problems'' resulting from
a combination of sewer overflows from storm water and runoff,
problems that have led to ``numerous beach closures.''
</P>
<P>
   The trust, in its responses contained in the environmental
report, disputes the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   This is the latest in a series of controversial issues to beset
the 200-year-old military installation since the Sixth Army pulled
out in 1995. In its wake, the National Park Service and, later, the
presidential-appointed Presidio Trust has taken over most of its
real estate, leaving the National Park Service to govern its
waterfront and beach areas under supervision of the Golden Gate
National Recreation Area.
</P>
<P>
   One critic whose comments carry more than casual weight is
Hilary Gitelman, San Francisco's chief environmental review
officer, whose comments were similar to those of the Sierra Club
and allied conservation groups.

<P>
   Gitelman said that during wet weather, ``there is substantial
public concern about partially treated sewage'' from a city
sewage-treatment plant.

Our rating: 3 stars

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Erin Brockovich, legal assistant extraordinaire, has an uncanny
way of digging up information that would elude the most experienced
lawyers and the best private detectives. Her boss, Ed Masry, a
disheveled attorney nearing the end of his career, wonders just how
Brockovich does it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how these places are run,'' Masry says. ``They're a
mess. What makes you think you can just walk in there and find what
you need?''
</P>
<P>
   Answers Brockovich: ``They're called boobs, Ed.''
</P>
<P>
   Julia Roberts' boobs _ along with her considerable charisma _
are on fine display in ``Erin Brockovich,'' an enjoyable lark of a
movie that finds director Steven Soderbergh working hard to deliver
crowd-pleasing entertainment. And while the movie certainly
delivers a rousing good time, it never comes close to being
believable as a true story. And the problem isn't in the film's
facts, which are close enough by Hollywood standards, but in the
way Roberts' imposing presence subverts what is essentially a
David-and-Goliath tale.
</P>
<P>
   Brockovich begins the movie as a twice-divorced mother of three
young children who's desperate for work. She eventually lands at
the law offices of Masry (Albert Finney), who once represented her
(unsuccessfully). Masry gives Brockovich a clerical job after she
threatens to make a scene. Making scenes is what Brockovich does
best; Masry at one point tells her that charm school, not law
school, would be of greatest benefit to her personal growth.
</P>
<P>
   Brockovich's attitude and her appearance (all the plunging
necklines, push-up bras and leather mini-skirts makes it look like
Roberts' has raided her ``Pretty Woman'' wardrobe trunk) don't
exactly endear her to her female co-workers. She calls one
overweight woman ``Krispy Kreme'' and reduces others to shocked
silence with various risque put-downs.
</P>
<P>
   A higher calling eventually arrives when Brockovich begins
investigating health problems afflicting families in the California
desert community of Hinkley. Brockovich traces the illnesses to a
deadly chemical that Pacific Gas and Electric used in its local
plant. Employing nothing more than her street smarts and
conspicuous cleavage, Brockovich begins to gather damning evidence,
pressing Masry to take the case to trial.
</P>
<P>
   The facts of the case make ``Erin Brockovich'' sound like the
recent tepid legal drama ``A Civil Action,'' but this movie is more
like ``Norma Rae'' anchored in underwire. There are the requisite
scenes of lives that have been ravaged by corporate greed (Marg
Helgenberger and Cherry Jones have some nice moments), but they're
overshadowed by Brockovich's coming-of-age tale.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Certainly, we've had
enough solemn and teary courtroom theatrics in movies to last us a
lifetime. Soderbergh, working from a snappy screenplay by Susannah
Grant (with an uncredited rewrite by Richard LaGravanese), seems to
understand this, and ignores most of the genre's cliches. The
result is an energetic, briskly directed, knockabout effort that
tells its story in a different, although hardly unique, way.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and Finney make a great team, and an unrecognizable
Aaron Eckhart also has some potent chemistry with Roberts, playing
Brockovich's biker boyfriend who becomes a full-time baby sitter to
her kids.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts' star power is what you'll remember most, though, which
is both the movie's greatest strength and its one glaring weakness.
Roberts is at ease with the film's comic and dramatic requirements
and she's at her romantic best with Eckhart. But we never forget
she's Julia Roberts. It all makes for a great Julia Roberts movie,
but an iffy biopic, which is a little disconcerting for a movie
called ``Erin Brockovich.'' &QL; 
_____ &QL;

and acts of God; green for extra-curricular projects. Much more
than just a pen, it's my personal Palm Pilot. You know the pen I'm
talking about: fat plastic barrel with four plungers _ blue, red,
black and green. Maybe you had a BIC 4C in school and thought
they'd stopped making them. They haven't. What they have done is

switch (Heated Dry/Energy Saver) that has the potential to melt or
ignite, creating a fire hazard. Although there have been no
injuries from the switch, there have been about 50 incidents, three

   MONTEREY, Calif. _ Chilean sea bass is a hot item on the
restaurant menu, but the delicacy _ which is really the Patagonian
toothfish _ is quickly disappearing from southern ocean waters off
the United States, along with orange roughy, redfish, Atlantic
swordfish, Georges Bank cod and other fading stars.
</P>
<P>
   To alert eaters about what is really hot and what is barely
surviving in the ocean, the Monterey Bay Aquarium has issued
``Seafood Watch: A Guide for Consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the size of the fish populations and how well they are
managed by government regulators and fishermen, the aquarium is
providing three lists: ``best choices,'' ``proceed with caution''
and ``avoid.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal, said Monterey Bay Aquarium Executive Director Julie
Packard, is to use market pressure to conserve ocean species and
healthy diets.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say that overfishing has plundered the ocean. As of
1993 nearly 80 percent of the commercially valuable fish _ those
whose status is known _ were overfished or ``fished to their full
potential,'' according to the National Marine Fisheries Service, a
branch of the U.S. Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   A report to Congress by 40 scientists said that almost all of
the important fish stocks off the northeastern, southeastern and
Gulf of Mexico coasts of the United States are either overfished or
nearing that status.
</P>
<P>
   Through its new guidebook, the aquarium, backed by information
from a panel of scientists and the Audubon Living Oceans Program,
warns restaurant-goers and cooks away from those fish whose
populations have been dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   Seafood is placed on the ``avoid'' list if the numbers are
depleted or the method of fishing them also kills turtles or
incidentally takes tons of other fish, called the by-catch.
</P>
<P>
   American lobster, bluefin tuna, lingcod, rockfish, monkfish,
shark, trawl-caught spot prawns and farmed salmon, among others,
are on that list.
</P>
<P>
   Farmed salmon and shrimp also are on the ``avoid'' list because
they sometimes create waste, disease and, in the case of salmon,
occasionally escape into a wild population.
</P>
<P>
   On the ``best choice'' list are albacore tuna, squid, Dungeness
crab, California and Alaska wild salmon and Alaska halibut. The
eat-up list also includes the following farmed animals: oysters,
clams, rainbow trout, catfish and striped bass.
</P>
<P>
   Some fish that make the ``proceed with caution'' list are
petrale and English sole, snow crab, Bay scallops and shrimp, and
wild Washington and Oregon salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The Packard Foundation, which founded the Monterey Bay Aquarium
in 1984, is spending $3 million this year to support consumer
education, eco-labeling and certification programs for well-managed
fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   A well-managed fishery signifies that its operation is
environmentally friendly, that it is not taking more fish than can
be replenished naturally or not killing other species through
harmful fishing practices. A certified fishery can earn a ``Forever
Fish'' logo on its products, telling customers that the fish has
been taken in an environmentally sound way.
</P>
<P>
   One certification group being supported by the Packard
Foundation is the Marine Stewardship Council, a London-based
nonprofit organization set up in 1996 by World Wildlife Fund and
Unilever, a major food supplier in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago, the council opened its first U.S. office in
Seattle. At a seafood show in Boston last week, the council
certified its first two fish _ the Western Australian rock lobster
and the Thames River herring _ because the industry that brings
them to the market has sound fishing operations. They now bear a
``Forever Fish'' logo.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Alaska Fish and Game Department requested a
``Forever Fish'' certification from the council, which is
evaluating the state's five runs of salmon: Chinook, coho, sockeye,
pink and chum.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the California fishing industry is talking to
the Sierra Club and other environmental organizations about
starting labeling that would appear on packages denoting which fish
are in season, which are particularly healthful and which come from
sustainable fisheries, said Zeke Grader, executive director of the
Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Association.
</P>
<P>
   Grader consulted with the Monterey Bay Aquarium on its guidebook
list, which was revised in February based on comments from
fishermen in his group.
</P>
<P>
   One fish that didn't make it on the ``best choice'' list but
should have was the sardine, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one fish we should be promoting because it's being
managed on a sustainable basis,'' Grader said. ``It's taken us 50
years to rebuild the stocks, and I think we've learned from our
mistakes of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Other populations of fish that aren't doing as well are rockfish
and groundfish, including lingcod, pacific red snapper, sablefish
and butterfish. But new regulations put in place recently by the
Pacific Fishery Management Council, a regional regulatory agency,
should improve the situation.
</P>
<P>
   In Islip, N.Y., Carl Safina, Audubon's vice president for marine
conservation, said it was worth saving the endangered species of
fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have those fish to eat in the future, and the
quality of peoples' lives depends on these things we like so much
maintaining a presence in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of power to protect sea life lies with consumers and
restaurateurs, he said. The Audubon Living Oceans program next
month will publish a 120-page full-color ``Seafood Lover's
Almanac.''

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I am in the process of improving the insulation in the home I
recently moved into _ to save on fuel bills in the heating season,
as well as to cut down on air conditioning costs in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   I put down extra insulation in the attic and installed it around
the foundation walls, but I cannot afford to have insulation added
to the outside walls.
</P>
<P>
   A friend recommended that I can cut down on cold drafts in the
winter and air conditioning costs in the summer by imply insulating
all electric outlets that are located on outside walls.
</P>
<P>
   Is this worth doing, and if so, how can I accomplish this?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is a very simple do-it-yourself project that is also
very inexpensive. I feel that it is well worth doing _ especially
in an older house that may not have adequate insulation in the
exterior walls.
</P>
<P>
   The existing outlet plate is removed by taking out the screw
that holds it in place, then a foam gasket is slid in behind it
before screwing the plate back into position.
</P>
<P>
   These foam gaskets are available in most hardware stores and
home centers and can be easily trimmed to size when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Water drips in from our bathroom exhaust fan in the winter
months, but this never happens during mild weather.
</P>
<P>
   We had the hooded exhaust vent on the roof replaced with a model
that has a flap on it to cover the opening when not in use, but
this has not solved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Can you explain how water is getting into the fan and then
dripping down into our bathroom?
</P>
<P>
   A: Without having actually examined the installation I can only
guess.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is that the water comes from melting snow that
piles up against the vent, then melts when the vent is warmed by
hot air that comes out when the fan is in use. That would explain
why there is no such problem in warm weather.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that the moisture is actually
condensation _ steam that condenses on the cold metal on its way up
to the outside vent opening.
</P>
<P>
   This condensation then drips down after enough moisture
accumulates. If so, this could by corrected by insulating the metal
duct where it goes up through the attic.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We used chemicals to kill a climbing vine on the brick walls
of our house, but we are still left with lots of tentacles and
root-like remnants on the brick _ especially in the crevices and
joints.
</P>
<P>
   Can you suggest an easy way to get these remnants off the brick?
</P>
<P>
   A: Unfortunately, there is no ``easy way.'' Wire brushing by
hand is one method, but it is a lot of work.
</P>
<P>
   The work will be less tedious and go a lot faster if you use a
power-driven wire wheel instead, but make sure you wear safety
goggles or a safety mask to protect your eyes and your face.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our fiberglass bathtub is very hard to clean. The ring around
the tub after each use is almost impossible to remove.
</P>
<P>
   Is there some product we can use that will make this easier?
</P>
<P>
   A: Fiberglass tubs vary in quality and finish and some seem
easier to clean than others. Also, it depends on how they have been
cleaned and cared for in the past.
</P>
<P>
   If an abrasive cleaner has been used often the surface may be
rougher and more porous, so dirt will tend to penetrate and be
harder to remove.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if the water is ``hard'' this may tend to leave a ring of
its own after the tub is emptied.
</P>
<P>
   If hard water is the problem, you can try using a product like
Lime Away, which is designed to remove ``hard'' water deposits.
</P>
<P>
   If that is not the problem, try using one of the fiberglass
cleaners that are sold in marine supply outlets for use on boats.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to

</P>
<P>
   CAPTION: Foam insert behind electric outlet will prevent cold
drafts from entering and thus cut down on heat loss.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ In the summer of 1994, Cristina Pineda, who was
studying textile design at the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico
City, and Ricardo Covalin, who was studying industrial design,
immersed themselves in the indigenous culture and way of life in
Merida, Yucatan, as part of a three-month social service
requirement.
 &HT;    To get to know the people and the area, they visited
archeological sites, ruins and colonial areas and lived in the
indigenous communities. Many of the community members were
unemployed artists, and the students taught them how to make
original designs in various colors, shapes and sizes and sell them
as a means to support their families. ``We fell in love with
pre-Hispanic culture,'' Covalin says.
 &HT;    A year after graduating in 1995, Pineda was taking classes at
the Anthropology Museum in Mexico City when she was asked to design
a product that could be sold at the museum's store. She got in
touch with Covalin, and the two presented the museum with
pre-Hispanic designs for ties and scarves. The museum didn't have
the budget to produce the manufacturer's minimum of 10,000 pieces,
so it offered to display the ties and scarves in their stores on
consignment. They agreed, borrowing money from their families to
pay for the production costs.
 &HT;    Three months later, the Pineda Covalin Design House was born.
With no business experience and no customers, they started cold
calling prospective clients, hoping that the grandeur of Mexico's
past would work its magic. Armed with courage and the originality
of their product to back them up, Pineda and Covalin went door to
door and from restaurant to coffee shop meetings, lugging their
designs in a suitcase.
 &HT;    The two gradually began to establish their brand thanks to store
and restaurant patrons, whose curiosity was peaked after seeing the
contents of the suitcase. ``At the beginning, it was difficult,''
Covalin says. ``Some of our calls were not returned and some were
blatantly rejected. But we persevered.''
 &HT;    Capturing the beauty, challenge and greatness of the
pre-Hispanic era at the height of its magnificence is the raison
d'etre of the Pineda Covalin Design House. Beautiful silk is used
to weave elements of myths, archeology and history into their
designs. Their objective: to keep the wonders of the ceremonies,
the customs and the magical world of indigenous culture alive
through art and fashion.
 &HT;    Their designs tell stories of offerings made in the presence of
Gods and introduce rituals where animals and priests _ in a
splendor of colors _ come together, enveloping viewers in the
mystic of the pre-Hispanic empire.
 &HT;    One example is the Mayan legend of K'IN (meaning the moon or
night) and AK'AB (meaning the sun or day). The young woman K'IN and
her bow AK'AB fell in love at first sight, but the young woman's
grandfather wouldn't let him near her. So AK'AB turned himself into
a hummingbird and flew over to her room. Her grandfather shot and
wounded the bird, but K'IN secretly took care of it. At midnight,
AK'AB changed back into human form and convinced K'IN to run away
with him. They made love, and the power of the act transformed them
into the sun and the moon. They took their places in heaven, giving
the world day and night.
 &HT;    This legend is the inspiration behind a Pineda Covalin perfume
and cologne. The scents were imported from Germany and France: a
floral perfume for women (K'IN) and a natural woodsy cologne for
men (AK'AB). They are prepared in a lab in Mexico City and packaged
by Pineda Covalin in a Mayan-styled bottle with designs referring
to the legendary love affair between the sun and the moon.
 &HT;    Pineda Covalin's products have found fans high up in the world.
When Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo inaugurated an exposition at
the Museum of Anthropology, Covalin and Pineda presented him with a
tie. In corporate Mexico, executives from Disney, Bacardi, Grupo
Modelo (maker of Corona beer), Bayer, American Express, Nestle and
BMW have been seen sporting Pineda Covalin ties. Even Hillary
Clinton was presented with a bottle of K'IN as a gift during her
visit to Mexico City.
 &HT;    Since it opened in 1996, Pineda Covalin's sales _ which the
partners won't disclose _ have doubled every six months. While it
took them almost a year to sell their first production of 10,000
ties and scarves, that now represents less than their present
monthly sales average. Pineda, 27, and Covalin, 28, manage 11
employees and 30 salespeople.
 &HT;    A big reason for their success is Mexicans' desire to return to
their roots. ``There is a resurgence of Mexican-made products,''
Covalin says. ``You see it mostly among the young people. Bars and
fancy restaurants used to pride themselves on cool English names.
Now it is the exact opposite; they are all in Spanish. Today young
people are drinking tequila shots, not cognac.''
 &HT;    The National Advertising Council backs him up. The group started
promoting Mexican products in 1971 with slogans such as ``Made in
Mexico means good quality.'' But now the trend is more toward
homegrown products with a certain `mexicanidad.' ``The increase in
exports has given rise to the feeling that if Canadian, British and
American people want our products, maybe we should, too,'' says
Monica Martinez, a campaign manager at the National Advertising
Council.
 &HT;    Pineda Covalin has taken inspiration from everything that has to
do with the pre-Hispanic era. The Bonampak Murals that depict the
presentation of a new heir to the throne, the hieroglyphics used to
represent Mayan months and the different masks worn by the rain god
Tlaloc in Mixteco, Zapoteco and Mexica styles can be found in the
company's ties and scarves.
 &HT;    A trade advertisement the design house placed in Aeromexico's
in-flight magazine, Escala, spurred the decision to begin offering
companies special and exclusive designs. Little did they realize
the jump-start effect this would have on their business. ``Calls
started coming in from all sorts of people making orders for
specially designed ties and scarves _ the Mexican Dog Federation,
Motorola, Marriott,'' Covalin says. ``We had to branch out.''
 &HT;    In designing these ties, the house uses symbols, figures and art
from national monuments (the rights for which they pay the National
Institute of Anthropology), a blend of the pre-Hispanic with the
company's logo or an original design. ``It is a high-quality
product,'' says Antonio Martinez Reyes, point of sales manager for
Grupo Modelo. ``For us, the most interesting aspect is that it is
Mexican, just like our beer.''
 &HT;    When Disney opened its marketing office in Mexico City,
executives heralded Pineda Covalin's beautiful designs for both
being reminiscent of the rich pre-Hispanic culture and up to par
with the latest fashion in accessories. They were ecstatic to have
a truly Mexican _ but not typical _ gift they could present to
their clients. The packaging reads Disney, but everything else is
Pineda Covalin. ``Who thought of this idea?'' Manuel Garcia
Lascurain, Disney's marketing and synergy manager for Latin
America, asked. ``I want some for myself!''
 &HT;    From the beginning, Pineda Covalin thought internationally. When
they put together their first packaging, which tells the legends
and myths of Mayan and Aztec symbols, among others, they did so in
six different languages. Their first breakthrough outside Mexico
came when they made some sales in Argentina. They have recently
begun to focus their efforts on London, Los Angeles, and New York.
 &HT;    Pineda and Covalin are a new breed of Mexicans _ Generation
X'ers who appreciate where they came from. Traditional mariachis
took part in the inaugural celebrations in October 1999 of their
new and more spacious offices located in La Roma, a trendy
neighborhood in Mexico City. But they've also launched a website
(www.pinedacovalin.com) that features all their designs _ and for
purchase.
 &HT;    And while business is good, the pair of entrepreneurs still
seems to be enjoying themselves. ``It's fun,'' Covalin says. ``I
really enjoy the idea of being able to make a difference, making
Mexicans realize they have a rich past they should be proud of.''

pre-Hispanic era at the height of its magnificence is the raison
d'etre of the Pineda Covalin Design House. Beautiful silk is used
to weave elements of myths, archeology and history into their
designs. Their objective: to keep the wonders of the ceremonies,
the customs and the magical world of indigenous culture alive
through art and fashion.
 &HT;    Their designs tell stories of offerings made in the presence of
Gods and introduce rituals where animals and priests _ in a
splendor of colors _ come together, enveloping viewers in the
mystic of the pre-Hispanic empire.
 &HT;    One example is the Mayan legend of K'IN (meaning the moon or
night) and AK'AB (meaning the sun or day). The young woman K'IN and
her bow AK'AB fell in love at first sight, but the young woman's
grandfather wouldn't let him near her. So AK'AB turned himself into
a hummingbird and flew over to her room. Her grandfather shot and
wounded the bird, but K'IN secretly took care of it. At midnight,
AK'AB changed back into human form and convinced K'IN to run away
with him. They made love, and the power of the act transformed them
into the sun and the moon. They took their places in heaven, giving
the world day and night.
 &HT;    This legend is the inspiration behind a Pineda Covalin perfume
and cologne. The scents were imported from Germany and France: a
floral perfume for women (K'IN) and a natural woodsy cologne for
men (AK'AB). They are prepared in a lab in Mexico City and packaged
by Pineda Covalin in a Mayan-styled bottle with designs referring
to the legendary love affair between the sun and the moon.
 &HT;    Pineda Covalin's products have found fans high up in the world.
When Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo inaugurated an exposition at
the Museum of Anthropology, Covalin and Pineda presented him with a
tie. In corporate Mexico, executives from Disney, Bacardi, Grupo
Modelo (maker of Corona beer), Bayer, American Express, Nestle and
BMW have been seen sporting Pineda Covalin ties. Even Hillary
Clinton was presented with a bottle of K'IN as a gift during her
visit to Mexico City.
 &HT;    Since it opened in 1996, Pineda Covalin's sales _ which the
partners won't disclose _ have doubled every six months. While it
took them almost a year to sell their first production of 10,000
ties and scarves, that now represents less than their present
monthly sales average. Pineda, 27, and Covalin, 28, manage 11
employees and 30 salespeople.
 &HT;    A big reason for their success is Mexicans' desire to return to
their roots. ``There is a resurgence of Mexican-made products,''
Covalin says. ``You see it mostly among the young people. Bars and
fancy restaurants used to pride themselves on cool English names.
Now it is the exact opposite; they are all in Spanish. Today young
people are drinking tequila shots, not cognac.''
 &HT;    The National Advertising Council backs him up. The group started
promoting Mexican products in 1971 with slogans such as ``Made in
Mexico means good quality.'' But now the trend is more toward
homegrown products with a certain `mexicanidad.' ``The increase in
exports has given rise to the feeling that if Canadian, British and
American people want our products, maybe we should, too,'' says
Monica Martinez, a campaign manager at the National Advertising
Council.
 &HT;    Pineda Covalin has taken inspiration from everything that has to
do with the pre-Hispanic era. The Bonampak Murals that depict the
presentation of a new heir to the throne, the hieroglyphics used to
represent Mayan months and the different masks worn by the rain god
Tlaloc in Mixteco, Zapoteco and Mexica styles can be found in the
company's ties and scarves.
 &HT;    A trade advertisement the design house placed in Aeromexico's
in-flight magazine, Escala, spurred the decision to begin offering
companies special and exclusive designs. Little did they realize
the jump-start effect this would have on their business. ``Calls
started coming in from all sorts of people making orders for
specially designed ties and scarves _ the Mexican Dog Federation,
Motorola, Marriott,'' Covalin says. ``We had to branch out.''
 &HT;    In designing these ties, the house uses symbols, figures and art
from national monuments (the rights for which they pay the National
Institute of Anthropology), a blend of the pre-Hispanic with the
company's logo or an original design. ``It is a high-quality
product,'' says Antonio Martinez Reyes, point of sales manager for
Grupo Modelo. ``For us, the most interesting aspect is that it is
Mexican, just like our beer.''
 &HT;    When Disney opened its marketing office in Mexico City,
executives heralded Pineda Covalin's beautiful designs for both
being reminiscent of the rich pre-Hispanic culture and up to par
with the latest fashion in accessories. They were ecstatic to have
a truly Mexican _ but not typical _ gift they could present to
their clients. The packaging reads Disney, but everything else is
Pineda Covalin. ``Who thought of this idea?'' Manuel Garcia
Lascurain, Disney's marketing and synergy manager for Latin
America, asked. ``I want some for myself!''
 &HT;    From the beginning, Pineda Covalin thought internationally. When
they put together their first packaging, which tells the legends
and myths of Mayan and Aztec symbols, among others, they did so in
six different languages. Their first breakthrough outside Mexico
came when they made some sales in Argentina. They have recently
begun to focus their efforts on London, Los Angeles, and New York.
 &HT;    Pineda and Covalin are a new breed of Mexicans _ Generation
X'ers who appreciate where they came from. Traditional mariachis
took part in the inaugural celebrations in October 1999 of their
new and more spacious offices located in La Roma, a trendy
neighborhood in Mexico City. But they've also launched a website
(www.pinedacovalin.com) that features all their designs _ and for
purchase.
 &HT;    And while business is good, the pair of entrepreneurs still
seems to be enjoying themselves. ``It's fun,'' Covalin says. ``I
really enjoy the idea of being able to make a difference, making
Mexicans realize they have a rich past they should be proud of.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    CIUDAD DE MEXICO _ En el verano de 1994, Cristina Pineda, que
estudiaba diseno textil en la Universidad Iberoamericana de la
Ciudad de Mexico, y Ricardo Covalin, que estudiaba diseno
industrial, se sumergieron en la cultura indigena y el modo de vida
de Merida, Yucatan, en un plan obligatorio de servicio social de
tres meses.
 &HT;    Para conocer la zona y a sus habitantes, visitaron sitios
arqueologicos, ruinas y lugares coloniales y vivieron en
comunidades indigenas. En las comunidades habia muchos artistas sin
empleo, y los estudiantes les ensenaron a hacer disenos originales
en diversos colores, formas y tamanos como medio de subsistencia.
``Nos enamoramos de la cultura indigena,'' comenta Covalin.
 &HT;    Un ano despues de graduarse en 1995, Pineda estaba recibiendo
clases en el Museo de Antropologia de Mexico cuando le pidieron que
disenara un producto para vender en la tienda del museo. Se puso en
contacto con Covalin, y los dos le propusieron a la institucion
disenos para corbatas y bufandas. El museo no tenia el presupuesto
para fabricar el minimo de 10.000 unidades, de modo que les propuso
exhibir los articulos en sus tiendas en consignacion. Los dos
aceptaron y le pidieron dinero a sus familiares para costear la
produccion.
 &HT;    Tres meses despues, nacio la firma de diseno Pineda Covalin. No
tenian ni experiencia ni clientes, y comenzaron a hacer llamadas
para ofrecer su mercancia, con la esperanza de que la grandeza del
pasado mexicano atrajera compradores. Armados con su valor y con la
originalidad del producto, Pineda y Covalin fueron de puerta en
puerta y de restaurante en restaurante, con una maleta llena de sus
disenos indigenas.
 &HT;    Poco a poco establecieron su marca gracias a la colaboracion de
tenderos y duenos de restaurantes. ``Al principio fue dificil,''
relata Covalin. ``No nos devolvian muchas llamadas y a veces nos
rechazaban de plano. Pero perseveramos.''
 &HT;    La razon de ser de la firma Pineda Covalin es captar la belleza,
el reto y la grandeza del apogeo de la era prehispanica. Usan una
hermosa seda para tejer elementos de la mitologia, la arqueologia y
la historia en sus disenos. Su objetivo es mantener viva la
maravilla de las ceremonias, las costumbres y el mundo magico de la
cultura prehispanica a traves del arte y la moda. Sus disenos
narran historias de ofrendas a los dioses y presentan rituales en
los que se unen animales y sacerdotes en un torbellino de colores
que da una imagen de la mistica precolombina.
 &HT;    Un ejemplo es la leyenda maya de K'IN (que significa la luna o
la noche) y AK'AB (el sol o el dia). La joven K'IN y AK'AB se
enamoran a primera vista, pero el abuelo de la joven no deja que el
pretendiente se le acerque. De modo que AK'AB se convierte en un
colibri y vuela hasta su recamara. El abuelo hiere al pajaro, pero
K'IN lo cuida en secreto. A medianoche, AK'AB adopta de nuevo su
forma humana y convence a K'IN para que huya con el. Cuando hacen
el amor, se transforman en el sol y en la luna y asi le dan al
mundo el dia y la noche.
 &HT;    Esta leyenda es la inspiracion del perfume y la colonia Pineda
Covalin. Las esencias se importaron de Alemania y Francia: un
perfume floral para la mujer (K'IN) y una colonia con aroma de
madera para el hombre (AK'AB). Se preparan en un laboratorio de
Ciudad de Mexico y Pineda Covalin los envasa en frascos estilo
maya, con disenos que evocan el idilio del sol y la luna.
 &HT;    Los productos Pineda Covalin han encontrado aficionados en la
alta sociedad. Cuando el presidente mexicano Ernesto Zedillo
inauguro una exposicion en el Museo de Antropologia, Covalin y
Pineda le regalaron una corbata. En el mundo empresarial mexicano,
se ha visto a ejecutivos de Disney, Bacardi, Grupo Modelo (que
fabrica la cerveza Corona), Bayer, American Express, Nestle y BMW
luciendo corbatas Pineda Covalin. Hasta a Hillary Clinton la
obsequiaron con un frasco de K'IN durante su visita a Mexico.
 &HT;    Desde su inauguracion en 1996, las ventas de Pineda Covalin
(cuyo monto los socios no revelan) se han duplicado cada seis
meses. Aunque les tomo casi un ano vender su primera produccion de
10.000 corbatas y bufandas, esa cantidad es menor que el promedio
mensual de ventas. Pineda, que tiene 27 anos, y Covalin, de 28,
dirigen a 11 empleados y 30 vendedores.
 &HT;    Una importante razon de su exito es el deseo de los mexicanos de
regresar a sus raices. ``Hay un resurgimiento de los productos
hechos en Mexico,'' afirma Covalin. ``Se ve sobre todo entre la
gente joven. Los bares y los restaurantes de moda solian tener
nombres en ingles. Ahora es al reves: todos son en espanol. Los
jovenes de hoy beben tequila en vez de conac.''
 &HT;    El Consejo Nacional de Publicidad lo apoya. El grupo comenzo a
promover los productos mexicanos en 1971 con lemas como ``Hecho en
Mexico es igual a gran calidad.'' Pero ahora se buscan mas los
productos nacionales con cierta mexicanidad. ``El aumento de las
exportaciones ha dado pie a la opinion de que si los canadienses,
los britanicos y los norteamericanos desean nuestros productos,
nosotros tambien debemos desearlos,'' dice Monica Martinez, gerente
de campana del Consejo Nacional de Publicidad.
 &HT;    Pineda Covalin se ha inspirado en todo lo que tiene que ver con
la era prehispanica. Los murales de Bonampak describen la
presentacion de un nuevo heredero al trono. Los jeroglificos que
representan los meses del calendario maya y las mascaras que usaba
el dios de la lluvia, Tlaloc, en estilo mixteca, zapoteca y mexica
se encuentran en las corbatas y las bufandas de la compania.
 &HT;    Un anuncio que la firma de diseno coloco en la revista de
Aeromexico, Escala, estimulo la decision de ofrecer a las empresas
disenos especiales y exclusivos. No previeron el efecto catalizador
que la decision tendria en su negocio. ``Nos llamaba gente de todo
tipo para pedirnos corbatas y bufandas con disenos especiales: la
Federacion Mexicana del Perro, Motorola, Marriott,'' dice Covalin.
``Tuvimos que expandirnos.''
 &HT;    Al disenar estas corbatas, la casa usa figuras y simbolos
prehispanicos de monumentos nacionales (pagan los derechos al
Instituto Nacional de Antropologia), una mezcla del arte indigena
con el logo de la compania o un diseno original que solo lleva el
logo de la firma. ``Es un producto de gran calidad,'' dice Antonio
Martinez Reyes, gerente de punto de venta del Grupo Modelo. ``Para
nosotros, el aspecto mas interesante es que es mexicano, como
nuestra cerveza.''
 &HT;    Cuando Disney abrio su oficina de mercadeo en Ciudad de Mexico,
los ejecutivos elogiaron los bellos disenos de Pineda Covalin por
recordar la rica cultura indigena y por reflejar a la vez lo ultimo
en moda. Los fascino contar con un producto verdaderamente
mexicano, aunque no tipico, para regalar a sus clientes. El envase
dice Disney, pero todo lo demas es Pineda Covalin. ``A quien se le
ocurrio esta idea?'' pregunto Manuel Garcia Lascurain, gerente de
mercadeo y sinergia de Disney para America Latina. ``Quiero varios
para mi!''
 &HT;    Desde el principio, Pineda Covalin tuvo una proyeccion
internacional. Cuando prepararon su primer paquete, que narra las
leyendas y los mitos de los simbolos mayas y aztecas, entre otros,
los escribieron en seis idiomas. Su primera incursion fuera de
Mexico se produjo cuando hicieron varias ventas en Argentina.
Recientemente han comenzado a apuntar a Londres, Los Angeles y
Nueva York.
 &HT;    Pineda y Covalin representan a una nueva generacion de mexicanos
que valora su origen. En octubre, mariachis tradicionales
participaron en los festejos de la inauguracion de sus nuevas
oficinas, mas espaciosas, en La Roma, un prospero barrio de Ciudad
de Mexico. Pero tambien han lanzado un website
(www.pinedacovalin.com) con todos sus disenos y con articulos a la
venta. Y mientras el negocio marcha bien, los dos empresarios
disfrutan tanto como al principio. ``Es divertido,'' afirma
Covalin. ``Me complace saber que ejercemos una influencia para que
los mexicanos se sientan orgullosos de nuestro rico pasado.''

con el logo de la compania o un diseno original que solo lleva el
logo de la firma. ``Es un producto de gran calidad,'' dice Antonio
Martinez Reyes, gerente de punto de venta del Grupo Modelo. ``Para
nosotros, el aspecto mas interesante es que es mexicano, como
nuestra cerveza.''
 &HT;    Cuando Disney abrio su oficina de mercadeo en Ciudad de Mexico,
los ejecutivos elogiaron los bellos disenos de Pineda Covalin por
recordar la rica cultura indigena y por reflejar a la vez lo ultimo
en moda. Los fascino contar con un producto verdaderamente
mexicano, aunque no tipico, para regalar a sus clientes. El envase
dice Disney, pero todo lo demas es Pineda Covalin. ``A quien se le
ocurrio esta idea?'' pregunto Manuel Garcia Lascurain, gerente de
mercadeo y sinergia de Disney para America Latina. ``Quiero varios
para mi!''
 &HT;    Desde el principio, Pineda Covalin tuvo una proyeccion
internacional. Cuando prepararon su primer paquete, que narra las
leyendas y los mitos de los simbolos mayas y aztecas, entre otros,
los escribieron en seis idiomas. Su primera incursion fuera de
Mexico se produjo cuando hicieron varias ventas en Argentina.
Recientemente han comenzado a apuntar a Londres, Los Angeles y
Nueva York.
 &HT;    Pineda y Covalin representan a una nueva generacion de mexicanos
que valora su origen. En octubre, mariachis tradicionales
participaron en los festejos de la inauguracion de sus nuevas
oficinas, mas espaciosas, en La Roma, un prospero barrio de Ciudad
de Mexico. Pero tambien han lanzado un website
(www.pinedacovalin.com) con todos sus disenos y con articulos a la
venta. Y mientras el negocio marcha bien, los dos empresarios
disfrutan tanto como al principio. ``Es divertido,'' afirma
Covalin. ``Me complace saber que ejercemos una influencia para que
los mexicanos se sientan orgullosos de nuestro rico pasado.''

<P>
   Not since the time of chaperones and high-button shoes has there
been such a direct means of keeping tabs on children.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, many parents have bought pagers and cell phones
to help them keep track of their teen-agers, although it is
impossible to say just how many. A result is a new balance in the
perennial struggle between parents' desire to know what their
teen-agers are doing (and where, and when, and with whom) and the
teen-agers' desire to have their parents back off.
</P>
<P>
   Parents may be happier with the electronic ties than their
teen-agers are. True, many teen-agers consider their pagers and
cell phones instruments of liberation, but others view them as yet
another means by which their parents can exert control. Annoyed at
constantly being summoned, they either insist that their parents do
so less often or they find ways to beat the system.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen-year-old Zan Morris, a ninth grader in San Anselmo,
Calif., an affluent community north of San Francisco, has owned a
pager for six months. Originally, Zan said, she wanted a pager so
her friends could get in touch with her. But now most of the pages
seem to come not so much from her friends as from her mother, she
said, and she is having second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just complicates matters, really,'' Zan said. ``Now it's
like I have kind of a dog chain on. If she pages me, I have to call
her back. She always has some kind of access to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she got her pager, Zan said, ``it felt almost as if I had
a little more freedom.'' She added that life with a pager made her
``feel kind of overwhelmed and cramped, like my personal space is
being invaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooke Fontaine, 16, a high school junior who lives in Brooklyn,
N.Y., has had her pager for four months. Although her mother does
not page her too much, sometimes Brooke has trouble figuring out
why her mother pages her at certain times and not at others, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while, if she calls home and can't get through
because I'm online or something, she'll page me,'' Brooke said.
``Other times, if I'm out with my friends and she doesn't know
where I am, she won't beep me.''
</P>
<P>
   Educating one's parents in the ways of appropriate pager and
cell phone use is important, those teen-agers with more experience
say.
</P>
<P>
   Maura Tuohy, 18, a high school senior in San Francisco, has had
her pager for two years and has reached a happy medium with her
mother. ``My mom doesn't page me on whims, like to ask me where I
put the cereal,'' Maura said. ``She just pages me if she wants to
know where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   At Maura's school, Lowell High School in San Francisco, Ray
Cordoba, a dean of students, estimates that about half of the
school's nearly 2,700 students carry pagers or cell phones, even
though that is against the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Maura and her mother also have codes to convey the urgency of
the page. Including 911 in the numeric message means that Maura
should call right away; 811 is less important, and 711 is ``call
whenever,'' Maura said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, pager codes are usually reserved for
friends. Maura and her friends use a set of codes popular among
teen-agers for conveying particular messages. Each number stands
for a letter or combination of letters. Some number sequences have
a meaning, too, like ``143'' for ``I love you,'' or ``411'' for
``What's going on?''
</P>
<P>
   Robi Tse, a classmate of Maura's, said she had listed the codes
for her mother. ``But she only knows `call home' or `call Mom,'''
Robi said. ``And that's all I want her to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Other teen-agers have gone to more extreme lengths to keep their
parents out of their social lives. Many of the teen-agers
interviewed said they kept their parents at arm's reach by doing
things like turning off their cell phones or telling white lies
about dead batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle Broude, 17, has had a pager for four years but has
tried to keep it a secret from her parents. That frees her to use
it to communicate with her friends _ and only with her friends.
``If my parents knew I had a pager, I don't think I'd keep it,''
said Danielle, who subscribes to the pager-as-leash school of
thought, at least if parents are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, however, Danielle's pager shows up around the
house. ``They've found it five or six times,'' she said, which has
led her to believe that her parents are on to her secret. What does
she tell her parents? ``I think up lies,'' she replied, ``like,
`Oh, it's Kathleen's, but she's out of town, so she let me borrow
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones are increasingly common among teen-agers, as
prepayment options give parents control over the volume of calls
and family plans reduce the cost of calls between parents and
children. A survey of 1,502 American households conducted last June
found that children had cell phones in 7 percent of families with
children, said Ken Hyers, an industry analyst with Cahners In-Stat
Group, the market research firm that conducted the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, however, not all teen-agers want to move from
pagers to cell phones, even given the higher level of status that a
cell phone offers.
</P>
<P>
   Some who were interviewed for this article said that if they had
a cell phone, they would not have enough time to think up a
plausible alibi before speaking with a parent. Receiving a page, on
the other hand, gives them ample time to fine-tune a story before
calling back.
</P>
<P>
   Elena Gonzalez, a high school senior in San Francisco, explained
why a teen-ager with a pager might encourage his or her parents to
stick to pager communications instead of calling the place where
the parents expect the teen-ager to be. ``If kids are spending the
night at places where their parents don't want them to be,'' she
explained, ``they can manipulate things by saying, `Just page
me.''' That, in effect, prevents the parent from knowing where the
child actually is. ``Lots of kids get away with it,'' Elena added.
</P>
<P>
   That may prove to be a short-lived ploy, however, as wireless
devices with built-in Global Positioning System trackers start to
come on the market. That represents a teen-ager's nightmare: being
in a position where parents can track every move.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Elena said her parents generally paged her only if they needed
her _ or, she added, if they found a hole in her account of where
she was or what she was doing. ``If your parents page you, it's `uh
oh, I'm in trouble,''' she said. ``So you find a quiet room and
call them back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali Endress, a high school senior in Greenbrae, Calif., north of
San Francisco, said she was glad that her parents had a way to
reach her. ``It has actually helped my parents loosen up a lot,''
she said. ``I think they like the fact that if I'm out late or if
I'm going to the city or far away, they can always get ahold of me.
It's definitely given me more freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   But that freedom is closely managed, from both sides. Some
months ago, Ali lost her pager. ``It just disappeared,'' she said.
``My parents didn't believe me at first because I quote lost it so
many times before, so it took a while for them to understand that I
had actually lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she now had a cell phone with one especially attractive
feature: ``When it rings, it has built-in Caller ID. And if it says
Home is calling, I can hit a button and it sends it to the voice
mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Some teen-agers are unwilling to carry around any kind of
in-loco-parentis technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Evan Losow, 16, a high school junior in Queens,
N.Y., who uses neither a cell phone nor a pager. `It's a leash at
this age,'' he said. ``When I'm out of the house, I'm out for a
reason. I really don't want people to contact me. If I'm in school,
the only people who need to contact me are my friends, and they're
there with me.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents trust him, Evan said. ``When I say I'm going to a
movie or wherever, they trust me,'' he said. ``If something
happens, I have quarters with me, and I just use a pay phone.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still early for many academic studies of pager and cell
phone use, but for some who study families, the technology offers a
new twist on an old theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids have always felt kind of tethered _ that's part of being
a teen-ager,'' said Laurence Steinberg, a psychology professor at
Temple University.
</P>
<P>
   Pagers and cell phones can be a good thing for teen-agers, he
said. ``They probably end up giving them more freedom, not less,
but in a good way,'' Steinberg said, ``because one of the
challenges that faces parents and teens today that didn't face them
25 years ago was the challenge of having two parents out working,
with different schedules and travel.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said that in research on latchkey children, employers
reported that the quality of their employees' work began to slip
after 3 p.m. every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't get any good work out of them because they were
so worried about where their kids were,'' Steinberg said. ``But now
if this technology has made it easier for working parents to stay
in touch with their kids, that's a win-win-win situation. Good for
parents, good for kids and good for employers.''
</P>
<P>
   Good, that is, if you can keep tabs on the pager itself. Pagers
are small, and teen-agers are famously absent-minded. Pagers are
routinely swept under beds, left on hot dashboards, dropped on hard
pavement and put through the wash.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty of the pager's whereabouts raises the anxiety
level a notch or two, not necessarily for the teen-agers but for
the parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she's not wearing the pager and I page her several times, I
get more uptight or anxious,'' said Zan Morris' mother, Gail,
``because I think, `Wait a minute, she's got a pager.'''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Tse, Robi's mother, has similar frustrations. ``Sometimes
she leaves it at home and it's buzzing like crazy,'' Tse said.
``One night I was paging her and I could hear it in the other
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamara Hareven, a professor of family studies and history at the
University of Delaware, said that apart from the chaperones who
went along on many dates at the beginning of the 20th century, she
saw few precedents for the kind of supervision a parent gets with a
pager or cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Hareven said, the principle of parental supervision
of teen-agers' behavior has been in place since the age of the
Puritans, who were so concerned about disciplining their teen-age
children properly that they sent them to live in other people's
homes. ``Parents did not trust themselves to sufficiently
discipline their own teen-age children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always an anxiety about raising them properly, and
about their conforming to basic rules,'' Hareven said. But the
numerous attempts on the part of parents to supervise the behavior
of young adults were not necessarily effective even during the
Puritans' time, she added, because even the Puritans were
confronted by premarital pregnancies.

DO FLOPPIES WEAR OUT?

   Q. Can floppy disks go bad over time? Are recordable CDs a more
permanent solution for long-term data archiving?
</P>
<P>
   A. A year seems to be the expected life span of floppies, but
your mileage may vary with frequency of use and how you store them.
Conditions like heat, humidity, dust and dirt can affect the
magnetic surface of the disk, causing erosion that takes your
stored files with it.
</P>
<P>
   Because the data is stored magnetically, exposure to nearby
magnetic fields (including other floppies) can cause problems as
well. To preserve the lives of your floppy disks for as long as
possible, keep them in a cool, dry place, away from dust, and try
not to stack them on top of one another.
</P>
<P>
   Recordable CDs, or CD-Rs, do have a much longer life span when
stored properly and are better for long-term storage. CDs, which
record data optically when a laser etches the data into dye on the
reflective surface of the disc, are not affected my magnetic
fields, although heat, dirt and dust can alter the reflective
surface and cause problems.
</P>
<P>
   CD-Rs made with cyanine, a dye that gives them a greenish color,
are thought to last between 70 and 100 years, while gold-colored
discs made with phthalocyanine dye have a life expectancy of 200
years, based on accelerated-age testing.
</P>
<P>
   Exposure to humidity, sunlight or harsh cleaning solutions can
gradually break down the dye on the disc's surface, rendering the
data on it unreadable.
</P>
<P>
   CD-RWs, rewritable CDs that let you copy and recopy data to the
disc, have a shorter life expectancy than CD-Rs _ an estimated 30
years. CD-ROMs, which are not recordable, are sturdier and thought
to last about 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   To safely store your CDs, keep them out of the sun and wipe off
smudges and fingerprints with a soft, lint-free cloth. Ballpoint
pens can scratch the surface, so use a felt-tip marker to write on
the disc if you need to label it. Handle your CDs by the edge and
keep them in their cases in a cool place with low humidity for the
best care.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In Kiersten L. Johnson's 10th-grade humanities class,
students have been asked to consider the nature of forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson pops a tape into the VCR, and the 15 students, seated in
two facing banks of metal desks, watch a news report by Bill Moyers
on South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They become
somber as a black victim of police torture tells how he was dangled
from a window of the room where Steve Biko, the anti-apartheid
leader, was fatally beaten. The tape rolls on and the moral issues
become more complex. A white South African faces three young black
militants who killed his wife in a fusillade of bullets and
grenades during a 1993 attack on a church in a Cape Town suburb.
</P>
<P>
   As they shift edgily in their seats, the students grapple with a
thorny question: Is it morally easier to pardon the actions of the
militants than the white police torturers?
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have whipped him and let him off,'' says Diaby
Moyabi Mohammad, 16, referring to the black militant who apologized
for the attack on the church. ``Some people just wanted to hear the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay Dawson, 15, disagrees. ``I think you should take
responsibility, but there should also be punishment,'' he says,
arguing that the man should face the death penalty. ``Because
without punishment there are no consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's class, at the East Side Community High School on the
Lower East Side, is nearing the end of the kind of course that once
would have been confined to explicitly religious schools or private
institutions like the Ethical Culture School. Her students are not
only learning world history and politics, but how to make hard
moral choices in a world of both apartheid and terrorists fighting
its injustice, a world of Holocausts and of bystanders who never
protested its horrors.
</P>
<P>
   This particular program is called Facing History and Ourselves
and is one of a number being taught in the New York City region as
moral education has found a growing place in American schools.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the upsurge reflects a growing concern about school
violence. ``Every time you hear of a school shooting, there's a
renewed cry for this,'' said Joan F. Goodman, a professor at the
Graduate School of Education at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   But the push for lessons in ethics also comes from educators,
who perceive an unsettling shift in students' attitudes and
behavior, said Karen E. Bohlin, director for the Center for the
Advancement of Ethics and Character at Boston University,
</P>
<P>
   ``Many teachers testify that there is a growing lack of respect
for other human beings in terms of language, basic courtesy and
bullying, just a real breakdown in healthy relationships,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, New York State received a $1 million federal grant for
``character education,'' to support pilot programs in four school
districts to teach ``caring, self-reliance, trustworthiness, and
open-mindedness,'' among other virtues.
</P>
<P>
   When the programs begin in September, said Vito J. Borello,
president of Every Person Influences Children, the nonprofit group
that is managing the funds, it will be the first time the state has
specifically focused on teaching morality. Yet New York is
certainly not the first state to enter the game. Character-building
classes are now officially mandated in 10 states _ up from five
just two years ago _ and such classes are encouraged in seven other
states, said Esther F. Schaeffer, executive director of the
Character Education Partnership, a national nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the Facing History curriculum, which usually
centers on the Holocaust but also has classes on the apartheid and
civil rights eras, is being taught in about 200 of the city's
public and private schools, including the Center School and the
Dual Language Middle School, both in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Such lessons are not without their critics. Some feel the
promotion of virtue in the classroom can easily border on religious
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right is worried it's going to be excessively liberal and
permissive humanism,'' Goodman said. ``The political left is
concerned that schools are going to start preaching to children.''
</P>
<P>
   Others criticize some of the programs for having a prefabricated
curriculum, which may produce orderly behavior but does not build
character. ``Many of those commercial programs even have
multiple-choice questions to measure kids' absorption of the
correct virtues,'' said Alfie Kohn, an author who writes about
moral education. ``Some contain simplistic little stories, at the
end of which the lead character says, ``I will never be selfish
again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson took a weeklong course with Facing History, a nonprofit
organization created in 1976 by Margo Stern Strong, a middle school
teacher in Brookline, Mass. Its programs now reach about a million
students each year. Johnson said she wanted to incorporate moral
lessons into her curriculum not for fear of gunfire in her
classroom, but because these particular teaching methods would
strengthen her humanities course work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in 10th grade and all they care about is their
existence,'' she said. ``We're using that natural curiosity about
the self and the identity and layering it on the curriculum to get
them interested.''
</P>
<P>
   The students grapple with material that is tough for many
adults, like the degradation of European Jews that eventually led
to the Holocaust, or attacks on black children who integrated
schools in the South.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the students are asked to turn history's lessons
on themselves. One of Johnson's students, Ila K. McCall, 15, said
her teacher asked her whether she viewed the homeless any
differently after learning that the white South African government
once regularly seized property from blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking at people on the street and saying `Yuck,''' she
said. ``But now I know that just because you live on the street
doesn't mean you're not a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's students did not go home with a featherweight load. As
she concluded her section on the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, Jason A. Pizarro, 16, remarked that some black
militants were probably responding to the conditions in which they
were reared.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you grow up in violence, is that an excuse for violence?''
Johnson asked as the class came to an end. ``Most of us have
witnessed violence in our own lives. If we think that's the case,
how do we ever achieve peace?''

ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS AGREE ON LATEST WEST BANK HANDOVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Overcoming a dispute that had frozen peace efforts
for weeks, Israel and the Palestinians agreed Wednesday on the area
of a further handover of West Bank territory to Palestinian
control, and the transfer was approved by the Israeli security
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement removed a persistent stumbling block to the
resumption of negotiations on a permanent peace. The talks are
scheduled to resume on March 20 in Washington before moving back to
the Middle East, with the aim of reaching a framework agreement in
May and a final peace accord by September 13.
</P>
<P>
   The latest handover, which is supposed to be ratified at a
meeting of the full Israeli Cabinet on Sunday, will put another 6.1
percent of the West Bank under full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian negotiators agreed on maps delineating
the areas to be handed over, and the transfer is expected to take
place as early as Sunday, leaving the Palestinians in full or
partial control of 42.9 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The areas to be ceded by Israel include several Palestinian
villages and towns around the cities of Ramallah, Bethlehem and
Hebron. Palestinian officials said they chose the areas from a map
of 10 percent of the West Bank submitted by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians had suspended negotiations last month,
complaining that the Israelis were trying to dictate the terms of
the land transfer without prior consultation.
</P>
<P>
   However, demands by the Palestinians to receive villages
adjacent to East Jerusalem, which they view as their future
capital, were not met, at least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel decided against a proposed
handover of the village of Anata, abutting Jerusalem's city limits,
after members of his fractious coalition, including right-leaning
ministers in his Cabinet, raised strong objections. The decision
highlighted Barak's political vulnerability as he tries to forge a
peace agreement while keeping his coalition together.
</P>
<P>
   Education Minister Yossi Sarid of the leftist Meretz party, who
abstained in Wednesday's security Cabinet vote, said that the map
of areas to be handed to the Palestinians had ``been drawn with a
coalition pencil,'' raising questions about Barak's freedom to
maneuver in the more weighty negotiations that lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, the leader of the opposition Likud party, said
that in consulting with the Palestinians about the areas of
withdrawal, Barak had ``folded,'' and a Likud statement accused the
prime minister of ``surrendering to the dictates'' of the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials said that they expected to receive areas
near East Jerusalem in a third and final Israeli pullback under the
terms of interim self-rule accords. That withdrawal, still to be
negotiated, is supposed to leave Israel in control of only
settlements and military locations, but the interpretation of those
terms remains in sharp dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Talks on a permanent peace will focus on the most profoundly
divisive issues separating the two sides: the future of Jerusalem,
settlements, Palestinian refugees, and the delineation of borders.
</P>
<P>
   The security Cabinet also approved the release of an undisclosed
number of Palestinian prisoners on the forthcoming Muslim holiday
of Eid al-Adha, the Feast of the Sacrifice.

SELLING WOOFERS AND TWEETERS TO THE SANER SEX 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   My husband and I see eye to eye on a lot of life's important
issues, including the wisdom of sleeping in, traveling without
children and dark rum over light. But when it comes to buying
stereo speakers, there is some mild disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   Me: ``What are those huge, huge, ugly brown tower things sitting
in the middle of the living room? And where did you put the
couch?''
</P>
<P>
   Him: ``I moved it to the kitchen so it wouldn't distort the
sound. Listen to that bass.''
</P>
<P>
   Me (screaming to be heard over blaring stereo): ``Why do I see
seven separate cords running across the floor?''
</P>
<P>
   Him (playing air guitar): ``Eight. I'll tape them down.''
</P>
<P>
   I always thought the reason we had such conflicting attitudes
was obvious. I have taste and he, well, is insane. But now, some
people who sell those big, loud, blaring stereo things online tell
me that I have been wrong. It turns out that my husband and I are
cliches in the battle of the sexes. In other words, the old
stereotype is true: Men love electronics. Women don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical marketing words like `room-shaking bass' and `big
black box' just do not appeal to women,'' said Maria Cataldo, a
spokeswoman for Hifi.com, which has been selling consumer
electronics online since 1994. ``Last year we surveyed 1,000 women
and found that more than 50 percent said they were intimidated
about buying consumer electronics. But at the same time, women
account for 22 percent of consumer electronics sales, so it was
crazy that their needs have not been met.''
</P>
<P>
   Deciding that women were an untapped market, Hifi.com last month
introduced a sort of sister site, called Herhifi.com
(www.herhifi.com).
</P>
<P>
   Herhifi.com sells the same 900 stereos, televisions, DVD
players, speakers and radios as Hifi.com but in a very different
way. For instance, in addition to listing products in traditional
categories like home theater, multimedia or video, Herhifi.com
sells things by room. So if you want to buy a stereo, you can click
on Living Room.
</P>
<P>
   When I heard about the strategy, my first reaction was negative.
I figured that sort of approach must be bad, because it would
perpetuate stereotypes about male and female roles. I also thought
it sounded condescending toward women; I don't see anyone rushing
to put up Web sites like Hiswallpaper.com aimed at
shopping-impaired men. And worst, I thought it might give my
husband (who just last week bought a new roll of wide black duct
tape) the mistaken impression that he was sane, after all.
</P>
<P>
   But then I tested both Herhifi.com and Hifi.com, and I have to
say, I liked Herhifi.com a lot more than Hifi.com, which gave me a
headache with its screaming orange and blue type, its animated DVD
players and a headline that announced a ``Surround Sound Sale.'' In
contrast, Herhifi.com offered tasteful backgrounds of pale yellow,
deep purple and leaf green, an uncluttered design and a picture of
a woman with hair like me washing her face in a bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   After I clicked on Shop by Room, the screen filled with the
sorts of soothing, gentle images _ including a sun-filled dining
room and a bunch of purple grapes drying beside a kitchen sink _
that I would expect to see in a home decorating magazine (yes, I
indulge) but not a consumer electronics catalog.
</P>
<P>
   I clicked on the grapes and arrived at a carefully edited
selection of items in four categories _ phones, shelf stereo
systems, televisions and radios _ appropriate for use in the
kitchen. The $49.99 Sony Kitchen Clock Radio, for example, can be
mounted under a kitchen cabinet. It comes in a nice, clean shade of
white.
</P>
<P>
   But I was a little concerned when I read the description: ``Its
clock doubles as a kitchen timer.'' Had I found evidence of sexism?
Did this language imply that I, as a woman, would be more likely to
need a kitchen timer than a man?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, I gritted my teeth against the orange blare and
used Hifi.com's Shop by Product search feature. I clicked on Home
Audio and then on the Radios subcategory and arrived at a long list
that included the Sony clock radio. The description was the same;
Hifi.com acknowledged the fact that men, too, need kitchen timers.
</P>
<P>
   During another 20 minutes of searching, I realized I could not
find one thing on the Herhifi.com site that offended me. In fact, I
actually appreciated the Knowledge Builder feature, which answered
some of the questions that have been bugging me, like: ``What size
TV do I need? Is there such a thing as too big or too small?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was because the site's color scheme mimicked my dining
room's, but after a while, I realized that for the first time in my
life, I felt like buying electronics items. Shaken, I logged off
and sought advice from Tina Pieraccini, a communications studies
professor at the State University of New York at Oswego, whose
research focuses on the effects of media on women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is going to be very much like magazines have been
since the 1700s, targeting very specific audiences in different
ways,'' she said. ``I would be concerned if these sites were very
sexist, but it doesn't sound as if they are; they're just appealing
in different ways. I think there are going to be a lot more of
these sites popping up.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Autobytel.com, which sells cars online, is another
example, having recently introduced a For Her informational section
for female car buyers. For Her offers articles on topics like how
to keep your tires in top condition and tips on remaining calm when
there is a teen-age driver in the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that women are not necessarily as interested in
the same things men are when they are shopping for cars,'' said
Tracey McCarter, who directs Autobytel's women's programs. ``But
that doesn't mean we're coddling women. We have information both
about safety and about horsepower.''
</P>
<P>
   This online trend of selling to the sexes will continue.
Considering the cost of doing business in a physical space in the
real world, the Internet is a cheap laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Web, you have the opportunity to present people with an
almost infinite variety of approaches,'' said Roland T. Rust, a
management professor at Vanderbilt University whose research
focuses on advertising and customer satisfaction. ``What these
sites are trying to do in their initial halting, crude way is to
create a personal experience that's unique to the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   So we can expect even more of this _ shopping sites aimed at
teen-agers who like a certain band or dog lovers who own two or
more Border collies. People who like the song ``American Pie.'' The
far larger group of (sane) people who hate the song. I know I was
disappointed to learn that the domain name DarkRum.com is no longer
available.

SOUTH FOUGHT TO PRESERVE SLAVERY, HISTORIANS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Texas _ It's not only South Carolina. The Confederate
battle flag remains a potent symbol, angering some, pleasing
others, right here in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the current debate is research into what Southern
soldiers actually thought they were fighting for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our understanding of the relationship between slavery and the
Civil War changed before the war, during the war and every decade
since the war,'' said Ed Ayers, a University of Virginia historian.
``The trick is to realize that slavery was absolutely fundamental
to the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the South went to war, a powerful wave of Confederate
patriotism swept the region, and many whites marched off to war to
defend their home and hearth, many scholars say. Although few
Confederates discussed slavery in their letters and diaries,
significantly, none wrote in favor of abolition.
</P>
<P>
   Buster Wayne Desselles Jr., 41, a colorful fringe candidate in
Tuesday's Democratic primary for a Texas Legislature seat, is so
convinced that the Confederate icon is a positive symbol that he
used its design for dozens of campaign yard signs.
</P>
<P>
   Running in Navarro, Henderson and Freestone counties, which make
up District 12, he printed 2,500 fliers with a photo of himself
dressed as a rebel general leaning against a draped battle flag.
</P>
<P>
   The East Texas freight-line pilot, who describes himself as
``hanging off the right side'' of the Democratic party, said he
used the flag ``as an attention getter,'' noting ``all of the
recent hoopla'' about it in South Carolina, Texas and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People has called for the removal of Confederate plaques
from the Texas Supreme Court building, the end to the practice of
flying the battle flag at schools and the scrapping of a planned
Confederate monument outside the Grimes County Courthouse in
Anderson, north of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gov. George W. Bush said he would look into the issue
of the Supreme Court plaque. Before the Republican Primary in South
Carolina, Bush said the state's residents should decide whether the
battle flag should continue flying over the state Capitol. This
presents a clear point of difference with Democratic presidential
contender Al Gore, who has urged South Carolinians to take down the
flag.
</P>
<P>
   To many Southern whites, the plaques and battle flag recall a
noble but lost cause.
</P>
<P>
   Most African-Americans contend that that cause was the
preservation of slavery, which many whites in the region dispute,
saying that the war was fought over states' rights and inequitable
tariffs. Complicating the issue has been the wholesale adoption of
the flag as an emblem by the Ku Klux Klan and other white racist
groups.
</P>
<P>
   But what did Johnny Reb himself think he was fighting for?
</P>
<P>
   The answer that slavery was a fundamental cause for the
secession won't please descendants of Confederate soldiers.
Although it hasn't filtered down to much of the Southern public,
much research has been done in recent years on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Ayers has launched an ambitious Web site _
http:/valley.vcdh.virginia.edu _ that chronicles the wartime views
of two Shenandoah Valley communities, one Northern, the other
Southern. It taps letters, diaries, military records and 30,000
pages from local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Virginia community, they are always determined to keep
slavery,'' said Ayers, a native Tennessean. ``That's a constant.
But the strategies they used to keep slavery varied widely. The
answer is not going to fit on a bumper sticker.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 book, ``For Cause &AMP; Comrades'' by Pulitzer Prize winner
James M. McPherson of Princeton University, is based on 25,000
letters and 249 diaries of Civil War soldiers from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   A far higher percentage of Northern soldiers cited in the book
debated slavery in their writings than their Southern foes. Only 20
percent of 429 Rebels mentioned slavery, while more than twice that
percentage of Yankees did.
</P>
<P>
   Although slavery and emancipation were contentious issues in the
North, the South just didn't have a need to rehash the arguments,
McPherson said.
</P>
<P>
   Confederate enlisted men and officers, he found, ``took slavery
for granted as one of the Southern `rights' and institutions for
which they fought and did not feel compelled to discuss it.''
</P>
<P>
   McPherson noted that although just ``20 percent of the soldiers
avowed explicit pro-slavery purposes in their letters and diaries,
none at all dissented from that view.''
</P>
<P>
   When he's asked the war's causes, McPherson gives a two-part
answer:
</P>
<P>
   After Abraham Lincoln was elected president without a single
Southern electoral vote, the South seceded because it could no
longer control the political situation for the long-term survival
of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Once the war started, Confederate soldiers fought to defend
their homes, their country, their constitution. And that's what
many contemporary white Southerners dwelt on, although virtually
all university-based, professional historians accept the view that
slavery was the underpinning cause of the war, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Historians said most Confederate letter writers used euphemisms
for ``preserving slavery,'' saying they fought to protect
``Southern liberties and institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   But some were blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country without slave labor would be completely
worthless,'' William Nugent, a lieutenant with a Mississippi
regiment, wrote to his wife in 1863. ``We can only live &AMP; exist by
that species of labor: and hence I am willing to fight to the
last.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The vandals of the North ... are determined to destroy
slavery,'' a young Kentucky physician, Lunsford Yandell Jr., wrote
his slave-owning relatives. ``We must all fight, and I choose to
fight for Southern rights and Southern liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that a sense of honor, patriotism and a
desire to defend one's home from ``rapacious Yankees'' were not
important motivating factors in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go to war for all sorts of reasons,'' said Joseph T.
Glatthaar, a military historian at the University of Houston and
author of three Civil War books. ``But the reality is that the
Southerners knew they were fighting for the institution of
slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   When Southerners marched off to war, they clearly knew what
their leaders had decreed, Glatthaar said.
</P>
<P>
   The first reason Mississippi cited in its declaration of
secession was the ``institution of slavery, the greatest material
interest of the world.'' When Texas seceded, it cited ``the
servitude of the African to the white race'' as justification and
simultaneously outlawed the freeing of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens declared that the
new nation's ``cornerstone rests upon the great truth that the
Negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery ... is his
natural and normal condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Southerners argue that the war couldn't have been fought
over slavery because only 25 percent of Confederate soldiers owned
slaves. But slaveholding represented wealth and status in the South
and many of those not in the slave-owning class strove to join it,
said Steven Woodworth, a historian at Texas Christian University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a universal human characteristic that everyone wants to
believe their heritage contains noble elements,'' Ayers said.
``Just being defensive and refusing to acknowledge the full
complexity of the situation faced by our ancestors doesn't honor
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice isn't Simon Legree and Robert E. Lee,'' Ayers said,
referring to the evil slave driver of ``Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and
Lee, the respected Confederate commander. ``Many Southerners
balanced a love for Union and belief that slavery was God's plan
for America but were tortured by it.''

A BIC MAN LAMENTS:   IT'S MY PEN! DON'T CHANGE IT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK MARIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A pen is a pen, you'd think. Especially a ballpoint. You lose
it, you buy another for $2.99. They stop making your kind, you
switch. No biggie.
</P>
<P>
   No. Biggie.
</P>
<P>
   My pen is my life. Literally. Bic's four-color ballpoint is the
organizing principle of my day-planner diary: blue for work-related
entries; red for personal; black for illness, public appearances
and acts of God; green for miscellaneous ``creative projects.''
Much more than just a pen, it's my Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   You know the pen I'm talking about: fat plastic barrel with four
plungers _ blue, red, black and green _ at the top. Maybe you had
one in school and thought they stopped making them. They haven't.
What they have done is changed them in a small but unsettling way.
</P>
<P>
   The change that threw my system out of whack is not even a
functional one, but an aesthetic issue. The blue plunger at the top
of the medium-point pen was always the same color as the bottom
half of the barrel: light blue. They matched. Then, suddenly, they
didn't. The plunger is now navy.
</P>
<P>
   A person would have to be both a design fetishist and obsessive
about this particular pen even to notice a detail like this. I am
that person.
</P>
<P>
   Like my writer friend who says magazine redesigns give him
anxiety attacks, or the legions of M&AMP;M traditionalists who freaked
out when they brought in blue, I realized that the god of small
things is vengeful indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Switching to keyboard control, I e-mailed the Bic Corp. in
Milford, Conn. Although Bic 4Cs are still stamped ``Made in
France'' (by Bic's French parent company), they are packaged here.
I asked what the deal was with the new color and got an explanation
from Linda K. Kwong in corporate communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change you noted was made to be closer to the actual blue
ink color,'' she e-mailed back.
</P>
<P>
   Such literalism! After all these years, consumers are actually
going to think that a light-blue plunger means light-blue ink? Is
this really a concern worthy of the attentions of a global
conglomerate that sells 21 million stationery products a day?
</P>
<P>
   I pummeled Kwong with more questions.
</P>
<P>
   _ When was the 4C introduced?
</P>
<P>
   _ When was the color of the plunger changed to navy?
</P>
<P>
   _ When would I be able to speak to Bruno Bich, who has run the
company since his father, Baron Marcel Bich, died in 1994?
</P>
<P>
   She politely obliged:
</P>
<P>
   _ The baron (pronounced  &UR; beek)  &LR; introduced the pen in France in
April 1970, a year later in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ The covert color change occurred in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   _ Monsieur Bich was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   No sales figures on the 4C would be released. ``Fun factoids''
were offered instead. The pen is a favorite among students and
nurses, who use different colors on medical charts for each shift.
The first advertisement in France boasted ``3 francs for 4
colors.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a fine-point version, with a bright orange barrel,
but I prefer the medium-point.
</P>
<P>
   Kwong noted that the 4C ``has a unique little white ball at the
top (representing the famous `Bic boy' head _ from the Bic
trademark) that was used to dial a number on the old rotary
phones.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``old rotary phones'' line made me feel as much like a
kooky '70s relic as the pen. I do remember my mother using a
two-color blue-and-red version back then so she could do double
crossword puzzles. But I wasn't using the 4C for nostalgic reasons.
I didn't seek it out until about five years ago when I started this
obsessive-compulsive rainbow diary thing. Also because it looks
cool and no one else I know uses one. The only other person I've
ever seen brandish a 4C was a young city reporter. ``You never run
out of ink,'' he said flatly, pointing to an attribute that never
would have occurred to me.
</P>
<P>
   Fixated on the pen as industrial design object, I tried to find
out who invented it. The Bic people were no help here. They cited
only an ``internal team.'' Many of the 20th century's most
innovative product designers were fated to corporate anonymity,
said Donald Albrecht, a guest curator at the National Design
Triennial at the Cooper-Hewitt museum. ``Trying to reclaim the
history of these things is really hard,'' he said. ``The brand
becomes the designer, and the company forgets after a while who
designed its products.''
</P>
<P>
   I then e-mailed Steven Skov Holt, another curator of the
Triennial. Holt calls himself a ``visionary and vice president of
creative culture'' at Frog Design, a product and graphic design
firm based in San Francisco. He relayed the following thoughts:
</P>
<P>
   ``On the positive side, the Bic 4C represented one of the early
triumphs of democracy-in-design action. The pen was made to be
popular, accessible and inexpensive. The consumer was given a
semblance of choice, with each of the pen's cardinal directions
representing a particular color ink. Arguably, it was part of a
small group of products that combined over a period of time to
create the `expectation of color choice' that today's iMac has so
compellingly capitalized on.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued:
</P>
<P>
   ``On the negative side, the Bic 4C came out at a time when pens
were made to be disposable. It represented the apotheosis of
disposable writing instruments _ the frankly terrible notion that
not only could resources be tossed aside once even a portion of
them was used up, but the idea that entire mechanisms could be
disposed of wholesale as well. Ecologically speaking, the Bic 4C
was a couple of cartridges short of a six-pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Not being a visionary, I'm not troubled by the eco-wastefulness.
If anything, the pen's disposable '70s decadence makes me like it
even more.
</P>
<P>
   I've always hated change, and this whole pen business has
reminded me of that bad character trait. Forced to adapt, I will
press on somehow, as long as they don't mess with my Week
At-a-Glance.

   MOSCOW _ Nadia Gorovaya is a 19-year-old Russian architecture
student who counts The Verve and The Beatles among her favorite
musical groups. She loves art, and spends free time hanging out
with friends in Moscow's budding cafe culture. She and her mother
live in a tidy one-bedroom apartment on this city's northern
outskirts. On March 26, Nadia will be able to cast a vote for the
first time choosing the person who will lead Russia for the next
four years. She spoke recently with Cox Newspapers Moscow
correspondent Margaret Coker on her thoughts about politics and
teen-age life in her country.
</P>
<P>
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
</P>
<P>
   Question: Your generation is the first to come of age after the
Cold War. How are you and your friends different from your parents?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: We are very different. Me and my friends have a much
wider outlook and have access to much more information. We also
have more responsibility and more choice. Previously, (your life)
was more or less pre-determined. You graduated and knew what was in
store for you. You did what was required. Now, even though life is
rather hard, more depends on the person's own effort.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is your view of America and the rest of the world
different?
</P>
<P>
   A: The borders are now open and many of my friends and I travel
a lot. It's one of the things I like most. I get a fresh look at
things and new impressions. (This opportunity) is much more
realistic for us than it was for our parents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think are the best, and the worst changes in your
country since the end of the Soviet Union?
</P>
<P>
   A: To me, the best thing is democracy, the ability to say what
you think freely even if the government doesn't like what you say.
Now, we have some freedom of choice. The worst thing is that all of
this is not yet properly protected. Our laws don't really work all
of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would your older relatives answer this question the same way?
</P>
<P>
   A: In principle, they all agree with me. Although my father, for
example, who belongs to the democratic camp and does not want the
restoration of the old regime, believes there were some advantages
in the Soviet times, like free education and free health-care.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think about the political situation in Russia?
</P>
<P>
   A: I do not like what is happening now. I think the authorities
are thinking for the most part about power, money, prestige and
very little about what they ought to be thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think your leaders should be paying attention to?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the first place, to social programs, raising people's
living standards because the majority of the population are very
poor. The government must develop the economy, private business,
promote private property.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you discuss politics with your friends?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, with some. Not of all my friends are interested. I've
found they usually share the views of their parents. In these
elections, I think many of my friends are going to vote like their
parents
</P>
<P>
   Q: For whom will you vote?
</P>
<P>
   A: For Gregory Yavlinsky (the leader of the liberal political
party Yabloko).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think he is the most democratic candidate. His party, I
think, is the most honest and the most decent. His program is aimed
at the development of all of Russia, especially promoting private
property. There are so many issues I like. For example, Yavlinsky
opposes the war in Chechnya and says it should be stopped.
Unfortunately, I know he will lose. There is no alternative to
Putin in these elections, but I do not want to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you think the winner is obvious, then why bother voting at
all?
</P>
<P>
   A: If I do not go to the polls, my ballot may be used somehow to
falsify the results. It is my choice. I do not want to vote for
someone else only because everybody else votes for him. I do not
want this to happen. There will be few of us voting for Yabloko,
but maybe it will give rise to the hope of this happening in
future.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did you first learn about democracy?
</P>
<P>
   A: We studied it a bit in history class in high school, but, of
course, it is not enough. We studied the American system some. I
read books for myself to find out what the principles are.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have visited America. Did you like our way of life? Do
you think it is better?
</P>
<P>
   A: You have a higher standard of living compared to Russia. Of
course, that is better. Your college graduates know they will be
able to find a job. It is hard for U.S. families to pay for
education, but at least you have a banking and loan system that
makes it possible to repay all costs. Americans can travel, change
jobs, feel the police protects them. Your courts are really
unbiased in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   My friends really like America. They think everything is great
there. But I think there are negative things about your country,
too. People pay too much attention to superficial things, not to
culture or the soul. You can find anything in the stores, sometimes
even 100 kinds of soap. But what about theater or good books?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you follow the news? Read newspapers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, I do. Not very regularly, but I do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know about the American elections?
</P>
<P>
   A: That you have now two candidates _ Democrat Al Gore and
Republican George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were an American for whom would you vote?
</P>
<P>
   A: I know less about American politics ... Not that I do not
care at all, but I know much less about your candidates than mine.
I don't know who I would vote for, honestly. I think Democrats, as
a party, are closer to my views.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you see your life in five years?
</P>
<P>
   A: I do not know. What makes life in Russia both fascinating and
a little frightening is that you do not know what's in store for
you tomorrow. You do not know what life is going to be like in one
or two years, let alone in five. I do hope it will get better. In
principle, I am an optimist. But judging by what is happening now,
I'm not sure. If Putin comes to power it will be a regime based on
a ``strong hand.'' I do not think he'll bring about more reforms.

&HT;     CALIFORNIA EXECUTES KILLER, RAPIST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With a sacred white eagle feather draped
diagonally across his chest to signify his American Indian
heritage, Darrell Keith Rich softly drew his last breath early
Wednesday and became the first Californian executed this year.
</P>
<P>
   A confessed serial killer and rapist who terrorized Shasta
County for a two months in 1978, Rich was pronounced dead at 12:13
a.m. Wednesday, seven minutes after state prison employees began
pumping a deadly mixture of fluids into his vein.
</P>
<P>
   His final statement to the world: ``Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   That same word was on the mind of a woman Rich raped 22 years
ago. She watched impassively as her tormenter twitched and died
from the lethal cocktail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can finally live in peace,'' the woman, whose full name has
never been made public, said in a statement. ``He won't be there to
haunt me anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who said earlier she suffered two decades of
nightmares after Rich snatched her off a rural road and raped her,
silently held hands with the relatives of five other victims during
the execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too easy for Darrell Keith Rich after what he put us
through for 22 years,'' said another witness to the execution,
Peggy Eastwood. Rich killed her sister, Annette Edwards, by
crushing her skull with a rock after he raped her on July 4, 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen victims and relatives traveled to the San Quentin
Prison for the execution, but the authorities had room for just six
of them in the viewing area adjacent to the death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Rich, 45, was convicted of killing four women and sexually
assaulting five others.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted all the crimes, including the rape of a neighbor,
11-year-old Annette Selix. After he raped her, he threw her off a
105-foot bridge near Lake Shasta. Clad only in her underpants, she
lived long enough to inhale her own blood and crawl into the fetal
position.
</P>
<P>
   Rich was given the death penalty for the Selix killing and the
murder of 28-year-old Linda Slavik. The other convictions resulted
in prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gov. Gray Davis denied Rich's request for clemency,
saying ``There is absolutely nothing about Mr. Rich's brutal
behavior that warrants clemency.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a Democrat who ran on a pro-capital punishment and
tough-on-crime platform, now has denied three clemency pleas since
January 1999. Neither Davis nor his predecessor, Republican Gov.
Pete Wilson, accepted a clemency plea in the eight years since
executions have resumed in California.
</P>
<P>
   Rich spent his last hours praying with his two spiritual
advisers and meeting with lawyer James Thomson. His last meal
consisted of beef broth, papaya juice and Gatorade. ``It was a
rather Spartan meal at his request,'' said Department of
Corrections spokesman Bob Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Strapped into a gurney with wide leather bindings, the doomed
man looked straight ahead and showed no emotion when the curtain to
the small death chamber was opened to the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   As the lethal chemicals were pumped into his body, his jaw
clenched but his breathing continued, then slowed. Several minutes
later, his chest convulsed a couple of times. Then he stopped
moving.
</P>
<P>
   The foot-long Indian ceremonial feather quivered with each
breath. It became still as Rich's chest stopped moving.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, a guard in the witness room received a
small slip of paper passed through a portal in the door. The guard
read it, then announced that Rich had served his death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Rich was injected with sodium pentothal to put him to sleep,
pancuronium bromide to arrest his breathing and potassium chloride
to stop his heart.
</P>
<P>
   He became the eighth murderer executed in California since the
state resumed capital punishment in 1992, following a hiatus of
more than a quarter of a century.
</P>
<P>
   Rich, one-quarter Cherokee, was the first American Indian
executed by the state in that period.
</P>
<P>
   The last Californian to be executed was Vietnam veteran Manuel
Babbitt, killed by injection last May for murdering a 78-year-old
Sacramento woman during a robbery and attempted rape in 1980.

SITE SEES A SURE THING IN BASKETBALL CONTEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems like an audacious gamble for a small dot-com that lost
more than $6 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sandbox.com, one of the several thousand Internet start-ups in
the Washington area scrabbling for attention and wealth, is putting
on a rich sweepstakes based on the men's college basketball
tournament that begins on Thursday, promising to pay $10 million to
anyone who correctly chooses the winners of all 63 games.
</P>
<P>
   So far about 600,000 contestants have filled out the brackets
online, and Sandbox's 30-year-old president, Lawrence M. Cotter,
said he expected the total to approach 1 million contestants before
the contest, called It's Madness, closes at noon Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But as with so many things in the new online economy, the risks
for Cotter and his company are illusory. First, it is highly
unlikely that anyone will win. Statisticians put the odds of
selecting all 63 winners at something in the neighborhood of eight
or nine quintillion (a quintillion has 18 zeros).
</P>
<P>
   But then, most basketball fans think that they bring some
knowledge and skill to the selections. ``So I think the odds are
really in the neighborhood of one in 5 billion,'' Cotter said,
``meaning that the chances are about 1 in 600 that a Sandbox member
will win.''
</P>
<P>
   But a single upset in the tournament can cause turmoil. Last
year, when Sandbox offered a mere $1 million prize, every one of
the 160,000 contestants was shut out in the very first round, after
the highly ranked University of North Carolina lost to Weber State,
a Cinderella team, by 1 point in the first game _ which almost
nobody predicted. This year, another Web site, Predict It
(sports.predictit.com), is offering a similar contest with a $1
million prize.
</P>
<P>
   Cotter said he hoped that his contest would last longer this
year. After all, the game for Sandbox.com is to gain national
attention as well as new members for its online gaming business.
And at this point he has nothing to lose, because if someone does
win, Sandbox.com doesn't have to come up with the $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company bought ``hole in one'' insurance, so named for the
country-club practice of parking a Cadillac Coupe DeVille on the
golf course, next to the 18th hole, and promising to give it to the
member who can sink a hole in one.
</P>
<P>
   An insurance examiner figured the odds for Sandbox.com's contest
and assessed a fee of about 25 cents per player, or just $250,000
if 1 million people play.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that the contest and resulting attention will shut down
quickly again this year, Sandbox is also giving away other prizes,
like a car and entertainment centers, for people who pick lots of
game winners, if not all of them. The top scorer wins a Pontiac,
donated by another Web site, AutoMall.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sandbox also recruited several paying ``sponsors,'' or
advertisers, for the contest. The lead sponsor, whose banner
advertisement appears at the top of the contest Web page, is
another Internet start-up, PhoneFree.com. Jan Horsfall, the
company's president, said, ``We are extremely stoked to be part of
such great fun.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Sandbox is earning money from the entrants.
Registration is free, but Sandbox presents about a dozen special
offers _ trial magazine subscriptions, memberships at other Web
sites _ on the registration page.
</P>
<P>
   So many people are taking them up on the offers that on average,
Sandbox is getting $3.50 in commissions and other fees as a result
of each registration, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   With all that, ``everyone's a winner,'' Cotter said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   The contest almost did not get off the ground. The company
ordered new server capacity to handle the surge in visitors to the
site, but after weeks of promising, the contractor had not
delivered by last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Collegiate Athletic Association was to post the
game brackets on Sunday evening, and that is when Sandbox needed to
have its contest up and running. ``We called all around the area,
desparately looking for bandwidth,'' Cotter said. Finally a local
company stepped in to help, and the higher-capacity servers were in
place just in time on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to have someone win so we could march him around the
country with a big $10 million check,'' Cotter said. After a moment
of thought, he added with a grin: ``That's the second-best thing
that could happen. The first-best thing would be for a hacker to
shut down our site for two hours in the middle of the contest, and
we'd be on the front pages of all the papers.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, a windfall like that has not arrived. So the company is
already thinking about next year's contest. Bill Carey, Sandbox's
executive vice president, has said the company is thinking of
offering $64 million in 2001. After all, what's to lose?

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Information geared toward Americans with low
incomes or poor reading skills is scarce and difficult to find on
the Internet, according to a study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The year-long study by the Children's Partnership, a
Washington-based organization, was billed as the first to look at
what low-income internet users want and need online.
</P>
<P>
   The organization identified nearly 50 million Americans _ 20
percent of the population _ who are ``on the other side of the
content gap because the Internet does not have the information and
services they could use,'' said Wendy Lazarus, co-director and
co-founder of the Children's Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Authors of the study interviewed low-income Internet users,
community leaders and literacy experts, and analyzed 1,000 Web
sites. Only 6 percent of the sites contained local information that
low-income users said they needed, and 1 percent contained
information about local jobs and housing.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that only 1 percent of the sites were
easily readable by the 44 million Americans who read below the
average literacy level. Only 2 percent were geared toward the 32
million non-English speaking Americans, and only 1 percent catered
to the 26 million foreigners living in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no need to wait another day to tackle the content
gap,'' said Laurie Lipper, the group's other co-director and
co-founder. ``We have a compelling need, examples of what works,
many of the technical tools we need and now, with this report, a
clear road map for action.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization's recommendations include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Working with low-income communities and using their input to
design information portals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Developing search tools that help low-income users find
information.
</P>
<P>
   _ Training members of low-income communities to develop their
own local content and providing them with investment capital.
</P>
<P>
   _ Conducting more research.
</P>
<P>
   ``By releasing this report, we are placing a flag in the sand,''
Lazarus said. ``If we want all Americans to reach their full
potential, we must close the digital divide.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``Online Content for Low-Income and Underserved
Americans: The Digital Divide's New Frontier,'' is available at the
group's Internet site (www.childrenspartnership.org/indextop.html).
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Others have taken steps to make it easier for low-income
Americans to gain access to the Internet. Days after noting the
digital divide in his State of the Union address in January,
President Clinton launched Click Start, a federally funded program
to subsidize computers and Internet connections for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson recently opened an office in East Palo
Alto, Calif., a predominately black city 30 miles south of San
Francisco, intended to serve as the Silicon Valley headquarters of
Jackson's effort to close the digital divide.
</P>
<P>
   And more recently, billionaire Michael Saylor donated a $100
million to start developing an online university that he says will
offer an Ivy League-quality education to anyone in the world free
of charge.

FTC SIGNALS THAT BP AMOCO-ARCO MERGER IS LIKELY BE APPROVED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, West Coast)   (bl)  
 By DAVID STOUT and STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday put a
hold on its attempt to block a merger of BP Amoco and Atlantic
Richfield Co., signaling that the $30 billion deal is very likely
to win government approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the substantial and constructive proposals made by
the defendants, all parties have agreed to seek adjournment of the
federal court proceedings in FTC vs. BP Amoco and Atlantic
Richfield Co. in order to conduct negotiations,'' said Richard G.
Parker, director of the agency's Bureau of Competition, in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Parker did not elaborate, but there was no doubt he was
referring to BP Amoco's just-announced intention to sell the
Alaskan assets it would get from Atlantic Richfield (or Arco) if
the merger went through. Together, BP Amoco and Arco now control
about 70 percent of oil production in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC had expressed concerns that the merger would lead to
substantially higher prices for Alaskan crude oil at refineries on
the West Coast, where gasoline prices are already among the highest
in the country. But BP Amoco has just reached a deal to sell its
Alaskan assets to Phillips Petroleum in a deal valued at $6 billion
to $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   With that arrangement, BP Amoco appears to have eliminated the
highest hurdle standing in the way of its acquisition of Arco.
While Parker's terse statement referred to further negotiations,
its mention of ``substantial and constructive proposals'' seemed to
indicate that federal court hearings might not be necessary. The
hearings, which were to have begun next week in San Francisco,
would have been on the FTC's motion to block the merger on grounds
it would violate antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   The BP Amoco-Arco merger is the largest proposed deal ever to be
opposed by the federal government. Assuming that the FTC does drop
its opposition, the merger would create a company second in size
only to Exxon Mobil. The merger of Exxon and Mobil, a deal worth
some $80 billion, was approved only last November.
</P>
<P>
   Both BP Amoco and Arco executives had argued that the government
misinterpreted antitrust law, and that notwithstanding the
regulators' concerns, their merger would not drive prices in
California even higher. Gasoline prices across the country _ near
historic lows not many months ago _ have skyrocketed recently and
threaten to become a major political issue.

SUIT SEEKS OPTIONS   IN DISHWASHER RECALL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROSALIE R. RADOMSKY  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should consumers with defective GE dishwashers rewire them or
buy new ones? And how much of the cost should GE pick up?
</P>
<P>
   From April 1983 to January 1989, General Electric produced 3.1
million G.E. and Hotpoint dishwashers with a defective air-drying
switch that has the potential to melt or ignite, creating a fire
hazard. The switch has caused no injuries, but there have been 50
hazardous incidents, three of which damaged houses. About 900,000
of the dishwashers were in use nationwide by consumers and property
managers when GE began a recall last year.
</P>
<P>
   Affected dishwashers are all among the Hotpoint and GE model
numbers GSD500D, GSD500G, GSD540, HDA467, HDA477 and HDA487.
Specific serial numbers of the affected machines are available on
the General Electric Web site at www.geappliancerecall.com or from
(800) 599-2929. The numbers appear on a rectangular label to the
right or left front rim of the tub.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer of New York filed a federal
lawsuit earlier this month over what the state described as a
difference in treatment between commercial customers and
individuals. ``We want General Electric to offer all consumers the
same opportunity,'' he said. He said he was also dissatisfied with
GE's current rebate offers.
</P>
<P>
   GE has offered a temporary measure to property managers and
corporate customers: a set of instructions for rewiring the
dishwashers, along with a plastic connector for tying off the ends
of cut wire, and in some cases, a small payment toward rewiring.
Individual consumers, meanwhile, are not getting the rewiring
option. Instead they are being offered a $25 rebate toward a new
Hotpoint or non-GE brand and $75 to $125 toward GE dishwashers.
</P>
<P>
   About 45,000 rebate checks were mailed and more than 166,000
claim packages were sent out by the end of January, Terry Dunn, a
GE spokesman, said. He added that property managers, who are
dealing with numerous recalled dishwashers, had rewired more than
100,000 of them.
</P>
<P>
   One 26-unit condominium Soundview Terrace, in New Rochelle,
N.Y., was entirely equipped with the GE dishwashers, said Joseph
Poggioli Jr., who lives there with his wife and two children. His
GE Model GSD500D was in the apartment when he moved there in 1990.
He has not replaced it. ``I'm going to wait for the outcome of the
lawsuit, or until my wife gets tired and bugs me for a new
dishwasher,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GE has made additional arrangements with some bulk purchasers of
its dishwashers. For instance, GE is offering the National
Association of Housing Cooperatives, based in Washington, either
new GE dishwashers for $150, or $15 for a 15-minute rewiring for
those of its 1,000 member buildings that own the recalled machines.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general, responding to consumer complaints, would
like General Electric to finance the entire cost of the rewiring,
about $75 for a qualified service call, and to provide more money
for rebates.
</P>
<P>
   But, Dunn said, rewiring the dishwashers is an unsatisfactory
option for consumers. ``The rewiring option permanently disables
the function'' _ a choice between hot- or cool-air drying _ ``and
degrades the performance of the dishwasher,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, the average life span of a dishwasher is
assumed by the industry to be 9 to 11 years, and the models being
recalled are near the end of that period.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, rewiring is not required under the program approved
by the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission, which oversees
such matters.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows GE to choose how to resolve the recall. ``We also
wanted GE to do a full repair program to all consumers free of
charge, and they refused, which is their right,'' said Russ Rader,
a commission spokesman. ``The law says a company can select a
repair, refund or a replacement. It's their right to select the
refund program. Whirlpool had a similar fire problem with
dishwashers in 1996 and did a full repair free of charge.''

   SCI-PRIMATE-FOSSIL (Undated) _ Fossil bones of an animal no
bigger than a shrew and weighing less than an ounce have been
identified as belonging to the earliest known relative of the
primate lineage that led to monkeys, apes and eventually humans.
The wee animal lived 45 million years ago in a humid rain forest in
what is now China. The paleontologists who announced the discovery
Wednesday said the fossil animal, named Eosimias for ``dawn
monkey,'' was the best evidence yet for fixing the time and place
of one of the more fateful branchings in evolution. Eosimias
appeared to be a transitional figure when lower primates, known as
prosimians, went their way, developing into today's lemurs,
lorises, bush babies and tarsiers, while the diverging higher
primates, the anthropoids, evolved into more prepossessing
creatures, including human beings. By John Noble Wilford.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ After months of primping, Paul Allen's curvaceous and
colorful interactive music museum finally has set a date for her
debutante ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Frank Gehry-designed, 140,000-square-foot Experience Music
Project at Seattle Center will open June 23, kicking off a multiday
celebration of live performances throughout the center grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Though EMP hasn't confirmed the lineup, it will include artists
of many genres _ rock, funk, soul, gospel, hip-hop, jazz and blues.
The Northwest will be well-represented.
</P>
<P>
   Additional details will be announced this spring. Offerings may
include some unusual live collaborations; there is a rumor James
Brown's original band may be reunited.
</P>
<P>
   Some concerts will be ticketed events, while others will be
free. Charter members will have first pick of the tickets to the
grand-opening concerts when they go on sale sometime this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Membership fees range from $35 for the ``acoustic student''
package (for full-time students 21 and under with ID) to $5,000 for
the ``superstar'' package. For more information, call 877-396-8742
or visit the Web site at www.emplive.com.
</P>
<P>
   Construction still is under way at the site along Fifth Avenue
North, where the Monorail slices through the roof of the
eye-popping structure before rolling into its terminal at Seattle
Center. A sign greeting visitors at the site reads: ``When You Feel
You Have No Rhythm, Place Your Hand Upon Your Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what Seattleites think of EMP's exterior design, the
building's interior and its spectacular soaring spaces surely will
awe them.
</P>
<P>
   The star attractions at the 18-room museum will include Sky
Church _ a grand hall inspired by Jimi Hendrix's concept of a place
where people of all ages, interests and backgrounds could come
together to experience music _ and a ridelike multimedia experience
called Artist's Journey. The latter opens in June with ``Funk
Blast,'' which explores the origins and sounds of funk music.

Zumwalt, EMP's design and construction manager, said during a tour
of the museum this week. ``It's more about music.''
</P>
<P>
   For Zumwalt, the project has been the highlight of a career that
has included the design of museums, resorts and golf courses from
Ohio to the Caribbean. One of his most notable projects was the
Museum of Anthropology in Veracruz, Mexico. Zumwalt previously
worked for Allen as project manager of Portland's Rose Garden Arena
from 1990 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   During months of construction at the EMP site, Zumwalt has
watched iron workers sign their names, poetry and song lyrics to
the museum's giant beams. Many of those working on the museum are
caught up in the excitement of the unusual project.
</P>
<P>
   ``As someone who really loves music, this is as good as it gets,
as wild as it gets,'' Zumwalt said.
</P>
<P>
   The Experience Music Project was founded by Microsoft co-founder
Allen and his sister, Jody Patton. Inspired by Allen's fascination
with Hendrix, the interactive museum has been designed to be far
more than a repository for EMP's more than 80,000 artifacts,
including what is reportedly the world's largest collection of
Hendrix memorabilia. Once envisioned as a Hendrix museum, EMP has
expanded its scope to encompass thousands of artists and all styles
of popular music. Amenities will include a cafe and nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   After slogging through mud at the construction site, Zumwalt and
a reporter entered the museum through a plywood construction door.
Indoors, the museum is a labyrinth of soaring spaces cluttered with
plastic tarps, rolls of wiring, construction debris and stacks of
building materials. High above, wildly curved beams accentuate the
building's rebellious geometry.
</P>
<P>
   The main lobby features a giant ``snake wall'' that wriggles to
the ceiling like a shapely dancer dressed in exotic, brightly
colored garb. The wall is covered with the same painted metal
shingles that decorate the exterior.
</P>
<P>
   In another part of the main lobby, the space that houses the
Demo Theater juts downward like a UFO that has crashed through the
roof of a building. The hanging appendage is covered with polished
silver shingles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it Frank Jr.,'' Zumwalt quipped. ``It's like a little
bit of Frank Gehry hanging out in the lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sky Church is a cathedral-like space with a 65-foot-high
ceiling. The grand hall was designed by The Floating Co., a San
Francisco company that created stage designs for U2's ``PopMart''
tour and the Rolling Stones' ``Bridges to Babylon'' tour.
</P>
<P>
   When it is finished, Sky Church will function as an audio-visual
space by day and dance club or performance space by night, with a
state-of-the-art sound system.
</P>
<P>
   A steel scrim will encircle the Sky Church like a curtain,
hiding video screens and lights until they are activated. A frieze
of electronic images will play continuously along one wall.
Illuminated time capsules filled with donated objects will be
installed in the translucent flooring.
</P>
<P>
   Graceful curved trusses soar to the ceiling like giant steel
ribs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were a museum of natural history, this is is where the
dinosaurs would be,'' Zumwalt said.
</P>
<P>
   A wide staircase leads to the second-floor galleries, including
the Hendrix Gallery (which will feature the Fender Stratocaster
Hendrix played at the '69 Woodstock festival), the Guitar Gallery
(where the 1934 Rickenbacker ``frying pan'' electric lap steel
guitar will be among more than a dozen instruments displayed) and
Northwest Passage, offering a look at local music history (Quincy
Jones' trumpet from the 1940s is one of the Northwest treasures).
</P>
<P>
   Other galleries are dedicated to the Roots of Rock 'n' Roll (EMP
plans to exhibit Elvis Presley's black leather jacket from the
early '60s), Rock's Next Generation (would you believe Janis
Joplin's bell-bottom pants from 1970?) and Hip-Hop (which will
offer a peek at handwritten lyrics by Kurtis Blow).
</P>
<P>
   Nine designers worked on the various spaces at EMP. Gehry
himself designed the cozy but high-tech JBL Theater, a
200-capacity, fixed-seat room for film and video screenings, master
classes and intimate live performances.
</P>
<P>
   The multisegment building has been compared to pieces of a
broken guitar, a human heart and parts of the human inner ear. But
Gehry has claimed that electric guitars, with their bright colors
and curved shapes, were the inspiration for EMP's exterior.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry used CATIA, the three-dimensional computer program
employed in the design of France's Mirage fighter jets. The program
also has been used by Boeing and Daimler-Chrysler. Gehry is the
first architect to use it to create shaped-metal buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's intended for designing aircraft and anything that
requires the shaping of metal,'' Zumwalt said. ``This is the first
time it's really been put to the test.''
</P>
<P>
   The second floor includes Sound Lab, a futuristic studio where
visitors can create music, regardless of their level of skill,
using guitars, drums or keyboards. Visitors can learn basic skills
or work on improving their existing ones. Toys include sound pods
and the Jam-o-Drum, a high-tech version of the ancient drum circle
that features psychedelic graphics projected onto the ceiling,
conjuring images of early humans playing around a fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tested it with 8-year-olds and 80-year-olds,'' Zumwalt
said. ``Regardless of age, they were caught up in the joys of
creating music from scratch. We couldn't pull them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the interactive exhibits will be hundreds of oral histories
_ original audio and video footage of artists talking about their
memories, contributions and inspirations. Among those recorded so
far are Ann and Nancy Wilson, Bonnie Guitar, Buck Owens, Bo
Diddley, Noel Redding, Ice-T, Taj Mahal, the Dust Brothers and
Ernestine Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   In an exhibit titled ``The First Rock 'n' Roll Record,'' music
veterans talk about the origins of rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``We was tired of all that slow music,'' Little Richard says of
early rock. ``We wanted to boogie.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen.

<P>
   In May 1997, at a ceremony in Cork, Ireland, commemorating those
who suffered and died in the great Irish famine, which began in
1845, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain said: ``That 1 million
people should have died in what was then part of the richest and
most powerful nation in the world is something that still causes
pain as we reflect on it today. Those who governed in London at the
time failed their people through standing by while a crop failure
turned into a massive human tragedy. We must not forget such a
dreadful event.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, as Irish movies, dance, books and plays
have enjoyed a surge of popularity in the United States, a number
of Web sites have emerged to ensure that the famine, which Blair
called ``a defining event in the history of Ireland and of
Britain,'' will not be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most thorough treatment is a 117-page curriculum
guide for teachers sponsored by the New Jersey Commission on
Holocaust Education. It is available for downloading at
www.nde.state.ne.us/SS/irish(UL)famine.html, thanks to an Irish
education coalition that persuaded the Nebraska Department of
Education to put it online. The site is also linked or listed
online by the education departments of Illinois, Massachusetts,
Idaho and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   It was prepared by James V. Mullin of Moorestown, N.J., a former
teacher and law librarian. In 1995, he began putting together a
synopsis on the famine for the Holocaust Commission, which was
assembling similar guides on the persecutions and mass deaths of
Cambodians, Armenians, American Indians and African slaves. The
online curriculum is free. (Another resource site about the famine
is at www.people.Virginia.EDU/(tilde)eas5e/Irish/biblio.html.)
</P>
<P>
   Mullin, who was educated in parochial schools, said, ``I was
taught basically that the Irish only wanted to grow potatoes
because they loved them so much, and then when the potato crop
died, the Irish couldn't think of anything else to eat.'' He agreed
with the historians he consulted that the famine could not be
understood apart from British colonial misrule in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But it was odd how little teaching existed about the famine and
the policies that led to it and worsened it, he said. Jonathan
Swift's ``Modest Proposal,'' about eating Irish babies to reduce
the surplus population, is routinely taught in English literature
courses as a supreme example of irony, he noted, but it is less
often taught in English history classes, where it would acquire a
needed context.
</P>
<P>
   The heavily footnoted and attributed guide takes Ireland from
Neolithic times through the Viking and Norman invasions and into
the era of colonial domination, British plantations and the
absentee landlord system, laissez-faire economics, the poorhouses,
the relief efforts and the anti-relief efforts, and the emigration
in what were called coffin ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between 1845 and 1850, more than a million Irish people
starved to death while massive quantities of food were being
exported from their country,'' it begins.
</P>
<P>
   The guide covers the English penal and administrative laws that
reduced the native Irish to second-class citizens. A section on
racism depicts some of the cartoons that helped foster Irish
stereotypes. (The publication of Darwin's ``On the Origin of the
Species'' in 1859 was soon followed by an upsurge in caricatures of
Irishmen as monkeys.)
</P>
<P>
   There are horrific depictions of beggars, of skeletal children,
of a man staggering to the graveyard carrying his dead wife.
Equally horrific are the quotes from Parliament on the folly of
upsetting ``natural law'' by aiding the starving, and the economic
wisdom of encouraging their eviction (in the dead of winter) and
their emigration (in ships with mortality rates of more than 50
percent).
</P>
<P>
   There is a discussion of genocide, and historians and political
theorists are quoted on the differences between the planned
extermination of a people or a culture and the prejudice and
culpable neglect that produce the same result.
</P>
<P>
   The curriculum has been revised to add a section on poetry of
the famine and to remove a few lines that might unfairly
characterize Britain today. But Mullin said he was disappointed at
how many people assumed, wrongly, that the curriculum was
anti-British or an Irish nationalist project.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always saying we're comparing it to the Holocaust
when we've never done that, and we never will do that,'' he said.
``There is a passive genocide. You can allow people to die.''
Comparisons with famines in Ukraine, in China under the Great Leap
Forward or among the American Indians are always inexact, he said,
``but the comparisons have to be made if we're going to learn
anything.''

HIGH TECH'S THE ART IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By SALLY McGRANE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cultural sea change is nothing new to the Bay Area of San
Francisco, and the city that spawned the beats and psychedelia now
finds itself a few degrees north of the technology revolution's
epicenter. But is there room for art in the no-nonsense
commercialism of the tech world, where everybody has a business
plan?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, it turns out, is yes, with a twist. A number of Bay
Area artists are taking the technology that is transforming the
area and making art with and about it.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors make the Bay Area a fertile region for
technology-related art. Artists there are surrounded by technology
as dot-com companies take over industrial neighborhoods that were
once artists' haunts. Splashy Internet advertising plasters
billboards and dominates radio spots.
</P>
<P>
   There are also last year's products, discarded by the tech
industry but still useful to artists, as is technological know-how.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is in the atmosphere here,'' said Jim Campbell, a
San Francisco-based technology artist.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who works in Silicon Valley as a hardware engineer
three days a week, said that the Bay Area creates an environment in
which technology and art feed off each other. He is working on a
piece that explores compression technology and the impact it has on
information and meaning _ because, he said, ``I've been working
with compression in my job, making 40 or 50 pixels represent
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Goldberg, a technology artist who is also an engineering
professor at the University of California at Berkeley, said there
was no question that the technology revolution was making itself
felt in art circles. ``In some way,'' he said, ``all artists in the
Bay Area are directly or indirectly responding to technology
because it is so pervasive here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, art and technology often have an uneasy
relationship. Rebeca Bollinger, a San Francisco artist who uses the
Internet in much of her work, said she was ``equally disgusted with
and passionately seduced by'' technology. ``I try hard to be on the
outside of what's going on in the industry,'' she said. ``I get so
sick and tired of all the technology propaganda. I'm sick of all
the marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so immersed in the economy of it. If you go to other
parts of the country, you see that it's totally different. But
what's happening here will happen there, eventually. We're living
in this strange space of present-future.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, companies and organizations in the high-tech
field have embraced _ and financed _ existing art groups. Survival
Research Laboratories, for instance, a prominent feature of the
alternative Bay Area landscape since Mark Pauline founded it in
1978, builds large robots and creates violent spectacles where
machines wreak destruction on one another.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the group integrated the Internet into its art,
connecting laptops to the robots and allowing remote Internet users
to aim and fire powerful machinery during shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably since 1992 all of our shows have been affiliated with
organizations related to technology,'' said Pauline, who has
created events for clients like the publisher Miller Freeman, Wired
magazine and Webzine99, a San Francisco conference for
Internet-based alternative magazines.
</P>
<P>
   But while the booming economy has brought in money that has
benefited artists, it could also impose restraints. Eric Paulos,
director of an art group called the Experimental Interaction Unit,
points out that being employed in the technology sector could limit
artistic freedom, especially if an artist's projects are critical
of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to do anything too controversial if you're at a
dot-com,'' Paulos said. ``This is an incredible time because you
can do creative expression _ design work _ and get paid. But if
what you're doing is driven by money, you're not really in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulos said he made a point of distancing his work _ which
includes a vending machine that sells a mock lethal pathogen and
tracks users' identities _ from his role as a graduate student at
Berkeley's computer science department to maintain his artistic
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Thomas, on the other hand, is firmly in the anti-tech camp.
A spokesman for RTMark, a kind of cyberguerrilla group known for
lampooning politicians and making mischief for corporations, Thomas
pointed to escalating rents as a death knell for art. ``Silicon
Valley has basically destroyed the art scene in the Bay Area by
bringing in so much money and so many people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his artist friends are moving to cities like Los
Angeles, where rents are lower. ``It's basically so demoralizing,
people don't even have energy to make art about it,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases, technology companies are looking to artists for
new ideas that could lead to the development of new technology.
Corporate research centers like the Interval Research Corp. and the
Xerox Palo Alto Research Center are financing artists in residence.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Naimark, an artist at Interval, said: ``It's a funny
situation right now, because there really isn't an NEA to support
experimental work, and there's so much money and activity in high
technology. The question is, how do artists fit in? Nobody really
has the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   They do appear to fit in better in the Bay Area than down the
road in Silicon Valley itself, which is generally acknowledged as
not having much of an art scene (although a foundation for art and
technology in the Valley is in the works).
</P>
<P>
   When asked about art in Silicon Valley, John Weber, a curator at
the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, said: ``In Silicon Valley?
They work. That's all they do. When they get interested in art,
they move.'' &QL;

 &HT;    RILEY TELLS HISPANICS AMERICANS MUST SPEAK TWO LANGUAGES
 &HT;    480&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Education Secretary Richard Riley told Hispanic
leaders Wednesday that American schools must produce more students
with ``bi-literacy'' in English and one other language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation can only grow stronger if all our children grow up
learning two languages,'' Riley said in an hourlong speech billed
as his ``first ever'' address on the state of Hispanic education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, too many teachers and administrators today
treat a child's native language as a weakness if it is not
English,'' Riley said. ``It is high time we begin to treat language
skills as the asset they are, particularly in this global
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley noted that a poll of teachers showed that half of them
have some students with limited English proficiency in their
classrooms, but only one-fifth feel ``very'' prepared to educate
them.
</P>
<P>
   Between 70 and 75 percent of the 3 million U.S. students with
limited English skills speak Spanish, according to the Education
Department.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to calling for a ``more diverse and more adaptable''
teaching force, Riley said that he would like to see the number of
``dual-language'' schools created by federal, state and local
cooperation rise to 1,000 within five years.
</P>
<P>
   He said there now are about 260, including Grant Elementary
School in Salem, Ore, where all English-speaking and
Spanish-speaking students must develop their skills in both
languages.
</P>
<P>
   Riley also praised Bell Multicultural High School, where he was
speaking. Its 700 students come from more than 40 different
countries and speak at least 20 languages, said its principal,
Maria Tukeva.
</P>
<P>
   Each student at Bell studies grammar, vocabulary and literature
in English and one other language, usually Spanish. Though 98
percent of Bell's students are poor enough to qualify for
subsidized school lunches, 70 percent go on to higher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his proposal for 1,000 dual-language schools is really
exciting,'' Tukeva said. But Riley's contention that starting out
with a non-English language is an asset, rather than a weakness, is
only correct ``sometimes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really varies,'' she said. ``If the students have a
strong background in their native language and strong academic
skills, it's actually an asset. But some of them don't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dual-language schools aren't the only useful approach, Riley
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many different and effective strategies for teaching
English, from bilingual to sheltered English to English as a second
language,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But whatever the approach to teaching English, it cannot be
simply a defensive or reactive one,'' Riley said. ``If we see to it
that immigrants and their children can speak only English and
nothing more, then we will have missed one of the greatest
opportunities of this new century.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Riley outlined $8 billion in federal education programs that he
described as elements of President Clinton's ``Hispanic Education
Action Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon the president will host a White House meeting to further
discuss these issues and commit the nation to action,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's speech and the financial commitment grew out of years of
quiet lobbying by Latino leaders, said Guillermo Linares, a New
York City council member who chairs the President's Advisory
Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential year in which Clinton cannot run to succeed
himself ``is an opportune time for us to highlight the potential
that we have and the challenges that we hope will be faced by the
changed leadership, regardless of what happens,'' Linares said.
</P>
<P>
   In political terms, his polite words translate into cheerful
anticipation of a bidding war between the presidential candidates
for Hispanic votes.
</P>

OLD CELL PHONES CAN STILL CALL 911 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROY FURCHGOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SecureAlert has been marketing its Magnavox Mobile911
emergency-only cell phone with a tantalizing proposition: It will
call 911 from just about anywhere in the United States, and there
is no charge for the service.
</P>
<P>
   But many people may already have such a phone without knowing
it. Any old, decommissioned cell phone can be used to make 911
calls, as long as the battery is good.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission requires all cell phone
service providers, like Sprint, AT&AMP;T and Bell Atlantic, to accept
911 calls from any wireless phone _ even one that no longer has a
phone number or service contract.
</P>
<P>
   On cell phones that are under a service contract, emergency
services can quickly obtain information about the user _ including
name and address _ that would be helpful in locating a dazed
caller. Such information is not available with uninitialized
phones, including the Mobile911. New triangulation technology may
soon allow wireless service providers to locate the source of any
call.
</P>
<P>
   In general, all wireless phones have some weaknesses as
emergency devices. Although the FCC has ruled that 911 should
become the universal emergency number, not all areas of the United
States have the service, so calls in some areas might go
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   And as anyone with a wireless phone knows, you cannot always get
a signal _ even in the middle of a large city. Also, wireless phone
networks are not available in 20 to 30 percent of the United
States, although most of those areas are unpopulated.
</P>
<P>
   There may be other disadvantages to using uninitialized cell
phones for 911 calls. For example, signals from old phones that
operate on an analog network would not be picked up by a
digital-only service like Sprint. In some areas, that could reduce
the chance of a message getting through.
</P>
<P>
   SecureAlert says its phone, which is priced at $199, has
advantages over using an old wireless phone. ``We have powered it
with AAA batteries, which will give you use for well over a year
without charging and recharging,'' said Brian Boling, a partner in
SecureAlert LLC, which licenses the Magnavox brand name. The phone
also has a single, large 911 button, making it easy to use. And it
has a siren to attract help.
</P>
<P>
   Used wireless phones can be purchased from Web auction sites for
less than $10, and even though uninitialized phones have drawbacks,
they are not far worse than regular cell phones, and they are
certainly better than nothing.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Fuel costs in San Francisco topped the nation's
other cities, with motorists paying an average $1.90 per gallon for
self-serve gasoline, according to a survey released by the
California State Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
   The price is being driven up by higher crude oil prices and
lower production of gasoline at area refineries, said Paul Moreno,
spokesman for AAA of Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't hold your breath for gas prices to come crashing down
anytime soon,'' Moreno said. ``Most analysts expect OPEC will
increase production, but there's little agreement as to how much.''
</P>
<P>
   In one month in Northern California, the average price per
gallon of regular unleaded gas rose 25 percent to $1.83, according
to the AAA.
</P>
<P>
   Prices hit record highs across the rest of the United States as
well, with a gallon of regular gasoline averaging $1.54 at the
self-service pumps in the AAA March survey released Tuesday, up
17.6 cents since mid-February and 57.3 cents from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline is typically more expensive in California because of
environmental laws that make crude oil costlier to refine.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, gasoline was a relative bargain at $1.65 per
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Schlichting, a spokesman for the California Energy
Commission, which monitors gasoline in the state, said San
Francisco tends to be more expensive because there are fewer gas
stations.
</P>
<P>
   In AAA's report on Tuesday, the average price for a gallon of
gas in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area was $1.84 per gallon,
a 34-cent increase since February.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Rosa, the lowest average gas price was $1.78 per
gallon, according to AAA.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has announced that the
Clinton administration is looking at ways to reduce fuel costs,
especially since driving will increase in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oddly enough,'' Moreno said, ``last year there was a much
stronger reaction when gasoline prices went up.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, a series of refinery fires in Northern California
caused the production of gasoline to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's understandable why people are angry,'' Moreno said.
``People will be driving more soon, and the upward pressure on
retail will increase.''

 &HT;    Uncover colorful treasures and trinkets from around the world at
Atlanta's ethnic shops
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Put your passport away. People with a penchant for that
well-traveled look can fill their homes with exotica from around
the globe without the hassle of jet lag _ not to mention without
leaving Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Within the metro area, there are a wealth of shops and galleries
chock-full of treasures from faraway places.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the trend in decorating with imported pieces
escalate over the past five-ten years. Right now the market is
flooding with items from the Pacific Rim,'' says Randall Cobb, vice
president of David Incorporated in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot of furniture and accessories from China, Malaysia
and Thailand. In fact, 90 percent of the accessories in my shop are
from the Pacific Rim,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are buying individual imported pieces that stand on
their own _ not like their parents who bought living room and
bedroom suites.''
</P>
<P>
   Those partial to African goods _ from textiles to jewelry _ need
merely to head for Little Five Points, home of African Connections,
or consider Underground Atlanta's African Pride as a sampling of
shopping possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Thousand Villages in Virginia-Highland is a nonprofit gift
store run by volunteers that sells merchandise from around the
globe. The shop helps provide income to Third World craftspeople by
marketing their handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
   And that's one of the drawing cards for local television
producer Conne Ward-Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I shop there is because I like the idea of
fairly traded goods. But who wouldn't? Also, it's relatively
inexpensive. I gravitate to the hand work quality of it _ you get a
sense of the maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people come in all the time who say they just didn't
buy enough souvenirs on their trip, so they stop here to get
more,'' says manager Marg Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   You can select from soapstone carved in India, South American
pottery, dishware from Vietnam and beautiful handmade paper from
Bangladesh. And that's just the short list.
</P>
<P>
   On Zonolite Road in East Atlanta, Mingei World Arts offers a
view into an exotic realm. This little space is crammed with the
bizarre and stunning. Consider a collection of exquisite silk
slippers made and worn by Chinese women whose feet were bound. Note
that 3-inch feet were thought to be the ideal. Think of it as a
case of beauty and art emerging from excruciating pain.
</P>
<P>
   Here, you'll also come across old Cambodian temple paintings,
Javanese puppets and flying dragons from Bali, which are placed
over children's beds to keep evil spirits away.
</P>
<P>
   For Indonesian furniture _ old and new _ as well as Balinese
carvings and batiks, Manorism's 30,000-square-foot warehouse in the
Westside area near the Atlanta Water Works is worth exploring.
</P>
<P>
   And those who crave European flair will find many shopping
venues in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Along with tartan ties and English bone china, Taste of Britain
in Norcross offers all of the accouterment needed for the perfect
English tea.
</P>
<P>
   Francophiles can soak up their fill of country French at Pierre
Deux in Phipps Plaza. The boutique stocks fabrics from Provence,
glazed Quimper faience from Brittany and even a line of foods from
Le Cordon Bleu.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of our favorite finds from a whirlwind tour of
some of Atlanta's international shopping venues.

 &HT;    Merchants bring Adamson Square back to life
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARROLLTON, Ga. _ At Horton's Bookstore, owner Dorothy Pittman
rings up sales on the shop's original 1892 cash register. But don't
expect a receipt.
</P>
<P>
   She can't find paper to fit the machine anymore.
</P>
<P>
   That might be a small drawback, but it's also a drawing card for
the customers _ many who know Pittman personally _ who like to shop
at Carrollton's oldest downtown business. ``We have been affected
by Amazon.com,'' said Pittman, referring to the online bookstore,
``but we still offer personalized service. For example, we send
Bibles away to be re-bound and will wrap all your purchases free.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, as Pittman points out, if you shop online, you won't be
able to pet Chloe. She's the tabby cat that has taken up residence
on a chair in the shop.
</P>
<P>
   Personal service and a mix of businesses. That's what merchants
are banking on to attract residents and visitors to this west
Georgia town of 18,000, about 45 miles from downtown Atlanta.
Incorporated in 1829, Carrollton was named in honor of Charles
Carroll, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Today, shops, galleries and restaurants revolve around
picturesque Adamson Square and its adjacent streets. Buildings date
from the late 1800s on the square, which was named for William
Charles Adamson, a 1900s state representative and local judge. Here
you can find the old and the new, from an Indian skirt at the Gypsy
Peddler, a 4-month-old shop on Rome Street, to home accesssories
and antique furniture at Groover-Smith Co., a 68-year-old fixture
on the square.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a gardener, you should head to Burson Feed and Seed, a
business on Rome Street that's been selling yard tools, plants and
fertilizer for 50 years. For a change of pace, drop by Linda
Cagle's Design Associates shop on the square, where she will work
with you from the blueprint stage to selecting the right wallpaper
for your home. Cagle also stocks plenty of gift accessories and
does custom flower arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Although the downtown is humming today, with students from the
nearby State University of West Georgia and with visitors, this
wasn't always the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a number of years, the square was dead,'' said Oak
Mountain school counselor Lucy Gay, who moved to Carrollton with
her husband, Jim, in 1971. ``But in the last five years, it has
come back to life. Now you can find anything you need, including
restaurants like Pearl's Cafe and Tea Thyme and two of my favorite
shops, Victoria &AMP; Ivy and Clayworks. I like to support the local
merchants, who are also my neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Such merchants are weaver Carol McWhorter and her husband, Don,
a potter. They own McWhorter Clayworks Fine Craft Gallery, a
4-year-old business on the square. ``We have lots of repeat
business from the county and from out-of-towners staying in condos
at Fairfield Plantation,'' said McWhorter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Visitors want to find a piece of the Old South off I-20,'' she
added. ``Last week, we had a couple from Chicago who read about our
shop in Southern Accents magazine and went out of their way to find
us.'' Clayworks sells one-of-a-kind items from 100 artists around
the country who specialize in clay, fiber, glass, metal and wood.
</P>
<P>
   Since its 1985 designation as a Main Street city, which
encourages economic improvement and renovation of a downtown
commercial district, Carrollton has been the beneficiary of several
programs. One has been the renovation of the Lawler Hosiery Mill
into loft apartments. Situated just off the square, the lofts offer
a built-in clientele for shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   To further stimulate business, Main Street director Tammy
Calhoun is planning Mayfest 2000 on May 6. Arts, crafts,
entertainment and food will be featured around the square. And
Friday at noon, during the summer, free concerts are held on the
square.

   Q: Where can I buy the orange peeler that Andy Rooney recently
demonstrated on ``60 Minutes''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Doxey, Carrollton, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: For those of you who hate to peel an orange (or any other
citrus fruit), Wilbur Blank's Qwik Orange Peel is for you. Using
the side cutter, insert the gizmo into the fruit's center, rotating
it round and round. Then insert blade between fruit and rind.
Slowly turn fruit while working blade up to the top. Repeat on
other half. Then twist and remove the rind.
</P>
<P>
   Available through Wil-Le Products, three peelers are $5 plus $2
for shipping; six peelers are $10 plus $3.50 for shipping. Send
checks only to: Wil-Le Products, R.R. 1, Box 65, Toulon, IL 61483.
</P>
<P>
   Like reader Doxey said, Andy Rooney demonstrated, and listed,
this orange peeler as No. 10 on a list of what he considers the 10
best unimportant inventions of the 20th century on ``60 Minutes.''
Incidentally, the other nine Rooney choices in ascending order: the
thermos, zipper, remote-control garage door opener, remote-control
channel changer, paper clip, paper bag with handle, pop-top can,
refrigerator door light and the elastic band.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Help! Bugs are in my pasta. I am looking for clear glass
canisters with rubber seals and metal buckle latches. I've checked
the discount department stores to no avail. Any ideas?
</P>
<P>
   _ Jean Cleveland
</P>
<P>
   A: Those little crittettle represents Lavin and her daughter
dressed for a ball. Like many fine fragrances, this one dropped out
of favor in the 1970s and '80s but was relaunched in '94.
</P>
<P>
   The original formula has not been copied note for note. ``This
could not be done today because the quality of oils and flowers has
improved and the harvesting and processing methods refined,'' said
Catherine Holmes of Cosmair. ``But the new Arpege has the same
richness, the same diversity and quality of the natural flowers as
the original. Longtime wearers will recognize their fragrance.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: In a recent issue of In Style magazine, singer Marc Anthony
swore by a hair product called dirt. What is it, who makes it and
where can I get it? I've called around to local hair salons, but no
one knows a thing about it.
</P>
<P>
   _ James S. Meisenzahl,
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: We hit pay dirt. California hair stylist Jonathan Antin
developed dirt, a nongreasy, nonsticky moulding pomade, ``to take
hair from its cleanest state to a more moldable, pliable one.'' The
pleasant-smelling styling aid can also be used ``to achieve that
day after, messy look.'' The 4-ounce jar ($20) is available in
Atlanta at Carter-Barnes Hair Artisans at Phipps Plaza
(404-233-0047). You can also order this Jonathan product at
1-877-673-3734. Other celebs who use the stuff: Ricky Martin,
Jewel, Jay Leno, Tiger Woods and Roseanne.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been trying to find dip-it cleaner, which is marketed
as a cleaner for coffeepots, but in reality will clean any
burned-in mess out of any pot, with no scrubbing. The powder form
is most effective and is found in small green boxes. I'm desperate
for a supply of this!
</P>
<P>
   _ Susan Andrews, Lilburn, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's always a pleasure to help a desperate woman. We found
dip-it destainer (5-ounce box of powder, $2.49) or dip-it 2
(7-ounce liquid bottle, $2.49) at Publix, 6300 Powers Ferry Road
N.E. (770-612-5140). In addition to cleaning automatic and drip
coffeemakers, the manufacturer also recommends dip-it for removing
food and beverage stains on porcelain, plasticware, glass and
countertops.

 &HT;    DALEY URGES CONGRESS TO PASS BILL BOOSTING TRADE STATUS FOR
CHINA
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By ALEC SCHULTZ 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Calling the decision an ``economic no-brainer,''
U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley urged Congress Wednesday
to pass legislation that would grant China permanent most favored
nation trade status.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economics of this deal are very good for America,'' said
Daley, speaking at a National Press Club luncheon, adding that the
Clinton Administration will push for approval of the proposed
legislation by Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Administration has made quick approval of permanent MFN for
China a primary goal of the president's foreign policy in this, his
final year in office. The White House argues that American
companies will have better access to a Chinese market of more than
1.2 billion people, and American consumers will benefit from
cheaper goods.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the deal is also expected to facilitate Chinese
entry into the World Trade Organization, another issue at the top
of the president's foreign policy agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the anticipated fullcourt press by administration
lobbyists, however, certain members of Congress _ most notably,
Democrats _ seem in no hurry to approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., has said that ``if the Senate
schedules a vote in April or May, there will not be nearly enough
time for public scrutiny of this deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone, and other Democrats continue to cite Communist
China's lack of human and workers' rights as reasons to vote down
any attempt to give the country better trade status with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said he is convinced the trade deal will pass. But with
such criticisms being voiced in Congress, he admitted that the
administration does not yet have the number of congressional votes
required for passage.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, House Democratic Whip David Bonior of Michigan said that
``there is nothing on worker rights, nothing on the environment,
nothing on human rights or democratization and no strong
enforcement'' in the legislation offered up by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in here to convince anyone that the U.S.
should permanently give up our leverage with China,'' Bonior said,
adding that the current system of annual review gives the United
States an advantage in dealing with the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   But Daley countered Wednesday that there has been no great
advance in Chinese human rights under that current system of annual
review either.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic legislators also worry about offending organized
labor, some of the trade legislation's harshest critics. Labor
leaders do not want to see American jobs lost as a result of
Chinese competition.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that there will be winners and losers in the
deal, Daley said the benefits to the United States will far
outweigh the losses. He said U.S. economy has nothing to fear from
its Chinese counterpart, which is only only 1/10 its size.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should seize this opportunity to open China to
American products and industry, the secretary argued.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has stated that he does not want the United
States to have to come late to the Chinese markets and lose out to
other nations. The Chinese government has entered into trade talks
with numerous other partners, including the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to sway the vote, Daley will lead a group of
congressmen to China. The group will consist largely of legislators
who are either opposed to, or undecided on the legislation. They
will visit Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A few years ago, when educators and company executives first
talked about the prospects of online education, they borrowed terms
from the business world. Students are consumers, they said. Treat
them as valued customers and offer them convenient courses at
prices they can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists cringed at the commercial mentality. But many
were heartened by the thought that the product being packaged was
still education. And few disagreed that adult students, especially,
would do some comparison shopping before devoting their time to an
online course.
</P>
<P>
   Now a group of Internet entrepreneurs is trying to turn the
shopping analogy into something more literal. Students are not
merely consumers of knowledge, they argue. They are consumers,
period.

   A student in a photography course, for example, could be in the
market for a new camera. Someone learning French might be inclined
to buy a travel guide or airline tickets. Instead of relying solely
on revenue from tuition, the entrepreneurs asked, why not offer
online courses _ perhaps even free ones _ and make money from
people who might shop while they study? Why not use education as a
marketing tool to attract potential shoppers the way other sites
use free e-mail or home pages?
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rosenfelt, the founder of notHarvard.com
(notharvard.com), argues that the combination of courses and
consumerism will be the next marketing wave to hit the Internet.
``Education has always been at the basis of commerce,'' said
Rosenfelt, who coined the term eduCommerce to describe the concept.
``Sellers need to teach, and buyers want to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Some who follow trends in education do not know whether to be
amused or appalled by the concept. ``It would be interesting to
consider what is meant by the term `course,''' said Alex Molnar,
director of the Center for the Analysis of Commercialism in
Education at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee. ``If you
mean something as straightforward as having people learn a fact
they didn't know before, that certainly doesn't rise to the level
of a course as most people think of it.''
</P>
<P>
   William L. Rukeyser, a former official in California's
Department of Education and director of a nonprofit organization
called Learning in the Real World, also questions the concept. ``If
the so-called education has the intent of getting people to buy a
product,'' Rukeyser said, ``then there is an open question as to
whether it can be dignified with the name education at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But the companies involved are confident that adult students,
who are their primary targets, will understand the value of what
the courses provide. NotHarvard.com is banking on the concept
entirely. Instead of charging tuition, it is making deals with
commercial Web sites that will offer the courses at no charge in an
attempt to acquire new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make no pretense that this is, in fact, a for-profit
venture,'' said Rosenfelt, who once had the title ``marketing
weasel'' on his business card.
</P>
<P>
   (Officials at Harvard University are not content with the
apparent differences between their institution's name and that of
notHarvard.com. They have asked lawyers to explore whether
notHarvard.com's name is a trademark infringement.)
</P>
<P>
   Other companies that are hoping to profit from student shoppers
include Smart Planet (smartplanet.com), Hungry Minds
(www.hungryminds.com) and Learn2.com (learn2.com). Learn2.com
creates its own courses and tutorials; most of them are free, but
some are subsidized by courses that cost money. Smart Planet and
Hungry Minds are designed to be clearinghouses for online courses
developed primarily by other companies and universities. Most of
their courses are not free, so the sites make some money on
commissions on tuition or on sales of CD-ROM tutorials.
</P>
<P>
   But for all three companies, shopping still plays a role:
students at each site are invited to make online purchases, and the
sites pocket a percentage of each sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are essentially a marketing platform,'' said Stuart
Skorman, chief executive and founder of Hungry Minds. In his
company's case, that marketing takes the form of promoting courses
that are available for a fee from places like the University of
California at Los Angeles and consumer products from stores like
Reel.com and Amazon.com. Students browsing Hungry Minds courses,
which include subjects like art history and alternative medicine,
are invited to shop in the Knowledge Store, where they can buy
items like books, music and software.
</P>
<P>
   Such mixtures of marketing and education could backfire, critics
say. Adults may shun courses that they suspect are more intent on
selling than teaching. And qualified instructors may not want to
teach for companies that can change the content of the courses the
instructors want to teach or are blatantly using education as a way
to increase sales.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Molnar said he could not imagine spending his time as an
instructor for such sites and did not expect that his colleagues or
students would want to, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not an edifying model of a scholar,'' Molnar said.
``That is a scholar as a used car salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chris Dobbrow, president and chief executive of Smart
Planet, said the strategy could work, as long as lines are drawn
between course content and advertising. ``The trick,'' he said,
``is not to make it an infomercial.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A Web site called CodeWarriorU provides a view of the kind of
education offered by notHarvard.com. CodeWarriorU
(www.codewarrioru.com) was developed by notHarvard.com for
Metrowerks, a software maker that creates tools for computer
programmers. Its first courses were offered in February: one on C
plus plus programming for the Macintosh and another called an
introduction to Code Warrior, one of Metrowerks' software packages.
In both courses, instructors posted new lessons every week and
responded to questions posed by students on the course bulletin
board.
</P>
<P>
   In the introductory Code Warrior class, the instructor was Joe
Zobkiw, a software developer who started his own company. The class
on C plus plus was taught by Ronald Liechty, a Metrowerks employee
who has been teaching similar classes for more than six years.
Metrowerks screens all instructors to determine whether they know
the material and can lead a class, said David Perkins, the
company's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of February, the courses had attracted more than
2,000 students _ well over the 500-student limit per course. Many
who did not sign up in time audited the course by reading lesson
plans without posting any messages.
</P>
<P>
   To register, students were asked to provide their names and
e-mail addresses and to check boxes that applied to broad areas of
interest, like technology and the humanities. NotHarvard.com
collects that data, Rosenfelt said, only to get a sense of what
courses it should offer in the future. Students were also directed
to a Web page that listed the course's required materials, which
included a book on C plus plus and one of two versions of Code
Warrior software, priced at $49 or $119.

 &HT;    DALEY URGES CONGRESS TO PASS BILL BOOSTING TRADE STATUS FOR
CHINA
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By ALEC SCHULTZ 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Calling the decision an ``economic no-brainer,''
U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley urged Congress Wednesday
to pass legislation that would grant China permanent most favored
nation trade status.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economics of this deal are very good for America,'' said
Daley, speaking at a National Press Club luncheon, adding that the
Clinton Administration will push for approval of the proposed
legislation by Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Administration has made quick approval of permanent MFN for
China a primary goal of the president's foreign policy in this, his
final year in office. The White House argues that American
companies will have better access to a Chinese market of more than
1.2 billion people, and American consumers will benefit from
cheaper goods.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the deal is also expected to facilitate Chinese
entry into the World Trade Organization, another issue at the top
of the president's foreign policy agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the anticipated fullcourt press by administration
lobbyists, however, certain members of Congress _ most notably,
Democrats _ seem in no hurry to approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., has said that ``if the Senate
schedules a vote in April or May, there will not be nearly enough
time for public scrutiny of this deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone, and other Democrats continue to cite Communist
China's lack of human and workers' rights as reasons to vote down
any attempt to give the country better trade status with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said he is convinced the trade deal will pass. But with
such criticisms being voiced in Congress, he admitted that the
administration does not yet have the number of congressional votes
required for passage.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, House Democratic Whip David Bonior of Michigan said that
``there is nothing on worker rights, nothing on the environment,
nothing on human rights or democratization and no strong
enforcement'' in the legislation offered up by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in here to convince anyone that the U.S.
should permanently give up our leverage with China,'' Bonior said,
adding that the current system of annual review gives the United
States an advantage in dealing with the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   But Daley countered Wednesday that there has been no great
advance in Chinese human rights under that current system of annual
review either.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic legislators also worry about offending organized
labor, some of the trade legislation's harshest critics. Labor
leaders do not want to see American jobs lost as a result of
Chinese competition.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that there will be winners and losers in the
deal, Daley said the benefits to the United States will far
outweigh the losses. He said U.S. economy has nothing to fear from
its Chinese counterpart, which is only only 1/10 its size.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should seize this opportunity to open China to
American products and industry, the secretary argued.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has stated that he does not want the United
States to have to come late to the Chinese markets and lose out to
other nations. The Chinese government has entered into trade talks
with numerous other partners, including the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to sway the vote, Daley will lead a group of
congressmen to China. The group will consist largely of legislators
who are either opposed to, or undecided on the legislation. They
will visit Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong.

   That unabashed attempt to promote the software did not faze Karl
Kornel, a high school senior in Cincinnati who took both courses.
``I saw, obviously, that they were planning to sell some kind of
products,'' Kornel said. ``I wasn't surprised at that.'' He had
already bought the software to supplement a computer-science course
he was taking at school, so he was able to take the courses by
spending only $36, the cost of the book.
</P>
<P>
   The course has been a good experience, Kornel said. He said it
was better than just reading a textbook or a tutorial because he
could interact with other students and the instructor via online
messages. ``It's pretty well laid out, I must admit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when asked if such a course would ever replace computer
courses offered by universities, Kornel was skeptical. ``If you are
paying for education, it is probably going to be written with a lot
more forethought,'' Kornel said, adding, ``I have not heard of any
colleges saying, `We'll give you credit for CodeWarriorU
courses.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   NotHarvard.com is developing courses for other commercial Web
sites, each of which will be designed with input from the host
companies. The CodeWarriorU courses, for example, are fairly light
on advertising, Rosenfelt said.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies may want to promote more products, but Rosenfelt
said his company would try to ensure that the course content did
not become an advertisement. A site sponsored by a car dealership,
he said, would not offer a course on how to select the best car
dealership or even the best car. Instead, it might offer a course
on car maintenance, in the hope that people would come back to the
site to shop. ``As with anything,'' Rosenfelt said, ``there are
agendas. We just need to be sure that we are upfront about what
this is.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rukeyser, whose organization examines educational
technology's effect on the way students learn, wonders whether the
terms ``education'' and ``courses'' are deceptive in the case of
notHarvard.com. ``There is a cloak of objectivity and disinterest
that wraps around somebody who says, `I'm here as an educator,'''
Rukeyser said. Sites that are offering courses as part of a
marketing strategy, he said, should ask themselves: ``Are the
signals clear enough for people to perceive it is in fact primarily
advertising and secondarily instructional?''
</P>
<P>
   A site like Hungry Minds raises slightly different questions.
Instead of developing courses that are offered through the Web
sites of specific companies, it displays online courses created by
its own online guides or by outside instructors. The site
encourages those course creators to list Web sites, books and
videos that relate to their courses or tutorials.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone recommends something, it's totally from the
heart,'' said Skorman, of Hungry Minds. ``It's not, `Let's sell
something because we can make money.''' And what if an instructor
has written a book and lists it as required reading? ``We're going
to watch it very, very closely,'' Skorman said. ``If they are going
to sell their own book, we'll say this is their book and they'll
profit from it.'' (Questions about potential conflicts, of course,
can also arise on even the most prestigious campuses, where
professors sometimes teach courses that require students to use
books they have written.)
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gott, the president and chief executive of Learn2.com,
said that it might take awhile for consumers to become used to
linkages between commerce and online learning. ``It's a new
concept, to buy while you learn,'' Gott said, ``but we're there and
ready for it, when people become accustomed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The sites' founders say they are not trying to replicate the
experience of traditional offline and online college courses.
Instead, the commercial sites' courses are intended to attract
adults who are engaged in what is called ``lifelong learning,'' a
buzzword among college administrators and among people running
corporate-training and continuing-education programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is considered by many experts to be the main arena
for this new version of education, and universities have been
scrambling for the past few years to stake out their spaces online.
Many colleges are already offering online education tailored to
adults, like the State University of New York, which delivers
hundreds of such courses, many for college credit, and New York
University, which offers many noncredit courses through the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Now colleges face competition from commercial Web sites that may
not offer exactly the same kinds of courses but have the potential
to overlap in areas like computer training and self-improvement
courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing wrong with traditional education,'' Skorman
said. ``But it is just a piece of the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Even offline, education comes in many forms. The Home Depot, for
example, sometimes offers classes on how to build a deck or tile a
floor. No one is asked to pay for those classes, and no one is
forced to buy Home Depot products. But it is obvious that The Home
Depot is using the classes to win customers and build loyalty to
its brand.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfelt of notHarvard.com said the Home Depot model was
similar to what he was trying to do online, with a much larger
audience. He likes to say that his company is simply offering
people another choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a model that is really resonant,'' he said. ``It's
like saying, `Hey, you can go physically take classes, you can go
online and pay for them, or if you'd like, there is a new option,
which is this notion of eduCommerce. Here are free courses taught
by branded, compelling instructors. They are free, but they are
sponsored by a company.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, notHarvard.com has to be sensitive to
the fact that people will not take courses that feel like
advertisements. ``Education is a lot more than simply a veiled
marketing message,'' he added. ``We have to provide, and we think
education provides, a real value to consumers.''

AT LAST, CD PLAYERS THAT D-D-D-DON'T SKIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before palm-size MP3 players, before songs could be downloaded,
before there was even a World Wide Web from which to download them,
there was portable digital music in the form of the compact disc
player.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all the high-tech gizmos crammed inside them, like
laser pickups and computerized decoders, portable CD players played
music on the go about as well as an old-fashioned record player,
not quite as bulky, of course, but with a similar problem: whenever
a CD player was moved or bumped, even a little, it skipped.
Listening to a CD while you jogged on a treadmill was simply
unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Each new generation of portable CD players arrived with promises
of skip-free play. Broken promises.
</P>
<P>
   But no more.
</P>
<P>
   Just when CD player technology appeared to be badly outclassed
by ever-smaller, relatively skip-proof mini-disc and MP3 players,
designers of portable CD players began striking back with better
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   A shining example _ literally, in its polished aluminum case _
of how portable CD players have been forced to reinvent themselves
is the newly released antiskip Walkman D-EJ915 from Sony
Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   This new model sells for $199.95, but other antiskip Sony
players with fewer features, like the D-EJ611, start at $80.
</P>
<P>
   The new Walkman is handsome and almost impossibly sleek, barely
larger than a five-inch CD. It is extremely light, and its
rechargeable nickel-hydride batteries have a life of 62 hours of
continuous playback _ more than three times that of most other
players.
</P>
<P>
   Portable CD players started to appear in 1984, two years after
Sony and Philips Electronics jointly introduced CD technology. What
makes the new Sony players stand out in an increasingly crowded
field of portable CD players is their capacity to play music
skip-free in almost any setting and circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   At Sony's request, during a demonstration, I slapped the machine
as if it were a tambourine while it played a CD. The result? Mary
J. Blige belted out her songs without so much as a hiccup.
</P>
<P>
   It was not surprising, then, that the results were identical
under more common circumstances. I walked with the player, jogged
with it and took it on a crowded subway car and a bus. Both player
and listener were frequently bumped, crushed and jostled, but the
music played without the slightest interruption.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of technologies, grouped under the rubric
G-Protection, kept the playback steady and true. The new Sony
player uses a memory buffer. Long a part of high-end CD players,
the buffer stores data from a spinning CD on a chip, then rapidly
dips into this electronic music reservoir to cover gaps in the
playback that are created when the CD is suddenly moved or bumped.
</P>
<P>
   But the buffer isn't what makes these new models different. The
first line of defense in the new antiskip players are two
technologies called quick focus search and fine access.
</P>
<P>
   Quick focus permits the CD player to almost instantaneously
regain the focus of its laser pickup when it is jarred. Sony
officials say that the refocusing occurs in less than 0.3 seconds.
Fine access quickly resets the laser pickup if it is bumped so it
can resume reading the CDs digital music data without interruption.
</P>
<P>
   The new Sony CD player can also increase the speed of the CDs
rotation when it senses a bumpy ride. By spinning the disk faster,
the player can more rapidly extract data from the disc to fill the
player's memory buffer faster as that is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Sony is hardly alone in making portable players live up to their
name. Late last year, Aiwa and Panasonic introduced much-improved
portable CD players that were just about as skip-proof as the Sony
G-Protection models. And both companies say this year they will
release more refined antiskip players.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Aiwa America plans to introduce a CD player for
joggers that will feature a 48-second memory buffer _ eight seconds
more than on current models _ to help it overcome skips. And like
the Sony players, Aiwa antiskip models will include technologies
that permit the player to quickly adjust the laser pickup
vertically and horizontally.
</P>
<P>
   Aiwa says its Electronic Anti-Shock System, or EASS Plus, does
not reduce battery life. Continuous playback on the current $110
Cross Trainer XP-SP90 is 14 hours with two AA batteries. The
company says the new XP-SP911 will extend battery life to 20 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The XP-SP90 is not as elegant as the Sony player, but its rugged
exterior is well suited for use by people engaged in athletic and
outdoor activities. It also packs a big sound, to my ears
significantly louder than the Sony player's.
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic's new antiskip player, the Shock Wave Metal SL-SW870,
priced at $199.95, is also designed to withstand rugged outdoor
use. It has a 40-second memory buffer and uses what Panasonic calls
Anti-Shock Memory II, a collection of technologies that includes a
memory buffer with variable speed control for the CD, error
correction chips to quickly retrack the player's laser pickup and
advanced optics to rapidly refocus the laser when it is knocked out
of its ideal vertical position.
</P>
<P>
   The Shock Wave Metal player provides 25 hours of continuous
playback on a pair of AA batteries, and it lives up to its name
with a feature that trembles for youthful attention: The headphones
that come with the player have a vibration unit. When a button on
the player is pressed, bass signals below 50 hertz are felt as mild
vibration. Officially, the feature is known as the Virtual Motion
Sound System, but as Reid Sullivan, a Panasonic executive, said,
``We like to call it the brain shaker.'' &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Abundant moisture will stream north from the Gulf of Mexico to
the Northeastern states ahead of a slow-moving cold front. An area
of rain with imbedded thunderstorms will move from the lower
Mississippi Valley early Thursday morning to the Ohio Valley during
the midday and afternoon as a jet stream disturbance lifts the
moisture-laden air. One to 3 inches of rain will be common in much
of the Ohio Valley by Thursday evening. Meanwhile, clouds and
broken areas of showers and thundershowers will cover much of the
Southeast. Heavier showers will be favored near the southern
Appalachians where moist winds ascend the sloping terrain. Farther
south, humid weather and some sunshine will linger in central and
southern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine will quickly fade near the Northeast Coast as a strong
cold front gradually approaches. Showers will arrive in the
interior Northeast during the midday hour and will spread to the
coast at night. Behind the cold front, temperatures will fall
quickly causing rain to change to snow in a narrow band across
extreme northern New York and New England later Thursday. Colder,
drier air will spread from the Midwest throughout the Northeast
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered rain and a few strong thunderstorms will develop near
low pressure in northern Texas and Oklahoma. Some patches of snow
will fall in the higher elevations of the panhandles and into
southeastern Colorado. Farther west, generally dry and seasonable
conditions will prevail in the interior west. The Northwest will
stay unsettled while sunshine continues to bathe the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Snow Season
</P>
<P>
   Winter is often very slow to end near the Front Range of the
Rockies. Indeed, the two snowiest months in Denver, Colo., are
March and April, with average snowfalls of 12.8 and 9.0 inches.
Most of the spring snow falls in a few, big spurts. With the
northward retreat of the jet stream in spring, the availability of
moisture from the Gulf of Mexico increases. When passing
disturbances draw cold air from Canada southward and moist air from
the Gulf of Mexico northward, big snows can result. Thursday a
fast-moving snowstorm will come to an end across eastern Colorado.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On May 29, 1976, Kim Barnes attended her high school graduation
in Lewiston, Idaho, vainly searching the audience for her family.
As she recounts in her beautifully written if harrowing new memoir,
``Hungry for the World,'' that evening there was to be ``a
supervised senior party given by the family of a classmate at their
cabin 150 miles north on Coeur d'Alene Lake.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, she had asked her devoutly religious father for
permission to go, and he had said no. ```I'm 18,' I'd said,
shivering with the courage it took to question. `What if I go
anyway?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked at me from the brown recliner, looked at me with his
cool-blue eyes, looked at me until I began to understand and not
care. `Then you would have to take your things and never come
back.'''
</P>
<P>
   What had happened to Barnes up to this point in her life was
told in her first book, ``In the Wilderness,'' which won the
PEN/Jerard Fund Award and was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The same story is retold in the first 75 pages of ``Hungry for
the World'': how her parents moved to Idaho from Oklahoma so her
father could work as a logger and enjoy the solitude of the
woodsman; how the voice of God told him he must give up that life
and join the Pentecostal Church of God in Lewiston, and how his
daughter, whom he both dominated and encouraged to think for
herself, alternated between subservience to family and church and
rebellion against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years away from that child sleeping in her mother's arms, I
would enter into my young woman's life knowing these two things: by
my gender I was cursed, and my mind would destroy me.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school, her life would be the same
only more so. As she writes in another context, it was about
``being raised to believe that women want to be, must be,
dominated.'' It was about ``rejecting those beliefs and still being
unable to escape them _ so wide a river, so many currents to swim
through.''
</P>
<P>
   She did attend that senior party at the lake, taking her
belongings with her and moving into her own apartment in Lewiston.
At first she enjoyed her new-found freedom and solitude but soon,
beginning to feel alone, she found her sexual fantasies taking a
dark turn. ``I came to the deepening belief that there was
something freakish in my nature, something dangerous and
destructive.''
</P>
<P>
   These anxieties would soon be realized. Working as a drive-in
bank teller, one day she served a shaggy young man, David W.
Jenkins, a Vietnam veteran and long-haul truck driver. He asked her
out to dinner, seemed to like her, asked her out again, took her
hunting even, reminding her of her father in his knowledge of the
woods, but refused to do anything more than kiss her goodnight.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, she liked the sensation this gave her, the
sense that they were companions and she was an equal. But soon his
aloofness grew frustrating, and when she asked him for more, he
introduced her to his collection of sex toys, encouraged her to be
with other men and gradually revealed his sadistic side.
</P>
<P>
   She found this behavior enthralling: ``I had succeeded in
remaking myself into that hybrid I believed might grant me the
greatest access into the world of men: a masculine spirit and
intellect; a feminine body and libido. With my mind, I challenged
and prevailed; with my sex, I appeased and confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   But in time, of course, the relationship grew worse than
sterile. ``Even our once lively conversations had become stilted,
as though we had emptied ourselves into each other and now must
face the limits of our ken.''
</P>
<P>
   When an intruder tried to break into her apartment and she told
David about it, he said, ``Maybe next time it will be me.'' He had
done that to old girlfriends. ``Wait a few years, then hide behind
the door, find a closet. They always fight at first, but they want
it.''
</P>
<P>
   She finally escapes David, forms ``an uneasy truce'' with her
parents, works her way through college, marries, has children, and
at last begins to write, tapping into her childhood love of
language, and publish her stories, poems and memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her triumph in finding herself and describing her
experience so powerfully, what sticks in the reader's mind is her
final evocation of her ordeal:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of the Inuit way: a wolf bone whittled to a point at
both ends, coiled and frozen in blubber, left along the path of
bears. The bear eats it and weakens slowly, over miles, over days,
the bone twisting and slashing, killing from the inside out. Shame
feels this way, swallowed and sharp, working its way deeper with
each move to dislodge the pain, so that finally, we lie still,
dying with blood in our mouths. We eat our stories and starve.''
</P>
<P>
   We read her story and bleed for her.

BEATING SWORDS INTO SUBURBS   IN EAST GERMANY'S BUNKER CAPITAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAN OTAKAR FISCHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The train to Dresden makes a stop at Wuensdorf, a dot on the map
25 miles south of Berlin, now once again the German capital. When
Werner Reisinger comes home from work each evening, he can see
blocky Cyrillic letters on the derelict station. They read:
``Wuensdorf-Moscow.'' Reisinger is again reminded that he lives on
hard-won ground.
</P>
<P>
   For most of a century, Wuensdorf led a secret double life: a
sleepy Prussian village twinned with a forbidden city of soldiers.
Now it is a city of civilians _ the site of the biggest settlement
project in Germany, whose success may inspire similar projects
throughout Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Wilhelm II cleared the land adjoining Wuensdorf for a
firing range and infantry school. By 1914, the site was the biggest
military base in Europe. In the chaotic years after World War I,
the barracks were occupied by the right-wing Freikorps troops.
After the Nazis took power in 1933, Hitler built a network of
concrete bunkers, code-named Maybach and Zeppelin, where the
invasion of Poland was coordinated in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   The bunkers were the German Army's World War II nerve center,
but to the end, the Allies did not know of their existence. In
March 1945, American planes destroyed barracks but did not hit the
bunker complex. A month later, as the Soviets drew nearer, the
bunkers were evacuated in hours. Cups of coffee were left warm on
the desks.
</P>
<P>
   The 60,000-acre military sector was transformed into the inner
sanctum of the Soviet forces in East Germany. The Zeppelin bunker
became their secret communications center, from which they were
prepared to direct a nuclear war against the West. Berlin was the
front line of the Cold War, and Wuensdorf was its field office,
with perhaps 30,000 to 70,000 Russians soldiers and their families
living in the military enclave. By September 1994, they were all
gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Brandenburg government established the Waldstadt Development
Agency, under the direction of a young Berlin official, Juergen
Baumann, charged with nothing less than building a new city in a
ghost town, where no one had ever lived without a uniform.
</P>
<P>
   To the west of the train tracks, in the old town of Wuensdorf,
little seems to have changed since the Berlin Wall came down.
Almost 3,000 people live in traditional detached houses. The signs
of prosperity are few: an occasional satellite dish, a rare new
car.
</P>
<P>
   East of the tracks, however, things are moving fast. The
military zone has been integrated with the old municipality and
rechristened Waldstadt, or town in the woods. Long three- and
four-story dormitorylike buildings stand in formation. Most of them
sport pastel-tone plaster facades and shiny red ceramic roof tiles.
Interspersed are brand-new-looking prefabricated concrete apartment
buildings, ringed by shady lawns.
</P>
<P>
   From zero in 1996, the population of Waldstadt has grown to
2,500, and projections allow for 10,000 by 2005. If the growth rate
is sustained, it will be one of Europe's highest.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is not a typical planned community. A tank tread
sits on a restaurant terrace. A flaking statue of an unknown jet
pilot and a corroded figure of Lenin emerge from the trees, and so
do huge rocket-shape concrete towers, their noses well above the
neighboring buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building a new community is an exciting and rare opportunity,
and this site is more interesting than most,'' said Wolfgang Metz,
an urban planner and a guiding force behind the efforts of the town
to reinvent itself.
</P>
<P>
   The inheritor of the Wuensdorf garrison, the Brandenburg state
government, called on Metz to help coordinate the Russian
evacuation of Wuensdorf. A deal was struck: Germany paid Russian
troops a salary to decommission, and in return the material
infrastructure was left mostly intact. The arrangement hastened the
withdrawal, but left the Germans with more than they bargained for:
45,000 cubic yards of trash, 250 tons of toxic chemicals, 30 tons
of spent munitions, 2,800 bombs and 98,000 rounds of ammunition.
The cleanup took two years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Waldstadt Development Agency hired Baumann. What
did he have to work with? More than 1,000 buildings of every
description _ barracks, administration buildings, factories, sports
facilities, warehouses, villas, stables _ 700 of which were deemed
fit for reuse. A territory of considerable charm, including dense
forests and a wide lakefront, which had not been environmentally
wasted. A fortunate site on a rail line and highway linked to
Berlin. And history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, we are turning a place of war into a place of peace,''
Baumann likes to say.
</P>
<P>
   The 1916 officers' headquarters building, imperial stables and
bunkers became protected monuments. Investors bolstered the
infrastructure with gas stations, banks and bakeries. The state
government moved 1,000 government officials into offices in the old
barracks, a crucial step in creating the core of an employment base
in the town. The first grammar school was built before there were
enough pupils to fill it.
</P>
<P>
   Petra Dittmer, 29, is a resettled employee of the state
ministry, and on weekends she takes people down into the Zeppelin
bunker. She grew up in the shadow of the Soviet base. ``We had no
idea about the bunkers or other things, but we sometimes saw the
soldiers in town,'' Dittmer said. ``Our shoemaker got a lot of
business.'' The promise of a low-cost, sanitized apartment, and of
a government job to which she did not have to commute, persuaded
her to join Baumann's roster.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new residents of Waldstadt are like those who fill
suburbs everywhere in Germany: young, middle-class couples with
children who want affordable, modern amenities in the embrace of
nature. Eighty percent are eastern Germans who may be seeking to
escape their still crumbling hometowns.
</P>
<P>
   Rental apartments in converted barracks range from studios to
five rooms, from $250 for 390 square feet to $660 for 1,240 square
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Converting barracks in this case was not the problem you might
expect, since at Wuensdorf they had always been used by officers
and their families,'' Baumann said.
</P>
<P>
   The old barracks were laid out with three-room apartments. These
buildings were gutted and then refitted with apartments of varying
sizes, along with new bathrooms, linoleum floors, parking spaces,
balconies and cable television.
</P>
<P>
   The result is housing that to a large extent conceals its
martial origins. Bright honey-color plaster walls and hanging
plants, playgrounds, birches and private garages serve to disguise
what are still unmistakably large and regimented structures. But
they end up looking solid and conservative.
</P>
<P>
   This is part of their appeal, if you can ignore history, because
across from your bedroom window may be a 70-foot concrete air raid
bunker or a hero of the Soviet Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing Waldstadt was perhaps more of a challenge for two of
its most recent arrivals, Werner and Hannelore Reisinger. Like
thousands of their colleagues, they spent last summer moving all
their belongings from Bonn, where Reisinger worked as chief
librarian of the Labor Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not want to live in the big city,'' Reisinger said.
</P>
<P>
   They bought the first available lot for a three-bedroom detached
house and then ordered wood-frame components from a builder. They
paid about $175,000 for more than 1,160 square feet of living
space. Nearly 700 one- or two-family houses are planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Berlin or even Bonn, we could only afford to rent in a
two-family house, but here we could build our own,'' Reisinger
said. ``And nature is at our doorstep. At night, we can hear the
wild boar snorting around below our window.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reisingers have not yet been to see the bunkers, though they
are visible less than 100 yards away. Reisinger's father was killed
fighting in Yugoslavia in 1943 _ she cannot bring herself to enter
the chambers where his last orders were dispatched.

</P>
<P>
   Not far below the surface lies another concern, common to most
settlers from western Germany: fitting in to the east. There is
still a suspicion among westerners that only the youngest people in
the former East Germany show the motivation to make something of
themselves (like turning a military base into a soldierless town);
and that an urge to buy now dominates the ``Ossie'' (eastern)
mentality, something the west got over decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   From the other side, western Germans, or Wessies, are still
thought of by many in eastern Germany as patronizing opportunists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a bit worried at first about being the new rich
Wessies on the block, with an instant house and stay-at-home wife
and all that,'' Reisinger said. ``But we have had no problems.''
</P>

<P>
   Metz has been busy luring transient visitors. One weekend, four
years ago, he was traveling in Britain and stopped at Hay-on-Wye,
the village near the Welsh border that has become a pilgrimage site
for rare book collectors. There are 20 such towns worldwide,
including Nevada City, Calif., and Metz immediately set about
adding Waldstadt to the list. The former army bathhouse and post
office were renovated to showcase the wares of a dozen German
antiquarians.
</P>
<P>
   The monolithic concrete and moldering relics of failed regimes
exert a fascination for war tourists, several hundred strong each
week. Hourly weekend tours take people into the chilly
107,000-square-foot recesses of the Zeppelin bunker, whose
reinforced walls the Russians discovered were too thick to
detonate.
</P>
<P>
   Metz, the first civilian to become a resident of Waldstadt, is
busy plotting the future from his office in the Book Town building
(now the unofficial town hall). In 1998, he gave up his civil
service job to form his own Book Town tourism company. The state of
Brandenburg has pumped in $130 million worth of investment, while
private investment stands around $160 million. Apartment rental
prices are averaging 65 cents a square foot compared with $1 a
square foot elsewhere in the region, so the space is rapidly
filling.
</P>
<P>
   Baumann is finding new distractions: a steady stream of
government officials from countries like the Czech Republic and
Ukraine have been arriving, seeking conversion advice for their own
tattered and abandoned infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The Book Town is opening a fourth building this summer. One way
Baumann wishes to foster community is to build up the cultural
base. An artists' colony has been proposed for the old troop
exercise yards, and the row of empty imperial stables is to become
a military museum extension, art galleries, a printing plant and
space for publishers. A couple of miles away, the officers'
headquarters complex is waiting for the right investor to revivify
the grand old Prussian spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kind of institution would be right, or a high-tech
company campus,'' Metz said. Then he paused with a smile, ``You
don't happen to know Bill Gates, do you, or maybe Steven
Spielberg?''

   With eight months left until November, Al Gore and George W.
Bush locked up their nominations with primary wins in the South.
Bush said he was braced for Gore's ``politics of personal
destruction and distortions,'' while Gore argued that Bush's
``risky tax scheme'' would hurt the economy. And Bush brushed off
as a stunt Gore's latest challenge: a promise to hold off on TV ads
funded by ``soft money'' as long as Bush does, too.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH AHEAD IN PARTY LOYALTY
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has his work cut out for him in the South. Exit surveys
by Voter News Service for several news media organizations
suggested that George W. Bush ran stronger among Democratic voters
than Gore did among Republicans. Just 6 percent of voters in
Republican primaries said they would vote for Gore in November;
twice as many Democrats said they would defect to Bush. And more
than 20 percent of Democrats said they had a favorable view of
Bush; half as many Republicans had a favorable view of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   THAT WOULD BE A NO-NO, GEORGE
</P>
<P>
   As the primary returns were coming in from Texas and five other
states, George W. Bush celebrated with supporters in Austin. His
campaign decided to feed the traveling press pork barbecue. The
only problem was that the victory party was held at the Dell Jewish
Community Center and they refused to allow pork on the premises.
</P>
<P>
   OVER ALMOST AS SOON AS IT BEGAN
</P>
<P>
   The front-loaded primary and caucus schedule enabled the vice
president and the Texas governor to win nominating majorities
earlier in the election year than any prior candidate who wasn't
already president. ``I think change is badly needed,'' said Jim
Nicholson, the Republican Party's national chairman. ``If we don't
change it, we're headed inexorably to a national primary day, and I
think that would be bad.'' Said Joe Andrew, Democratic national
chairman: ``The goal has got to be voter participation, not just a
rigid system that tries to spread things out.'' So far, however,
there's no consensus in either party on the problem or the
solution.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONS OPEN, REALLY OPEN
</P>
<P>
   John McCain's advisers are preparing to establish a political
action committee that would allow him to campaign for other
candidates this year and lay the groundwork for his own future,
which could include another White House race. McCain is expected to
give the final go-ahead on the project when he returns to work in
the Senate next week, the advisers told The Associated Press on
Wednesday. They also said McCain is still in no hurry to endorse
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   FEC LOOKING FOR A LITTLE HELP
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission is urging Congress to pass a law
saying foreigners cannot give any money to federal campaigns _ a
subject at the heart of the scandals involving President Clinton's
1996 re-election effort. The FEC wants Congress to enact such a
measure during its current session and make it a top priority. An
existing law specifically bans foreign contributions to candidates,
and the FEC has ruled that the statute also applies to unregulated
soft money given to political parties. But some courts have ruled
otherwise. Most of the foreign donations to the 1996 Democratic
presidential campaign were soft money contributions.
</P>
<P>
   STOCK OWNERSHIP NO OCCIDENT
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore defended his family's ownership of stock in Occidental
Petroleum Corp., which plans to drill on land near a Colombian
Indian reserve, saying ``there certainly is not'' anything wrong
with the arrangement. Gore inherited the stock from his father, the
late former Sen. Albert Gore Sr., who had served on the board and
served as chief executive of a subsidiary. The stock, valued at up
to $500,000, is in a trust fund to benefit his mother. ``If you can
find anything wrong with that, please tell me,'' Gore said. The
U'wa Indians believe oil exploration will bring violence and
destroy their culture.
</P>
<P>
   CULT-IVATING RELIGIOUS HARMONY?
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones University has dropped from its Web site statements
calling Catholicism and Mormonism cults. A new message on the site
has president Bob Jones III recounting how he contemplated on
Christmas Eve ``the growing worldwide hostility toward the
evangelizing efforts of Bible-believing Christians.'' But gone is
the message in which Jones said, ``The diminution of evangelistic
enterprise to cults which call themselves Christian, including
Catholicism and Mormonism, is frightening.'' The language was cited
repeatedly after George W. Bush was criticized for speaking on the
South Carolina campus Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY DEFENDS FUND-RAISING . . .
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton denied that a campaign event held last month in
New York by Pakistani-Americans influenced her husband's decision
to visit Pakistan during an upcoming trip. ``If anybody thinks they
can influence the president by making a contribution to me, they
are dead wrong, and I think there is no evidence of that,'' she
said. The Senate candidate said it was well known that her husband
wanted to include Pakistan in his visit to neighboring India. The
fund-raiser reportedly netted her $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND GIULIANI FORMS SOFT MONEY OPERATION
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani has set up a political action committee to collect
largely unregulated donations known as soft money. ``We have to
remain competitive. ... We're going to fight fire with fire,'' said
Stuart Roy, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial
Committee. An earlier decision by Clinton to set up soft-money
accounts for the New York Senate race had been roundly criticized
by Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN `SUSPENDED' FROM BALLOT
</P>
<P>
   Oregon officials have decided to remove John McCain's name from
the primary ballot in May, a move that has irked some McCain
supporters, who noted that he has not formally withdrawn from the
presidential race. McCain said last week that he was ``suspending''
his campaign. Oregon Secretary of State Bill Bradbury said voters
would be presented with ``a false choice'' if McCain's name
remained on the ballot, and that any of his die-hard supporters
could still write-in his name. The move leaves two Republicans on
the ballot, George W. Bush and Alan Keyes, and two Democrats, Al
Gore and Lyndon LaRouche.
</P>
<P>
   EASIER FOR TED THIS TIME
</P>
<P>
   The last time Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) sought re-election, he
faced one of the stiffest challenges of his long political career.
That was against Republican Mitt Romney in 1994. This time around,
the six-termer may not even break a sweat. Kennedy's likely
Republican challenger is Michael Sullivan, district attorney in
Plymouth County. He has little money or name recognition despite a
solid political background that includes three terms in the
Massachusetts House and two terms as district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA DEMOCRAT LOOKS GOOD IN POLL
</P>
<P>
   A poll of registered voters in the Florida Senate race offered
some encouragement to state Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson, the
lone Democrat, and Republican Education Commissioner Tom Gallagher.
It was less kind to Republican Rep. Bill McCollum, one of the House
managers who prosecuted President Clinton's impeachment trial. A
survey by Mason-Dixon Polling and Research Inc. (4 percentage point
margin of error) found that Nelson would win a hypothetical general
election over McCollum by 43 percent to 33 percent, and would nudge
Gallagher by 39 percent to 38 percent. Republican Sen. Connie Mack
is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   HATCH GETS A CHALLENGER
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from an unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential
nomination, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) will not even have clear
sailing toward a fifth term. Democratic state Sen. Scott Howell,
Senate minority leader since 1995, said he'll oppose Hatch in
November. For Democrats, Howell is a lifesaver: Until now, Hatch
was unopposed by both parties.
</P>
<P>
   RUNOFF FOR RIGHT TO FACE ARCHER
</P>
<P>
   Texans head back to the polls April 11 for runoffs to decide
which Republican will be the favorite to replace retiring House
Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer this fall. Rep. John Culberson
and businessman Peter Wareing were the top vote-getters among eight
GOP candidates. The winner will be considered a shoo-in against
lone Democrat Jeff Sell. Archer, who went to Congress in 1970, was
the only incumbent in Texas' 30-member House delegation not to seek
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   RUNOFF FOR RIGHT TO FACE HUTCHINSON
</P>
<P>
   Five little-known Democrats sought to oppose Texas Republican
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson. Gene Kelly, a retired Air Force lawyer
who has lost six previous statewide bids, snared the top berth.
Party favorite Charles Gandy, who served one term in the
Legislature in the early 1980s, was locked in a tight race for
second place with computer systems analyst Don Clark. In East
Texas, actor Noble Willingham of ``Walker, Texas Ranger'' fame
snagged the GOP nomination to take on Democratic Rep. Max Sandlin.
</P>
<P>
   RUNOFF IN MISSISSIPPI, BUT NOT FOR LOTT
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, seeking his
third term, escaped a primary challenge. Troy Brown Sr., an
unsuccessful candidate for lieutenant governor last year, will face
national party representative Rickey Cole in the April 4 Democratic
runoff. In the 4th Congressional District, District Attorney Dunn
Lampton beat a primary challenger to face freshman Democratic Rep.
Ronnie Shows.
</P>
<P>
   GAY MAJORITY ON TOWN COUNCIL
</P>
<P>
   An openly gay city council member, John Fiore, was elected mayor
of Wilton Manor, Fla., a feat believed to have made the
municipality north of Fort Lauderdale one of only two in the nation
with a gay majority. Fiore, 46, has been on the council since 1988
and was the vice mayor. The town has two other gay members of the
council. West Hollywood, Calif., is the only other U.S. city with a
gay majority on its council, according to the Gay and Lesbian
Victory Fund.
</P>
<P>
   CLOGGED STREETS, UNCLOGGED RE-ELECTION
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, two-term Orlando Mayor Glenda Hood easily won
re-election in a hotly contested race where the city's clogged
streets had become the central issue. In tiny Briny Breezes, an
oceanside mobile home park near Boca Raton, voters re-elected
77-year-old Mayor Robert Conkey, who spent $11 in his campaign. His
83-year-old opponent didn't spend a cent.

<P>
   While just a few years ago it might have been akin to owning a
Lear jet, having your own Web page these days is about as exciting
as, well, having your own e-mail address. But if you really want
one, whether to show off family photos or to plug a new business,
there is plenty of room still available in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Internet service providers like America Online, Earthlink, AT&AMP;T
WorldNet Service and Juno Web offer the easiest and fastest way to
create and publish Web pages. Most offer five to 15 megabytes of
storage space for the pages they hold on their servers. That is
more than enough to accommodate several pages with images and text.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the space, these services offer simple
page-creation programs that let you type in text, choose background
colors and transmit digital photographs from your system to the
server. Most offer the page-making program free when you sign up
for the monthly Internet service (ranging from about $10 to $20 per
month, depending on the provider and amount of time spent online).
</P>
<P>
   America Online's 1-2-3 Publish feature, for example, lets AOL
subscribers set up a free home page in a few steps. Pick a
background color and a logo for the top of the page, type in a
title and some text, add a few favorite Web pages for links, and
you're done.
</P>
<P>
   Many Internet portals like Yahoo, Mindspring and About.com now
offer the ability to create Web pages at no charge, in exchange for
registering and agreeing to allow the portal to run an advertising
banner somewhere on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The megaportals are in many cases offering free Web building
as another enticement to get you to come to their site,'' said Gene
Phifer, vice president and research director of Internet strategic
services at the Gartner Group, an Internet research firm based in
Stamford, Conn. ``It's appealing to people's egos, having the
ability to say, `I've got a Web site.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site programs available at ISPs and portals are an easy
way to display family photos and keep relatives up to date on the
latest family activities. Some people might find posting a Web page
to be a more palatable alternative to sending out the newsy ``Dear
everyone'' holiday notes, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Although you can usually create a page in a couple of hours with
these types of programs, they do not give you a lot of flexibility
in terms of how your pages look. Most of these programs offer a
limited number of page templates, fonts, colors and borders. Other
elements that are common on more sophisticated Web pages, like
streams of moving text, clocks or flashing buttons or images are
hard to come by, although some portals and ISPs are starting to
make them available.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to be more creative with their pages and
incorporate some flashy features can choose from a variety of
software, like Microsoft FrontPage 2000 ($149, before a $40
rebate), Sausage Software's HotDog PageWiz 1.02 ($70) and
NetObjects Fusion 5.0 ($299).
</P>
<P>
   Like the programs used by the ISPs and portals, these
what-you-see-is-what-you-get, or Wysiwyg (pronounced WIZZY-wig),
programs let you lay out a page without having to know HTML, the
computer code used for writing Web pages. Instead, you can focus on
how the page looks while the program translates your work into
HTML.
</P>
<P>
   After you insert a photo, write a paragraph of text or insert a
page link, the program immediately displays the result on a working
sample, letting you click Save or Undo after each step.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the ISPs that sell Net access for a fee let
people create pages within a Wysiwyg editor and then send the file
to the host site, not every ISP will accept all Wysiwyg programs.
</P>
<P>
   These off-the-shelf programs offer both adventurous novices and
experienced Webmasters the chance to create original and complex
sites. ``I'm absolutely amazed that two weeks ago I said to myself,
`I'm going to create a site,' and that I was able to without the
slightest knowledge of how to do it,'' said Jason Orans, a film
producer in New York who is developing an entertainment-related
site using FrontPage 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Orans said it had taken him about a day to learn the basics of
FrontPage 2000 and about three days to put up a page. ``I'm pretty
happy with the site, but I still don't have the knowledge or skills
to do exactly what I want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the programs also let the Web purist write and edit in
HTML, allowing complete control of the page's design.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who are building pages will view the source codes of
pages they like and cut and paste them into their own work to use
as a model. All Internet browsers have the ability to display the
HTML source code of a Web site. In Microsoft Internet Explorer, for
example, clicking on the View button on the upper-right part of the
screen and selecting the Source option will display the code.
Although copying whole pages of work from other sites is frowned on
by Web designers, it is generally acceptable to borrow font styles
and colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK to mimic code, as long as you use your own graphics
and text,'' said Will Harris of Point Reyes, Calif., who is the
editor of efuse.com, a site for beginning and intermediate-level
Web page designers.
</P>
<P>
   Another option for people who want to build a more sophisticated
site than those found at the free portals is available at
Homestead.com. A free Web publishing service that began operating
last June, Homestead.com offers hundreds of templates for specific
uses, like promoting a business, an event, a club or a hobby. There
are also personal-page templates geared to different age groups.
Homestead.com has a large bag of tricks to choose from, including
novelty cursors, shopping carts, guest books and chat rooms.
Although the service is free, features like stock quotes and chat
display the names of the companies that have provided them. You
will also have to indicate whether you want to participate in the
optional user surveys, which Homestead.com uses to deliver
advertising.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No matter what method you use to create a Web site, it is a good
idea to test your page on different computers. Factors like
Internet connection speed, processor speed and system memory can
affect how quickly the pages load, and monitor size can determine
how much of each page is displayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people make the mistake of putting a 200-kilobyte
image of their dog on their opening page, thinking that it only
takes a minute or so to load when they test it at work,'' said
Jeffrey Veen, a designer at Wired Digital in San Francisco. ``Then
they see that it actually takes five minutes to load on their
computer at home.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a good idea to see how your pages run on both
Netscape and Microsoft Internet Explorer because they sometimes
read certain lines of HTML differently.
</P>
<P>
   If you are building Web pages to promote yourself or your
business, you might want to register your own domain name. Getting
your own domain name at one of the dozens of registrars, like
Networksolutions.com or Register.com, requires that you check that
the name you want is not already taken and that you pay a fee
(usually $70 for two years). You then have to find an ISP to serve
as host for the site with your domain name, which costs an average
of $50 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Some services will post a site at no cost. Angelfire.com, for
example, will do it free, but your domain name will appear as
www.angelfire.com with two more names, or directories, after .com
that you select from a pull-down menu. You choose the first
directory based on your state or interest, like ``NY'' or
``Pokemon,'' then enter the text you want for the second directory.
(You could, for example, end up with
www.angelfire.com/pokemon/lover.) Although the result is a domain
name that may not necessarily reflect your business or interests,
your site is online free.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where your site is located, most page-creation
programs provide password protection options, which allow you to
control who sees it. ``No matter how confined you think your group
of visitors is going to be, you never know who's going to come in
and look at it,'' said Chuck Green, president of Logic Arts, a Web
design firm in Glen Ellen, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Although a sense of place adds to the overall feeling of a site,
Green said, site creators should never include information that
they would not post on a sign in the backyard. And when you include
those family photos, he added, never reveal children's names or the
exact location of your residence.

A VARIATION ON THE SEQUEL FORMULA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHARLES HEROLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as Hollywood does, the computer game industry loves to turn
out sequels. Myst begat Riven, and Final Fantasy begat Final
Fantasy 2 through 8. But computer games have another kind of sequel
_ called the mission pack _ that Hollywood can only dream of.
</P>
<P>
   When an action game is successful, the manufacturer puts out a
mission pack as soon as possible. Mission packs let companies add
new levels without building a whole new game engine and make more
money without actually coming up with a new product. And mission
packs, created with more speed and less inspiration than the
original games, are almost never as good.
</P>
<P>
   Valve Software, the creator of Half-Life, has teamed with
Gearbox Software for a mission pack called Half-Life: Opposing
Force. Just as Half-Life changed the first-person shooter genre by
providing a fully developed story, Opposing Force, by rethinking
that story, could do the same for mission packs.
</P>
<P>
   In Half-Life, the player was a scientist named Gordon Freeman
who had witnessed an accident that ripped a hole in space, allowing
horrific monsters to invade Earth. Freeman, making his way to the
planet's surface to find help, discovered that the government had
tried to cover up the botched experiment by sending in the Marines,
who proved as deadly as the aliens.
</P>
<P>
   As a story line, this might not seem very complex, but since
previous shooters had story lines like ``aliens have destroyed the
earth: kill them all,'' Half-Life became the ``Citizen Kane'' of
the genre.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical mission pack, you would play a few more levels of
Half-Life as Freeman. But Opposing Force puts you inside the skin
of one of Half-Life's villains, a marine who has been sent to cover
up the disaster. In Hollywood terms, it is like watching one of
those sports movies in which the coach has to redeem his violent
past and the quarterback needs a scholarship to get out of the
slums, then watching a version of the same movie, this time about
the opposing team's coach who wants to win one more time before he
dies of cancer and the team misfit who finally has a chance to
prove himself to his abusive father.
</P>
<P>
   The mission pack begins with boot camp, where you are impolitely
told that you are a maggot before being shipped out to the Black
Mesa Research Project for what your buddies are afraid will be a
``baby-sitting mission.'' You play the game in the same time frame
as Half-Life; you hear some of the same radio reports and even
catch sight of Freeman boarding an alien transporter.
</P>
<P>
   As with Half-Life, the plot gives you a sense of being part of
an ongoing crisis. When a dying soldier wheezes, ``You've got to
kill that thing,'' you have a sense of purpose unknown in a game
like Quake. If the soldier had not told you to kill the monster,
you would have done it anyway because it is the only way to
continue, but the narrative structure makes the player's objectives
more palpable. All good shooters are fueled by adrenaline, but
Opposing Force makes you wonder not only whom to shoot next but
also what may happen next.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot does happen. In a series of imaginative levels you are
challenged by intelligent puzzles of the
get-into-that-unreachable-place or fix-the-monster-killing-machine
kind, along with heart-stopping action and graphic violence. If
bloody skulls landing at your feet disturb you, the game's
content-control option allows you to turn off the gore. (The
control is protected by a password so that parents can shield their
children from the sight of aliens spurting blood.)
</P>
<P>
   As with any mission pack, there are new aliens to encounter.
That is Opposing Force's concession to the mission pack tradition:
Logically, if you are in the same place at the same time as you
were in the original game, it is unlikely that you will meet any
new monsters. You can also team up with other marines _ a medic, an
engineer and a grunt _ lead them into a dangerous area and then run
back and hide while they battle it out with the alien hordes. Hey,
war isn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is a mission pack, a lowly add-on that will not even
run without the original game, Opposing Force is the best new
shooter since Half-Life a year earlier, almost matching the
original. Kingpin may be edgier, Mortyr more visually seductive,
but you can stop playing either game without ever wondering how it
all turned out.
</P>
<P>
   It is too bad Opposing Force does not go a bit further. In the
original, the marines were out to kill the scientists, including
Freeman. In the mission pack, your helicopter is shot down before
you are given the order to murder the scientists. The mission pack
would have been meatier had you been ordered to shoot unarmed
civilians and had become disturbed by the government conspiracy of
which you were now a part.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Opposing Force makes the marines the good guys. The bad
guys are ``black ops'' who are as interested in killing marines as
they are in killing aliens. Maybe it would have been too much to
ask that a game primarily concerned with blasting aliens have a
conflicted anti-hero, but playing off the original story would have
been an awfully entertaining counterpoint. Of course, if you wanted
to stay in the spirit of the first game, you could shoot scientists
and security guards on your own, but they are not much of a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer dramatic value, it might be better to play Opposing
Force before Half-Life. You could start with the marine grunt's
view of battle, not knowing the circumstances or the overall
objectives, and then find some answers by playing as Freeman. It
would be a little offbeat to play a mission pack before the game
itself, but Half-Life broke some rules, so why shouldn't you?

DYSFUNCTION   AT A JUNCTION   OF CONFESSION   AND COMEDY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ His mother was a manic-depressive schizophrenic who
killed one of her husbands, wound up in a mental hospital and
committed suicide. His father drank too much and married five
times. Their son was _ as you can imagine _ an unhappy and
dysfunctional child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've driven your drunk father to your mom's parole
hearing, what else is there?'' said the son, Christopher Titus, 35,
the star and co-creator of ``Titus,'' an autobiographical Fox
sitcom that essentially turns tragedy on its head. The half-hour
show has its premiere on Monday night at 8:30.
</P>
<P>
   Titus, who grew up in small towns in Northern California, has
been a stand-up comedian since he was 17. But in 1994, at the
Montreal Comedy Festival, he finally got tired of being what he
called ``a happy comic, making observational jokes, being physical
and high energy.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled: ``I wanted to quit. I got tired of talking about
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   His agent and friend, Bruce Smith, pulled him aside. ``He said:
`What are you doing? You're talking like Seinfeld. You're not
Seinfeld. You're talking like a happy guy. You're intense and
driven. Talk about your life.'''
</P>
<P>
   Titus said the audience would never get it. But he went ahead
and nervously tried a two-and-a-half-minute act about his troubled
family, about growing up in a world where his mother was mostly in
mental hospitals and his father drank and caroused.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of it the audience went nuts,'' said Titus. ``I
instantly changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fox Network already has one dysfunctional family in its
lineup, in ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' the most successful new
sitcom on television. But that show _ with its genius son and
funny, wacky parents _ hardly has the edge or the potentially
tragic undertone of ``Titus.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Grushow, chairman of the Fox Television Entertainment
Group, acknowledged that ``Titus'' was hardly a traditional sitcom.
``That's a good thing because it's been proven time and time again
that the conventional half-hour format doesn't work any longer,''
said Grushow. ``At Fox we're accustomed to doing things that are a
little bit outside the box. That's where `Titus' fits in.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has been a haven for dysfunctional families ranging from the
Bundys in ``Married . . . With Children'' to the animated
characters in shows like ``The Simpsons'' and ``King of the Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Grushow acknowledged that he was a little concerned about the
reaction to ``Titus.'' ``Unlike `Malcolm,' I believe `Titus' will
be a show that's polarizing,'' he said. ``There'll be people who
love it, and people who won't have a taste for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Titus' partners in creating the series are Jack Kenny and Brian
Hargrove, two former New York stage actors who have been writers on
shows like ``Dave's World'' and producers on ``Caroline in the
City.'' Partly because of their theatrical training and Titus'
stand-up comedy experience, the series is taped in front of an
audience without interruption to give it a sense of live theater.
Usually studio audiences sit for three or four hours or even longer
during the taping of a 22-minute sitcom while scenes are reshaped.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts a lot more pressure on the actors,'' said Kenny.
``It is like theater.'' Hargrove said, ``But there's an energy and
immediacy and focus that the actors and the audience bring to it
that, we hope, is translated onto film.''
</P>
<P>
   The pivot of the show is, of course, Titus. The other major
character, Ken Titus, his father, is played by Stacy Keach.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Titus said with a laugh that at first his father was
a little disturbed by the way he was depicted on the show but that
he now enjoyed it. ``My dad got a little angry, but he signed the
release,'' said Titus. ``What's he going to do? My brother, Dave,
is fine with it. He's like an extreme sports guy. He surfs all
day.''
</P>
<P>
   But the show's blurring of the line between fiction and reality
takes some odd turns. At a recent Friday-night taping, Titus
proudly introduced his father, who stood and waved to the audience.
The taping that night depicted a real-life event: His father once
faked a heart attack because he smashed up a car while he was
engaged in sex with a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is wickedly close to my life,'' said Titus. ``My dad
never missed a drink, never missed a joint, never missed a party.
He also never missed a day of work, a house payment or a car
payment. He was a single parent, and he did his best.''
</P>
<P>
   One or two episodes will depict Titus' mother returning home for
a visit from a mental hospital. His mother, Juanita, killed herself
in 1994. She had earlier shot and killed an abusive husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know her well,'' said Titus. ``She was a concert
pianist. She spoke four languages. She was brilliant. But she
wouldn't take her medicine. She loved the ride of schizophrenia.''
Titus himself grew up with two half-sisters and a half-brother.
</P>
<P>
   Titus said that as a 5-year-old he wanted to make people laugh
and to become a comedian. He would sneak behind the sofa every
night so he could stay up late to watch Johnny Carson, and he
listened to and imitated the records of Bill Cosby. He began
performing in clubs as a teen-ager in San Francisco and in recent
years has won a following on the club circuit. A one-man show at
the Hudson Theater in Los Angeles in 1998 called ``Norman Rockwell
Is Bleeding'' led Michael Hanel, senior vice president of comedy at
20th Century Fox Television, to team Titus with Kenny and Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   Titus is married to his high school sweetheart, Erin, who is
also depicted on the show.
</P>
<P>
   The ever candid Titus said: ``My wife and I once cheated on each
other. I said the most cruel things in the world to her. We fought
through it. Now no one can ever get between us.'' The incident will
of course be used on the series.

&HT;     HOUSE SEEKS DRAMATIC RISE IN VISAS FOR HIGH-TECH WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: Filed in the ``f'' and ``w'' categories)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A coalition of House members introduced legislation
Wednesday that would dramatically raise the ceiling on visas for
foreigners with high-tech skills from 115,000 to 200,000 over the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the second increase in the cap in two years and is
similar to legislation moving through the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of raising the limits under the H-1B visa program say
that if companies can hire skilled workers from overseas, they will
not bother to train older American workers or strive to improve the
teaching of computers and technology in schools.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, backed by Democrats and Republicans, attempts to
deflect such criticism by boosting to $1,000 from $500 the visa fee
paid by employers of foreign workers. The money would be used for
scholarships and training for students in computer and
technology-related fields.
</P>
<P>
   The bill gives current H-1B workers the right to remain in the
United States while they await green cards. It also sets aside
10,000 of the visas for universities that have difficulty
attracting foreign workers in high-tech areas such as engineering
and computer programming.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., the sponsor of the bill, said an
unprecedented shortage of skilled workers is threatening the
technology industry that he said has created 4.8 million jobs in
six years and has created the highest standard of living in
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let the technology labor shortage undermine our
economic boom,'' Dreier told a news conference. ``Prosperity in the
information age is fueled by brainpower and people, not steel and
machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies in the Silicon Valley of California and other regions
flush with technology-related jobs predict they will hit this
year's limit of 115,000 foreign workers this spring. Under existing
law, they would have to wait until new visas become available on
Oct. 1, when the H-1B visa cap will drop to 107,500. In 2002, they
would be further squeezed as the cap is scheduled to drop to
65,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., said a key part of the bill would
allow workers on H-1B visas to stay in this country while
immigration officials process their applications for permanent
visas.
</P>
<P>
   The H-1B program, created in 1990 with a cap of 65,000 visas per
year, grants visas for up to six years to noncitizens with college
degrees. The maximum period of admission in the United States is
three years, but it can be extended for three more.
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren said backlogs at the Immigration and Naturalization
Service are forcing highly skilled workers to wait years for
permanent visas, which often means their employers must to send
them back to their native countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be hundreds of thousands of people sent home in the
next few years'' unless the law is changed, Lofgren said.
</P>
<P>
   The co-sponsors of Dreier's Helping to Improve Technology
Education and Achievement Act are Adam Smith, D-Wash., Thomas M.
Davis, R-Va., Calvin Dooley, D-Calif., Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.,
James P. Moran, D-Va., Pete Sessions, R-Texas and Anna Eshoo,
D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Eshoo said the legislation would ``import the best trained
people in the world while providing the resources and programs to
train and educate our own citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who heads the House immigration
subcommittee, has a competing bill that would raise the visa cap to
160,000 only for this year, then retain the current levels for the
two succeeding years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Senate Judiciary Committee approved legislation
that would boost the number of H-1B visas to 195,000 this fiscal
year, which ends Sept. 30, and during the next two fiscal years. It
would exempt those who come to the United States to work at
universities and those who have recently received advanced degrees
at a U.S. college.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, led an effort to raise
the annual ceiling on high-tech visas from 65,000 to 115,000 for
the 1999 and 2000 budget years.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A coalition of House members introduced legislation
Wednesday that would dramatically raise the ceiling on visas for
foreigners with high-tech skills from 115,000 to 200,000 over the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the second increase in the cap in two years and is
similar to legislation moving through the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of raising the limits under the H-1B visa program say
that if companies can hire skilled workers from overseas, they will
not bother to train older American workers or strive to improve the
teaching of computers and technology in schools.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, backed by Democrats and Republicans, attempts to
deflect such criticism by boosting to $1,000 from $500 the visa fee
paid by employers of foreign workers. The money would be used for
scholarships and training for students in computer and
technology-related fields.
</P>
<P>
   The bill gives current H-1B workers the right to remain in the
United States while they await green cards. It also sets aside
10,000 of the visas for universities that have difficulty
attracting foreign workers in high-tech areas such as engineering
and computer programming.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., the sponsor of the bill, said an
unprecedented shortage of skilled workers is threatening the
technology industry that he said has created 4.8 million jobs in
six years and has created the highest standard of living in
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let the technology labor shortage undermine our
economic boom,'' Dreier told a news conference. ``Prosperity in the
information age is fueled by brainpower and people, not steel and
machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies in the Silicon Valley of California and other regions
flush with technology-related jobs predict they will hit this
year's limit of 115,000 foreign workers this spring. Under existing
law, they would have to wait until new visas become available on
Oct. 1, when the H-1B visa cap will drop to 107,500. In 2002, they
would be further squeezed as the cap is scheduled to drop to
65,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., said a key part of the bill would
allow workers on H-1B visas to stay in this country while
immigration officials process their applications for permanent
visas.
</P>
<P>
   The H-1B program, created in 1990 with a cap of 65,000 visas per
year, grants visas for up to six years to noncitizens with college
degrees. The maximum period of admission in the United States is
three years, but it can be extended for three more.
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren said backlogs at the Immigration and Naturalization
Service are forcing highly skilled workers to wait years for
permanent visas, which often means their employers must to send
them back to their native countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be hundreds of thousands of people sent home in the
next few years'' unless the law is changed, Lofgren said.
</P>
<P>
   The co-sponsors of Dreier's Helping to Improve Technology
Education and Achievement Act are Adam Smith, D-Wash., Thomas M.
Davis, R-Va., Calvin Dooley, D-Calif., Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.,
James P. Moran, D-Va., Pete Sessions, R-Texas and Anna Eshoo,
D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Eshoo said the legislation would ``import the best trained
people in the world while providing the resources and programs to
train and educate our own citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who heads the House immigration
subcommittee, has a competing bill that would raise the visa cap to
160,000 only for this year, then retain the current levels for the
two succeeding years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Senate Judiciary Committee approved legislation
that would boost the number of H-1B visas to 195,000 this fiscal
year, which ends Sept. 30, and during the next two fiscal years. It
would exempt those who come to the United States to work at
universities and those who have recently received advanced degrees
at a U.S. college.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, led an effort to raise
the annual ceiling on high-tech visas from 65,000 to 115,000 for
the 1999 and 2000 budget years.

BLACK REVIEWS,   STILL A SECRET  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By   MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It matters that few people in book publishing seem
aware of the existence of an ambitious, glossy bimonthly magazine
devoted entirely to black literary culture, to books by or about
blacks and to news about the few black people who work in
publishing. The magazine, Black Issues Book Review, is a secret
that doesn't want to be kept, and it matters that it is largely
unknown in the industry because more books written by black authors
are being published than ever before. Black Issues is trying, with
some success, to reach African-Americans, particularly but not
exclusively those on the high end socially and economically. In
short, regular book customers.
</P>
<P>
   To mainstream publishing, blacks are somewhat like a very
welcome weekend guest that the host doesn't quite know how to
entertain. Thus, for instance, Susan McHenry, editor of Black
Issues, said that although the magazine is filled with book
reviews, it still has difficulty getting on publishers' lists to
receive galleys of new black books. It's not that publishers want
to withhold them; it's just that they don't think black. Without
such galleys, there can be no reviews, and without reviews no
influence for the publication and no sales for the book.
</P>
<P>
   Among other examples: in some book stores, the works of Toni
Morrison are found on the racks identified as African-American
literature, not general literature, where one would expect to find
a Nobel laureate. (Sometimes, but not always, they are
cross-indexed.) There remains that old question: Where are the
black editors? The answer is not that publishers don't want them
but rather that they don't know how to attract them. This is not
about prejudice as much as it is about a meandering lack of
urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the growing number of books by and about blacks, in
recent years black readers' groups have popped up all over.
Publishers, with some exceptions, have been slow to respond to this
expanding constituency. Doubleday Direct, the book club division of
Bertelsmann, has Black Expressions, a club devoted to books by and
about blacks, with its own online version, and Ballantine has its
One World imprint, which publishes black writers. HarperCollins
owns Amistad Press, devoted to work by and about African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's a divide between what's being published and
what's being publicized about black literature; to cross that
divide there are black literary magazines, the newest among them
Black Issues. Its latest issue, March-April 2000, celebrates the
magazine's first anniversary. There are other magazines, like The
Quarterly Black Review, founded in 1993, and Mosaic Literary
Magazine, a quarterly founded two years ago as a showcase for new
black literary writers.
</P>
<P>
   Black Issues is a slick magazine, ambitious in scope, with crisp
writing and quality production values. Its format is slightly
larger than a news weekly, and it is divided into sections about
literary subjects (the latest issue features poetry and the cover
line is ``Rap Is Poetry: Hip-Hop's Poet Ambassadors'') and the
business of book publishing. Between them are scattered eight
fiction reviews, 11 nonfiction reviews, six reviews of books of
poetry and the usual magazine tchotchkes: shorts about deals,
today's top 10 poetry CD's, a feature called Bookbytes etc.
</P>
<P>
   Rone Shavers, the managing editor, said the magazine hoped to
attract bookstores, libraries, agents, book publicists and art
designers, ``but the main mission is reaching regular book
readers.''
</P>
<P>
   McHenry said: ``There's no one place where someone can go and
find out what's in the bookstores and libraries about people of
African descent. A major national review may review a handful of
black books a year. We do more than that in our latest issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have a national forum for the growing black book
audience,'' she continued. ``There's a community of lovers of black
literature who are interested in contemporary black writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Black Issues was founded by a cultural entrepreneur, William E.
Cox, who had started two other publications, Black Issues in Higher
Education and Community College Week, a newspaper. Both are
bimonthly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran book reviews in the higher education magazine,'' he
said, ``and we started to receive so many unsolicited book reviews
back from readers there was no way we could publish them. First we
did a special report twice a year. But there was this tremendous
interest in books, we found, based on our feedback. Why starve an
audience out there?''
</P>
<P>
   The first issue of the book review was sent to colleges and
universities. ``But I wanted to cut across all areas, whether high
school graduate or not, whether college graduate or not,'' Cox
said. ``I wanted a broad-based audience, yet I wanted to attack the
high end economically and socially.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine sells 40,000 copies of each issue, through
subscriptions and newsstands, which includes bookstores, most but
not all of which are black. The Borders chain is its largest
advertiser and major supporter, and has been from the start. The
magazine is advertising-driven, and Cox hopes to start making money
on it in two years. Black Issues in Education also sells 40,000
copies each issue, but it has much more advertising and is a
moneymaker, Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest issue of the book review has 74 pages, about its
average size. Borders has its usual full-page ad inside the front
cover and a second one for its Web site. Absolut vodka has the back
cover. In between are but a few book publishing ads. Of the
mainstream publishers, Doubleday has a full-page ad, and Penguin
Putnam has an ad. There are also ads from Arabesque, Warner Aspect
and the University of Indiana Press.
</P>
<P>
   Book publishers, who often moan about their sales, should
certainly be out there supporting anything that moves the product,
which makes the ghostly absence of major publishing house ads all
that more surprising.

 &HT;    BLACK COLLEGES WIN APPROVAL FOR STUDENT LOANS
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Students at the 13 black colleges with the highest
default rates on their student loans can continue to get federal
loans and grants, the Education Department announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   All the schools had received warnings after an average of 25
percent or more of their former students, as measured over a
three-year period, weren't making payments on their student loans.
A legal exemption from the rules for ``historically black colleges
and universities'' expired last June.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Woods, chief operating officer of the department's office
of student financial assistance, said that all 13 have since taken
one of the two steps needed to avoid the loss of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Some reduced their loan default rate below 25 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most devised a default management plan acceptable to Woods's
office, and hired an experienced contractor to help implement the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The plans ``help them lower their default rates while raising
their financial accountability,'' Woods said. ``It's best for the
students, it's best for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13 schools and their 1997 default rates, reported last
October, are:
</P>
<P>
   Miles College, Birmingham, Ala., 25.2 percent; Arkansas Baptist
College, Little Rock, Ark., 21.5; Mary Holmes College, West Point,
Miss., 26.3; Barber-Scotia College, Concord, N.C., 33.3; Central
State University, Wilberforce, Ohio, 22.5; Allen University,
Columbia, S.C., 42.1; Lane College, Jackson, Tenn., 18.2;
Huston-Tillotson, Austin, Texas, 26.7; Paul Quinn College, Dallas,
36.8; Texas Southern University, Houston, 21.4; Wiley College,
Marshall, Texas, 10.9; Southwestern Christian College, Terrell,
Texas, 31.1, and Texas College, Tyler, Texas, 53.8.

   Microphones for People Who Hate Headset Hair  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If headsets introduced the era of hands-free telephones, then a
couple of new products may usher in the era of head-free headsets.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies are offering PC microphones that allow users
to use voice-recognition programs, even Internet telephony, without
the bother of being wired to the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Labtec's Clearvoice LVA-7280 Digital Microphone and the Desktop
Array microphone from Andrea Electronics both use four microphones
and digital signal processors to capture the voice of the speaker
and to block out other voices and ambient sound. In the case of
Labtec's products, users can move within about a 30-degree radius
of the microphone and within a distance of about two feet and be
clearly understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering you don't have these things strapped to your head,
they offer performance on par with close-track microphones,'' said
Jeff Anderson, an electrical and acoustical engineering manager
with Labtec Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Labtec ran tests in conversation-filled office settings and
found that its microphone still recognized only the speaker's
voice, Anderson said. The Clearvoice retails for $129.95 and is
available this week through the company Web site. Andrea sells the
Desktop Array for $149.95 and also sells the Autoarray, a version
designed for auto PCs.

   CompuServe Faces Lawsuit Over Delayed Rebate Checks
</P>
<P>
   In the latest legal skirmish over rebate programs in the
computer industry, a Florida law firm has filed a class-action suit
against CompuServe Interactive Services, accusing CompuServe of not
giving rebates to customers in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed this month on behalf of two Florida customers
who were each promised a $400 rebate when they purchased a Compaq
Presario and signed up for three years of CompuServe's 2000 Premier
Service in August 1999. The suit says the rebate checks were not
received until last month and seeks to have CompuServe pay
interest.
</P>
<P>
   CompuServe began its rebate program with computer manufacturers
like Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and IBM in July 1999. Ann Bentley, a
spokeswoman for CompuServe, said the company advises customers in
the rebate agreement that checks take 8 to 10 weeks to arrive. The
rebate program was similar to those offered by other Internet
service providers as a way to get more people to sign up for their
services. CompuServe has mailed more than 700,000 rebate checks,
Bentley said.
</P>
<P>
   But Byron Petersen, a lawyer at Petersen &AMP; Hawthorne in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., who is handling the suit, said the firm had
received more than 100 e-mail messages from CompuServe customers
who were awaiting rebate checks.
</P>
<P>
   Trish Primrose, a spokeswoman for America Online (CompuServe is
a wholly owned subsidiary of AOL), said CompuServe has a Rebate
button on its site that allows customers to check the progress of
their rebates. ``Some of the problems in issuing rebate checks stem
from CompuServe customers not filling out the rebate forms
correctly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission recently reached agreements with
Memtek Products and Umax Technologies, stating that the two
computer products companies would provide checks to their customers
within the time specified on the rebate agreements. Mitchell Katz,
a spokesman for the FTC, said that it has not filed a complaint
against CompuServe in relation to rebate offers.

   OED Finds Meaning For the Word `Internet'  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perspicacious or precipitous? Heuristic or hermeneutic? The
ongoing battle to sound smarter than you really are just got a
little easier and a lot more expensive. On Tuesday, the Oxford
English Dictionary made all the entries from its 20-volume second
edition available on its Web site (www.oed.com).
</P>
<P>
   There are other dictionaries online, most notably
Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th edition) at
www.m-w.com, and The American Heritage Dictionary of the English
Language (third edition) at www.dictionary.com, which are free to
users. But neither has the authority or the cachet of the OED.
</P>
<P>
   The online version of the OED comes in the middle of the
dictionary's current revision, only the second in its 116-year
history, which is expected to more than double the number of
entries from 640,000 to 1.3 million. Lexicographers and editors
began the project in 1990 and expect to finish in 2010 ``with every
word and every meaning fully reviewed and updated, and new words
and meanings added,'' according to the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers to the online edition will be able to search for any
word in the dictionary's database and receive the full Oxford
entry, including pronunciation, etymology, variant spellings and
illustrative quotations. The online edition will be updated
quarterly. But the price of knowledge isn't cheap. Subscriptions to
the OED online edition run $550 for individuals and $795 for
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Money Is Pledged to Close `Digital Divide' on Campuses
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, IBM and AT&AMP;T last week pledged more than $101 million
worth of materials, software, services, training and financial
support for a newly announced program of the United Negro College
Fund. The program is designed to improve computer access for
students and faculty at the fund's 39 member institutions, which
are all historically black colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the $130 million program, said William H. Gray III,
the fund's president, is to help increase computer access among
black college students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a 45 percent gap between American households and
African-American households that own computers,'' he said, ``and a
72 percent gap between UNCF students and students nationally who
own computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 percent of the 420,000 students attending United Negro
College Fund schools have computers, his office said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft pledged $50 million in software, reference and
training materials to the program, called the Technology
Enhancement Capital Campaign. IBM promised to provide equipment and
services worth more than $50 million, which includes a two-thirds
discount on IBM personal computers for students, faculty and
administrators at UNCF schools. AT&AMP;T donated $1 million to help
train faculty to use information technology in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he was confident that the remaining $29 million the
program calls for could be raised.

   BEIJING _ In a last-ditch effort to influence Taiwan's
presidential election, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji said Wednesday
that the Chinese people were ``willing to use all their blood'' to
prevent the island's independence.
</P>
<P>
   But, at the same time, he played down a recent Chinese policy
paper that threatened military action against the island if it
delayed indefinitely talks on reunification, saying, ``There's
nothing new in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan, which holds its election on Saturday, dominated Zhu's
90-minute news conference marking the end of this year's session of
parliament. In language that was on balance more incendiary than
calming, Zhu reiterated Beijing's position on the island it
considers a breakaway province.
</P>
<P>
   It was the last major opportunity in a month-long campaign by
the Chinese government to use fighting words to pressure Taiwanese
candidates and voters. And Zhu made clear that the government has
strong preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter who comes into power in Taiwan, Taiwan will never be
allowed to be independent,'' he said. If the ``people who favor
independence'' win, he later added, ``it may trigger a war between
the two sides and undermine peace.''
</P>
<P>
   There were several such references to Chen Shui-bien, the
presidential candidate whose opposition Democratic Progressive
Party has advocated formal independence in the past, although Chen
has moderated that position in this election. In recent days,
Chinese officials and Communist Party newspapers have lobbed
numerous thinly veiled attacks at Chen, saying he is ``tricking''
the Taiwanese and still at heart ``a separatist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His mainland policy is merely a tactic to win the election, to
pick up votes and deceive voters,'' said Xu Bodong, a Chinese
foreign policy expert, on state television Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chen is in a tight three-way race for the presidency. None of
the candidates currently advocates a declaration of independence,
and Beijing's threatening words are aimed to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu spoke with passion, but it was an odd role for the
government's leading economic reformer, who has never been its
point person on Taiwan. About half way through the news conference,
the usually straight-talking prime minister seemed exasperated and
refused to answer further questions on Taiwan, although reporters
kept bringing up the subject.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Zhu repeated that China did not fear war, if it
came to that. And he lambasted foreign analysts who have recently
argued that the Chinese military lacks the capability to take
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not know the history of China and that the Chinese
people will use all of their blood to defend the unity of the
Chinese nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On several occasions, Zhu declined to re-assure Taiwan that
there would be no violence before or after the election. For
example, when a Taiwanese journalist asked if China plans to
conduct military exercises this week near Taiwan, as it did four
years ago in a bid to influence Taiwan's last presidential
election, he said: ``Let's just wait and see. But don't worry too
much, because there are only two days left.''
</P>
<P>
   But at other points, Zhu reiterated the government's position
that its goal is peaceful reunification with Taiwan, and said that
the alarmed reaction abroad to the policy paper released last month
was unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu said that document, which has angered some U.S. politicians
to the point that they have pledged to fight China's bid to enter
the World Trade Organization, did not represent a shift to a more
bellicose policy.
</P>
<P>
   He said that position was first stated by Deng Xiaoping in the
1980s and accused anti-China forces ``in a certain nation'' of
using an innocuous position paper that was meant to be a
``comprehensive and detailed exposition of China's long standing
policy'' to their political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he expressed hope that the current tensions would not
scuttle China's entry to the WTO or damage relations with the
United States. He said he did not want to connect the Taiwan
question ``with other issues related to China-U.S. relations.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the brief interludes when Zhu managed to move away from talk
of Taiwan, he solicited foreign investment for Chinese development
projects, praised China's current anti-corruption drive, and said
the government would soon clarify its new policies on the Internet
and telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
   But he was at his most emotional on the issue of Taiwan, giving
even declarations of brotherhood vaguely threatening undertones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trust that our Taiwanese compatriots will make a sensible
choice'' in Saturday's election, he said. But he added that, if
they did not, they might not ``get another opportunity.''

FRAGRANT FRANGIPANI  
 BETTER RED THAN NOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DORA GALITZKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRAGRANT FRANGIPANI
</P>
<P>
   Q. Twice I've brought back plumeria cuttings from Hawaii for a
friend who spent her teen years there and would love to recapture
plumeria's lovely scent. A nursery potted up the first, which died,
and I am trying to start the second. I let them dry first, but one
cutting rotted, and the other barely survives. After nine months it
had grown only two tiny leaves and no roots. Last month I put it
under fluorescent lights, and now it has two new leaves. Any
suggestions about how I can grow this stubborn stub into something
that approximates the lush shrubs we see and smell in tropical
climes?
</P>
<P>
   A. It sounds as if the artificial longer days have awakened
them. Richard Criley, a professor of horticulture at the University
of Hawaii in Manoa, said that Plumeria rubra, or frangipani, the
classic flower of the Hawaiian lei, needs at least 14 to 15 hours
of light each day and temperatures above 50 degrees or it will go
dormant. He said that tip cuttings, commonly available in tourist
shops in Hawaii, should have the cut end dipped in rooting hormone
before being planted in a well-aerated medium, like peat and
perlite, kept moist but not wet, in a warm, brightly lit spot. It's
not too late to apply the hormone to yours, but don't make a new
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Under the best conditions it takes four to six weeks for roots
to grow, maybe longer. But the wait has just begun. Assuming the
cutting is large enough, at least three-quarters of an inch in
diameter, and gets all those hours of light, it will set flower
buds this summer and bloom next spring.
</P>
<P>
   As a houseplant, plumeria tends to be tall and gawky, with few
branches and the leaves mainly at the top, so its attraction is
strictly in the flowers. The waxy, simple pinwheel flowers range
from white to dark red, rose-pink, yellow and orange and
multicolored, while the fragrance is unique but reminiscent of
jasmine. One sniff and it's clear why people love them, even though
when shorter days lead to dormancy and all the leaves fall off,
they look exactly like an old walking stick jammed in a pot.
</P>
<P>
   Sources for plumeria include Stokes Tropicals, P.O. Box 9868,
New Iberia, LA 70562, (800) 624-9706, catalog $5; and the Exotic
Plumeria, 500 Grove Ave., Seffner, FL 33584, (813) 653-2496,
catalog $10.
</P>
<P>
   BETTER RED THAN NOT
</P>
<P>
   Q. This past spring I planted two red twig dogwoods. One had
some new growth, so we have had a few brilliant crimson branches to
enjoy during the winter months. Next winter I would like more of
the red color and have heard that you should trim the shrub down
quite a bit. But when? I don't want to lose the flowers in the
spring or the berries in the summer and fall.  &QL; 
A. The subtle whites, browns and grays of the winter landscape have
a quiet beauty, but some days you just need something that shouts.
Whether they are in your garden or just off the side of a road, the
bright red stems of Cornus alba or C. sericea and their cultivars,
or the yellow-green stems of C. sericea Flaviramea, can jolt you
right out of your winter blues.
</P>
<P>
   But, as with people, the young are the most colorful. As the
stems get older, they turn duller and darker, so late-winter
pruning is necessary to keep the display bright red. Go on out
today. By cutting the 3-year-old stems every year right down to 6
inches above the ground you always have two-thirds of the shrub _
the one- and two-year-old stems _ to provide showy winter color.
</P>
<P>
   Late-winter pruning does have one risk: you are likely to step
on the tender hints of your spring bulbs, so tread lightly. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The GI Bill _ or contemporary versions of it _ is becoming
popular again. In 1944, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the
bill, which gave World War II veterans a basket of benefits
including money for education, housing loans, and employment
assistance. Seen today as a huge success that helped educate a
generation, the bill in its time was thought by some to be too
generous. But the American Legion _ chartered by Congress in 1919
as a wartime veterans' organization _ lobbied hard and is credited
with getting the bill passed.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard sociologist Theda Skocpol sees the bill as a template
for other programs, calling it one of ``America's finest social
policy achievements,'' in her book, ``The Missing Middle: Working
Families and American Social Policy.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the GI Bill's best features is that it attracts broad
support. Instead of being seen as a handout to idlers, it has been
nobly elevated to payment of a national debt of gratitude to
service members who defended the country and its values.
</P>
<P>
   The pressing question: How can the spirit of the GI Bill
flourish when the country is not at war?
</P>
<P>
   One promising example is the new Teacher Next Door program,
announced this week by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development. HUD will help public and private school teachers buy
single-family homes at a 50 percent discount and a downpayment of
as little as $100 if they live in ``revitalization areas,''
typically low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The program insightfully identifies teachers as a group whose
service can be honored by helping them buy homes. The program also
extends teachers' service by making them part of communities that
need stable, active homeowners. Because teachers are seen as
hard-working but undervalued, the program should stir little public
resentment. It ought to set an innovative example.
</P>
<P>
   Creative political thinking needs a national forum. Al Gore and
George W. Bush can lead by using the presidential race to spotlight
more GI Bill-style thinking. The country is hungry for public
policies that are effective and popular.

CIVILITY IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration appears to have learned a belated
lesson about ethnic conflicts in the Balkans. State Department
spokesman James Rubin and National Security Council official Chris
Hill have been visiting a liberated but unpacified Kosovo this
week, asking Albanian Kosovars to cease vengeful violence against
Serbs and warning the Kosovo Liberation Army not to provoke a new
pogrom across the border in southern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   In the territories of the former Yugoslavia, an ounce of
prevention is worth a pound of cure. Albanians in Kosovo have been
killing and attacking Serbs since last spring, when NATO ended its
bombing campaign against the regime of Slobodan Milosevic.
Recently, the divided town of Kosovska Mitrovica has been wracked
by intercommunal violence, suggesting that Albanian and Serb
Kosovars are no more willing to live together now than they were
before the NATO intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we hear another story about ethnic minorities who
are abused by Kosovar Albanians, our determination to help Kosovo
weakens,'' said Rubin. ``We're in this for the long term, but if
the Kosovar Albanians want that commitment to be upheld, they have
to act responsibly.'' This was the message Rubin was tasked to
deliver in Kosovo by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's aim is to get the attention of leaders in
the Kosovo Liberation Army, in the hope that they will be so
fearful of losing Washington's backing that they will clamp down on
acts of vengeance or intimidation against Serbs and gypsies within
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   This is a proper message to send, and the administration's
attempt to take preemptive measures against another eruption of
ethnic cleansing in Kosovo or southern Serbia is commendable. It
would also help if a properly trained and funded international
police force were provided to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the spectacle of American envoys trying to cajole
the hotheads and thugs of the KLA into imposing order in Kosovo may
be a sign that the United States and its NATO allies have gotten
themselves entrammeled in a Balkan tarbaby.

   X-Ray vision would be so handy around the house.
</P>
<P>
   Need some rewiring? Nothing to it _ just stare through the wall,
as Superman would do, and then snake conduit through the wooden
framing with nary a snag.
</P>
<P>
   Superman's magic eyes would help doctors, too. They could borrow
them to see through breast tissue to a lump lying deep below _ not
by looking at an X-ray, but as they are doing examinations.
</P>
<P>
   Soon feats like those will not be solely for superheroes.
Proponents say a computer technology called augmented reality
promises to make transparent the solid walls of flesh or plaster
within a decade, or even sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Augmented reality is the general term for electronic technology
that lets people see not only the surface of the world but also,
superimposed on it, things like bones or wiring hidden deep below
the surface. Augmented reality is already available in the Cadillac
DeVille DTS or DHS, which uses infrared technology to generate
images of obstacles on a dark road, like deer frozen in the
headlights, and projects those images onto the windshield.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is not the familiar virtual reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``With virtual reality, you put on the goggles and plunge into a
completely synthetic world,'' explained Henry Fuchs, a computer
science professor at the University of North Carolina and a pioneer
in the high-performance graphics hardware used in augmented reality
systems. ``With augmented reality, you see the real world, plus an
overlay of synthetic information that enriches the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, systems like the varied ones being developed by
Fuchs, his colleagues and other researchers will, for instance, let
surgeons perform precise biopsies of the breast by looking through
head-mounted displays that let them see both the breast and virtual
images of its interior. That would enable a doctor to relate
information from touch or sight with a view beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physician needs to see her hands and instruments,'' Fuchs
said. ``The augmented reality _ the visualization _ is just for the
few square inches inside the breast the physician also needs to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuchs and his colleagues have developed what they call a video
see-through system. In one version, video cameras are mounted just
in front of the eyes. The computer running the show adds the
virtual imagery of the breast, based on ultrasound data, to the
camera image, aligning the synthetic graphics and the real. The
final, layered image is presented through stereoscopic liquid
crystal displays.
</P>
<P>
   Fuchs said he had first been drawn to work in augmented reality
in 1970, when he was in graduate school and saw the groundbreaking
see-through displays developed by Ivan Sutherland, widely regarded
as the father of modern computer graphics. This head-mounted
display overlaid stick-figure graphical objects onto a normal view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taken with wanting to add to the real world what a
computer could create, and I've been doing it ever since,'' Fuchs
said. ``I'm interested in medical applications principally because
it's honorable and compelling. Playing even a small part in helping
to save lives is wonderfully fulfilling.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuchs and others see many practical applications for augmented
reality in the future. ``There will be so many jobs in which people
need to see what they can't with their naked eye,'' he said. ``I
thought about this every time I pulled out my manual to work on my
BMW. It's a wonderful manual, but what I really need to do is look
at the car and see inside.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the emerging applications of augmented reality is in the
repair not of engines but of people _ patients undergoing
reconstructive surgery.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Biocomputation Center of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration at Stanford University, Kevin
Montgomery, the technical director, is working toward that goal
right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does you no good to live until 150 if you look like 150,''
said Montgomery, who believes that while humans are not going to
live to 150 just yet, the discovery of many cellular mechanisms
raises the real possibility of eventually extending human life by
decades. ``We're going to need to replace a lot of body parts as
they break or wear out,'' Montgomery said. ``And they'll have to
fit well.''

   &UR;  &LR; Montgomery, whose background is in computer engineering, said
his interest in augmented reality began at the NASA Ames Research
Center, where he worked on space-related research. Body parts came
later, when he came to Stanford and was drawn to medical and
surgical applications.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery and his colleagues have developed a series of
three-dimensional visualization techniques for surgical planning,
which they hope to extend into the operating room through augmented
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, for instance, the team used 3-D visualization
techniques to design a new jaw for a patient whose own had been
devastated by cancer. First the team took the patient's CAT-scan
data and built a computer model, making detailed measurements of
the patient's jaw, including the angles between the various parts.
</P>
<P>
   Then team members created a virtual replacement jaw, traced its
template onto film that could be sterilized and took the pattern
into the operating room for the surgery, placing the pattern
directly on the bone they were cutting up to make the new jaw.
``It's like making a dress,'' Montgomery said. ``Slide Tab A into
Slot B.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his team want to take these surgical planning and
replacement strategies a step further. They want to put the 3-D
visualizations, like the CAT-scan data, into the direct view of the
surgeons while they are performing surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working on an augmented reality system designed to give
surgeons virtual windows hanging in front of them that show
CAT-scan and other data,'' he said. ``In essence this will give
surgeons X-ray vision because they can see the computer model of
this woman's skull, generated by the computer from her CAT-scan
data, superimposed on her body.''
</P>
<P>
   Many problems lie ahead before augmented reality like the kinds
being tested at the University of North Carolina and at NASA's
center at Stanford are realized.
</P>
<P>
   But Fuchs is confident that augmented reality systems will soon
become part of our everyday lives. ``We'll have our computer with
us all the time and have it display helpful information
superimposed on what we are looking at,'' he said. ``The same way
we carry a wallet or watch, we'll have a display and be able to add
to it information that is of interest to us, whether to identify a
mountain we are looking at or whether to turn right at the next
intersection.''

   deck: In 'Erin Brockovich,' Julia Roberts &QL;
</P>
<P>
   plays it straight even in a short skirt &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Glenn Whipp, Film Writer
</P>
<P>
   After following the recent controversies revolving around the
historical accuracy of movies like ``The Hurricane'' and ``The
Insider,'' director Steven Soderbergh says he's glad he followed
his gut while shooting his latest film, ``Erin Brockovich.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise you, there's nothing of any significance in the
movie that's invented,'' Soderbergh says. ``That was important to
me. I wanted to be able to defend the film and not have to
backpedal every time somebody said, 'I heard this didn't happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Soderbergh, the true story behind ``Erin
Brockovich'' contained enough drama to make creative invention
rather unnecessary. The film tells the story of how Brockovich, a
legal investigator with no technical training, discovered how
Pacific Gas and Electric had contaminated the groundwater in the
tiny California desert town of Hinkley. With local residents
contracting cancer and experiencing an array of serious health
concerns, Brockovich convinces her boss, rumpled attorney Ed Masry,
to pursue the case. The result: a record-setting $333 million
settlement for the community.
</P>
<P>
   While the movie's screenplay, written by Susannah Grant (with an
uncredited rewrite by Richard LaGravanese) invents some characters
and amalgamates others, it sticks remarkably close to the actual
events. More significantly, it manages to capture the spirit of
Brockovich herself, a twice-divorced mother of three, who's
unapologetic about her blunt speech and revealing wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Since Brockovich is played by Julia Roberts, the world's biggest
female movie star (who came to the film with a record-setting $20
million payday), it would be natural to wonder if the actress's
larger-than-life persona might overshadow the character.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year-old Masry admits that when he heard Roberts had been
cast, he thought ``the movie was going to be a disaster.'' His
misgivings: Roberts was too sweet to say the sort of things that
regularly came out of Brockovich's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   He says he changed his mind once he saw the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference between Julia and Erin is that Erin wore
her skirts shorter,'' Masry says.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts laughs at the sartorial comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have something that I have in my closet that I call a dress,
and then she has something in her closet that I call a 'dr---.' The
whole `--ess' part that covers your ass isn't there,'' Roberts
says.
</P>
<P>
   As for the movie's fascination with underwire, Roberts says,
``It's more cleavage than God ever thought to give me.''
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, Roberts says signing up to play Brockovich was a
no-brainer given what she helped accomplish for the people in
Hinkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take a situation like this, and a court environment:
Files, water, people getting sick,'' Roberts says. ``She could have
been a very quiet person, like, 'This doesn't seem right ... well,
I don't know.' That's OK to play, but it's more fun to go 'What the
f--- is this all about? This doesn't make any sense.' That's just
more interesting. So yeah, the energy with which she approaches her
life is really appealing as an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh, speaking a bit like a schoolboy with an enormous
crush, says Roberts has that same energy level.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both very charismatic and funny, and they have this
amazing life force,'' Soderbergh says. ``And beyond that, I felt
that Julia would help the audience relate to Erin's dilemma. She's
a person who cannot seem to reconcile how she sees herself with how
others see her.''
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh sees ``Erin Brockovich'' as a coming-of-age story,
not a courtroom thriller. This is in line with producer Carla
Santos Shamberg's description of the movie as ``'Rocky' in a
miniskirt.'' The movie has only one brief courtroom scene,
concentrating instead on the methods Brockovich and Masry used to
accumulate evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh also keeps a pretty low directorial profile,
eschewing the temporal displacements that made his last two films,
``Out of Sight'' and ``The Limey,'' big hits with critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the kind of movie that required and demanded any
flourishes or stylistic devices,'' Soderbergh says. ``And that was
also part of its appeal to me, because I wanted to work on
something where the direction would not be so apparent. It's a
different set of disciplines. You work just as hard, and your grip
on the movie is just as firm it's just that you're hidden more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that it's different than `The Limey,''' Soderbergh
continues, ``where I was standing between the audience and the
screen, sort of waving my arms. This is the opposite of that. I
just didn't want anything between Julia and the audience. And it
seemed to me, again, that since this was based on a true story, it
would be all for the better to have the audience feel like things
were happening in front of them instead of being constructed.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts met her counterpart just once, on the day Brockovich
showed up to film a cameo. Brockovich plays a waitress in a coffee
shop; Masry can be seen in a booth next to Roberts. The name of
Brockovich's uniform reads ``Julia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole thing has been a little surreal for Erin,
seeing your name on giant billboards and being played by Julia
Roberts,'' Soderbergh says. ``But she is a pretty savvy person and
has a great sense of perspective about the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Brockovich has remarried and remains committed to her
family and her legal career. Masry, who was close to retiring
before taking on PG&AMP;E, now has eight cases pending, including
another lawsuit against PG&AMP;E over pollution near their Kettleman,
Calif., facility. More than 900 former residents and workers at
PG&AMP;E plants are suing for personal injuries they say were caused by
contaminated water. The trial is set for November.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, for one, can't wait for the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``She should be an inspiration for everybody,'' Roberts says,
quick to add that she would discourage any and all comparisons
between her philanthropy and, say, Paul Newman's. But that doesn't
mean she doesn't have her own aspirations in that area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, if you only extract one concept out of this
movie, it should be that one person can make a difference in a
situation that seems too enormous to even examine,'' Roberts says.
``It really is the idea that a waterfall starts with one drop of
water. So if that's all you get from this movie than we've served a
purpose.'' &QL;

LAST WORD AT A LITTLE LABEL CALLED LAST BEAT: HONESTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It started with a simple enough idea: A friend is
making a record. We've got some extra cash. Let's help him out.
</P>
<P>
   That act of kindness has, seven years later, evolved into one of
the most popular and well-respected independent record labels in
North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Last Beat Records, dreamed up and run by president/owner Caron
Barrett and label manager Tami Thomsen, formed when the women, then
in their mid-20s, forked over a few bucks to help their buddy,
longtime Dallas musician Jeff Liles, put out a disc by his band
Decadent Dub Team.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the label, headquartered in a swank office on Commerce
Street in Deep Ellum, has a solid roster of a half-dozen acts (some
of which are playing the label's showcase this week at the South by
Southwest music festival in Austin), the range of distribution that
only a handful of indie labels attains and, perhaps most important,
a reputation for treating bands well _ both as people and as
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we just always try to be real honest, fair and nice.
That doesn't always play to our advantage, but we're not gonna
change,'' says Barrett, who's also a member of a band called
Astrogin. ``We had a guy who worked here for a while and he said,
`Why don't we just lie to the bands?' We would never dream of that.
That guy didn't last long.''
</P>
<P>
   It's this frame of mind that has attracted some of the area's
heaviest-hitting bands. Alumni include Arlington, Texas, pop-rock
outfit Slowpoke, which released an EP on Last Beat before it signed
to major label Geffen, Dallas pop-rock band Tomorrow People (also a
onetime Geffen signee), longtime Dallas prog-rock unit Vibrolux,
noise-rock icons rubberbullet and popular pop-punk trio Darlington.
</P>
<P>
   That's just scratching the surface. As the label's reputation
has solidified over the past year, its release schedule has become
astonishing. Captain Audio, Pinkston and Pleasant Grove, all
on-their-way-up bands from this area, have recently put out Last
Beat efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But the label's largest score: Baboon, a Denton, Texas-based
punk-rock band that's easily one of Texas' biggest draws, is set to
release a live disc on the label later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Several things explain why Last Beat Records is so hot: It's a
small operation (six people work in the office), the distribution
is strong (you can pick up Last Beat efforts in record shops from
Fort Worth to New York), a recording studio is built into the
office (Last Beat bands get a discount on usage) and every band,
Thomsen says, gets treated with hands-on, specialized care.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the record-deal strategies of groundbreaking indie
labels such as Touch &AMP; Go out of Chicago and Amphetamine Reptile in
Minneapolis, band contracts differ from group to group. Unlike
major labels, Last Beat doesn't require each act to sign a
multi-record deal _ a sigh of relief for bands that want to take
their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our contracts are really individualized to the band,'' says
Thomsen. ``Vibrolux has had big deals in the past, but they don't
even have a record out. We signed them for a one-off deal. Had we
insisted on signing them for anything more, it would not have
happened. They just need to get one out. Whereas Pinkston is a
younger band that is looking at things a little differently, so we
did a multiple record deal with them. Every band's a little
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Last Beat's roster keeps growing: The recording
studio is a state-of-the-art room where local superheroes such as
the Toadies, Reverend Horton Heat and Edie Brickell &AMP; the New
Bohemians have banged out material. Recently it was renovated and
redesigned by Nick Griffiths, a producer/sound wizard who has
worked with artists including Pink Floyd, Joy Division, Squeeze and
Killing Joke.
</P>
<P>
   Thomsen says the label found Griffiths while looking for a
producer for Astrogin's record. ``We sent out a bunch of tapes to
people and Nick was one of the ones that replied back,'' she said.
``As they began talking about the record, Nick had some suggestions
for the studio. One thing led to another.''
</P>
<P>
   The Last Beat phenomenon grew, partially at least, out of a
failure. In 1991, Barrett and Thomsen opened Last Beat Records as
an underground/punk-rock record shop on Elm Street in Deep Ellum.
Thanks to Deep Ellum's constant foot traffic, the store thrived for
a few years before chain record stores such as Best Buy and
Blockbuster Music started carrying _ and selling for less _ punk
records, helping kill Last Beat's business. In 1997, the store
closed.
</P>
<P>
   By that point, though, the label had established itself as
competition for other local labels by releasing a string of
well-received efforts, and they'd already set up shop on Henry
Street in Deep Ellum. The bigger and better space soon came along
on Commerce Street, where the Last Beat camp has been ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the label has had its share of struggles _
with money, with ornery bands, with employees who didn't subscribe
to the Last Beat mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music industry is like a big whirlwind and you have to
stand there and jump at just the right time, and who the hell knows
when that is,'' says Barrett. ``Then when something does happen,
operating in the political realms of the industry is yet another
hurdle.''
</P>
<P>
   Not making it any easier for Last Beat is that Thomsen and
Barrett are competing in a male-dominated field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't always been easy, but we realize it's a Republican
world. At least it seems that's the way things operate,'' says
Barrett. ``But some people find it intriguing, too, a little bit
out of the norm. Thing is, we're not dormant. We're very
aggressive. We're not just a coupla bimbos sitting around with CDs
stuffed in our high heels.''

`KADOSH' LOSES ITS RELIGION AMID GRATUITOUS SEX

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Israeli film ``Kadosh'' lands somewhere between an astute
examination of how religious fundamentalism is used by insecure men
to dominate women and an overwrought excuse to watch Hasidic girls
get naughty.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly more intelligent and persuasive than the melodramatic
``A Price Above Rubies'' from a few years back, ``Kadosh''
nevertheless falls into the same trap the earlier film did: It
reduces a critique of the ultra-observant lifestyle to narrow
sexual parameters. Which is a shame, since hints of the wider
political conflict between Israel's secular and religious Jews are
tantalizingly dropped during the earlier stages of the drama.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Jerusalem's Orthodox Mea Shearim neighborhood, the
claustrophobic piece initially finds some humor in the Hasidim's
frustrated efforts to convince their disinterested countrymen _ and
even, in brief moments, themselves _ that theirs is the only true
religion. But neither these brief encounters, nor the siege
mentality the believers sporadically express toward the outside
world, do much in the way of addressing the real struggles of faith
and power that are increasingly defining the traditionalists'
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what we mainly get is a sometimes touching, sometimes
shrill study of two tragic marriages. Meir (Yoram Hattab) and Rivka
(Yael Abecassis) have been happily together for 10 years and even
have a pretty hot love life, considering the cultural strictures
(Meir's morning prayers thanking God for not making him a woman
being an emblematic indicator). Trouble is, no babies yet, which
the sect considers the only real measure of marital success.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rivka's younger sister Malka (Meital Barda) is slated
to marry Meir's most devoutly loony fellow Talmud scholar, Yossef
(Uri Ran Klausner). Predictably, she's really in love with the
hunky Yaakov (Sami Hori), who's been rejected by the congregation
for joining the Israeli army and now makes his way as a nightclub
singer.
</P>
<P>
   Meir's rabbi father pressures him into leaving guilt-ridden
Rivka for a younger, presumably more fertile wife. Spunky Malka,
meanwhile, gets to experience what is surely the worst sex ever
filmed.
</P>
<P>
   Can any of this possibly be what God intended?
</P>
<P>
   Director Amos Gitai clearly does not think so, and his general
distaste for the perceivably sexist subculture permeates
``Kadosh.'' He takes every opportunity to present the Hasidim as
backward, paranoid and coercive.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Gitai's own family was involved in founding
Israel's Labor party. The prejudices the director brings to the
material might be more forgivable if he hadn't presented them with
such glacial solemnity. Most shots are twice as long as they need
to be, and if this is meant to evoke the kind of suspended-in-time
lives the characters lead, it does so to a fault. What is of
interest in ``Kadosh'' just takes too much time to get at, and film
audiences cannot be expected to have the patience of lifelong
biblical scholars. &QL;

JULIA ... ERIN. ERIN ... JULIA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After following the recent controversies revolving around the
historical accuracy of movies like ``The Hurricane'' and ``The
Insider,'' director Steven Soderbergh says he's glad he followed
his gut while shooting his latest film, ``Erin Brockovich.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise you, there's nothing of any significance in the
movie that's invented,'' Soderbergh says. ``That was important to
me. I wanted to be able to defend the film and not have to
backpedal every time somebody said, `I heard this didn't happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Soderbergh, the true story behind ``Erin
Brockovich'' contained enough drama to make creative invention
rather unnecessary. The film tells the story of how Brockovich, a
legal investigator with no technical training, discovered how
Pacific Gas and Electric had contaminated the groundwater in the
tiny California desert town of Hinkley. With local residents
contracting cancer and experiencing an array of serious health
concerns, Brockovich convinces her boss, rumpled attorney Ed Masry,
to pursue the case. The result: a record-setting $333 million
settlement for the community.
</P>
<P>
   While the movie's screenplay, written by Susannah Grant (with an
uncredited rewrite by Richard LaGravanese) invents some characters
and amalgamates others, it sticks remarkably close to the actual
events. More significantly, it manages to capture the spirit of
Brockovich herself, a twice-divorced mother of three, who's
unapologetic about her blunt speech and revealing wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Since Brockovich is played by Julia Roberts, the world's biggest
female movie star (who came to the film with a record-setting $20
million payday), it would be natural to wonder if the actress's
larger-than-life persona might overshadow the character.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year-old Masry admits that when he heard Roberts had been
cast, he thought ``the movie was going to be a disaster.'' His
misgivings: Roberts was too sweet to say the sort of things that
regularly came out of Brockovich's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   He says he changed his mind once he saw the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference between Julia and Erin is that Erin wore
her skirts shorter,'' Masry says.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts laughs at the sartorial comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have something that I have in my closet that I call a dress,
and then she has something in her closet that I call a `dr---.' The
whole `--ess' part that covers your ass isn't there,'' Roberts
says.
</P>
<P>
   As for the movie's fascination with underwire, Roberts says,
``It's more cleavage than God ever thought to give me.''
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, Roberts says signing up to play Brockovich was a
no-brainer given what she helped accomplish for the people in
Hinkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take a situation like this, and a court environment:
Files, water, people getting sick,'' Roberts says. ``She could have
been a very quiet person, like, `This doesn't seem right ... well,
I don't know.' That's OK to play, but it's more fun to go `What the
f--- is this all about? This doesn't make any sense.' That's just
more interesting. So yeah, the energy with which she approaches her
life is really appealing as an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh, speaking a bit like a schoolboy with an enormous
crush, says Roberts has that same energy level.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both very charismatic and funny, and they have this
amazing life force,'' Soderbergh says. ``And beyond that, I felt
that Julia would help the audience relate to Erin's dilemma. She's
a person who cannot seem to reconcile how she sees herself with how
others see her.''
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh sees ``Erin Brockovich'' as a coming-of-age story,
not a courtroom thriller. This is in line with producer Carla
Santos Shamberg's description of the movie as ``'Rocky' in a
miniskirt.'' The movie has only one brief courtroom scene,
concentrating instead on the methods Brockovich and Masry used to
accumulate evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh also keeps a pretty low directorial profile,
eschewing the temporal displacements that made his last two films,
``Out of Sight'' and ``The Limey,'' big hits with critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the kind of movie that required and demanded any
flourishes or stylistic devices,'' Soderbergh says. ``And that was
also part of its appeal to me, because I wanted to work on
something where the direction would not be so apparent. It's a
different set of disciplines. You work just as hard, and your grip
on the movie is just as firm _ it's just that you're hidden more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that it's different than `The Limey,''' Soderbergh
continues, ``where I was standing between the audience and the
screen, sort of waving my arms. This is the opposite of that. I
just didn't want anything between Julia and the audience. And it
seemed to me, again, that since this was based on a true story, it
would be all for the better to have the audience feel like things
were happening in front of them instead of being constructed.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts met her counterpart just once, on the day Brockovich
showed up to film a cameo. Brockovich plays a waitress in a coffee
shop; Masry can be seen in a booth next to Roberts. The name of
Brockovich's uniform reads ``Julia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole thing has been a little surreal for Erin,
seeing your name on giant billboards and being played by Julia
Roberts,'' Soderbergh says. ``But she is a pretty savvy person and
has a great sense of perspective about the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Brockovich has remarried and remains committed to her
family and her legal career. Masry, who was close to retiring
before taking on PG&AMP;E, now has eight cases pending, including
another lawsuit against PG&AMP;E over pollution near their Kettleman,
Calif., facility. More than 900 former residents and workers at
PG&AMP;E plants are suing for personal injuries they say were caused by
contaminated water. The trial is set for November.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, for one, can't wait for the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``She should be an inspiration for everybody,'' Roberts says,
quick to add that she would discourage any and all comparisons
between her philanthropy and, say, Paul Newman's. But that doesn't
mean she doesn't have her own aspirations in that area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, if you only extract one concept out of this
movie, it should be that one person can make a difference in a
situation that seems too enormous to even examine,'' Roberts says.
``It really is the idea that a waterfall starts with one drop of
water. So if that's all you get from this movie than we've served a
purpose.'' &QL;

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blanche can hear. Stanley cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Kind of makes things more interesting, don't you think?
</P>
<P>
   Ed Waterstreet did, which is why he set about reconceiving ``A
Streetcar Named Desire'' for his Deaf West Theatre Company in North
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In Deaf West's new production, which is running through April 9,
the protagonists' failure to communicate takes on an even deeper
metaphoric layering than is usual for Tennessee Williams' hothouse
masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   As played by actors Suanne Spoke and Troy Kotsur, Blanche
DuBois, the faded Southern belle, and Stanley Kowalski, her earthy
brother-in-law, are estranged not only by cultural and
temperamental differences. Quite literally, they talk in different
tongues. Blanche speaks in English while falteringly translating
her words into an old-fashioned form of sign language. Stanley uses
American Sign Language, a far more visceral lexicon of hand thrusts
and finger jabs, to convey the emotions roiling within him.
</P>
<P>
   Waterstreet, Deaf West's founder and artistic director, hopes
this unusual approach will give hearing and non-hearing audiences
alike a new perspective on ``Streetcar'' and the tragic
misunderstandings that can result when cultures collide.
</P>
<P>
   That's a theme Waterstreet, 56, deaf since acquiring childhood
pneumonia, understands well.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family's all hearing,'' he explains through an interpreter,
``and they would take me to the theater. And not knowing what was
going on, I would always be poking my family, `What's going on?' I
would feel so empty and isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   Using theater as its medium, the non-profit Deaf West has spent
its nine-year existence uniting the often isolated realms of
hearing and non-hearing people. Its mainstage productions of shows
ranging from ``Equus'' to ``Shirley Valentine'' have won bushels of
awards, and the company gradually has added a children's theater
program and professional training workshops for deaf and
hearing-impaired artists.
</P>
<P>
   By casting deaf and hearing actors in its shows, Deaf West also
has frequently been able to tap into emotional and poetic nuances
that might elude traditional productions of the same texts. In most
Deaf West productions, deaf actors perform in American Sign
Language alongside hearing actors who speak the words aloud,
creating a multilevel interpretive strata not unlike the effect of
a Greek chorus.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty sometimes comes in making sure the dueling
dialogues and performances don't crowd each other out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearing actors need to learn when they come on board that the
acting choices are the deaf actors','' Waterstreet says. ``They
can't make different choices. They have to mold into one. It's a
very big challenge for the hearing actors.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Deaf West productions also use projected subtitles, an
acknowledgement that roughly three-quarters of the 7,000 people who
attend its shows are not hearing-impaired.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, Deaf West became the latest theater to relocate to
North Hollywood's NoHo Arts District after several years of
temporary residence at the Fountain and Heliotrope theaters. The
company occupies a two-story storefront on the same block as the
Lankershim Arts Center, a location it hopes will be more
recognizable and accessible to the community it serves
(approximately 750,000 deaf and hard-of-hearing people reside in
Los Angeles County).
</P>
<P>
   Deaf West eventually hopes to add a coffee shop that would serve
as an informal social center, and also to acquire the
2,500-square-foot building next door. That would allow the company
to double its space, expand from 60 to 99 seats, and offer more
workshops and acting classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally have a real home,'' Waterstreet enthuses. ``I don't
mean to brag, but I can't help myself.''
</P>
<P>
   A recently awarded five-year, $4 million grant from the U.S.
Department of Education will allow the company to continue
producing three mainstage shows a year and to develop a national
tour each year for one of its shows.
</P>
<P>
   Since its opening production of ``The Gin Game'' in May 1991,
starring Phyllis Frelich _ a 1980 Tony winner for ``Children of a
Lesser God'' _ Deaf West has consistently sought out plays that can
be explored and even enhanced through the use of deaf performers,
without requiring any changes in the script.
</P>
<P>
   Waterstreet says he got the idea of doing ``Streetcar'' four or
five years after watching a captioned version of the 1951 film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennessee Williams' language is very poetic, and it sort of
matches the style of visual sign language,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In Deaf West's production, Stanley's wife, Stella, also is
represented as deaf and is portrayed by the hearing-impaired
actress who goes by the single name Terrylene.
</P>
<P>
   Making Stanley and Stella deaf emphasizes the bond between them,
and sharpens the threat that Blanche represents to their shared,
insular reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``She (Blanche) is putting cracks into their relationship,''
Terrylene explains. ``We have to find a way to solve all the
problems. Because I'm trying to save our marriage. That's my goal,
is to get into a regular life.''
</P>
<P>
   When Terrylene and Kotsur engage each other on stage, their
colleague Spoke finds the sight to be, well, beyond words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch the two of them, they look like dancers to me,'' Spoke
says. ``It's beautiful. The individual becomes like a living
portrait. It amazes me.'' &QL; 
________ &QL; 
What: ``A Streetcar Named Desire.'' &QL; 
Where: Deaf West Theatre, 5112 Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood. &QL; 
When: Performances at 8 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays, 2 and 8 p.m.

<TEXT>
<P>
   You might think that a documentary about pro wrestling, written
and directed by the former head writer of ``Saturday Night Live,''
would be a satire.
</P>
<P>
   You've seen the outrageous costumes, listened to the subhuman
bellowing on pay-per-view, maybe even bought a T-shirt or a beer
stein. Can you imagine anything more in need of a cinematic
smackdown than ``Smackdown!''?
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Barry Blaustein has a different agenda. In
``Beyond the Mat,'' Blaustein isn't out to skewer, or even
necessarily to expose the foibles. A self-confessed wrestling
junkie since the age of 8, Blaustein spent five years on the road
watching and interviewing the folks who make their living stomping,
crunching, mangling and setting fire to their ``opponents.'' His
conclusion that the wrestlers are people ``just like you and me ...
only very different'' won't win any points for profundity, but the
journey he takes to arrive at this conclusion is often revealing
and occasionally fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   Blaustein's stars are the stars of the World Wrestling
Federation: people like Terry Funk and Mick ``Mankind'' Foley.
Popping in for cameos are The Rock, Chyna, Stone Cold Steve Austin,
and even wrestler-turned- politico Jesse Ventura. We also meet the
hopefuls, no-names waiting like starlets for a call from the World
Wrestling Federation. One hopeful with a talent for projectile
vomiting even gets an audition with WWF head Vince McMahon. ``It
seems pretty logical that you should be Puke,'' McMahon tells him
tongue not in cheek. ``Puke is good, Puke is nice, and it fits with
the WWF attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   After proposing that pro wrestling is a form of theater and
spectacle, Blaustein shuts the curtain, getting into the brains
(and living rooms) of three wrestlers of various stages of
celebrity and disrepute. There's Funk, a 53-year-old ``living
legend,'' whose arthritic knees are degenerating with every tumble.
There's Funk's frequent opponent Mankind, the devoted family man
with an unusually high threshold for pain, and finally there's
``Jake the Snake'' Roberts, the disgraced cerebral wrestler who
flings serpents onto his opponents in the ring, but who has spent
too much time battling personaldemons (read drugs), frequently
coming out the loser.
</P>
<P>
   When not crashing through cages or braying into a microphone
through a mask of blood, these men are seen walking their daughters
down the aisle, having a heart-to-heart with an estranged child and
frolicking with their adorable kids. Cross-cutting between match
footage and Funk _ looking like five miles of bad Texas roadway _
dragging himself out of bed isn't exactly subtle. Ditto, playing
Rosemary Clooney crooning ``I'll Be Seeing You'' during a
wrestler's farewell bout. These are people who don't invite
mawkishness or sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   But as respectful of these wrestlers as Blaustein obviously is,
he isn't afraid either to show his subjects' warts or to use harsh
tactics to get a point across. In a particularly stomach-turning
sequence, he keeps the camera on Foley's wife and children cringing
and crying out from the front row of an Anaheim match as they watch
an opponent repeatedly pulverizing Daddy with a folding chair.
Blaustein then goes one better, filming himself taking that footage
to the Foley Florida home and watching it with Mr. and Mrs.
Mankind. Mankind's reaction: ``I don't feel like such a good dad
anymore.'' Well, duh! Although Mom should share some of the
culpability.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons not entirely clear, the WWF _ after participating in
its creation _ has now disavowed ``Beyond the Mat'' and refuses to
take advertisements for the film on its television shows. This
seems a little surprising, since the organization and its
controversial leader come across largely as astute business
entities who have figured out a rather unusual way to put on a
show. If McMahon and company are exploiters, they're reeling in
people who seem more than willing _ and even eager _ to be
exploited.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: McMahon and the WWF are treated as background to a
story about people, and for obvious reasons. Who after all is more
interesting _ the individual who sells his soul, or the person who
purchases it? See ``Beyond the Mat'' and draw your own
conclusions. &QL;

FESTIVAL ON THE EDGE OF FAME  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In ``One Soldier,'' a very funny short film
written and directed by its star, the comedian Steven Wright _ he
of the cadaverous deadpan and hair that hangs from both sides of
his head like tumbleweed _ he asks, ``Why are we here?'' And then
he answers, ``I think we're here because it was too crowded where
we were supposed to go.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be a motif for Austin's South by Southwest Film
Festival, which began seven years ago as an offshoot of the SXSW
music festival. It has become one of the best known film festivals
in the country, and it is poised to be the next Sundance. A hit on
the order of ``The Blair Witch Project'' or even ``Sex, Lies and
Videotape'' would do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone thinks an increase in visibility would be a
good thing for the festival, which began on Friday and ends this
weekend. Speaking on a panel about the future of independent film,
John Pierson, president of Grainy Pictures, compared SXSW and other
smaller festivals to the regional music labels that dotted the
country in the 1950s and '60s. Those labels championed acts that
not only became successes but also influenced the pop music
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Because SXSW is a magnet for indie filmmakers _ in the hallways
of the Austin Convention Center, ``What is independent film,
exactly?'' has been the constant topic of heated conversations _
the event has the jazzed pulse of a music show. (More pure high
spirits than the music portion of SXSW, when record industry types
descend on the shaggy calm of Austin and suddenly so many people
hit the streets wearing black in daylight that the city looks like
the Dance Club of the Living Dead.) With eager young filmmakers
everywhere here, scrambling to get their films seen or to get them
made, SXSW crackles with excitement.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the SXSW panels tend to be just as big a deal as the
screenings, though this year attendance at them has seemed down,
with a few exceptions. (That the SXSW crowd is filling the theaters
this year rather than going to the panels is, of course, a very
good sign for filmmakers with movies playing here.) The panels
offer a chance to hear directors, producers and actors speak on the
vagaries of how pictures are made.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a panel on the state of independent film featured
Bingham Ray, former head of the indie house October Films, and
Pierson, an indie film hero who has helped nurture the movement
through his involvement as an investor and producer with projects
like Spike Lee's ``She's Gotta Have It'' and the Independent Film
Channel program ``Split Screen,'' where ``Blair Witch'' first
appeared as a short.
</P>
<P>
   Another well-attended panel set up by Harry Knowles of the Ain't
It Cool News Web site featured the first meeting of John Carpenter,
the director known for low-budget genre pictures like
``Halloween,'' and Robert Rodriguez, the Austin filmmaker, whose
aesthetic _ his movies include ``El Mariachi'' and ``From Dusk Till
Dawn'' _ was influenced by Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter asked Rodriguez the film festival equivalent of ``Did
you inhale?'': How much did ``El Mariachi'' really cost? Rodriguez
legendarily made it for only $7,000, which has made him both a hero
and the disbelieved envy of the indie scene.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez sighed and said the figure was accurate. Carpenter
then made a statement that won him the hearts of those in
attendance: ``Until you confront catastrophic failure, you're not a
filmmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was the movies that most people came to SXSW to see.
Among the ones that made an impact was Chris Wilcha's ``The Target
Shoots First,'' a documentary about his time as an employee of
Columbia House, the record club whose ``12 records for a dollar''
pitch was the siren song for an entire generation. It sounds like
an unlikely subject for a film, but Wilcha used the material to
comment on the culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Target,'' which traces the parallels between Wilcha's life,
the music scene, Columbia House and Kurt Cobain (Cobain was turned
onto music by listening to records his father bought through the
club), is sharp, self-deprecating and ultimately troubling. The
film recounts how Wilcha accurately tagged punk itself as an
institution after he used the punk sensibility _ anarchy from an
aerosol can _ to successfully repackage Columbia House for a new
audience. ``Target'' won both the judges' and the audience
documentary awards.
</P>
<P>
   Documentaries are the best reasons to go to a film festival,
both for the audience members _ who rarely get to see them outside
of festival settings _ and for the filmmakers, who get to see them
projected on the big screen on their way to television. Paul
Stekler, a film professor at the University of Texas here and
co-director of ``George Wallace: Settin' the House on Fire,'' a
stunning and probing documentary that exposes largely unknown facts
about the race-baiting former Alabama governor, said, ``The thrill
of seeing your work 70 feet tall in front of an audience that loves
it, a work that won't be seen like that too many times _ there's
nothing else like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The director Steven Kessler offered ``The Independent,'' a
hilariously pointed mock documentary about Morty Fineman, a
little-known _ and nonexistent _ exploitation filmmaker with a
social conscience (played by Jerry Stiller, who seems to have gone
prematurely blond). It was worth seeing if only for the brief clips
of the films from Fineman's supposed 437-film career, a filmography
that included ``Twelve Angry Men and a Baby.'' The co-star is the
actress-comedian Janeane Garofalo, who spends as much time doing
independent films as she does mainstream work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones you do for next to nothing are the good jobs,''
Garofalo said in a panel discussion. ``I've done 24 films, and no
one knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Comedy was the high point of this year's SXSW. Even the Dogme
'95 film on the bill, ``Enigma (Love Is a Four-Letter Word),'' was
a minor achievement. It was the first film with a sense of humor by
Dogma '95, the Dutch collective committed to naturalism. ``Enigma''
chases after its star, Max, who is filming his audition for a
script so good ``Al Pacino would kill Nick Nolte [or Nol-ta, as Max
pronounces the name) for it.'' As ``Enigma'' moves around the
streets, sending up the self-absorption of actors and directors, it
feels like MTV's Tom Green's take on ``Inside the Actor's Studio.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rollercoaster,'' a bleak and stylish blend of comedy and drama
about a group of disaffected teen-agers, was a winner of this
year's judges' narrative prize. One of the more intriguing films
was ``Loving Jezebel,'' a romantic comedy whose hero (Hill Harper)
is in love with love and, throughout his life, with the wrong
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jezebel,'' which won the audience narrative award, deserved
notice because race isn't an issue, though its protagonist has an
African-American mother and a white father and falls for girls of
varied ethnic backgrounds. Maybe it is a sign of the future in
film, one well worth keeping an eye on.
</P>
<P>
   The shorts included ``Soldier,'' essentially a Civil War
black-and-white version of Woody Allen's ``Love and Death,'' and a
great short on the cult filmmaker Kenneth Anger's ``Scorpio
Rising'' in which Anger relates how, in ``Mean Streets,'' Martin
Scorsese picked up on his use of pop music to advance the story, a
practice the rest of the filmmaking world has adopted.
</P>
<P>
   This year SXSW had a retrospective of Monte Hellman's brooding,
laconic films (``The Shooting,'' ``Two-Lane Blacktop''), and at a
modestly attended Saturday morning panel he mused on his devotion
to his craft, saying that although he hadn't made a film in 11
years, he works every day on projects that end up falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   He summarized the indie life by quoting his wife: ``There is not
a day in my life when I don't wake up and hear my wife say, `Why
don't you get a job?'''

WHEN NATIONAL SECURITY BECOMES A MEDICAL ISSUE

 &HT;    
 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    America has been reminded once again that it is woefully
ill-prepared to deal with the threat of biological terrorism. The
General Accounting Office, an investigative branch of Congress, has
charged that the government has failed to properly manage the
medical stockpiles developed to protect the public from the scourge
of potentially devastating biological weapons.
 &HT;    In a scathing report, the GAO criticized multiple government
agencies for managing the stockpiles so poorly that they might be
unavailable in the event of an attack. It found shortages of vital
drugs as well as deficiencies in the amount of emergency supplies
that were supposed to be on hand.
 &HT;    The Chemical Biological Incident Response Force, a Marine Corps
unit created in 1996 to help treat civilian victims of a biological
attack, was cited for glaring shortcomings: the GAO discovered that
more than a quarter of the Corps' stockpile was plagued by
inventory discrepancies and record-keeping errors. The Department
of Veterans Affairs was also cited for its failure to competently
manage emergency supplies.
 &HT;    This government ineptitude is no idle matter. If deadly microbes
like anthrax or smallpox were released into the general population
_ a prospect that experts say is quite plausible _ federal
stockpiles of medical supplies would be critical to saving lives.
State and local authorities could be overwhelmed by mounting
casualties, and federal intervention would be urgently needed. No
city in the country has the resources to handle a major attack on
its own.
 &HT;    Yet Washington has been dragging its heels in preparing for a
potential crisis. The recent GAO report is only the latest evidence
to emerge that the government's effort to prepare for a biological
attack is alarmingly ineffective.
 &HT;    The problem, quite simply, is that the nation has yet to take
the steps that could ultimately save thousands, or even tens of
thousands, of lives. Such steps include everything from enhancing
our disease surveillance system to ensuring an adequate supply of
lifesaving vaccines and antibiotics.
 &HT;    The government's failure to take these steps raises inevitable
questions. With the stakes so high, why isn't Washington taking
more aggressive action? If national security and health officials
agree that the threat is real, why aren't they working harder to
mitigate the threat?
 &HT;    The answer may lie in the unique challenges posed by the specter
of bioterrorism.
 &HT;    Unlike a chemical or explosive attack, a biological attack will
require the close collaboration of groups that are not accustomed
to working together: the national security and public health
establishments. It's an odd mix _ doctors and intelligence agents _
but for biological counterterrorism to work, they must join forces.
Unfortunately, the National Security Council and other federal
agencies have yet to fully integrate the medical community into
their plans.
 &HT;    In order to succeed, they will have to correct this flaw,
because the first responders to any bioweapons attack are likely to
be doctors and local public health authorities _ not firemen,
police or SWAT teams. If terrorists should ever unleash infectious
agents on a city, the first evidence of the attack will almost
certainly appear in hospital emergency rooms. At this point, a
rapid response will be critical: if diagnosis and treatment is
delayed, it could mean huge numbers of casualties. The very
survival of healthcare providers could be at stake.
 &HT;    But how well prepared are we to handle such a crisis? Few
doctors have ever seen a case of smallpox, plague or anthrax. Few,
if any, medical laboratories are equipped to diagnose such
conditions. And as the GAO just noted, our stockpiles of drugs and
supplies are far from ideal.
 &HT;    There are other problems as well. The national counterterrorism
effort, for example, has thus far focused mainly on chemical and
explosive weapons rather than on infectious agents. Perhaps this
reflects the security establishment's familiarity with such
weapons, since its efforts in this area have largely involved the
enhancement of existing hazardous material protocols. But what
about the biological threat?
 &HT;    Medical experts point out that biological weapons are far more
dangerous than either chemicals or explosives, since the
devastation from this kind of attack can persist and even get worse
over time, as new cases of disease continue to arise. In contrast,
stabilization and recovery from a chemical or explosive attack can
begin almost immediately. Yet despite this reality, preparations
for a bioweapons attack have lagged far behind efforts to prepare
for more traditional kinds of threats like explosives.
 &HT;    The problem is not just one of priorities. It's also a matter of
expertise. Our national security apparatus _ accustomed to dealing
with military (rather than medical) issues _ hasn't brought enough
health experts into the nation's emergency preparedness program. In
fact, according to the Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies at
Johns Hopkins University, the medical community has so far received
little funding or targeted attention from any preparedness program,
and few hospitals have participated in the bioterrorism response
exercises sponsored by federal authorities.
 &HT;    This is a particularly illogical strategy, since planning for a
possible ``man-made'' epidemic is best handled by the people who
are specially trained for this kind of occurrence: epidemiologists
and infectious disease specialists. Preparing for bioterrorism
without their active involvement is a bit like preparing for war
without the Department of Defense. It's time to correct this
oversight.
 &HT;    We also need to improve the communication between the medical
and law enforcement communities. National security efforts in the
biological arena simply will not work without the combined
participation of both communities. By planning ahead, we can not
only avoid unnecessary problems like drug shortages but we can also
minimize the chance that cultural differences between the national
security and health establishments will hamper the nation's
response to a terrorist attack.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The average dream lasts about six minutes, but
for those who have sat on a Harley-Davidson, BMW or other
motorcycle, the dream lasts for as long as the motor is rumbling.
</P>
<P>
   If I have to explain, as the saying goes, you won't understand.
</P>
<P>
   But the one reality that shocks a lot of would-be riders is the
sticker price of the new bikes _ $15,000 to $22,000 is typical for
the new high-end Harleys and Beamers, with even the Honda, Yamaha
and Kawasaki touring lines getting way up there in price.
</P>
<P>
   But now there is an answer for that.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a renting a motorcycle for a vacation is growing
quickly and now popular enough to support a minitour industry. For
a package price, you can set up a vacation that includes a rental
bike (often a high-end Harley-Davidson), insurance, a proposed
itinerary, lodging, food and support.
</P>
<P>
   I don't own a bike at the moment, but I've driven about 75,000
miles around the western United States at various times on old
Triumphs, Harleys and BMWs, and can say the sensation of freedom
from a road trip on a bike is right up there with the best of any
California adventures and getaways. My preference is to throw my
camping book in a saddlebag and see where I end up, but there are
many more formal options _ as well as several wild cards.
</P>
<P>
   The price of rentals can be as low as $40 per day (offseason,
weekday, no insurance, no food, no nothin'), and go as high as
$3,500 a week for the all-included, everything-goes deals. Now is
the time when most reservations for planned vacations take place.

MILOSEVIC CALLS FOR U.N. WITHDRAWAL AS VIOLENCE CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA-MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ As fresh violence erupted in
this divided city Wednesday, President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia accused the United Nations of aiding Albanian terrorism
and said it should end its mission in Kosovo and hand control back
to Yugoslav military and police forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of using their authority and impartiality to restrain
terrorist gangs of Albanian extremists, we face the situation in
which the terrorism is taking place under their auspices, and even
being financed by United Nations means,'' Agence France-Presse
quoted Milosevic as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic made his comments as elections in Serbia appear
increasingly likely and as NATO announced the arrival of more than
1,000 additional troops in Kosovo to buttress its forces.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic spoke at a meeting with top Yugoslav military
officials, including Defense Minister Dragoljub Ojdanovic and the
chief of staff, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, the state news agency,
Tanjug, reported.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Milosevic reviewed troops and ``gave an
excellent mark to the fighting readiness of our army,'' Tanjug
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our army and security forces are capable of providing safety
for all the citizens in Kosovo in the interest of peace and
stability for the whole region,'' he was reported as having said.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, NATO said it would add two battalions, 700 French
and 400 Italian troops, to reinforce the security forces in this
northern Kosovo city that has been the scene of the most serious
violence for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Renewed violence broke out Wednesday as French troops tried to
set up a secure zone around one of the bridges that divide the city
and ordered the self-appointed Serbian guardians of the bridge to
leave their positions. The Serbs, who prevent Albanians from
crossing the bridge into the northern Serbian-dominated part of the
city, left. But an angry crowd of 300 people rapidly formed.
</P>
<P>
   Troops dispersed the crowd with tear gas and percussion
grenades. The Serbs said the grenades injured up to 15 people. The
Serbs then attacked Western journalists and were barely prevented
from lynching an elderly Albanian man in his apartment. French
paratroopers in armored vehicles rescued him, and he was bleeding
as the troops struggled to carry him through the lunging, pushing
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The anger in the streets was palpable. The so-called bridge
guardians were young tough men with walkie-talkies. Serbs said the
force is necessary to prevent Albanians from attacking the Serbs
and forcing them to flee the city, as they have elsewhere in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The French command has tolerated the guards because they are not
armed. But Albanians and foreign-aid groups have complained that
the men prevent the free movement of Albanians who live on the
northern side of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials and the NATO-led security force are trying to
form a secure zone around the bridges where both Serbian and
Albanian residents can move freely.
</P>
<P>
   They proposed that one Serb and one Albanian assist French
troops to check people who want to cross. But the Serbs refused.
The security action by the French troops Wednesday suggests that if
the Serbs do not cooperate, they will be forced to.

THINK ARTISTS ARE NORMAL? THINK AGAIN
</HEADLINE>

(Eds: For use FRIDAY, March 17 or later. Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite its pedestrian-sounding title, ``Condo Painting'' is not
Bob Vila's latest instructional video. Rather, it's about a notable
recent American painter, George Condo, his creative spirit and his
quirky, if not downright bizarre, notion of a world of imaginary
creatures he calls the ``Antipodean beings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Antipodes were the mysterious regions beyond North Africa
that fearful Europeans, before the Age of Exploration, peopled with
dragons, sea serpents and other fearsome if fanciful creatures. In
short, the Antipodes were, and are, the unknown, the place pulled
from the unconscious where fantasy and fear combine to create
beings that don't exist but nonetheless have power.
</P>
<P>
   Condo has been painting his notion of Antipodean residents for
years now. The paintings look like some drug-assisted hybrid of
Precious Moments collectibles and sad-faced clown Emmett Kelley Jr.
Bizarre, but utterly engaging, they fascinate for no explicable
reason, and maybe that's the point in painting them.
</P>
<P>
   Condo creates huge canvases peopled with these creatures, using
a confident craftsmanship and sweeping, just-right brush strokes to
quickly evoke his visions. Director John McNaughton catches those
brush strokes, sometimes in close-up and absorbing detail, in his
documentary of Condo's work. When he follows the brush, and the
creative process, the film is at its most interesting and engaging.
</P>
<P>
   At the film's core is Condo's lengthy struggle with a specific
canvas whose original Antipodean is shown painted in cheery colors
against a bubblegum-pink background.
</P>
<P>
   Over more than a year's time, though, a frustrated Condo will
paint in an additional smaller Antipodean, paint cloudlike mists
onto the background, paint over the background, paint over the
Antipodeans and paint a new, more somber resident.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, he tells the camera, he has signed the picture
three times. Finally, he steps back and, with his wife, surveys the
now- finished work with some adequate measure of satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   It's this sort of scene that redeems a film otherwise marred by
impenetrable self-indulgences, almost all of which revolve around a
dancing man (Condo's brother-in-law) in a business suit and
Technicolor long wig and clown mask.
</P>
<P>
   The dancing creature is meant to represent a living Antipodean,
and at one point, Condo uses a goofball faux device he calls a
``Podfinder'' to chase down the creature in a junkyard.
</P>
<P>
   In a film about the painter's attempts to bring these creatures
out of his subconscious and onto the canvas, such scenes must have
made some sort of wacky sense to Condo and McNaughton, who co-wrote
the film. Transmitted to screen, however, they just don't work,
either as humor, magical realism or some sort of offbeat commentary
on what's inside the artist's head. They are, in fact, more
off-putting than offbeat.
</P>
<P>
   McNaughton is a veteran director of quality TV and such diverse
films as ``Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,'' ``Wild Things,''
``The Borrowers'' and ``Mad Dog &AMP; Glory.'' In this film, his ninth,
he uses a variety of visual technological tricks available when the
film was being made in 1996 and 1997 to create a different,
purposely painterly look.
</P>
<P>
   That bag of digital tricks generally works well enough, and
certainly watching an excellent and talented young painter in the
struggle of creation can be absorbing. But perhaps we should leave
the Antipodeans where they belong, on the canvas, and in Condo's
fertile mind. &QL; 
____ &QL; 
The film: ``Condo Painting'' (not rated; no violent or sexual
content but occasional odd and disturbing images). &QL; 
The stars: George Condo. &QL;

MEXICO INVESTIGATES OFFICIAL'S SUICIDE AND SOURCE OF CONCEALED
CASH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Authorities investigating the suicide of a senior
official in the attorney general's office are trying to find out
where he obtained the small fortune that he kept in a safe deposit
box.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Juan Manuel Izabal, denied in one of at least
three notes that he wrote before he killed himself last Wednesday
that he had received the money from narcotics traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   But Attorney General Jorge Madrazo said drug ties had not been
ruled out. Authorities are also investigating whether the money may
have come from selling senior law-enforcement jobs, shaking down
contractors who have sold equipment to the attorney general's
office or other corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The suicide is the latest in a series of scandals to hit the
country's top law-enforcement agency, which Mexican and U.S.
officials say has been thoroughly corrupted by traffickers and
other criminals despite purges aimed at eliminating dishonest
officials. A former deputy attorney general also committed suicide
_ in New Jersey last year _ after having been charged with
laundering $9 million in traffickers' bribes. His aide had carried
the money to Houston in suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have reported finding at least $700,000 in one safe
deposit box registered to Izabal. The newspaper Universal reported
Sunday that investigators had found $500,000 in two additional safe
deposit boxes and had obtained warrants to search others.
</P>
<P>
   Izabal was the top administrative officer at the attorney
general's office, an agency with thousands of employees and offices
in all 32 states. He managed the agency payrolls, hiring and
purchases and the thousands of buildings, planes and vehicles
seized from traffickers. He had worked closely with Madrazo for
nine years.
</P>
<P>
   In one of Izabal's notes, he said he had received the money
before going to work for Madrazo. But several Mexican newspapers,
citing unidentified government officials, suggested that the
unfolding scandal had brought pressures from within President
Ernesto Zedillo's government for Madrazo's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Izabal's body, with a gunshot wound to the head, was found last
Wednesday morning, seated at the wheel of his Chevrolet Suburban,
parked a few blocks from his Mexico City residence. A .38-caliber
Beretta pistol was in his hand, and investigators ruled his death a
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The contents of the first of the safe deposit boxes, in a Mexico
City branch of Citibank, seem to have been discovered by accident.
Bank executives, preparing to close the branch, had sent three
notices to Izabal urging him to retrieve the contents. But Izabal,
for reasons that are been clear, did not respond, Madrazo said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the bank opened the box and found the $700,000 and
``personal documents,'' Madrazo said. The documents have not been
described.
</P>
<P>
   The day before his death, Izabal appeared at the branch, Madrazo
continued, but the bankers refused to give him access to his box.
Instead, they reported finding the money and documents to Madrazo.
</P>
<P>
   Izabal killed himself before dawn the next day. At the morgue,
investigators found two handwritten notes in Izabal's suit.
Handwriting experts said they Izabal had written them, although his
brother disputed that.
</P>
<P>
   ``To whom it may concern,'' the first began. ``Do not blame
anyone for my death. It is my decision, and I take responsibility.
May God forgive me.''
</P>
<P>
   The second note was addressed to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgive me for what I am going to do,'' it began. ``You are
going to learn of things you don't know about, and they will
disappoint you. The safe deposit boxes do not only contain
documents, as I told you. There is also money that is difficult to
explain. It is the product of business deals that I have done, but
that in my position as public servant would not be understood. It
is not from narcos, but I did not declare it, and the circumstances
have me up against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   City detectives who searched Izabal's office found a third note,
addressed to Madrazo, in which he said he had not received the
money in the three years that he worked for the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake before working in the attorney general's
office,'' the note said. ``The money is from before. It was my
protection, and I've had it for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Izabal said in the note that he had told his wife when he
acquired the safe deposit box that he had put ``important documents
from a job'' in it and that ``if something happens to me, take them
out and use them to help me.''

<P>
   Water in the basement can be a year-round problem, but it seems
particularly acute during the spring and summer. In the early
spring, melting snow turns into ground water that seeps through the
soil. Pressure in the soil forces it through the foundation walls
into the basement. Spring rains can trigger a deluge of water that
dumps thousands of gallons of water around the house. This will
percolate into the ground, where hydrostatic pressure will force
the water through basement walls. In the summer, the humidity in
the air condenses on the basement walls and drips down to form
puddles on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of techniques you can employ to dry a wet
basement and avoid it getting wet in the first place. For the
first, you must determine where the water is coming from, and then
you can plan an effective strategy to end the problem. There are
three major sources of basement water: condensation, runoff and
subsurface penetration.
</P>
<P>
   Condensation comes from the ambient moisture in the basement
air. Unlike runoff water and subsurface water penetration that
comes from outside the house, condensation is an interior problem.
But how can you tell if the water droplets collecting on the walls
come from ambient humidity or are the result of ground water
seeping through the walls?
</P>
<P>
   There is a simple test you can perform to tell where the water
on the walls is coming from. Tape pieces of aluminum foil (about 6
by 6 inches) over damp spots on the walls. Check the foil patches
after a few days. If moisture has formed on the outside of the
foil, then condensation is the cause of the water. If, on the other
hand, the moisture is on the wall side, the water is seeping
through the wall from the ground outside.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming you have a condensation problem, what can you do about
it? Start by airing out the basement. Open as many windows as
possible and set up fans to pull the air outside. Remove any items
that add to the humidity in the air. These include newly cut
firewood and wet clothes hanging on an indoor clothesline. If you
have a basement clothes dryer, make sure that it is vented to the
outside and that there are no leaks in the vent ducts. Wrap
cold-water pipes with foam insulation to isolate them from the
warm, moist air.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, install a dehumidifier in the basement. A good
heavy-duty unit can pull more than 50 pints of water out of the air
each 24 hours. It is best to place the unit near a drain. This will
make it more convenient to empty the reservoir. In the fall and
winter, make sure the basement is heated so moisture evaporates
quickly
</P>
<P>
   Some question the merits of a basement dehumidifier. They point
out that the dry basement atmosphere will actually pull water in
from the surrounding soil because water naturally flows from a wet
environment to a dry one. There is some truth to this, but experts
point out that an efficient dehumidifier can easily evacuate the
small amount of water drawn in through the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Runoff water is another significant cause of basement water.
Runoff comes from rain or melting snow. The way to control runoff
and keep it from entering the basement is to channel it away from
the house before it has a chance to seep into the ground. Start by
inspecting the gutters around the roof. They should be clear of
leaves and debris with tight seams and no holes.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the downspouts to make sure they are clear, and place
splash blocks under the downspout elbow. These will divert the
water pouring out of the downspout away from the foundation.
Ideally, the gutters should drain four feet away from the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The ground surrounding the house should slope down, at least one
inch per foot, so water will run away from the house. Some houses
at the base of a hill may have an additional drainage system in the
form of a U-shaped channel that wraps around the house. Coarse
gravel in the channel captures runoff from the hill and diverts it
around and away from the house. This system is effective at first,
but over time the runoff will deposit silt in the channel and clog
the spaces in the gravel bed. The remedy is to dig up and replace
the gravel after sifting out the silt.
</P>
<P>
   Water can enter the basement by coming up from below. Called
subsurface penetration, the excessive moisture is a result of
underground springs or a rising water table. It is best to consult
with a professional to find the ideal solution for your home. He
may suggest installing a sump pump and perhaps digging around the
foundation walls to apply a waterproof membrane.

`THE LIFESTYLE': A DISQUIETING LOOK AT MIDDLE-AGED `SWINGERS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   That old Freudian maxim about the mind being the most important
sexual organ certain applies to ``The Lifestyle: Group Sex in the
Suburbs,'' David Schisgall's disquieting documentary study of
middle-aged ``swingers.'' Although some may be stimulated by the
movie's fleeting glimpses of gray-haired, pot-bellied,
cellulite-jiggling, over-60 orgiasts lustily going at it in their
suburban living rooms after an evening of barbecue and California
dip, many more will probably be repulsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lifestyle'' includes one brief hard-core scene, but it is
not an exploitation film. In its blunt deglamorization of sexual
license, it is more like the antidote to Stanley Kubrick's elegant,
fearful erotic dream, ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' In Kubrick's
Freud-drenched vision of sexual transgression, group sex within the
upper class was portrayed as the ultimate taboo, a secretive
nightmarish dance with the Devil. Here it is an indoor sport played
by married middle-class couples on Saturday night in living rooms
decked out with disco balls and Japanese lanterns.
</P>
<P>
   The movie devotes much of its time to interviews with devoted
longtime swingers attending Lifestyles '97, a national convention.
We learn that most swingers meet at clubs that advertise in
publications in every state except North Dakota. Bisexuality is
encouraged among the women but not among the men. (Not so much as a
homosexual glance is exchanged in the movie.) Nobody seems to worry
about sexually transmitted diseases, since the use of condoms is
taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   What lends the movie a comic undertone is how everyday many of
these swingers are. There is absolutely nothing to distinguish
these polyester-clad, politically conservative suburbanites from
the crowds in any Middle American shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   The movie makes bluntly clear the reasons for the popularity of
swinging. Our society uses sex to sell everything and places such a
premium on sexual attractiveness and fulfillment that thousands of
frustrated people are bound to respond to the eroticizing of the
climate. Many of those interviewed have been married for decades,
and they attest that swinging is a solution to sexual boredom in a
relationship that has lost its zest. It's also a way to deal with
the loneliness of empty-nest syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the couples interviewed cheerfully stand up for
their lifestyle, there are exceptions. John and Gina, the youngest
and by far the most attractive couple interviewed, are naysayers.
After trying the swinging life (at John's instigation), they
withdrew because of Gina's reluctance to play, and the damage their
experimentation has done to their marriage is painfully visible.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has its share of oddballs and fanatics. We meet an
enthusiastic but dumpy-looking 73-year-old man who claims to have a
marathon sexual appetite. There is Dr. Robert McGinley, president
of the Lifestyles Organization, who estimates the number of
swingers in North America to be 3 million and daydreams about their
being organized into a political bloc.
</P>
<P>
   One devoted swinger enthusiastically points to the promiscuous
habits of chimpanzees as a model for an emerging orgy-porgy sexual
utopia. We even visit a swingers' church, the Earth Church of the
Pacific, to witness a wedding whose ceremony invokes the blessings
of ``angels and wizards'' instead of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lifestyle'' leaves you with strong contradictory feelings.
The sex shown in the movie is so routine and passionless that the
couplings look more like collaborative stretching exercises than
soul-stirring erotic encounters. Might this indiscriminate,
unromantic bumping and grinding be the outcome of ultimate sexual
liberation? If so, who wants it?
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, you have to admire these swingers for standing
up for pleasure in a society that, despite its obsession with sex,
views sex negatively. There's something courageous and healthy in
their demonstration that you don't have to be young and beautiful
to find sexual pleasure and celebrate the erotic.

   &UR; THE FINE ART OF ART CRITICISM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Visiting the fine-art collection of  &UR; Steven Wynn &LR;  at the
Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas last weekend, Personals received a
press kit extolling the glories of the paintings, which include
works by Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Picasso, Miro, Manet, Monet, De
Kooning and other masters.
</P>
<P>
   The press kit for the exhibit included an essay by  &UR; Peter &LR; 
 &UR; Schjeldahl &LR; , apparently written as a free-lance assignment before
he became an esteemed art critic for the New Yorker. The following
bon mots from Schjeldahl describe the wonders of the collection:
</P>
<P>
   - This ``remarkable American collection comes together suddenly
in a place that seems ever less unlikely the more one thinks about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   - ``All pleasures are pleasurable, but not all are equal.''
</P>
<P>
   - Describing  &UR; Claude Monet &LR; 's ``Water-Lily Pond With Bridge,''
the critic writes, ``The picture is a moisturizer of the soul.
Monet's painting also observes a high holy day of the human hand.''
</P>
<P>
   - As to  &UR; Joan Miro &LR; 's ``Dialogue of Insects,'' ``Nagging at the
mind like sandy grit caught in your eye, the apparitions clamor to
be identified, but none is anything you have seen before.
Gradually, as you look, you sink into the condition of those
winsome critters, sharing a perspective by which, say, a grain
stalk towers like a redwood tree. In the universe, aren't we all
odd, dwarfed critters, too?''
</P>
<P>
   - ``Looking (at  &UR; Willem De Kooning &LR; 's `Police Gazette') we seek
eyeholds like sailors grasping for survival in a storm at sea.''
</P>
<P>
   - ``Come to close quarters with all of the works here
assembled,'' the critic implores. ``Think of the hands that made
them _ because those hands are thinking of you!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GLOBAL NIBBLES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A Scottish chef who introduced deep-fried Mars Bars at a Paris
restaurant has caused international consternation, says a report in
the Times of London, forwarded to Personals by  &UR; Dennis &LR; 
 &UR; Cavagnaro &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The dish _ made by dipping a cold Mars Bar into batter, frying
it in oil, then serving it with whipped cream and strawberry sauce
_ was first prepared at Le Chipper in Paris by a Glaswegian chef
who has since departed. The left-wing French newspaper Liberation
proclaimed the treat ``not bad at all,'' an opinion not shared by
many Parisians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried one of their deep-fried Mars Bars and found it
disgusting,'' said Marie-Ange Renaud, owner of Le Petit Bonheur, a
traditional French restaurant next door to Le Chipper. ``That sort
of thing will never work in France.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberation has responded to French indignation by adding fuel to
the fire. Last week it printed a recipe for ham roasted in cola
with sugar, mustard and breadcrumbs.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. ``Is your hair making your face look fat?'' asks the latest
issue of Glamour magazine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - At a downtown Manhattan bar so new it doesn't yet have a name,
 &UR; Keanu Reeves  &LR; was upset when the bartender told him that he
doesn't sell cigarettes. According to New York magazine, the owner
of the place sent the bartender two blocks to the nearest deli to
make the purchase. Reeves tipped him $150.
</P>
<P>
   - The Ebonite Skull Ball, a clear bowling ball with a replica
human skull inside, costs $150, reports Men's Fitness. This item is
on view at www.ebonite.com.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Martha Stewart &LR; , who's been fighting with her neighbors in
Connecticut, is departing for Clintonland, Westchester County, N.Y.
She's bought a $50 million estate in Bedford Hills, next door to
 &UR; Ralph Lauren &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  ``Is it more prestigious to be a tenured professor or a
famous actor?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  ``Actors tell stories that serve a function, we go through
things for people. Historically, that's what plays do. You go to
the theater and you have that catharsis because there's a heroic or
non-heroic figure going through these things that speak to you in
some way, and you are involved and feel vital, and maybe you learn,
but at least you have an experience because we all can't go through
these heroic things. ... That's a great service. ... If I were a
teacher at Yale, I'd be teaching people who are already really
well-educated. You're not really saving anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - David Duchnovny &LR;  of ``The X-Files'' in a Movieline interview
that notes he ``almost ended up an academic instead of an actor.''

<P>
   - This ``remarkable American collection comes together suddenly
in a place that seems ever less unlikely the more one thinks about
it.''

   - ``All pleasures are pleasurable, but not all are equal.''
</P>
<P>
   - Describing  &UR; Claude Monet &LR; 's ``Water-Lily Pond With Bridge,''
the critic writes, ``The picture is a moisturizer of the soul.
Monet's painting also observes a high holy day of the human hand.''
</P>
<P>
   - As to  &UR; Joan Miro &LR; 's ``Dialogue of Insects,'' ``Nagging at the
mind like sandy grit caught in your eye, the apparitions clamor to
be identified, but none is anything you have seen before.
Gradually, as you look, you sink into the condition of those
winsome critters, sharing a perspective by which, say, a grain
stalk towers like a redwood tree. In the universe, aren't we all
odd, dwarfed critters, too?''
</P>
<P>
   - ``Looking (at  &UR; Willem De Kooning &LR; 's `Police Gazette') we seek
eyeholds like sailors grasping for survival in a storm at sea.''

   A Scottish chef who introduced deep-fried Mars Bars at a Paris
restaurant has caused international consternation, says a report in
the Times of London, forwarded to Personals by  &UR; Dennis &LR; 
 &UR; Cavagnaro &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The dish _ made by dipping a cold Mars Bar into batter, frying
it in oil, then serving it with whipped cream and strawberry sauce
_ was first prepared at Le Chipper in Paris by a Glaswegian chef
who has since departed. The left-wing French newspaper Liberation
proclaimed the treat ``not bad at all,'' an opinion not shared by
many Parisians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried one of their deep-fried Mars Bars and found it
disgusting,'' said Marie-Ange Renaud, owner of Le Petit Bonheur, a
traditional French restaurant next door to Le Chipper. ``That sort
of thing will never work in France.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberation has responded to French indignation by adding fuel to
the fire. Last week it printed a recipe for ham roasted in cola
with sugar, mustard and breadcrumbs.

but at least you have an experience because we all can't go through

BORDER PATROL DETAINS STRAY MEXICAN SOLDIERS AFTER SHOTS FIRED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal lawmen detained nine Mexican soldiers for
several hours Tuesday night after they fired two shots in the
direction of U.S. Border Patrol agents, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers, part of an anti-drug patrol, apparently fired the
shots after inadvertently crossing the U.S. border into a remote
area south of Santa Teresa, N.M., just west of El Paso. No one was
injured, and the Border Patrol did not return fire, INS reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol is investigating whether the shots were fired
at the agents, a drug suspect or by accident, said Tomas Zuniga, a
spokesman for the patrol's central regional office in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at all possibilities at this time,'' Zuniga said
of the patrol's investigation. ``We are trying to come up with ways
to prevent this from happening again.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. diplomats are meeting with their Mexican
counterparts over the incident, reported INS, the Border Patrol's
parent agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican Consulate in El Paso confirmed that soldiers
accidentally crossed into the United States. But consulate
spokesman Marco Antonio Fraire told The Associated Press that he
had no information about any shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The shots were the most harrowing part of a night in which two
Mexican anti-drug patrols in Humvees apparently crossed into the
United States inadvertently at 11:30 p.m. CST. In both cases,
Border Patrol agents identified themselves and informed the
Mexicans that they were in the United States, INS reported.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident, shots were fired from a Humvee that later
crossed back into Mexico. It was not clear when the shots were
fired, the agency added.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol agents detained the nine occupants of the other
Humvee. They were questioned for several hours at the Santa Teresa
Border Patrol Station.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers were then released, and they returned to Mexico in
their Humvee and with their weapons and their drug-detection dog.
The Mexican colonel in charge of the soldiers later met with Luis
Barker, the Border Patrol's chief agent in El Paso, INS reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``The colonel explained that the Mexican vehicles and officers
were part of a counter-narcotics unit that had been working
primarily in the interior of Mexico and were unfamiliar with the
border region,'' INS said in a prepared statement. The agency did
not disclose the colonel's name.
</P>
<P>
   Zuniga, of the Border Patrol, said it is not unusual for Mexican
and U.S. agents to cross the border inadvertently, especially
during night operations. But gunfire has never occurred during
these incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go into Mexico by accident and they come here by
accident,'' Zuniga said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We communicate with each other whenever one of these incidents
occurs,'' he said. ``We are two friendly nations.''

 &HT;    DIESEL FUMES SAID TO PUT 125,000 AMERICANS AT CANCER RISK
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than 125,000 Americans are at risk of getting
cancer during their lifetimes from breathing exhaust from trucks,
buses and other users of diesel engines, state and local air
pollution regulators said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Associations representing the state and local regulators called
on the Environmental Protection Agency to adopt stringent standards
limiting the amount of sulfur allowed in diesel fuel, and the
emissions of soot and smog-forming nitrogen oxide from new trucks
and buses that burn it.
</P>
<P>
   The two closely related organizations, the State and Territorial
Air Pollution Program Administrators and the Association of Local
Air Pollution Control Officials, said they based the cancer
estimate on a study released last year by California's South Coast
Air Quality Management District.
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on analysis of air samples collected at
various locations in the Los Angeles metropolitan area during a
one-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The state and local air pollution groups assumed that the
per-capita cancer risk from diesel exhaust was twice as great in
Los Angeles as in the rest of the country. To estimate the risk in
other locations, they halved the risk found in the Los Angeles and
multiplied it by local population estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Release of the national cancer estimate was the second shot in a
budding debate over whether EPA should also cut the allowable
concentration of sulfur in diesel fuel by more than 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's request for permission to develop the new sulfur
rules is being reviewed by the White House Office of Management and
Budget. The proposal is opposed by oil companies, truckers and
other interests.
</P>
<P>
   Air quality control scientists say sulfur must be removed from
fuel in order for pollution control devices to work properly.
</P>
<P>
   The California study concluded that more than 70 percent of
cancers attributable to air pollution in southern California could
be traced to soot and other components of exhaust from diesel
trucks, buses, construction equipment and other machinery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no pollution more disgusting than the thick, noxious,
suffocating smoke that billows from trucks and buses,'' said S.
William Becker, executive director of both the state and local air
pollution associations. ``But even worse, these fumes are putting
us at risk of cancer, a risk that can be almost completely
eliminated with modern pollution controls.''
</P>
<P>
   EPA allows the diesel fuel to contain a maximum sulfur
concentration of 500 parts per million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this analysis is another strong argument why EPA needs
to clean up diesel fuel and set very stringent emission standards
for trucks, buses and other big engines that use it,'' said Frank
O'Donnell, director of the Clean Air Trust, an environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from either petroleum or
trucking industries.
</P>
<P>
   However, earlier this week, a coalition of groups dominated by
the two industries called on EPA Administrator Carol Browner to
withdraw a proposal to reduce the permissible fuel sulfur
concentration to 15 parts per million by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   ``EPA's proposal for diesel sulfur is likely to reduce the
supply of diesel fuel as well as heating oil and even gasoline,''
the associations said in a letter to Browner. ``We consider it a
blueprint for future shortages of diesel and home heating oil.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter stated that the proposed cap and the six-year time
frame for implementing it ``are in excess of what is feasible or
advisable,'' and said EPA had not conducted a satisfactory analysis
of the rule's impact.
</P>
<P>
   The groups said they were ``committed to dramatically reducing
diesel engine emissions'' but asked that EPA ``perform the
necessary analysis before proposing a rule.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was signed by the Petroleum Marketers Association of
America, the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America,
the Independent Fuel Terminal Operators Association, the National
Association of Convenience Stores, the American Petroleum
Institute, the Service Station Dealers of America and Allied
Traders, the National Association of Truck Stop Operators, the
National Petrochemical and Refiners Association and the National
Council of Farm Cooperatives.

GORE COURTS VOTERS IN PIVOTAL PENNSYLVANIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Pennsylvania voters have almost always picked the
winning presidential candidate for the last four decades, and with
that in mind, Democrat Al Gore wasted no time Wednesday heading
there to stake his claim to the key battleground.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, Gore courted union workers, raised money,
picked up the endorsement of Mayor John Street and visited a
vocational school.
</P>
<P>
   He reminded a cheering state AFL-CIO conference of the
anti-union practices of past Republican administrations and warned
of a rough general election campaign ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to win, the other side is going to throw everything
but the kitchen sink. They're manning the barricades. They're
throwing unprecedented amounts of money at the campaign. They will
stop at nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pennsylvania holds its primary April 4, Gore is
spending his time here and in a half-dozen other swing states with
an eye on the November election against Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A manufacturing powerhouse earlier in the century, Pennsylvania
has gradually and painfully made a transition to a more high-tech
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The state's population is aging and heavily Catholic. Its voters
are often socially conservative but also supportive of government
programs such as Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   And in recent times neither political party has dominated the
state. Even as President Clinton won the state in 1992 and 1996,
Republicans have dominated the statehouse. While the mayors of
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh are Democrats, both U.S. senators are
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pretty much a centrist electorate,'' said Terry Madonna,
a professor at Millersville University.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Keystone poll, which Madonna directs, has Gore and
Bush in a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, released 10 days ago, shows dramatic improvement for
the vice president, who had trailed Bush by 20 points last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is Gore is doing much better among
blue-collar working Democrats,'' Madonna said.
</P>
<P>
   The pollster said Gore was also beating Bush in the Philadelphia
suburbs, the home of many moderate Republicans who were critical to
Clinton's two victories.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the survey shows the vice president is not
doing as well as he should in the traditionally Democratic
strongholds of Pittsburgh and the old industrial belt in the
southwestern corner of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem for Gore is senior citizens. The poll
showed Bush even with Gore among those older than 65, an important
voting block in a state with the second-highest percentage of
senior citizens in the nation, following only Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But among Catholics, another pivotal group of voters, the vice
president leads Bush, who spent the last part of the primary season
defending his decision to speak at Bob Jones University, whose
leaders have made anti-Catholic comments.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns claim they have advantages in the state. Bush
advisers are counting on the state's popular Republican Gov. Tom
Ridge, a Catholic who favors abortion rights, to put his political
machine to work to energize voters. Ridge has frequently been
mentioned as potential running mate for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a state where I think I can win,'' Bush said Wednesday.
``That's a state we intend to compete in. It's a state where it's
going to be helpful to have my friend Tom Ridge by my side. He's
been a good governor. But it's a tough state. It's going to be very
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Republicans will hold their national
presidential convention in Philadelphia this summer, which GOP
officials anticipate will shower their candidate with even more
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Gore noted the significance of the convention site, telling the
AFL-CIO workers: ``I want you to make sure that's as close as he
gets to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is relying on organized labor and the
Democratic mayors to provide the ground troops to get voters to the
polls for him in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor is gong to pull out all the stops for Gore,'' Madonna
said.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna also said that another factor helping Gore is that
traditional Democratic issues such as health care, education and
prescription drug coverage for the elderly rank high among
Pennsylvanian's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   However, tax cuts, the centerpiece of Bush's economic plans,
were mentioned by only one out of 10 voters polled as a top
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna said he expected Gore and Bush to lavish attention on
the state. A major reason, he said, is that Pennsylvania has failed
to vote for the White House winner only once since 1960. That was
in 1968 when voters went with Democrat Hubert Humphrey over Richard
Nixon.

LAWMAKER QUESTIONS JUSTICES ABOUT LACK OF MINORITY CLERKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Supreme Court justices Wednesday defended their
choices of law clerks amid a congressman's repeated pleas that they
and their colleagues do a better job of hiring minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before a House panel, Justices David H. Souter and
Clarence Thomas acknowledged that federal judges in general should
strive to hire more minorities to be law clerks. The justices,
under persistent questioning from Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif.,
added that an applicant's race is irrelevant when they choose their
clerks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That simply is not the criteria on which we hire,'' Souter
said, referring to a candidate's ethnic background. He added that
he scours federal appeals courts with a ``broad'' eye in search of
the most qualified clerks, regardless of their race.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, echoing Souter, said he and his high-court colleagues
``keep our eyes and ears open'' for clerks with strong academic
records and experience.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the nine justices hires up to four clerks annually. The
clerks are recently licensed attorneys who help the justices
research and write their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Souter and Thomas declined to say if any of their current clerks
are minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make the clerks public figures,'' Souter said.
He added that his clerks are free to disclose their ethnic
backgrounds but that he would not.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court during the past two years has come under
attack from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People for what it has called a distressing paucity of minority law
clerks. This year, in marked improvement from past years, five of
the court's 35 clerks are members of minority groups _ two blacks
and three Asian-Americans, according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent improvement, Dixon told the justices that he
will continue to press them and their colleagues to hire even more
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to go away,'' Dixon said of the
hiring issue.
</P>
<P>
   Souter and Thomas appeared before the House Appropriations
subcommittee on behalf of their colleagues to urge Congress to
appropriate $45.2 million for the high court in fiscal year 2001,
which begins Oct. 1. The justices' annual appearance before the
panel is the only chance Congress members get to question
high-court jurists, and Dixon made the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   Souter and Thomas, who also testified last March, were called
upon for the second time in as many years to respond to Dixon's
criticism that they and their colleagues have not hired enough
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, as they did last year, held fast to the position
that law schools and lower court judges have failed to move
qualified applicants up the judicial employment pipeline to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Justices generally hire clerks who graduated near the top of
their law school classes and have clerked for a federal appeals
court judge, prerequisites not too many minority lawyers have
satisfied, Souter said. That prior experience is necessary because
Supreme Court clerks must be ready from their first day on the job
to assist the justices, Souter told the Subcommittee on Commerce,
Justice, State and Judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas added that justices and lower federal court judges have
no formal guidelines on the hiring of law clerks, leaving it up to
the jurists to decide for themselves whom to hire as assistants.
But, based on informal discussions with fellow justices and judges,
Thomas said he senses a ``heightened awareness'' of the need to
hire more minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Under continued questioning from Dixon, Thomas said the court's
record of hiring women is stronger than its record of hiring
minorities. Thomas attributed the disparity to the greater number
of female law clerks at the federal appeals court level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that difficult to find women law clerks,'' Thomas
said. ``They're fairly well represented there'' on the appellate
courts, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But Dixon interjected, ``It's not difficult to find white women
law clerks.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparking the law-clerk controversy was a March 1998 USA Today
study that found only seven of the then-most recent 394 clerks were
black, four were Hispanic and 18 were Asian. In October 1998, NAACP
President Kweisi Mfume was arrested and held briefly for protesting
on the steps of the Supreme Court the justices' lack of minority
clerks.

MORE SETBACKS FOR EMBATTLED MAYOR OF PARIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Not long ago, Mayor Jean Tiberi invited the foreign
press to lunch. Under the coffered ceilings and the crystal
chandeliers of Paris' magnificent City Hall, he laid out a spread
that began with foie gras accompanied by a 30-year-old sauterne and
ended, many bottles later, with a 1985 Dom Perignon.
</P>
<P>
   Between sips, Tiberi described his political future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a good record,'' he said. ``And I am standing on my
record. Someone will have to explain to me why I should not run
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiberi made it sound like a simple equation. It is not. In fact,
Tiberi's attempt to hold on to his job is one of France's most
entertaining political stories these days. The post is coveted for
the comforts of the City Hall building and its wine cellar. But it
is also considered a jumping-off point for bigger things. Before
becoming president of France, Jacques Chirac as mayor of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   But Tiberi has problems, and they seem to mount by the day.
There is the matter of his wife, Xaviere, and her brush with the
law. Last year, before her conviction was put aside on a
technicality, Mrs. Tiberi was found guilty of accepting $36,000 for
a 36-page report on a subject she knew nothing about.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the flimsy report on France's relations with
French-speaking nations, with childish spelling and grammar
mistakes, showed up in the press. One of Mrs. Tiberi's
co-defendants testified that it was her husband who had arranged
the fake job as a pretext for a payoff.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor blew right by that one, meeting the press the next
day to tell them that he had been convicted of nothing.
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, Tiberi's fortunes seemed to dim further as
his honesty was questioned once more. Looking to keep the Gaullist
party's nomination, despite polls that found that only 5 percent of
Parisians believed him honest, Tiberi turned to party members for
support.
</P>
<P>
   He asked the leader of his party, Michele Alliot-Marie, to put
his candidacy to a vote by party members. (Usually, the party
leader simply decides who will have the nomination.)
</P>
<P>
   But while he was waiting for an answer, the party's national
headquarters unveiled a little problem: The list of local members
supplied by Tiberi contained 1,500 phantom members _ Parisians who
had moved away, stopped paying their dues or died. One party
employee found seven strangers listed as living in her home.
</P>
<P>
   Tiberi quickly withdrew the list, blaming the celebrated Year
2000 malfunction for what he termed ``computer errors.'' This
caused a great deal of mirth among French journalists, as Year 2000
problems have barely appeared in France.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason that Parisians are on the edge of their seats
waiting to see what happens to Tiberi is his long association with
Chirac, who handpicked him for the job. Tiberi, 65, was Chirac's
deputy for most of Chirac's time as mayor from 1977 to 1995.
Political analysts often speculate that Tiberi has been untouchable
because he knows too much about scandals at City Hall through the
years.
</P>
<P>
   Many scandals are still being investigated. One inquiry is
looking at the mayor's role in awarding public housing contracts to
supporters of Rally for the Republic, including those given out
when Tiberi was Chirac's right-hand man. The mayor is also being
investigated for inflated voter rolls and he has been questioned
about evidence that political cronies hold city jobs but are not
required to do any work.
</P>
<P>
   But Tiberi's lifeline to Chirac may be fraying. At lunch with
the foreign press, he boasted that he expected Chirac's continued
support. ``I have supported him when he was down,'' he said. ``Why
should he not support me?''
</P>
<P>
   This week he thundered that it was ``unimaginable that anyone
should try to eliminate a friend of Chirac's.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few days, Chirac has been conspicuously silent.
Even when Tiberi was admitted to a hospital with an infection,
Chirac apparently did not call. Such an oversight, said the
satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine, was hard to imagine, when
``most provincial Rally for the Republic members suffering from
corns'' got calls from the president wishing them well.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Tiberi took another blow. Rally for the Republic,
worried it would lose the mayor's race in March 2001 if Tiberi ran,
moved to suspend him as party leader in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to take measures to show our nomination will be decided
in a totally open manner,'' Alliot-Marie said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tiberi indignantly declared at an afternoon news conference
that the action came as a complete surprise to him. ``This
method,'' he said, ``was authoritarian, dictatorial, fascist and
Stalinist.''
</P>
<P>
   He vowed not to let go.

   SCI-PRIMATE-FOSSIL (Undated) _ Fossil bones of an animal no
bigger than a shrew and weighing less than an ounce have been
identified as belonging to the earliest known relative of the
primate lineage that led to monkeys, apes and eventually humans.
The wee animal lived 45 million years ago in a humid rain forest in
what is now China. The paleontologists who announced the discovery
Wednesday said the fossil animal, named Eosimias for ``dawn
monkey,'' was the best evidence yet for fixing the time and place
of one of the more fateful branchings in evolution. Eosimias
appeared to be a transitional figure when lower primates, known as
prosimians, went their way, developing into today's lemurs,
lorises, bush babies and tarsiers, while the diverging higher
primates, the anthropoids, evolved into more prepossessing
creatures, including human beings. By John Noble Wilford. 1,100

   WEB-BOOKS (Undated) _ In what could be a critical moment in the

Mustang-driving ghost has proven so popular in two days of literary
life that several online booksellers could not meet orders that
topped 400,000. In the first 24-hour after posting ``Riding the
Bullet'' on various Internet Web sites, readers overwhelmed leading
online booksellers with purchases or orders to download the 66-page
digital horror story into their computers, electronic readers or

   LA-PRIVATE-PRISONS (New Orleans) _ A judge here has accused one
of the largest private prison companies in the nation, Wakenhut, of
treating inmates in a for-profit juvenile prison like animals and
has freed two teen-age boys after finding they had been brutalized
by guards, kept in solitary confinement for months for no reason
and deprived of such routine things as shoes, blankets, education
and medical care. The judge said the teen-agers had been entrusted
to the prison ``for the avowed purpose of rehabilitation,'' but
instead he said, they ``wound up in a place that drives and treats
juveniles as if they walked on all fours. These young people
deserve to be treated like human beings, not animals.'' By Fox
Butterfield. 1,500 words.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Life is sweet for John Harrison. As the official taste tester
and ambassador for Oakland-based Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, founded
in 1929, he has what many would consider a plum of a job.
</P>
<P>
   You'll often find him with a golden spoon in his mouth as he
tastes and assesses dozens of ice creams, frozen yogurts, sherbets,
sorbets and other frozen desserts daily. If he doesn't like what he
tastes, it doesn't leave the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Willie Wonka job in America,'' said Harrison during a
recent visit to the Los Angeles area. He has tasted more than 180
million gallons of ice cream during his career.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer's (marketed under the Edy's label in states east of the
Rocky Mountains) depends on his tongue and its 9,000 taste buds. In
fact, so much so that the company has insured them for $1 million.
``That's around $110 a taste bud,'' he said laughing.
</P>
<P>
   So how did he get so lucky? His tasting skills were honed during
his growing-up years (his mother was an excellent cook) and while
working in the industry. Ice cream runs in his family _ four
generations have been in the business _ reaching back to the 1880s,
when his great-grandfather made and sold his own ice cream and
candy in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather started the first dairy co-op in Tennessee, and
my uncle Tom owned an ice cream factory in Memphis where I worked
during my high school and college days. I grew up drinking 40
percent (butterfat) cream in his factory and learning the nuances
of ice cream.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he went to work with his father, a formulator, selling
ingredients such as chocolate, cocoa, fruits and flavorings to ice
cream manufacturers in the western states.
</P>
<P>
   As fate would have it, he ended up at Dreyer's after an
opportunity to solve a formulation issue made the company aware of
his talents _ and they designed a position for him. That was in
1982 _ and the rest is history. Initially he was both a taster and
flavor developer, but as the company grew he settled into his role
as official taster and company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when he's not traveling and buying and sampling ice
creams in supermarkets and stores throughout the country, a typical
day in the office starts at 7:30 a.m. when his taste buds are at
their prime. It includes taste-testing and evaluating for quality
60 packages of 20 flavors of frozen desserts produced the day
before (from the beginning, middle and end of the run), which are
left in his freezer.
</P>
<P>
   He removes a carton at a time _ starting with the white wines of
ice cream _ which translates into vanilla _ and working his way up
to the heavy Bordeaux _ the stronger, heavier flavors like
chocolate, mint, coffee, etc. Each carton is split lengthwise in
half with a large, special ice cream knife. He checks appearance
and color (too light, too dark, unnatural).
</P>
<P>
   ``It must look inviting because first we eat with our eyes. I'm
looking for even distribution of the added ingredients such as nuts
and chocolate pieces and the evenness of swirls and patterns of
items (if present) like marshmallow, caramel or raspberry.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison then checks the temperature of the ice cream with a
thermometer to make sure it is at 10 to 12 degrees F (somewhat
melted) _ the optimum for flavor sampling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ice cream is too cold, you can't taste the flavor.''
However, he pointed out that at home, most consumers eat ice cream
at 5 degrees F or just above zero.
</P>
<P>
   Then he scoops a small sample with his gold-plated spoon.
``Gold,'' he explained, ``does not have a resin aftertaste like
wood or plastic.'' Then he turns the spoon upside down, placing the
sample on his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Next he swirls, smacks and spits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't swallow the ice cream because I would get too full and
my taste would lose its sharpness.''
</P>
<P>
   He is looking for flavor (unnatural, salty, too sweet, lacks
sweetness), body and texture (smooth, creamy, coarse, icy, gummy,
fluffy, etc.) and balance. Flavored ice cream should be well
balanced between the fresh cream, sweeteners and flavoring
material. He knows immediately if the product passes muster and
meets company quality standards.
</P>
<P>
   If not, that batch of still-edible ice cream is donated to food
banks _ close to half a million gallons produced last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many pecans in butter pecan is just as wrong as not
enough. If consumers are paying top dollar for ice cream, they
expect consistency and quality _ and they deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   On a problem-free day, tasting is completed by noon _ and the
balance of the day is spent consulting on new products, flavors,
ingredients, suppliers and other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, you might find Harrison training employees to
taste, which takes eight hours a month for three months. He trains
all of company's tasters, including two quality-control tasters in
each of the six plants (City of Commerce; Union City, Calif.; Salt
Lake City; Denver; Fort Wayne, Ind.; and Houston, Texas) located
throughout the United States, along with 35 additional tasters at
the corporate office in Oakland who evaluate product reformulations
and ingredients that go into the company's products. But tasting
has its downside. Harrison adheres to a specific list of no-no's
during the week (as do all the tasters). No garlic, no onions, no
hot or spicy foods, no smoking, no alcohol, no coffee (decaffenated
herbal tea is allowed), no cayenne pepper. But a bland, boring diet
(with foods such as mashed potatoes, roasted chicken, steak, plain
hamburgers and veggies) doesn't faze the jovial man with the large
laugh. When you're getting paid six figures, it's not an issue, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, however, Harrison turns the tables and indulges in
favorite foods (and you might even find him cooking some of them)
such as pepperoni pizzas, spaghetti (with garlic), spicy barbecued
creations, meat loaves and dishes redolent with garlic.
</P>
<P>
   The ice cream market in America today is very fragramented, with
approximately 500 ice cream manufacturers, according to Diane
McIntyre, Dreyer's public relations director. Dreyer's was the
largest in 1999 with a 15 percent market share ($1.1 billion in
sales), followed by Breyer's with 14 percent and Dean Foods (in the
Midwest) with 7 percent, said Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   California produces more ice cream than any other state.
According to the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) in
Washington, D.C., in 1998 Calfornia produced about 160 million
gallons of ice cream (regular, low-fat and non-fat) and 180 million
gallons of frozen daiy products (including ice creams, yogurts,
ices, sherbets, etc.).
</P>
<P>
   Ice cream production in the United States for the same year
totaled 1.4 billion gallons (regular, low-fat and non-fat), while
frozen dairy desserts produced totaled 1.6 billion gallons. That
amounts to U.S. per-capita consumption of 20.57 quarts of ice cream
in 1998 and 24.01 quarts of frozen dairy desserts.
</P>
<P>
   As far as ice cream trends, ``Indulgent is where the pendulum is
today,'' said Harrison, adding that about 70 percent of Dreyer's
volume is real ice cream and 30 percent is low-fat, no sugar,
yogurt and other frozen dessert products. In the future, who knows.
``There is nothing new under the sun except new combinations of
ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer's annually produces 125 flavors of all brands (including
Godiva, Starbucks, Dreamery and Healthy Choice) of ice creams,
yogurts, sorbets, light ice creams, sugar-free ice creams, bars,
etc. Some 15 new flavors (10 of them ice creams) are introduced by
Dreyer's each year. Currently, six new M&AMP;M Mars flavors with
Snickers, Milky Way, 3 Musketeers, Twix and M&AMP;M candies, along with
three Girl Scout cookie ice creams including Thin Mints, Samoas and
Tagalongs, are available.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison encourages consumers to slow down, taste and enjoy ice
cream. ``Life is uncertain, so eat dessert.'' &QL;

BUSH FAVORS REQUIRING USE OF `SMART GUN' TECHNOLOGY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Under fire from Democrats as weak on gun
control, presumed Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush
said Wednesday he could favor a law requiring every new firearm to
include technology that would allow the weapons to be fired only
when matched to the owner's fingerprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the technology changes it will be good,'' Bush said. ``I
want to make sure I understand fully how the technology works
before I would embrace something like that, but it's not a bad
option. I will consider that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush for weeks has been promoting such ``smart gun'' technology
as a means of keeping unauthorized individuals and children from
shooting a firearm. But his statement Wednesday is the first time
he has indicated he might require gun makers to use such
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The technology uses a computer chip and a sensor on a gun to
match a fingerprint or palm print to the weapon's owner, allowing
only that person to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has embraced the ``smart gun'' technology in defending
Democratic criticism over his opposition to requiring all gun
owners to keep a trigger lock on their firearms when not in use.
Bush says such a law would be unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his comments in a wide-ranging interview with the
Houston Chronicle as he sat in the front parlor of the Texas
Governor's Mansion, a day after clinching the GOP presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared riled by an e-mail he had received Tuesday from
the presumed Democratic nominee, Vice President Al Gore,
challenging Bush to begin a series of debates and to forgo using
unrestricted soft money raised by the political parties to campaign
for president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sent an e-mail reply to Gore on Wednesday, saying Gore
should encourage the White House and the Department of Justice to
release all records related to alleged fund-raising abuses
committed by the vice president during his 1996 re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for your e-mail. This Internet of yours is a
wonderful invention,'' Bush's note said, poking fun at Gore's
exaggerated claim to have been responsible for creating the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will be willing to debate Gore later this year when
more voters are paying attention. The governor also refused Gore's
challenge to reject soft money _ unregulated contributions to
political parties for use in general election campaigns _ because
he does not trust Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said let's ban soft money, and President Clinton is raising
it hand over fist,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me this is just an attempt to obscure or to try to divert
people's attention from what's going on in this administration,
including his trips to Buddhist temples and his calls out of the
White House. I don't trust him,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Gore limited soft money expenditures through the
Democratic Party, Bush said the vice president's allies in
organized labor would still be free to run television ads attacking
him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush favors banning soft money from corporations and labor
unions, but not from individuals. Bush said he does not believe
large sums of money in U.S. politics corrupts the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it necessarily corrupts. I think honest people
are not corruptible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing the New Hampshire Republican primary to Arizona
Sen. John McCain in a surprise upset that led to six more weeks of
campaigning, Bush said he is satisfied that his campaign staff did
a good job in winning the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Bush's Washington backers had been privately calling on
him to replace strategist Karl Rove, manager Joe Allbaugh,
Communications Director Karen Hughes and advertising consultant
Mark McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of nattering. The team is intact. Everybody
performed well,'' Bush said. ``I've got great confidence in Joe,
Karl, Karen, Mark, as well as everybody else. We may be broadening
our reach. These decisions will be made in the next couple of
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said any decision on a vice president will likely be put
off until just before the Republican National Convention in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a list yet for potential running mates. I'm going
to take my time before putting one together,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main criterion is whether the person can be the president,
whether or not we agree on issues and whether or not we can get
along,'' Bush said. ``Whether a person brings something from a
region or a state, or whether the person is of a gender or a race,
all of those will be factors in making the determination as to who
ought to be vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   On one current issue of the campaign, Bush said it is not his
role as Texas governor to use the relations he has built with
Mexican officials during this decade to get them to increase crude
oil production in the government-owned oil company to help bring
down the rising price of gasoline in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the president ought to be doing _ not only Mexico,
but other friendly nations in OPEC,'' Bush said. ``I don't think
governor's ought to be interfering with the job that the president
ought to be doing. It's the president's job to be conducting
foreign policy.``

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Three sure signs that Gov. George W. Bush has
clinched the GOP presidential nomination:
</P>
<P>
   Official letter from Republican National Committee Chairman Jim
Nicholson declaring Bush the ``presumptive nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service agents, taking over from Texas Department of
Public Safety, spending first day on the job at the Governor's
Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Snippy e-mail response from Bush to Democratic opponent Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for your e-mail,'' Bush said in a Wednesday response
to a Tuesday e-mail from the vice president. ``This Internet of
yours is a wonderful invention.''
</P>
<P>
   On the morning after he became the GOP's presumptive nominee by
sweeping six southern primaries, Bush sat through a rapid-fire
series of interviews at the Governor's Mansion and geared up for
the fall battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot of time to celebrate,'' Bush told the Austin
American-Statesman. ``We're on to the next phase of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The next phase includes a lot of behind-the-scenes machinations,
including raising more money, patching things up with vanquished
foe John McCain, getting Bush people in place at the Republican
National Committee and trying to persuade Americans that Gore is
the kind of guy who will ``say anything to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   On hold for now is the effort to work things out with McCain,
who dropped out of the race after Bush won most of the Super
Tuesday contests on March 7. Bush wrapped up the nomination Tuesday
by winning six primaries, including Texas and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is vacationing out of the country. Bush, who has had one
brief phone chat with McCain recently, views reunification as
inevitable, though terms have not been worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can work together on a lot of reform issues,'' said
Bush. ``We're pleased that many of his supporters are coming
around. ... There is plenty of room for common ground.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush searches for common ground with a former foe, don't
look for the same kind of effort with his current foe. Gore and
Bush have wasted no time in going after each other.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president moved quickly Wednesday to point out exit
polls from Tuesday's Texas primary showing that 40 percent of the
GOP voters said there have not been ``significant reforms'' in
Texas schools under Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Education is the issue Bush believes can propel him to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush talked a lot about reform, but Texans are not seeing
results,'' said Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway. ``On education, as
on so many issues, George W. Bush is all hat and no cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was unaware of the exit poll results on education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statistics say different. I don't know what the polls
said, but the test scores showed different. I haven't seen the
polls, but I will tell you we are making great progress, better
than any other state,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will mount a campaign aimed at ``elevating the
spirit of America,'' but he will not shy from a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to defend myself,'' said Bush, launching into what
has become a familiar refrain about Gore, ``and this is a man who I
believe will say anything to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-Gore battle became a certainty on Tuesday when each
candidate swept primaries in Texas, Tennessee, Florida, Louisiana,
Mississippi and Oklahoma. Both candidates lost their top foes last
week when McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley gave up.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to differing interpretations of when a delegate
officially becomes bound to Bush, there are varying numbers
floating around on exactly how many delegates are now in Bush's
corner. It takes 1,034 to clinch the nomination. The Associated
Press count has Bush with 1,093 so far.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson on
Wednesday declared Bush ``has secured the requisite number of
delegates to win the Republican nomination.''Nicholson said his
count was based on ``convention delegates elected or selected to
date and the voting history of delegations from caucus states.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, however, is not offering a specific number on how
many delegates are in the Bush corner. The RNC will not go beyond
saying the number is ``over 1,034.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore, as of today, the Republican National Committee
officially recognizes Governor Bush as the party's presumptive
nominee,'' Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said Wednesday he is not sure he will be taking any
international trips prior to the nominating convention, though he
would like to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be the right forum. I'm not sure we're going to do
one,'' he said. ``If we did one I'd like to start in our own
neighborhood. I'd like to go down to South America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said a trip to Mexico is problematic because it would
get him wrapped up in the country's July 2 presidential election
``and I certainly don't want to get involved in that.''

   ``I'm going to defend myself,'' said Bush, launching into what
has become a familiar refrain about Gore, ``and this is a man who I
believe will say anything to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-Gore battle became a certainty on Tuesday when each
candidate swept primaries in Texas, Tennessee, Florida, Louisiana,
Mississippi and Oklahoma. Both candidates lost their top foes last
week when McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley gave up.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to differing interpretations of when a delegate
officially becomes bound to Bush, there are varying numbers
floating around on exactly how many delegates are now in Bush's
corner. It takes 1,034 to clinch the nomination. The Associated
Press count has Bush with 1,093 so far.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson on
Wednesday declared Bush ``has secured the requisite number of
delegates to win the Republican nomination.''Nicholson said his
count was based on ``convention delegates elected or selected to
date and the voting history of delegations from caucus states.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, however, is not offering a specific number on how
many delegates are in the Bush corner. The RNC will not go beyond
saying the number is ``over 1,034.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore, as of today, the Republican National Committee
officially recognizes Governor Bush as the party's presumptive
nominee,'' Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said Wednesday he is not sure he will be taking any
international trips prior to the nominating convention, though he
would like to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be the right forum. I'm not sure we're going to do
one,'' he said. ``If we did one I'd like to start in our own
neighborhood. I'd like to go down to South America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said a trip to Mexico is problematic because it would
get him wrapped up in the country's July 2 presidential election
``and I certainly don't want to get involved in that.''

 Matthew Gurewitsch's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was
about the filming of ``Leporello'' in Toronto.  
 By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recordings of Wagner's tetralogy, ``Der Ring des Nibelungen,''
are no longer the cultural milestones they were at midcentury. The
first studio recording _ Decca's _ took shape in stages from 1958
to 1966, with the as yet unknighted Georg Solti leading the Vienna
Philharmonic and a cast headed by Birgit Nilsson, Hans Hotter and
Wolfgang Windgassen.
</P>
<P>
   More than three decades on, remastered and reissued on at least
two occasions, it remains the best-selling ``Ring'' in the catalog.
</P>
<P>
   A rival take from Deutsche Grammophon, produced by Herbert von
Karajan between 1968 and 1970, features the Berlin Philharmonic and
artists including Thomas Stewart, Jon Vickers, Regine Crespin and
Helga Dernesch. It, too, makes the cut as a classic, though too
rarefied and idiosyncratic a one for universal acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of the CD, several digital contenders followed.
Artistic merits aside, the market could not absorb them all, as the
more prescient in the industry realized from the start. Privately,
a highly placed recording executive from Deutsche Grammophon (then
embarked on James Levine's ``Ring'' with the Metropolitan Opera)
told me he had made a bet with a counterpart at EMI (simultaneously
occupied with Bernard Haitink's ``Ring'' with the Bavarian Radio
Symphony) as to whose set would sell (italics)less.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   But corporate image was at stake; neither label backed off. To
compound the folly, Deutsche Grammophon and EMI had to share a
single artist in the central role of Wotan. Commercially speaking,
James Morris had no competition.
</P>
<P>
   Fulfilling the expectations of the cynical, both sets marched
straight to the white-elephant graveyard. Decca later gave
Christoph von Dohnanyi approval for yet another new studio
``Ring,'' this one with the Cleveland Orchestra. But in the lean,
mean '90s, the old rules no longer applied. After two installments,
the project went south. At least Dohnanyi was spared the
embarrassment of forging ahead without a viable Siegfried, the hero
of the third and fourth operas.
</P>
<P>
   The time for such Ozymandian projects is past, maybe forever.
Yet thanks to microphones in the opera house and concert hall,
recordings of the ``Ring'' continue to proliferate. In this context
one thinks first of the long-established cottage industry in
historic cycles (Toscanini at La Scala, Clemens Krauss at
Bayreuth).
</P>
<P>
   But as I discovered last year, taking refuge from a midsummer
downpour, some new bottles actually contain new wine. The source
was the record store Die Schallplatte, the audiophile's Wagner
Central in the Bavarian town of Bayreuth, home to the festival the
master founded in 1876 in honor of his own genius.
</P>
<P>
   There, amid the reissues, lay stacks of two genuine collector's
items. A ``Rheingold'' (Arte Nova 74321 63650 2; two CDs) documents
Gustav Kuhn's performances at the Tirol Festival in Erl, Austria,
and in Naples in 1998. The orchestra is that of the Teatro di San
Carlo, Naples; the singers are members and guests of Kuhn's
international training institute, the Accademia di Montegral. Of
the same vintage and similarly unexpected provenance is a
``Siegfried'' from a production at the Kassel State Theater (Ars
Produktion FCD 368377/80; four CDs), conducted by Roberto
Paternostro, for several years an assistant to Karajan.
</P>
<P>
   And now the historic label Testament has released Hans
Knappertsbusch's legendary, previously unpublished Decca
``Gotterdammerung'' from the first post-Hitler Bayreuth Festival,
in 1951 (SBT 4175; four CDs).
</P>
<P>
   The usual way to approach the ``Ring'' is via the more or less
unified conception of a single team of interpreters. Thus, the
Metropolitan Opera preserves a well-worn ``Ring,'' always conducted
by James Levine. The production _ originally directed by Otto
Schenk in decor by Gunther Schneider-Siemssen and Rolf Langenfass
in a literal-minded, reactionary conception _ is unified to a
fault. But breaking the cycle up may not be such a terrible idea,
if only for the greater imaginative flexibility the experience
demands from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for three cycles this spring, beginning next
Saturday with the matinee broadcast of ``Das Rheingold,'' the Met
has already presented ``Die Walkure'' out of sequence. Much more
radically, the Stuttgart Opera has been mounting the four music
dramas as a single project with a different director and designer
in charge of each, though a single conductor, Lothar Zagrosek,
presides throughout.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of creative fragmentation, why not take advantage
of the chance alignment of unrelated recordings to traverse the
``Ring'' (three-fourths of it, anyway) in contrasting readings, all
live, all unfamiliar? (Anyone holding a bootleg ``Walkure,'' kindly
speak up.)
</P>
<P>
   The glimpse into the state of Wagnerism in the outback struck me
as particularly appealing, for reasons touched on by Ioan Holender,
director of the Vienna State Opera, in an introductory note to the
Kassel ``Siegfried.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must never forget,'' writes Holender, who had attended the
show, ``that decisive innovations in the arts have always come from
the so-called `provinces.' The important singers and conductors who
have laid their artistic foundations in such places are legion. The
new generations of weighty Wagner voices, in particular, almost
never emerge from the metropolis but require the care and slow
development characteristic of smaller houses.''
</P>
<P>
   If weighty voices are in short supply in these recordings, there
are compensations, especially in ``Das Rheingold.'' Kuhn is hardly
the first to discover the glinting threads of melody that weave
through this score, but the flow of melody he sustains virtually
from start to finish is quite out of the ordinary. Even the
prelude, that astonishing fantasia in pure E flat suspended in
primordial timelessness, does not just hang there on this occasion
but sings.
</P>
<P>
   Instrumental gestures give off a pointillist brilliance, and the
scene painting is remarkable. Passages of violence and fury, often
played as if to crush the bones, unfold here as episodes in a
fast-paced thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the revolutionary nature of ``Das Rheingold'' lies in
the aggressive alliteration of its extensive dialogue. The
``talky,'' self-conscious quality of the language often leads
singers to adopt a style that foreshadows the harshness of German
Expressionism and even Sprechgesang. Unusually, Kuhn seems to
espouse a vocal ideal harking back to the cantabile of Italian
song.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese trio of Rhinemaidens (Hi-roko Kouda, Junko Saito
and Taeka Hino), dulcet almost beyond belief, and the Chinese giant
Fasolt (Xiaoliang Li) set the standard. As the dwarf Alberich, the
forger of the ring, Andrea Martin does not prejudice a listener
against him by snarling or growling, yet he never fails to put
across his character's malevolence at the proper moments.

MCCAIN TO FORM PAC TO CONTINUE `STRAIGHT TALK' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was hardly in doubt, but it was confirmed Wednesday that
Senator John McCain will not recede from the national stage as
Texas Gov. George W. Bush campaigns for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign workers said the Arizona senator's ``crusade'' for
campaign finance reform, an issue that helped to define his
candidacy for the Republican nomination until he suspended his
campaign on March 9, will continue.
</P>
<P>
   It will continue, not in a third-party run, as some have
speculated, but via a far more conventional route: a political
action committee.
</P>
<P>
   In a few days, the Senator, who returns from vacation at the end
of the week, will announce the formation of a PAC called Straight
Talk America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a vehicle which will allow Senator McCain to
continue his crusade for reform,'' said spokesperson Todd Harris.
``He will actively campaign in support of reform-minded Republican
candidates across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But the PAC will be mostly a vehicle for McCain himself, said
spokesperson Howard Opinsky, a way for the senator to ``continue
promoting his cause of reform, and to speak for the millions of
Americans who want something different out of their government.''
</P>
<P>
   The PAC will fund a speaking tour by the senator some time in
the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   The PAC will also serve as a clearinghouse for reform ideas, and
a way of fulfilling McCain's frequent stump pledge to make
beneficiaries of pork-barrel expenditures ``famous'' by exposing
them to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until last week, our campaign was our vehicle to push
Senator McCain's reform agenda,'' Harris said. ``His support of
that agenda has not gone away. The vehicle he'll be using to
advance the cause of reform has simply changed names.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain will retain his delegates, Opinsky said, in the hopes of
bringing a campaign finance reform amendment to the floor at the
Republican National Convention, if nominee George W. Bush hasn't
already introduced the principle into the platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in making sure the reform agenda is a part of
Republican party, and we've heard a lot of rhetoric about it thus
far,'' Opinsky said. ``But with seven states won and a large number
of delegates to his name, Senator McCain wants to reserve the right
to utilize those delegates if necessary, which it may not be.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has not yet endorsed Bush, and is not expected to do so
in the immediate future.

 UNDATED: proper moments.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rest of the ensemble ranges from highly acceptable to much
less so. Sad to say, the Wotan of Albert Dohmen _ to be heard also
in ``Ring'' cycles in Trieste and Catania, Italy, Geneva and Madrid
_ is at the wrong end of this spectrum: wobbly, lacking in
projection, fussy of phrase. Still, here is a prologue to a
``Ring'' it should be fascinating to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The best news from the Kassel ``Siegfried'' concerns individual
instrumentalists. Given the opportunity, they brighten the
proceedings with lovingly shaped comments and interjections. Where
the effect depends on more complex movement or interplay within the
orchestra, Paternostro coaxes forth the occasional magical
pianissimo, eerie chill or tidal swell. But too often the music
fails to catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   Among the singers, the most familiar is the veteran Manfred
Jung, whose Siegfried did yeoman's service two decades ago at the
Bayreuth Festival in the centennial production directed by Patrice
Chereau and conducted by Pierre Boulez. Kassel now has him in the
demanding, unglamorous role of the dwarf Mime, who raises the
orphaned hero for nefarious purposes of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Jung's frayed instrument can still summon the volume the role
requires, and the grotesque accents in his final scene bespeak a
wicked theatricality formerly held in check.
</P>
<P>
   Time may tell otherwise, but the representatives of the younger
generation show less promise for the future than they give cause
for present alarm. Christian Franz has a pleasing way with
Siegfried's lyric and meditative passages, but even at only
slightly higher volume, the sound turns pinched.
</P>
<P>
   As the Valkyrie Brunnhilde, stirred from her magic sleep, Susan
Owen gets by as best she can on sweetness and clarity of tone but
fades at the climaxes. Claudio Otelli's Wanderer (Wotan's alias in
this opera) hits his stride only in the third act. Even here,
though, he staggers, helpless against a wide vibrato.
</P>
<P>
   Turning from these contemporary accounts to the Knappertsbusch
``Gotterdammerung,'' we are overwhelmed by the sheer richness of
the voices. At the very start, the Norns of Ruth Siewert, Ira
Malaniuk and Martha Modl lend their gloomy nocturne an ample-toned,
ravishing solemnity.
</P>
<P>
   Next up is Astrid Varnay's majestic Brunnhilde, sensuous yet
serene, flinging bright high notes like the spears of an Amazon. At
her side is Bernd Aldenhoff, a robust yet romantic Siegfried,
emotionally complex and fascinating. In the thrilling voice of
Hermann Uhde, even the weakling Gunther comes off as a personage of
quasi-mythic stature, elevating the tragedy remarkably.
</P>
<P>
   The Bayreuth bark? You will hear none of that here. Heinrich
Pflanzl's Alberich and Ludwig Weber's Hagen conspire in
sleep-haunted, subliminal tones. If the jet-black, savage timbre
and grizzly attack we associate with Hagen's music are not Weber's
to command, he conquers by other means: among them, the wild,
frightening parlando he applies sparingly but to tremendous
consequence.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the sets of ``Rheingold'' and ``Siegfried,'' each spliced
together from a run of performances (and possibly a patch session
or two), this ``Gotterdammerung'' is presumably all one take.
Knappertsbusch, legend that he was, had human players to contend
with, and the account of Siegfried's Funeral March goes grimly
awry.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the coherence and intensity of the whole are
extraordinary, and the placement of tragic accents is masterly.
Varnay, gripping throughout, delivers Brunnhilde's Immolation Scene
as if to stake her claim on immortality, encompassing the passions
and the wisdom of a lifetime. Perhaps spurred on by this
achievement, Knappertsbusch and the orchestra, a pickup crew
gathered from orchestras all over Germany, surge into the
instrumental peroration with a force nothing short of apocalyptic.
</P>
<P>
   With material of such caliber at hand, should we grieve if the
``Ring'' never gets recorded in the studio again? No _ and yes.
Records cannot replace live performance, as we are often told. But
neither can live performances replace studio recordings, in which
the accidents of live performance can be held at bay.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a studio recording may convert a performance into an
artifact, in which, at least, all the material is present and
accounted for. No doubt this pedantic Platonic notion is more
congenial to some listeners than to others, but it would be hard to
deny that ``reference performances,'' like reference books, have
their uses.
</P>
<P>
   Live recordings can rarely fill that function. But for some who
were there, or others who for reasons of their own wish they had
been, examples like the new ``Ring'' fragments from the Tirol
Festival and Kassel must make cherished keepsakes: items of
personal history.
</P>
<P>
   In our brave new world of potentially boundless electronic
connectedness, institutions should soon be able, at affordable
prices, to self-produce such memorabilia to their constituencies'
hearts' content.
</P>
<P>
   Some such documents, like the Knappertsbusch ``Gotterdammerung''
of 1951, are historic in a broader sense. But only some dream
``Ring'' of the future could ever challenge Solti's. At the right
time, with the right cast, such a challenge will always be worth
mounting. Artistically speaking, that is. What happens in the
marketplace is another question.

`GHOST DOG' MISSES THE GRAVY TRAIN
</HEADLINE>

(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2{ stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his latest film, ``Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,''
formalist wiseacre Jim Jarmusch (``Stranger Than Paradise,'' ``Dead
Man'') attempts to blend gangster, hip-hop, cartoon and Japanese
action-movie elements into one poker-faced satiric hybrid. It's a
fundamentally fun idea that doesn't mesh very well with the
filmmaker's detached, cooler-than-thou aesthetic attitude. As a
result, the film's pleasures are more theoretical than actual.
</P>
<P>
   Jarmusch's signature cross-wiring of cultural references gets a
real workout in this story of a decrepit Mafia family's run-in with
an African-American hit man who fancies himself a latter-day
Samurai warrior. Basically, the film is about the clash of two
different, violent ethics, but it's also about all things running
their course. Set in a generic, post-industrial urban blightscape,
the movie unfolds at the speed _ and, even at its funniest, with
the tone _ of a funeral procession.
</P>
<P>
   Which is appropriate, since the upshot of all this has less to
do with contrasting themes and imagery than with making a lot of
dead bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Portly, putty-faced Forest Whitaker is the unlikely title
assassin. An ascetic, silent type who lives in a shack atop a
tenement next to his pigeon coop, Ghost Dog's life, like any good
Samurai's, is devoted to serving his master.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, said lord is an aging mob underling named Louie
(John Tormey), who saved Dog from an awful beating many years
earlier. Though he doesn't quite know what to make of this strange
guy who so willingly and effectively carries out requested hits,
Louie is happy to use him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   However, when a small glitch mars an otherwise perfect contract
killing, Louie's bosses order the Dog killed. This, of course,
proves easier said than done; after huffing and puffing their way
up flights of stairs, the family's gray-haired mooks barely have
enough energy left to pull triggers on the various pigeon-keepers
they mistake for their elusive prey.
</P>
<P>
   Dog, meanwhile, combines his ancient fighting skills and
high-tech arsenal in a war of attrition against the new set of
enemies, while all the time trying to stay loyal to Louie. As any
soldier will tell you, there's a lot of downtime between battles,
which Dog spends bonding with a little girl in the park and having
conversations he doesn't understand with a French-speaking ice
cream vendor.
</P>
<P>
   The mobsters, meanwhile, indulge the usual movie made-guy
eccentricities: Sonny (Cliff Gorman) digs that funky rap music the
most; godfather Ray (Henry Silva) makes fun of people's names and
tries to get his face to work; the jokers can't make the rent on
their headquarters; and they all watch cartoons too much.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this is funny, some of it just fills space, all of it
takes too long. To remind us that we're looking at a movie instead
of a still life, Jarmusch keeps throwing triple exposures,
superimpositions, editing stutters and other cinematic
attention-getters into the mix. In the plus column, he also comes
up with a good half-dozen inventive visuals (the great Robby Muller
shot the film). And the syncopated soundtrack by Wu-Tang Clan
leader THE RZA is the movie's most reliably lively element.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Ghost Dog'' isn't about life, however obsessed its
principles may be with the codes they live by. Practically
everybody we meet here is dead on first contact; it just takes a
long time for the realization to become final. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ So far, most of the articles about Billy Crudup _ and
there have been a bunch since his 1995 Broadway debut as the
heart-piercing tutor in ``Arcadia'' _ have noted the pronunciation
of his name. CREW-dup. CRU-dup. KROO-dup.
</P>
<P>
   And they have predicted that any time now, any time at all, the
name would become as familiar as DiCaprio or Damon or Affleck: that
the bitter college ladykiller he played in ``Inventing the
Abbotts'' (1997) or the star-crossed runner he played in ``Without
Limits'' (1998) or the pining cowboy he played in ``The Hi-Lo
Country'' (1998) would make him a star.
</P>
<P>
   Well, here they come again. This time, the movie is ``Waking the
Dead,'' based on Scott Spencer's novel about an up-and-coming
politician haunted by intertwined memories of lost love and
abandoned ideals. The 31-year-old actor is in just about every
scene in the film, which flips back and forth between Fielding
Pierce's passionate affair in the '70s with Sarah (Jennifer
Connolly), a committed political activist, and his pragmatic '80s
campaign for a freshly vacated congressional seat.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship ends when Sarah is killed in a car bombing, but
Fielding's career continues on the smooth track he had laid out for
it. As his long-held dream is about to come true, visions of the
martyred Sarah begin to obsess him and the film's director, Keith
Gordon, lets Crudup's chiseled but increasingly distraught face
tell the story, in close-up after close-up.
</P>
<P>
   Crudup has transformed that face for each of his roles: coolly
handsome in ``Inventing the Abbotts,'' cocksure and determined in
``Without Limits,'' naive and stubborn in the 1996 Broadway
production of ``Bus Stop,'' broodingly romantic in ``The Hi-Lo
Country.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Waking the Dead,'' which opens Friday, the large brown eyes
are keen and intelligent, the cheekbones commanding. So it's no
surprise that Crudup looks like someone else again when he shows up
on a blustery day for an interview in Manhattan _ finer-featured
than he appears on stage and screen but somehow less defined, less
finished. The long hair is a leftover from the movie he has
recently completed, about a '70s rock star; the sweatshirt looks
like a leftover from his days as a graduate acting student at
nearby New York University; and the earnestness with which he talks
about why he did ``Waking the Dead'' seems a throwback, too, to the
days before irony became the lingua franca of the young and the
talented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the idea of life's complications being unsolvable, and
that we persist anyway,'' he says. ``I identified with Fielding a
lot, with his confusion, and with his need for some point of view
that would lead him through life. He gets the opportunity to have
what he's always wanted, and all of a sudden he doesn't know why he
wants it anymore. It's a beautiful sentiment to examine: how we are
in part who we are, and in part what we're told we are, and in part
what we do well, whether we want to do it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting is something Crudup has always done well, but that has
not kept him from reflecting on why it's worth doing. ``You
gravitate toward the things that people give you the most positive
feedback for,'' Crudup says. ``And I was, for whatever reason, good
at being a sort of class clown and mimicking different
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   His fate may have been sealed at Hillcrest High School in
Dallas, when a teacher assigned the class to recite an excerpt from
Shakespeare. Crudup chose Hamlet's ``To be or not to be''
soliloquy, and found he had been able to memorize far more than
anyone else. (This is a skill he has not lost. Ask anyone who saw
his marathon performance as Oedipus in Dare Clubb's four-hour Off
Broadway reworking of the classic tale.) ``I remember the look of
awe on some of my classmates' faces as I went on and on and on and
on. That felt really good, to be special at something.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he pursued acting in college and then in graduate school,
he fretted over whether he was performing for the right reasons. At
the University of North Carolina, studying Western civilization was
hard, studying a performance piece was easy. ``Am I just into it
because it's the easiest route for me?'' he asked himself. ``Am I
doing this to keep regaining the attention that I needed at some
point in my life?''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he says, he concluded that acting ``was a way for me to
be expressive about life and also to make a living, and to feel
like I'm adding something to the community experience of life.''
</P>
<P>
   That last part was important to him. A friend since
fourth-grade, Rafe Bemporad, recalls Crudup as ``always incredibly
outgoing and clever and fun to be with.'' But Bemporad, whose
father is a rabbi, also recalls his friend at the Bemporad dinner
table, taking part in discussions of ``political issues or current
events or just ideas and expectations for our own lives, and how to
be human beings in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bemporad continued: ``It was an upbringing where we were talking
about community life as much as about the latest movie. I remember
one discussion about why you go to school: Was it to make a living
or to make a life? Billy chose his profession as a way of making a
life for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Van Lieu, who has taught acting at NYU since 1975, says that
the school encourages that kind of outlook. ``We train actors with
the idea that they belong to a larger community, that the artistic
choices they make make a statement,'' he says. Crudup's social
concerns and natural empathy, he says, helped him fit easily into
the NYU culture. ``He was truly, deeply concerned about being the
most responsible actor he could be,'' Van Lieu says.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Crudup recalls his three years at NYU as heaven:
``You took classes from 10 to 5, you rehearsed in the evenings from
7 to 10, you did performances on the weekend, all the time,'' he
says. ``I didn't want to leave.'' Indeed, his conversation leads
you to believe that if it were possible, he would think about
acting, talk about acting, work on his acting, 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   He would talk about why plays, which he has been regularly
squeezing into his film schedule, are more fun than movies: ``The
feeling you get from theater work is much more palpable _ you have
that to go home with each night. There's the cathartic effect of
starting and completing something each night. When you do film, at
the end of the day there's always a sort of emptiness, because your
performance hasn't ended. It's lingering, and everything you did
today you won't do again, so you can't learn from it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He would talk about the pitfalls of being in demand as an actor:
``When you get to a certain point, you get offered things that
you're not right for. And you have to be careful. You may want to
do it because it's a great exercise for you. But I don't think
taking jobs as exercises is such a great thing. Take a class. Don't
subject everybody to your exercises.''
</P>
<P>
   He would talk about the difference between spontaneity and
technique: ``The artistry of spontaneity is sort of lost on me _
people who just come in and do it once and it's brilliant, but ask
them to do it again and you don't know if they will. Creating a
truly rich layered moment that appears as though it happened just
once, and would never happen again _ that's what I'm most
interested in. Especially when you do it again. I'm much better at
learning than I am at spontaneously erupting with brilliance.''
</P>
<P>
   And even when you asked about his personal life, he would talk
about acting: ``If you're primarily interested in convincing
somebody for a short period of time that you're somebody else, the
more they know about you, the harder it becomes.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his reticence, there are a few facts on the record:
childhood moves from Long Island to Texas to Florida, and the
wrench of watching his parents' marriage fall apart not once but
twice. An older brother, a younger brother and a long-term
relationship with Mary-Louise Parker, whom he met when they were
both cast in ``Bus Stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Josephine R. Abady, who directed the play, says she was taken by
the combination of danger and sweetness in Crudup's acting. ``Part
of his skill is inhabiting the character to the point where you
don't realize it's a performance,'' she says. ``It's not
pyrotechnics: You notice the performance, you forget about the
actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon also remarks on Crudup's ability to submerge himself in
the roles he plays. ``In everything he does, he moves differently,
he talks differently, he holds his body differently,'' he says.
``And it's so casual, it looks as if they just found this guy and
he's really right for this part.''
</P>
<P>
   To Crudup, that's what the job entails. ``I don't want my own
personality to become the role,'' he says. And he relates an
anecdote about his preparation for the role of Steve Prefontaine,
the University of Oregon track star who died in a 1975 car crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working with the dialect coach,'' Crudup recalls, ``and
after a little while, he said, `You're not planning on doing an
impersonation of him, are you?' And I thought, `Well, that's kind
of exactly what I'm planning: I'm planning on being him _ speaking
like him and moving like him and thinking like him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So accurately did Crudup approximate Prefontaine's physical
characteristics that the film's director, Robert Towne, intercut
documentary footage of Prefontaine running at the 1972 Munich
Olympics with footage of Crudup pretending to do the same. And the
smile you get when you tell Crudup that the trick was undetectable
tells you everything you need to know about what makes him happy.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings him back to the fame thing. He describes with wry
detachment his reaction to an interviewer who ``was lamenting for
me the fact that nobody had seen a lot of my movies.'' But, Crudup
said, ``I was very proud and pleased with these movies. And the
idea that I could see them as successful was sort of ludicrous to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he does recognize that part of his job is
connecting with a public. And he relishes that as much as he enjoys
the analysis of a script and the building of a character. ``It's
not fun to be gawked at, or to be appreciated for being famous,''
he says. ``But it is a thrill to be appreciated for your work.'' He
motions outside the window of the restaurant. ``Not a lot of people
go up to the Con Ed guy out there, no matter how good a job he does
giving you electricity, to say, `Listen, what you're doing is
really helping me with my life, and I want to tell you that I
appreciate it.' As an actor, you get told that. Frequently.''
</P>
<P>
   As he leaves, the Con Ed worker Crudup had taken notice of takes
no notice of him. Will ``Waking the Dead'' change that, finally?
Will his next movie, ``Jesus' Son,'' which opens this summer? Or
will he remain, in Gordon's phrase, ``a character actor in a
leading man's body''?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I want him to become a big star more than he does,''
Gordon says. ``There's a Zen quality about him. You get the sense
that he's not walking through life wanting things he can't get.''

WHICH ONE'S AUDREY, AND WHY IT MATTERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 19) 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TV-HEWITT-HEPBURN) 
(af) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ For an actress who epitomized American cool, Audrey
Hepburn is inspiring a lot of nervous sweat. In life, her fragile
beauty and elegantly pared-down fashion sense made her one of the
most distinctive, most admired stars on the Hollywood screen. And
that is precisely the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very protective of Audrey Hepburn,'' said Susan
Lyne, executive vice president for movies and mini-series at ABC,
which will broadcast ``The Audrey Hepburn Story'' this month.
``They worry that someone will come along and try to besmirch her
reputation. It's not like doing the Marilyn Monroe story where
people are salaciously interested in every misstep she took.''
</P>
<P>
   The drama, starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, will be shown on
Monday, March 27, one day after the Academy Awards. The timing is
no coincidence. Executives hope that the annual love affair with
Hollywood glamour will create an audience keen to relive the
Hepburn story, and starry-eyed enough to accept Hewitt, a former
television teen queen, as a reasonable fascimile of the poised and
sophisticated Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   For the 21-year-old Hewitt _ beloved of teen-agers in the Fox
drama ``Party of Five'' and now the star of a spinoff, ``Time of
Your Life'' _ the decision to star in the film is a risky one, and
the network is plainly concerned that critics will be merciless.
</P>
<P>
   The last time anyone tried to step into Audrey Hepburn's famous
Ferragamo flats, the result was the disastrous 1995 remake of
``Sabrina,'' from which Julia Ormond's career has still not
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   From another perspective, though, the decision by ABC to proceed
with the movie and accept potentially stinging criticism is a
measure of the desperation at the networks for something _
(italics)anything(end italics) _ to halt the hemorrhaging of
audiences to cable and the Internet. They are increasingly willing
to risk crass and shallow programming, the recent vow by the Fox
chairman to swear off ``exploitative material'' notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, for instance, CBS presented ``Perfect Murder,
Perfect Town,'' a drama based on the JonBenet Ramsey murder case,
and late last year NBC offered up an embarrassing ``Mary and
Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans need not worry that ``The Audrey Hepburn Story'' will
detract from their memories of the star. The movie, which
chronicles the actress' childhood and career up to the age of 32,
is in fact gentle. And it has a surprisingly strong pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was written by the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright
Marsha Norman. An executive producer, Robert Greenwald, is one of
the most respected producers in television, with a track record
that includes Emmy Award-winning dramas like ``The Burning Bed''
and ``A Woman of Independent Means.'' The director, Steve Robman,
came to television from Yale Drama School and New York and regional
theater.
</P>
<P>
   But the force behind the project was the determined Hewitt _
everyone calls her ``Love'' _ who has been obsessed with Hepburn
ever since she saw a video of ``Breakfast at Tiffany's'' when she
was 7 or 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother showed me `Breakfast at Tiffany's' and told me to
take some pointers from Audrey Hepburn,'' Hewitt said, ``and I've
never been the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt spoke candidly. ``I'm absolutely scared to death about
playing her,'' she said. ``Two weeks before filming, I was in
tears. I told my mom I didn't know if I could do it. I knew the
press would not say kind things about me. I thought I wasn't pretty
enough. I thought I wasn't talented enough. My mom looked at me and
said, `If that's your decision, OK But think of the three things
Audrey Hepburn was most afraid of: that she wasn't pretty enough,
wasn't talented enough and what people would say about her.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I did it. I'm proud of it, and I'm proud of the fact that
it was something I was terrified of doing but did anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The project was the result of a serendipitous meeting between
Hewitt and Kimberly Rubin, who had worked with Greenwald. ``At the
end of the meeting we were kind of chatting,'' Hewitt recalled,
``and I said that my dream project was to play Audrey Hepburn one
day. She just stared at me. She said that for the last few years
her dream project was Audrey Hepburn.'' ABC quickly approved the
project because of Hewitt's commitment to it. ( Rubin is an
executive producer of the movie.)
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald said that Hewitt's adoration for Hepburn informed the
film. The actress worked with a dialogue coach for months to
perfect the Hepburn accent, and she watched Hepburn films over and
over. ``There's an innocence that she brings to it,'' Greenwald
said. ``There's no cynicism, no wink of the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is, if not a valentine, then certainly an homage to an
actress who was, in the words of the critic David Thomson, a
``fairy queen'' in Hollywood in the 1950s and 1960s. The story
traces Hepburn's life from her difficult childhood in Holland
during the German occupation of World War II through her days as a
dancer on the London stage to her success on Broadway in ``Gigi''
and stardom in ``Roman Holiday,'' ``Sabrina'' and in her signature
role as Holly Golightly in ``Breakfast at Tiffany's'' in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a life that had a lot of inherent conflict,''
Norman said. ``How do you make a story out of that? I think we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The story ends in 1961. ``Once she got to `Breakfast at
Tiffany's,' her transformation from ugly duckling, which she felt
she was, to this kind of princess was complete,'' Norman explained.
``I didn't feel we needed to see the rest of it. The question of
how she became Audrey Hepburn was the thing to see, not how do you
go on being Audrey Hepburn.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Hepburn was no saint, but her life was not bedeviled
by the demons that afflicted, say, Monroe or Ava Gardner. The film
dwells on some painful chapters but skirts others.
</P>
<P>
   Her father (played by Keir Dullea), who was estranged from her
mother (Frances Fisher), was a Nazi lobbyist in England. As an
adult, Hepburn had two unhappy marriages, the first to the actor
Mel Ferrer, the second to Dr. Andrea Dotti, an Italian psychiatrist
and socialite. (She had a son from each marriage.)
</P>
<P>
   She had affairs with several actors, including a difficult one
with William Holden, who was married and an alcoholic. There are
intimations that she may have had an eating disorder. In short, her
life was, for a movie star, perfectly normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried hard to show the adversity this woman lived through,
especially during the war when she nearly died of malnutrition,''
Robman said. ``One has to assume her father was a great source of
turmoil. But there was no terrible dark secret or hidden tragic
mystery here that will rip the image of Audrey Hepburn to shreds.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress died of cancer in 1963 at the age of 64, having
spent the last years of her life working for the United Nations
Children's Fund, often visiting refugee camps in Africa and Asia.
``The fact that she ended up giving back to children, trying to
rescue children the way she was rescued as a child, seemed very
natural to her,'' Norman said. ``It was totally in character.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the aura of her good works, Hepburn is defined for many
fans by her sense of style. Renee April, who designed the costumes
for the movie, said she was not allowed to directly copy the
outfits that Hubert de Givenchy created for Hepburn and for films
like ``Sabrina'' and ``Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' but she tried to
imitate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audrey knew her flaws and her good features,'' April said.
``Her body did not change. She had the same measurements at 60 that
she had at 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt shares some physical similarities with Hepburn. ``She has
that same swan neck,'' April said, ``and she carries herself with a
lot of grace.'' In other respects, the resemblance is more of a
stretch. ``She's shorter, she's bustier,'' April said, laughing.
``She has a tiny waist, but she comes more in curves.''
</P>
<P>
   April, too, was intimidated by Hepburn. ``Who wouldn't be
intimidated?'' she said. ``We were dealing with Audrey Hepburn.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the pitfalls of taking on the film are never far from
the filmmakers' minds. ``To Jennifer Love Hewitt's credit,'' Robman
said, ``when we talked about the fact that it was a dangerous road
to tread, she said that no matter what kind of performance she
gives, there'll be criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Audrey Hepburn was such an important part of her growing up
that she wanted to pay homage to her as best she could,'' he said.
``I thought, if this young woman is as brave as that, I have to be
at least as brave.''
</P>
<P>
   The intrepid Hewitt said: ``I tried not to think of career.
You've got to do some things from the heart. You've got to do
things that challenge you to be better.''

 &HT;    Bush needs more money for White House bid
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He vanquished his chief Republican rival after
transforming into a ``Reformer with Results.'' Now, Gov. George W.
Bush could use some cash.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly down to $6 million from a dizzying $70 million in
contributions, Bush kicks off a series of fund-raisers tonight in
the Republican stronghold of DuPage County, Ill. He is scheduled to
attend a $1,000-a-person reception at the Cantigny War Museum, in
Wheaton.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is also planning at least a dozen upcoming events
in, among other places, Florida, Arkansas, New Jersey, New York
City and Baltimore. Michael Dell, chief executive officer of Dell
Computers, will host a New York event on April 6, part of the Bush
team's plan to go after high-tech money. Four days later, former
President Bush is set to attend a fund-raising event in Puerto
Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokesman Scott McClellan wouldn't say how much cash
Bush has on hand. Through Jan. 31st, McClellan said the campaign
spent $13.1 million on television and radio advertising, including
in South Carolina where Bush's protracted primary fight with
Arizona Sen. John McCain reached its crescendo in an intense and
bitter ad blitz. The next legally required finance disclosure
report, due Monday, will reflect media spending in major states
such as New York and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll release the numbers Monday when the report is filed,''
McClellan said. ``The goal is to raise $5 million to $10 million by
the end of April ... We're going to have plenty of resources to
continue spreading the governor's compassionate conservative agenda
... Our supporters are energized and enthusiastic and we are
building upon our broad-based support.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Austin American-Statesman Bush declined
to confirm reports that campaign finance chairman Donald Evans will
soon move to the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could be. Could be,'' Bush said. ``There are ways to work
together and I want to make sure it's in a way that doesn't disrupt
the RNC and, at the same time, allows us to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush wrapped up the Republican nomination fight Tuesday with a
string of primary victories, including Texas and Florida. Now, Bush
and Vice President Al Gore are rattling tin cups even as they
tussle over who should inherit McCain's reformer mantle. Gore held
campaign fund-raising events Tuesday in Tennessee and Wednesday in
Philadelphia. And the two camps continued trading shots over
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he accepted the challenge to ban soft money he could take a
little break,'' Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway said of Bush's
fundraising schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bush campaign released an e-mail that Bush wrote
to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``... I challenge you to clear the air on some serious
charges,'' Bush wrote, referring to a 1996 Democratic fund-raising
scandal. ``I hope you will encourage the White House and the
Department of Justice to release all records and photographs
relating to fundraising abuses by you and your administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The note was written in response to an e-mail Gore sent to Bush.
In his note, Gore pledged to ask the Democratic National Committee
to run issue ads bankrolled with soft money only if the Republican
Party chooses to.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has called for banning lobbyist contributions to members of
Congress while Congress is in session, raising the limit on
individual contributions and preventing unions from using members'
dues for political contributions without members' permission.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Gore, Bush is not calling for a ban on soft money _ the
funds that flow from corporations and labor unions to political
parties and are not subject to federal contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign on Wednesday also released a list of overnight
guests at the Texas Governor's Mansion in response to a report by
the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity. The analysis of
overnight guests from January1995 to February 2000 shows that 60
have given and raised more than $2.2 million for Bush. At least 15
are members of Bush's fundraising team of ``Pioneers'' _ the
campaign's name for people who have raised $100,000 or more.

ACTIVE PROBE OF FATAL CANCER OVERDOSE CASE ENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Massachusetts board that regulates nurses has
dropped controversial charges against two Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute nurses involved in a notorious 1994 chemotherapy overdose
episode in late 1994, while reprimanding one other nurse for her
role in the affair.
</P>
<P>
   The action, announced Wednesday, the day public hearings on the
charges were to begin, brings to 16 the number of Dana-Farber
nurses who have accepted state reprimands or probation for their
role in the chemotherapy mistake. The board's decision closes the
books on disciplinary proceedings that have sparked considerable
criticism among nurses nationally.
</P>
<P>
   However, a nursing board official said there are still pending
complaints on seven additional Dana-Farber nurses who did not
directly administer or monitor the erroneous chemotherapy but
allegedly played some unspecified role in the affair. The board
will investigate those cases and decide whether to proceed or drop
them in the next weeks, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The nursing board's actions grew out of a medical error in a
Dana-Farber chemotherapy experiment that killed one breast cancer
patient, 39-year-old Boston Globe health columnist Betsy A. Lehman,
and severely injured another, a 53-year-old North Andover
schoolteacher, Maureen Bateman.
</P>
<P>
   The Dana-Farber overdoses are widely cited as a seminal event in
the nation's newfound recognition of preventable medical errors,
which a federal panel last December said kill from 44,000 to 98,000
Americans annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a sea change in ideas about medical error since
Betsy's death, and it was her death and subsequent events that
triggered it,'' said Robert Distel, a Dana-Farber scientist who was
Betsy Lehman's husband. ``I want Betsy to be remembered, because it
was Betsy's bravery and who she was that was a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana-Farber and many institutions have made changes designed to
catch medication errors. But there is still considerable debate
about the degree that individual professionals should be held
accountable when preventable errors occur.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David G. Nathan, Dana-Farber's president, and Susan Grant,
the institution's chief of nursing, said in a statement that the
board's charges were ``inappropriate and unwarranted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been easy for these nurses to have walked away
from their profession, and their patients, in frustration under the
pressure of the board's unnecessary action,'' they said. ``But they
didn't, and we are proud that more than five years later most are
still part of our service.''
</P>
<P>
   The two exonerated nurses, Ilene Galinsky and Susan
Coggeshall-Aikey, said in a statement that the accusations against
them were unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be accused as we were by the board hurts deeply and sends
an incorrect message to nurses everywhere,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse Maura A. Murray agreed to a formal reprimand and extra
training in chemotherapy administration, as 13 other Dana-Farber
nurses have also done. Two Dana-Farber nurses accepted a year's
probation in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction between Galinsky and Coggeshall-Aikey and the
other 16 nurses, a nursing board official said, is that the two
exonerated nurses monitored the chemotherapy infusion rather than
administered it, and had each been involved with only one of the
patients on the initial day of the overdose, which occurred over a
four-day period for each patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expert witnesses lined up for the hearing said this
initial dose was very large, but it was a dose known to have been
administered as one-time dose in other protocols,'' said Theresa M.
Bonanno, the nursing board's executive director. ``So their index
of suspicion that this was a problematic dose was lower.''
</P>
<P>
   The nursing board charged that the Dana-Farber nurses should
have checked to be sure the high chemotherapy dose, incorrectly
written by a trainee physician, was correct. But the nurses
maintained that they had followed the board's own standard, which
their attorney Wednesday said required them to follow a ``valid
doctor's prescription.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``valid prescription,'' said attorney Frank Reardon, is ``an
appropriate order in compliance with what other patients in similar
situations might receive.'' Reardon said the nurses had lined up
two expert witnesses to testify in the hearing that had been
scheduled for Thursday. Dana-Farber medical personnel were also set
to defend the nurses.
</P>
<P>
   Sara T. Fry, a professor of nursing ethics at Boston College,
said the Dana-Farber case has underscored a problem many nurses
face these days _ how to render safe care when they feel that they
lack support services from the institutions in which they work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all nurses should be held accountable for what they
give to the patient _ what they do and do not do,'' Fry said.
``That's part of their legal and moral responsibility. But the
institution has responsibility to make sure support systems are in
place. In this case, it looked like the nurses were the last ones
in the chain and everything else failed.''

 By JEFF MacGREGOR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In those ancient days long before the earth had cooled, when the
mighty pterodactyl still ruled the darkling skies, I took my first
job in television news. This was 1975, the early Polyester Period
of the Cenozoic Era, and the only thing wider than the bright
horizon on which I projected my youthful ambitions was the tie I
wore to work.
</P>
<P>
   It was an age of great social and technological upheaval:
American women abandoned the spiritual impoverishment of the home
for the spiritual impoverishment of the workplace, and, in
response, men began using hair dryers and wearing platform saddle
shoes. Microwave ovens delivered bad popcorn in only half the time.
Back in Minnesota, we recorded and reported these events with all
due dispatch and the appropriate gravity.
</P>
<P>
   That year, technology also brought the widespread use of
videotape to television news gathering. Film was laborious and
expensive, so we welcomed the convenience and speed of videotape.
We were warned by factory representatives, however, of a serious
concern with the new medium. ``Generational deterioration,'' they
would solemnly intone, speaking directly into the tabletop, bent
double by the weight of neckwear the size of lobster bibs, ``is a
real problem.'' Unable to nod, we could only murmur our agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Generational deterioration describes what happens when you make
copies of copies of copies, an effect common in videotape (and the
genealogy of Europe's royal families). By the fourth or fifth
generation the loss of quality is obvious, and one is left with
only a dim facsimile, a blurred and colorless rendering of the
original.
</P>
<P>
   A similar phenomenon can be observed in its proper laboratory
setting on March 27 when the ubiquitous ingenue Jennifer Love
Hewitt essays the title role in the television biopic ``The Audrey
Hepburn Story.'' While Hewitt's charms are considerable, and her
various talents have been corroborated by an astonishing number of
teen-zine cover stories, the portrayal by a popular young actress
of a show business original like a Hepburn, any Hepburn, can only
result in lopsided comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to me that the outcome of viewing something like this
will be to increase our longing for the genuine article at the
expense of our regard for the woman playing her.
</P>
<P>
   That fans of ``Roman Holiday'' and ``Breakfast at Tiffany's''
greeted the news of this project with barnyard snorts and
eye-rolling of a magnitude unseen since the heyday of Snub Pollard
is not a direct attack on Hewitt. Miscast or not, she will do her
best, I am sure, and the movie, like most movies, will be promptly
forgotten in any case. What seems to gall people is the potential
damage that might be done to their memories, however imprecise, of
Audrey Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something else at work here, too. Fueling that
upset is perhaps the broader exasperation we feel at the explosive
growth of ``celebrity'' and the proportional shrinkage of old
school ``stardom'' that accompanies it; at the casual and
unapologetic devaluation of originality; and at the melancholy
xerography of most current entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Hepburn vs. Jennifer Love Hewitt competing for America's
affections is a fixed fight, certainly, but may be emblematic of a
much bigger problem. In trying so hard to earn a buck on the cusp
of the Intertainment Age, Hollywood seems to specialize now in
nothing so much as its own diminishment.
</P>
<P>
   Before it gave way to new technologies and economies in the
1950s, the old studio system thrived on the gradual assembly of
film legends. It could take years to build a John Wayne or a James
Stewart or an Audrey Hepburn. The Hollywood bosses of that feudal
era understood that what they manufactured was not movies but movie
stars.
</P>
<P>
   The time and money it took to make one was well spent, because
that kind of marquee appeal was a guarantee of moviegoing fannies
in the seats. It was a long-term investment, one in which both
parties benefited. The studios got their stars, at a price, and the
stars, while constrained by their ironclad contracts, usually
learned their craft with a schoolhouse rigor unimaginable today.
</P>
<P>
   If one looks at the kind of roles assumed by Errol Flynn or Joan
Crawford or Spencer Tracy, the breadth and variety of the material
they tried (or were forced to try) is stunning.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, Hollywood is engaged in the bulk manufacture of
celebrities _ interchangeable entertainment widgets. The face on
that magazine cover seems vaguely familiar and may belong to that
guy we saw in that movie that time but, then again, may belong to
that other guy in that other movie. That the company that owns the
movie also owns the magazine  &UR; and  &LR; the magazine show covering them
both makes for a closed economy wherein the importance of the
individual is superseded by the impersonal necessities of a
business done in volume.
</P>
<P>
   Hence a generation of actors like Ben Affleck or Jennifer Lopez
who are on magazine covers because they are in the movies and seem
to be in the movies only because they are on so many magazine
covers. Ben Affleck is, I am sure, a nice young man, and somebody
somewhere is determined to make him a celebrity if it kills him.
Who and why I cannot say. Happily, the likelihood of seeing him in
something like ``The Jimmy Stewart Story'' remains remote, at least
for the moment. The part may go to Vince Vaughn. Or that other guy.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of strangely anonymous celebrity, with its high-speed
turnover and confusing sub-identities, is not limited to film. In
the space of about a month last year, we witnessed the emergence of
Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson and Mandy
Moore.
</P>
<P>
   The music business has obviously perfected the genetic
engineering of blonde, sexpot teen-pop singers, and these are the
results. In the old days Madonna had to invent herself piecemeal by
invoking the ghost of Marilyn Monroe. These four sprang full grown
from the MTV laboratories and are virtually identical, right down
to the bare midriff and semisuggestive lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   I would challenge the scientists who created them to
differentiate them (or their songs) in a police lineup. Can't be
done.
</P>
<P>
   What is most awe-inspiring about the new age of show business
devolution, though, is its copy-to-copy-to-copy rapidity. More
channels than ever, with more time to fill with more ``content,''
means more derivative performers in more derivative formats than at
any time in history. Digital technology aside, a copy is a copy is
a copy, especially if there are more of them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Witness the current state of television, the great devolver. Who
among us can honestly keep the casts of ``Felicity,'' ``Popular''
and ``Dawson's Creek'' straight? And why, after all, should we
bother? Maybe because we've been booked to appear on ``Greed''!
</P>
<P>
   The big story of the last six months has been the triumphant
return of the quiz show. ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
breathed life into a form long thought dead by the experts. Based
on a British show of the same format, it has made an unlikely
prime-time colossus of Regis Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a manner befitting a stylish Cosa Nostra funeral
director, Philbin sits on the bridge of the starship Free
Enterprise, firing questions at chatty contestants and signing
their souvenir checks. In its Americanized production, the
questions are not very tough (if you got through junior high earth
science and have a subscription to People magazine, you can make
some real dough), and the appeal of the thing seems to lie in its
ready accessibility. It is now on the air 128 nights a week and
seems to muscle its way onto the schedule whenever it damn well
feels like it.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of waning generations, however, kicked in with the
subsequent rollout of NBC's counterweapon, ``Twenty One.'' Not only
is this a show trying to capitalize on the first-generation success
of ``Millionaire,'' it is likewise a pale descendant of one of
television's most (in)famous early hits.
</P>
<P>
   Dumbed down as though the whole thing had been poleaxed with the
stupid stick, it betrays the initial appeal of the original, which
was hard questions asked of sweating contestants in giant
soundproof saltshakers. Now the Q&AMP;A is remedial multiple choice,
the booths look air-conditioned and the only tension arises when
the M.C., Maury Povich, tries to crack a joke. He has all the comic
timing of a death row chaplain and is far better suited to his
talk-show day job supervising teen prostitute makeovers and
mouthing pieties about our failing family values.
</P>
<P>
   The original ``Twenty One'' may have been rigged, but at least
it was worth watching. NBC is learning this the hard way as the new
show's ratings travel quickly south.
</P>
<P>
   In the seat just ahead of it on that downbound bus is the
aforementioned ``Greed.'' A Fox show from top to bottom, it has
failed to catch fire, maybe because it stole only the elements from
``Millionaire'' that nobody liked: the music and the set. Or
perhaps the audience doesn't think that knowing the five most
popular sandwich spreads is worth a million bucks. If Fox knows how
to make lemons into chicken salad, though, next month we will all
be glued to the set watching ``Who Wants to Marry Chuck Woolery?''
</P>
<P>
   The CBS entry in the quiz show sweepstakes, ``Winning Lines,''
was dead on arrival. More complicated than the New York state tax
code, the entire show was taken up by Dick Clark's dogged
explanation of the rules. Thus ended, in a matter of weeks, the
explosive success cycle of prime-time game shows. Only Regis seems
destined to endure.
</P>
<P>
   What is remarkable about all this is not that network television
resorts to ripping off successful ideas from its competition or its
own past but that it can do it so quickly. It has long been
axiomatic that imitation is the sincerest form of television, but
this season we have witnessed a new achievement in the turnaround
time necessary to beat the life out of a defenseless idea.
</P>
<P>
   Television is history's most insistently derivative medium. Our
other major pop-cult industries, like film and music, depend on it
for the promotion and cross-pollination of their own derivatives.
The lookalike morning show books the lookalike actors who are on
the lookalike magazine covers plumping the lookalike movies that
start this Friday. The next day another actor another magazine
another movie. And the next. And the next.
</P>
<P>
   The rapidity with which these pale copies track past us
diminishes the value of each, including the ones that preceded
them, blurring and obscuring even the most authentic. In this way
we spiral into ever faster, more meaningless cycles of spin, sales
figures and cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Thus diminished and inured to sensation, we can easily forget
why we loved that generation of originals from long ago, from the
time before the world grew cold. But if in remembering, or trying
to remember, you decide to rent ``Roman Holiday'' or ``Breakfast at
Tiffany's'' as an act of defiance or absolution or faith, don't
forget to thank young Jennifer Love Hewitt for the inspiration.

LUNG CANCER TOP KILLER IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Lung cancer continues to kill more people in
Massachusetts than any other type of cancer, and the incidence of
the smoking-related disease is rising among women, according to the
state Department of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   Another cancer, melanoma, is increasing in both men and women,
the statistics reveal. Caused in part by excessive sun exposure in
susceptible people, the incidence of the often deadly skin cancer
rose by almost 21 percent in men and more than 13 percent in women
over four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Cancer Incidence and Mortality report from the state cancer
registry covers the period from 1993 to 1997, the most recent
available, and is based on reports from 83 hospitals in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Howard Koh, the state health commissioner, said Wednesday
the rise in melanoma in both sexes, as well as the lung cancer in
women, ``is striking and ironic, because these are two thoroughly
preventable cancers.'' The continued upturn in female lung cancer,
he added, ``is the tragic end result of targeting of women by the
tobacco industry'' in advertising cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The patterns of cancer in Massachusetts parallel national
trends, Koh said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   A turnaround in overall cancer mortality first observed a few
years ago continues, with cancer deaths dropping 6.4 percent in
Massachusetts during the four-year period.
</P>
<P>
   About 31,000 new cases of cancer are diagnosed in the
Commonwealth each year, and about 13,000 people die of the disease.
The report noted these trends:
</P>
<P>
   --An increase of 12.8 percent in lung cancer cases in women,
contrasted with a 5.7 percent decrease in males, among whom smoking
rates have been dropping for a number of years.
</P>
<P>
   --Melanoma increased in males by 20.9 percent and in females by
13.3 percent. Health authorities are emphasizing a ``safe sun
strategy'' by minimizing sun exposure and using sunblock and
protective clothing, said Koh.
</P>
<P>
   -- The rate of breast cancer rose slightly over the period, by
1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer registry figures have not been broken out by various
localities, so they don't provide any new information on the
elevated levels of breast cancer that are being studied in some
parts of the state, including Newton, Cape Cod, and in parts of the
Berkshires.
</P>
<P>
   --Prostate cancer, the leading non-skin cancer in males, showed
a slight decline.
</P>
<P>
   --Colorectal cancer dropped 7 percent in males and rose 1.5
percent in females.
</P>
<P>
   --Uterine cancer in women remained stable while bladder cancer
in men increased 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Among men, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, an immune system cancer,
increased almost 4 percent during the period.
</P>
<P>
   Koh said Massachusetts is one of six states that received
federal grants to create a statewide cancer control program that
will integrate efforts in cancer education and prevention and will
attempt to uncover environmental and genetic causes of cancer. As
part of the plan, the state will establish a Web site where people
will have access to a wide range of cancer information.

   RUSSIA: CHECHEN VILLAGE SEIZED

   Russian forces said they had seized the Chechen village of
Komsomolskoye and were searching the ruins for rebels. Hundreds of
Chechens captured the town on March 6, an embarrassing setback for
the Russian military, which had sought to trap the rebels in the
highlands. Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, the chief of the Russian general
staff, said the military was stepping up its efforts to capture or
kill rebel leaders.

   Ken Livingstone, the maverick Labor member of Parliament running
for mayor of London as an anti-establishment independent, agreed to
make a public apology to the Commons after the Standards and
Privileges Committee rebuked him for not declaring outside earnings
of $250,000 from lectures and journalism. The revelation comes at a
time when newspaper ads from Livingston, known as Red Ken, have
been appealing for donations to fund his populist campaign.

   A lawyer for Penguin Books and the author Deborah Lipstadt, who
are being sued for libel by the historian David Irving, called
Irving ``a right-wing extremist, a racist and a rabid anti-Semite''
in his closing argument in the High Court. Irving contends that
Lipstadt severely damaged his reputation in her book ``Denying the
Holocaust'' by painting him as a leading spokesman for Holocaust
denial. A ruling is expected next month.

 &HT;    HURRICANE FLOYD: SIX MONTHS LATER
 &HT;    ALL SIGNS POINT TO PRINCEVILLE
 &HT;    EDS. Second in a seven-part series
 &HT;    By Chad Eric Watt
 &HT;    and Eunice Moscoso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   PRINCEVILLE, N.C. _ In a strange fusion of history and
devastation, Princeville has become the most famous casualty of
Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   The Edgecombe County town, which was submerged in 23 feet of
water for two weeks, has inspired Congressional press conferences,
high-profile celebrity donations, hundreds of news stories, and an
executive order from President Clinton mandating a group of D.C.'s
most powerful officials to help rebuild the flood-ravaged
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``People hardly knew Princeville was there,'' said Rep. Eva
Clayton, D-N.C. ``Now, it's something the nation wants to preserve
because they see it as a part of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton and other lawmakers say all the attention on Princeville
has helped the entire state secure emergency aid. But flood victims
in other areas, including the Grifton and Belvoir communities in
Pitt County, say that their plight has been overshadowed by
Princeville's.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment surfaced in Belvoir last November when more than
500 volunteers from Washington came to help flood victims in
eastern North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Two buses of volunteers, organized by the Congressional Black
Caucus, mustered at the Belvoir Volunteer Fire Department to start
a day of cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought they were interested in helping us,''said Wendy
Brady, a Belvoir resident who has helped coordinate recovery
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But flood victims in Belvoir were upset that only a few
volunteers came to help, Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Smith, a spokesman for Clayton, said the resentment is
``unfortunate'' and that lawmakers are working to help every
community hurt by the flood.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the damage in Princeville was far more severe
than other towns and that it holds a unique place in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was Plymouth Rock or an area of rich cultural
identification of another group maybe others would be more
understanding of the attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Princeville, the oldest town in the country incorporated by
freed slaves and still populated mostly by their descendants,
became the focal point of media attention after last year's brutal
flood.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures and stories were compelling _ an entire community
swallowed by the Tar River, senior citizens reported missing,
caskets unearthed from Wilson Cemetery, where town founder Turner
Prince had rested in peace for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors placed casualties in the dozens.
</P>
<P>
   As waters receded, however, the real numbers emerged : no
deaths, except for the town itself, which barely had a pulse.
Nearly all of its 1,143 homes, 37 businesses and three churches
were heavily damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Political attention shortly followed as the Rev. Jesse Jackson
stood on the steps of the old town hall, clutched the town's
muddied flag and declared that Princeville would live again.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, the Congressional Black Caucus _ citing the
rich history of Princeville _ demanded a recovery strategy for
eastern North Carolina similar to the Marshall Plan, which provided
extensive aid for post-war reconstruction of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The pop musician formerly known as Prince donated $37,000 to the
town for building materials, citing the association of his own name
to Princeville.
</P>
<P>
   Other thought to be overlooked
</P>
<P>
   ``People do feel like they've gotten more publicity, help and
attention,'' said Billy Tarlton, a coordinator for church volunteer
efforts in Grifton.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything big still happens, it happens there, even though
the devastation was just as big and bad here.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady said that echoed sentiments expressed by Belvoir flood
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel like that (Princeville) shouldn't have been the
focal point,'' Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   The Belvoir community, which parallels the Tar River north and
west of Greenville, saw more than 100 homes hit by floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got plenty of people still trying to get back in
their homes,'' Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. and Faye Bullock returned to their Belvoir-area home in
early March. They fled to a nephew's home when more than 20 inches
of water filled their house.
</P>
<P>
   Church groups from Hillsboro and Virginia helped the couple in
their 60s dry out and rebuild their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this part of the road, we've got neighbors on both sides
who got help (from church groups),'' Mrs. Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   Cedar Grove United Methodist Church near Hillsboro has been the
conduit for much of the recovery work in Belvoir, Brady said.
Volunteers from that church arrived during the flooding to cook
meals. Now they are still helping with labor and providing money
for rebuilding supplies.
</P>
<P>
   In Grifton, a town of 2,307 people and 900 houses, about 400
houses were damaged in the flood. Churches and public buildings,
including the police station and fire department, were also gutted.
</P>
<P>
   But Grifton Town Manager Paul Spruill said that ``the town is
getting the resources it needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Eugene James, a Pitt County commissioner who was evacuated by
helicopter from his Belvoir home during the flooding, said relief
money could have been more evenly distributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of other areas were hit bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   James added that many people in Belvoir have received help, and
more is promised on the way from the U.S. Department of Agriculture
and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a lot of help and we're so grateful,'' he said.
``But you can't count on it until you've got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said the battle for emergency aid has been ``complicated
by the fact that we have so much red tape.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been frustrating in terms of seeing some progress, but
it has been reassuring that at least there are people willing to
work on the issue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton also said that she has come to the difficult realization
that ``at best we don't have enough money ... that the loss and the
devastation is greater than the resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Princeville, like other communities, is hoping for more aid.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Princeville Housing Authority received
$2.5 million in grants to rebuild public housing. The town has
applied for another $2.5 million to replace the Montessori School
there.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Princeville, a town of 2,152, has hired a recovery
manager and the Federal Emergency Management Agency has contracted
with a private, nonprofit redevelopment team to help the historic
town recover.
</P>
<P>
   The latest emergency aid package moving through Congress
includes a $1.5 million federal study on raising the dike that
protects Princeville from the Tar River. The money had been dropped
from a Republican plan, angering many people, including Clayton,
who called the omission ``unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   In further evidence of Princeville's increasing importance, the
motion to reinstate the money was not brought by a North Carolina
lawmaker but by the powerful chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's big time around here,'' Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most impressive political intervention for
Princeville came from the highest political office. President
Clinton _ by executive order _ created a task force earlier this
year to preserve and protect the historictown.
</P>
<P>
   The impressive group includes officials from 12 federal agencies
and members of the Cabinet including the secretaries of defense,
agriculture, commerce, labor, health and human services, housing
and urban development and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   While the president has shed light on Princeville's predicament,
flooded areas have also relied on lower-profile assistance from
church volunteers to help rebuild communities.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Bell and a group of students from the Baptist Student Union
at Carson-Newman College made their second trip to Grifton during
their spring break this week.
</P>
<P>
   The group came from Jefferson City, Tenn., to Grifton last fall
after the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see the need _ you look around and see total
devastation,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennesse group was helping Shelton Grady and his grandson
tear out carpets and walls from his flooded Water Street home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about as much help as I've got,'' he said. ``Thank God
they're helping me take this apart.''
</P>
<P>
   He was approved for a federal disaster loan but hasn't taken it.
He and his family have been living in a nearby apartment complex
while waiting for a chance to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   Blocks away from Grady's home, Mary and Walter Artis' house on
East Main Street in Grifton resembles a partially built new house,
with bare floors and dusty white drywall.
</P>
<P>
   Those walls and floors were put in by church volunteers as well.
The Artises said they received a small grant from the federal
government. They had to pay for the building materials to restore
their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people around here have been volunteers,'' Mrs. Artis
said. ``We've come a long way, and we've still got a long way to
go.''

 &HT;    Bhutto: Set `big agenda' in Pakistan
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It wasn't an easy decision for the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   And former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto could
understand why.
</P>
<P>
   As a believer in democracy, Bhutto was not surprised that the
American president would hesitate to include a visit to Pakistan in
his tour of South Asia next week. Since October, Pakistan has been
ruled by a military regime that has so far set no time table for
restoring democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as a Pakistani, I thought it was important'' that Clinton
visit, Bhutto said Tuesday. ``And as a South Asian I thought it was
important, and that is why I am glad the president is going to
Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to her country won't be long _ a mere five hours
after five days in India and one more in Bangladesh. But Bhutto,
46, said during a visit to Atlanta for a speech at Agnes Scott
College that she would like to suggest a ``heavy agenda'' for the
president during his stay.
</P>
<P>
   She hoped Clinton would engage in ``behind-the-doors diplomacy''
to help both India and Pakistan _ the newest members of the nuclear
weapons club _ manage their long, bitter dispute over the Himalayan
territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also hope that he would take the opportunity to persuade
Pakistan's military leadership to promote the democratization
process,'' said Bhutto, who twice served her country as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutto, who in 1988 became the first woman to head the
government of an Islamic state, said she had spoken with Clinton
last month about her views and had also written him a letter.
</P>
<P>
   She will not be accompanying the president during his travels,
however. Bhutto currently faces arrest on corruption charges if she
returns home, and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, is currently
jailed there.
</P>
<P>
   But Bhutto, daughter of the late Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto, continues to play a key role as leader of the opposition
Pakistan People's Party.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview before speaking at Agnes Scott, she offered a
detailed rebuttal of charges against her and said she had been
``convicted by a kangaroo court'' for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   She said her country badly needs ``an independent mechanism''
for handling corruption cases and that she would not hesitate to
have the facts of her case examined in that way.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in her political career, Bhutto spent nearly six years
either in prison or under detention for her democratic activism.
</P>
<P>
   Her current legal fight began during the regime of Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was overthrown in last year's military
coup. But Bhutto said Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's new
military ruler, had missed an opportunity for reforming
anti-corruption laws that are often politically applied. She said
she had hoped Musharraf would call all political parties together
and have them jointly create a process for prosecuting corruption
that would be applied with an even hand, ``so that tomorrow if you
are tried you don't turn around and say that it's persecution.''
Her own case aside, she took the current government to task for
failing to address many other issues that plague her nation,
including the need for restructuring the economy, defusing
terrorism and bringing the military budget into line with reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a great expectation when (Musharraf) took over that
he would move on a reformist agenda,'' Bhutto said, ``and there
were voices which said that popular government could not take
difficult decisions which a military dictator could.''
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf often ``says the right things,'' she said, but the
perception has grown that other military leaders limit his ability
to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan is a country which in the last 3 1/2 years has really
gone downwards in social indicators, economic indicators,'' Bhutto
said. ``And what makes it far more explosive is the fact that there
are important international issues like terrorism and
proliferation.''
</P>
<P>
   Removing the military from civilian institutions is key to
Pakistan's future, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our vast defense machinery was subsidized by the West,''
Bhutto said. ``The West wanted us to fight communism, and we wanted
to fight India. And so we allowed the West to subsidize our
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   But the world has changed since the end of the Cold War. ``And
we in Pakistan need to realize that the old ways won't do,'' Bhutto
said.
</P>
<P>
   She called for more steps to build confidence between the
nations in South Asia and to open up borders, both physically and
economically. She also said good behavior should be rewarded by
Marshall Plan-style programs to alleviate poverty in the region.
</P>
<P>
   There is growing evidence that the people of Pakistan are not
happy with the present government, Bhutto said. And that public
opinion _ along with the kind of pressure she hopes President
Clinton and other world leaders apply _ will be critical toward
bringing about a return to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at history, governments that are democratic don't
go to war,'' she said. ``It's the governments that are not
democratic that too often end up in conflicts. And I think there's
far too much at stake for the West to turn its back.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fossil bones of an animal no bigger than a shrew and weighing
less than an ounce have been identified as belonging to the
earliest known relative in the primate lineage that led to monkeys,
apes and humans.
</P>
<P>
   The animal lived 45 million years ago in a humid rain forest in
what is now China. It was probably nocturnal and solitary, and fed
on insects and fruit. If not careful in its usual place up in the
trees, this primate often wound up as an owl's midnight feast. In
fact, some of the bones in question may well have been regurgitated
by an owl after one such repast.
</P>
<P>
   The paleontologists who announced the discovery Wednesday said
the fossil animals, named Eosimias for ``dawn monkey,'' were the
best evidence yet for fixing the time and place of one of the more
fateful branchings in evolution. Eosimias appeared to be a
transitional figure when lower primates, known as prosimians, went
their separate way, developing into today's lemurs, lorises, bush
babies and tarsiers, while the diverging higher primates,
anthropoids, evolved into more prepossessing creatures, eventually
including human beings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the first unambiguous evidence that is able to bridge
the anatomical gap between lower and higher primates,'' said Dr.
Daniel L. Gebo, a paleontologist at Northern Illinois University in
DeKalb who was a member of the discovery team.
</P>
<P>
   A close examination of the tiny ankle and foot bones, some the
size of grains of rice, established that Eosimias is an extremely
primitive member of the anthropoid lineage, Gebo and other
scientists said. The shapes of the bones and structure of joints
showed that this fossil species was able to walk on all four limbs
on the tops of branches, much like living monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   The lower primates are not built to be quadrapedal walkers. They
cling to trees and leap from one to another. As anatomists can
readily see, the heel bones of prosimians are longer than those of
anthropoids, giving them leverage for their long leaps. All
primates, whether lower or higher, are distinguished from other
mammals by their larger brains, grasping hands and feet, nails
instead of claws and eyes in the front of the skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are glimpsing a part of the evolutionary tree of primates
that previously eluded paleontologists,'' said Dr. Christopher
Beard, a curator at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in
Pittsburgh who directed American participation in the
fossil-hunting expedition in China.
</P>
<P>
   An accumulation of discoveries has revealed many of the
evolutionary steps leading to the emergence of humans in Africa
more than 100,000 years ago. Genetic analysis shows that the human
line split off from the one leading to chimpanzees and apes about 5
million to 7 million years ago. And scatterings of fossils point to
the earliest primates of any kind appearing about 55 million years
ago, mainly in Asia. But when the two lines of primates diverged
had seemed to be lost in the wide gaps in the fossil record.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings were described in interviews and in separate
reports being published Thursday in Nature and the Journal of Human
Evolution. Other scientists on the team were Dr. Marian Dagosto of
Northwestern Medical School in Chicago and Dr. Tao Qi and Dr.
Jingwen Wang, both of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and
Paleoanthropology in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the discovery team and other scientists familiar with
the research said they were especially surprised by the specimen's
size, the length of a human thumb. It is the smallest primate ever
found, alive or extinct. The tiniest living primate, the one-ounce
mouse lemur from Madagascar, is twice as heavy as the smallest
Eosimias.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption written into all evolution textbooks was that the
transition to anthropoids was made by animals larger than the
prosimians. The Chinese collections included what may turn out to
be several distinct Eosimias species. One anthropoid specimen
weighed only half an ounce and several others weighed up to four
ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ross MacPhee, a paleontologist at the American Museum of
Natural History in New York City, said this was the most
astonishing aspect of the discovery. ``You would expect these early
anthropoids to be small, yes, but smaller than the smallest known
living prosimians?'' he said. ``That was absolutely
nonpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   The minute size and other primitive characteristics, Gebo said,
``probably means we're getting close to the transition between
higher and lower primates.''
</P>
<P>
   This was further evidence that, although the more immediate
human forebears arose in Africa, their earliest primate ancestors
appeared to come from Asia. Somehow primates then migrated to
Africa. MacPhee said the Euroasian origin of primates was now
generally accepted by scientists, ``thanks in part to Beard's
work,'' but ``why that should be is itself controversial now.''
</P>
<P>
   The early interpretations of Eosimia fossils also caused
rumblings of dispute among scientists. Until now, all that
scientists had to work with were a few tiny teeth and jaws,
excavated in 1994. Not everyone agreed with Beard and Gebo that the
fossils represented the oldest anthropoid. Some scientists doubted
that Eosimias was a primate at all. Teeth were fine, many
paleontologists said, but it would take more of the skeleton to
draw firm conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Working at two sites, one a quarry 100 miles west of Shanghai
and the other in Shanxi province along the Yellow River in central
China, the American-Chinese expedition was unable to find any
complete skeletons, but it found as many as 50 foot bones and many
other lower limb bones. Dagosto discovered the telltale heel bone
of the smallest Eosimias as she sifted through a cardboard box
filled with soil and rock from one of the sites.

   ``The most interesting aspect of these new foot bones is that
they represent a mosaic,'' Gebo said in a statement issued by his
university. ``They possess primitive lower-primate features as well
as several advanced or higher-primate characteristics.''

   No other fossil primate at such an early time, he added, ``has
this interesting combination.''

   KINMEN ISLAND, Taiwan _ Through the narrow maw of a concrete
bunker at the tip of this Nantucket-sized island it is easy to see
communist soldiers exercising on the beaches of mainland China a
mile away. Through a telescope, Chinese machine gun nests behind
rocks come into focus, as do mainland tourists waving back from
lookout stations on the far side.
</P>
<P>
   This heavily fortified patch of the Taiwan strait is the
equivalent of Korea's Demilitarized Zone and what was once the
Berlin Wall. Here more than anywhere the proximity of Taiwan to its
giant neighbor, and the potential for eventual reunification _ or
disastrous conflict _ is impossible to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   As Taiwan prepares to choose a new president this weekend,
voters on this Taiwan-controlled isle are resisting a final-days
surge toward Chen Shui-bian, the opposition candidate who until
recently openly advocated independence from the mainland. With
Beijing warning darkly of the consequences that such a vote would
bring, residents here do not want to once again become pawns in a
cross-straits game of chicken.
</P>
<P>
   China considers Taiwan a breakaway province, and has always
demanded that it resubmit to mainland rule and vowed to attack
Taiwan if it declared itself independent. In recent weeks, Beijing
has upped the drumbeat by showing off newly &UR;  &LR; purchased Russian
destroyers and threatening to invade if Taiwan as much as drags its
feet over reunification talks.
</P>
<P>
   With just two days left before the vote, China's military
menace, and the perceptibly growing arms race on both sides of the
Taiwan strait, have become the looming issues in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the China threat will be the
deciding factor at the polls Saturday. Many voters resent China's
leaders' telling them how to vote and ordering them to surrender to
negotiations or face attack.
</P>
<P>
   And _ except perhaps on Kinmen _ many are skeptical that China
can back up its military bluster. Although China's forces outnumber
Taiwan's 6-1, many strategic analysts question whether Beijing's
war machine is capable of conquering, or even rapidly neutralizing,
its well-equipped neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   It is also an open question whether a military assault would be
worth the cost to China. Any attack would forever alienate
Beijing's avowed ``brothers'' across the strait and make voluntary
reunification impossible. It would also spark global condemnation,
economic sanctions, and a possible confrontation with the United
States, which is pledged to defend Taiwan against assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price of an attack would be very high'' for China's
leaders, said Maj. Gen. Tyson Fu, director of strategic studies at
Taiwan's Armed Forces University, and a former member of the
intelligence bureau of the joint chiefs of staff. China's
``decision-makers are not idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji Wednesday issued a new
warning that those who doubt China's capacities should not
underestimate its determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``People making such calculations don't know about Chinese
history,'' he told reporters. ``The Chinese people are ready to
shed blood and scarifice their lives to defend the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
   Kinmen, once known as Quemoy, was long the staging ground for a
50-year hot-and-cold battle between Chinese nationalists on Taiwan
and communists on the mainland following the end of their civil war
in 1949. That year, nationalist troops repulsed a Red Army force
that attempted to invade the island.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, Mao Zedong's forces tried again, raining 57,000
artillery shells in two hours on this fragile outpost. Over 44
days, Beijing's forces fired half a million shells onto its 59
square miles of sand dunes, scrubby pines, and farmland in a
conflict that pushed the United States to send aircraft carriers
into the area, and China and the United States to the brink of war.
</P>
<P>
   In a bizarre deal that followed, China offered to shell on odd
days, while Taiwan shelled on even ones. Sunday was everyone's day
off. The surreal alternate-day battle continued through 20 years
and 970,000 shells, with artillery eventually replaced by
cannisters of propaganda leaflets and queer forms of Taiwanese
psychological warfare, including _ inexplicably _ see-through
underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has given up on such tactics. The enormous speakers that
once blasted nationalist propaganda across the waters have been
replaced with smaller ones that jingle with Taiwan pop songs and
fishing reports. And even those play at volumes too low to reach
China; deafening decibels have been abandoned to avoid disturbing
Kinmen's own residents.
</P>
<P>
   Modern weaponry means that Kinmen is no longer the obvious
target of a Chinese assault, nor an important focus of Taiwan's
defense effort. Military forces here have shrunk to one-fifth of
the high of 100,000 troops. Today, China could eschew sending
frogmen and artillery to Kinmen in favor of launching missiles
directly at cities 100 miles away on the main island of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when China test fired missiles as a intimidation tactic
during Taiwan's last presidential election, the mainland was
thought to have fewer than 75 short- to medium-range missiles, said
Parris Chang, former chairman of the national defense committee.
Today, Beijing is believed to have about 300 such missiles, and the
Pentagon predicts it could have 800 in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing announced last week a 13 percent increase in military
spending to a record $14.5 billion this year _ capping a decade of
a double-digit growth aimed at modernizing the 2.5 million-member
army. Actual spending is probably two to five times higher. China
has bought electronics, ships, and state-of-the-art equipment,
including missile-firing destroyers capable of evading the defenses
of US carrier fleets.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's strategists boast that China could force Taiwan to
heel by launching a coordinated airstrike to cripple air defenses,
airfields, and command, control, and communications centers within
45 minutes. Most of Taiwan's major targets _ cities, harbors and
airfields; economic targets such as oil refineries and steel mills;
political targets such as the presidential palace and legislature _
are on the west coast facing the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts here are skeptical, saying China is five to 10
years from being able to mount such a surgical strike. China's
missiles are not accurate, said Chang; they could aim for the
presidential palace and hit a nearby girls' school instead.
</P>
<P>
   And though China's air force greatly outnumbers Taiwan's,
Taipei's is considered far superior, with an edge in technology and
pilots that the mainland might not be able to match or surpass for
one to two decades. Taiwan's radar systems are also superior.
Beijing also lacks a transport fleet large enough to ferry a major
invasion force across the strait, even though Taiwan's own ships
and submarines are woefully outdated. But China probably could
impose a naval blockade.
</P>
<P>
   Key to maintaining Taiwan's current air superiority is US
willingness to supply it with advanced defense systems, such as
forthcoming third-generation Patriot anti-missile batteries and
warships fitted with Aegis anti-missile radar systems _ sales the
United States is debating because of Beijing's vehement opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Pentagon authorized Raytheon Corp. to sell 162
Hawk anti-aircraft missiles and upgraded air surveillance radar to
Taiwan, in a deal estimated to be worth $106 million. But in the
end, said Lin Yu-fang, a strategic analyst at Tamkang University,
the only thing that could save Taiwan from an all-out Chinese
assault would be direct US intervention, and few believe that
Taiwan can count on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people here do not believe the US would fight
face-to-face against (Beijing) to save Taiwan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, a pledge by the United States to
defend Taiwan, is ``a very vague promise,'' said Lin, military
affairs' adviser to James Soong, the candidate seen as most in
favor of eventual reunification with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, strategic adviser to opposition candidate Chen,
acknowledged Wednesday that Kinmen, Matsu, and other front-line
islands ``are not defendable.'' But he said China could have long
ago seized those islands and chose not to, to maintain the
proximity and psychological link between Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the 51,000 civilian residents and 20,000 soldiers on
Kinmen seem oddly blase about living within virtual spitting
distance of China, perhaps inured after decades of bombardment.
This isle of winding paths through tile-rooved farming villages has
a sleepy, holiday-camp feel to it. But the apparent thick-skinned
nonchalance of the residents hides their true feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's an attack (on Kinmen), it would be very difficult
for Taiwan alone to protect us,'' a 48-year-old who identified
himself as Mr. Hsu said sadly. ``Only if America protects us would
we have a chance.''

 &HT;    Company offering health care info to Web sites to add 30 workers
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Adam.com, which supplies health care information to
several popular Web sites, said it will add 30 jobs at its Atlanta
offices.
</P>
<P>
   The people hired likely will be writers, medical illustrators,
producers and product managers, said Bob Cramer, Adam.com's
39-year-old chief executive and co-founder. Adam.com employs 45
people in it's Atlanta location. A San Francisco office employs
about 8 people, down from 35 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Adam.com creates and licenses the information found in
illustrated medical encyclopedias and on health care Web sites. Its
information is used by more than 20 sites, including Yahoo,
Healtheon/WebMD and Excite. The mission of the San Francisco office
was to place the behind-the-scenes company in the forefront _ to
design a Web site people would visit to research health issues,
such as breast cancer and knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt to get taken seriously in the early days of e-health,
you had to have a portal,'' Cramer said. ``We felt our strength was
to be a content syndicator. We sort of pulled back from being a
destination and will focus on being more of a business to business
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Cramer said the company plans to invest more than $30 million to
develop more products. Adam.com's illustrated medical encyclopedia
costs about $250,000 per year to use. The company plans to
introduce between 15 and 20 more products over the 18 months,
Cramer said.

 &HT;    Atlanta apartment construction due for surge, consultant says
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Metro Atlanta apartment construction will surge this
year, surpassing 1999's performance by 33 percent. The area will
see the addition of 15,470 apartments this year, up from 11,567 in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The prediction comes from M/PF Research, a Dallas-based
apartment market data collector and consultant. The company
introduced itself to the Atlanta market Wednesday morning with an
extensive briefing session for the executives it hopes will be
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders, owners and developers heard company President Ron
Witten report that 1999 was a better year here than in many other
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-quarter occupancy in Atlanta was at 96 percent, up 1
percentage point from the same period in 1998. Employment growth
pushed the increase. Atlanta created 116,000 jobs in 1999, placing
the metro area second among the nation's top job generators. New
York ranked first.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for apartments continued apace, Witten said, even though
Atlanta remains one of the hottest single-family-house markets in
the country. The metro area absorbed nearly 14,000 new apartments
in 1999, a 68 percent jump over previous-year volume.Absorption is
a measure of new units occupied.
</P>
<P>
   Among the submarkets, the northeastern suburbs _ Gwinnett
County, Roswell/Alpharetta and east Cobb _ accounted for the
greatest growth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Midtown held its own with 810 new units coming over 1999.
In 2000, seven apartment communities with 1,100 units will be ready
by year-end. Chamblee, Brookhaven and northwest Atlanta also have
apartments in the pipeline. The largest of these will be the
478-unit monolith going in at the Preserve at Deerfield, by
Fairfield Property.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 surprise was that Decatur, increasingly popular and
pricey as a residential area, saw only one completion. That was the
380-unit Jefferson Square in Decatur, Witten said. But this year,
there will be an ``impressive surge,'' Witten said, because more
than 2,000 units are targeted for completion.
</P>
<P>
   In south Atlanta/south Fulton, only one new community of 248
units opened, in College Park.

<P>
   A 1998 concert in Philadelphia promoting alternative energy
featured James Taylor and Kenny Loggins and exhibits like a
``Veggie Van,'' a purple mobile home fueled by used french-fry oil.
The event's sponsor: GreenMountain.com, which markets electricity
from sources like solar power and wind energy.
</P>
<P>
   The company's chairman, Sam Wyly, still exhibits a flair for the
dramatic, though his latest effort _ a $2.5 million advertising
campaign that attacked the environmental record of Sen. John McCain
_ has raised questions about his tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charged that the ads, which praised the environmental
policies of George W. Bush as governor of Texas, were an unfair
attack on McCain because they appeared just before last week's
decisive Republican primaries. While Wyly and his brother Charles
are major contributors to Bush, the ads were sponsored by
``Republicans for Clean Air,'' a group recently formed by them.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has thrown a spotlight on Wyly, a 65-year-old
Dallas investor who until recently was little known outside Texas,
where he is part of a small circle of wealthy, politically
connected Republicans. A founder of Maverick Capital Ltd., a hedge
fund, he amassed an estimated $1 billion fortune in ventures as
diverse as oil drilling, mining, software, steak houses and
arts-and-crafts stores.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly, who has collar-length hair and an energetic twang to his
high-pitched voice, is relishing his moment, appearing on
television and granting interviews. Though he and his brother
Charles are among the Bush campaign's biggest contributors, he
insisted the ads were also an effort to promote his environmental
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a monomaniac with one goal,'' he said. ``Clean air from
clean energy.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also not a stranger to controversy. In 1979, Wyly settled
charges brought against him by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and he was criticized recently by the California Public
Employees Retirement System, one of the nation's largest pension
funds, which said that he and other Wyly family members had favored
themselves at the expense of shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an investment by Maverick Capital in
GreenMountain.com appears to be at odds with a past statement of a
top fund official that it would not get involved in Wyly family
enterprises because of potential conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Wyly can barely restrain himself when he talks about
the environment, an interest apparently ignited three years ago,
after he, his family members, Maverick Capital and others invested
$100 million in GreenMountain.com, which before a name change had
been a unit of a Vermont-based utility company. Previously, he
said, while he and his family had been large political donors to
Republican causes, he had never contributed to an environmental
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air is dirty because of the electricity monopolists,'' he
said excitedly. ``They have powerful money lobbyists.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that investment, the company has successfully lobbied
lawmakers in states like California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and
Texas to pass laws that deregulate energy markets by either
encouraging alternative energy use or requiring that a small
portion of the states' electricity pool come from nontraditional
sources. These include solar power, wind energy, and biomass, which
involves the burning of organic matter like wood. Depending on the
state, the percentage can run as high as 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   GreenMountain.com does not produce alternative energy but
markets such power to mostly residential customers who are willing
to pay a premium. In return, the company has said it will invest in
alternative energy to increase the power available from such
sources. It now has about 100,000 customers in California and
Pennsylvania, while the Texas statute does not take effect for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups have criticized the company for buying
energy from sources that, for all their environmental claims,
generate significant pollution. But the company has won the backing
of other groups, and some said Wyly had lobbied hard to promote
state and federal laws to deregulate energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been very aggressive in the market,'' said Scott Sklar,
executive director of the Solar Energy Industries Association of
America, a trade group. ``When deregulation takes root, Wyly is
going to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Wyly is apparently not banking on deregulation alone to make
money from GreenMountain. Last year, GreenMountain abruptly
withdrew an initial public stock offering that would have valued it
at over $3 billion, SEC filings show. At that price, the Wyly
family's stake would have been worth about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   GreenMountain.com, which markets its services over the Internet,
uses the ``.com'' because it wants to be valued by Wall Street as a
high-tech company rather an energy supplier. In the first quarter
of 1999, it lost $19.8 million on revenues of $4.1 million, SEC
filings show.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly said the stock offering was withdrawn because the
public-offering market was in a downturn.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Louisiana, Wyly had his first success in 1963 when
he founded University Computing, which operated a scientific
supercomputer in space borrowed from Southern Methodist University
and initially subsidized itself in part by doing jobs for the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly, a onetime head of Bonanza Steak Houses, a restaurant
chain, later helped found Sterling Software, a high-tech company,
which later spun off Sterling Commerce, a business-to-business
Internet company. He is also chairman of Michaels Stores, a
nationwide chain of arts-and-crafts supply shops.
</P>
<P>
   A few of Wyly's ventures failed, like Datran, a data
transmission company that sought to challenge AT&AMP;T. But last month,
Computer Associates International paid $4 billion to buy Sterling
Software, and SBC Communications, in a separate transaction,
purchased Sterling Commerce for $3.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Maverick Capital, which was founded in 1990 by Wyly and
his son, Evan, manages more than $4 billion in assets from 700
institutions, including university endowments.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 decision by the University of Texas Investment Management
Co., a group that manages assets for the school, to place some $96
million with Maverick has come under scrutiny by The Houston
Chronicle and other publications, which focused attention on the
possibility that the placement resulted from Wyly family
contributions to Bush. Bush, as well as officials of the school's
management group and Maverick, have denied such suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Wyly's business practices, however, have come under
fire. In 1979, he settled SEC charges that he made undisclosed
payments to associates to buy up company bonds as part of a plan to
stave off bankruptcy. He settled without acknowledging any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the California Public Employees Retirement System, or
Calpers, described Michaels Stores, at which Wyly serves as
chairman, as having some of the ``most egregious corporate
governance practices'' of any publicly traded company.

AUBUDON HITS SMALL SIZE OF HORSESHOE CRAB LIMIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BRAILE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ An Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission decision
last month to impose a 25 percent reduction on catches of the East
Coast horseshoe crab amounts to no cut at all, the National Audubon
Society contends. The group claims that Massachusetts, Connecticut,
New York, and other states inflated their catch numbers prior to
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Audubon this week informed Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci
in a letter that his state not only raised its numbers in advance
of the decision by the Commission's horseshoe crab management
board, but voted against a minimally protective 50 percent cut
proposed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission acknowledged the states raised their numbers, but
not because they were trying to avoid the reduction in catches. The
increases were based on new data the states collected and filed
last year, it said. And Massachusetts stands by its new catch
number as accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were the books cooked? No, that's not the case,'' said Bruce
Freeman, chairman of the horseshoe crab management board. ``It may
appear that way, but it certainly wasn't something contrived to
increase the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the peak of the crab season just weeks away, the
creature that has scoured the ocean floor of New England for 350
million years remains imperiled by rampant fishing, Audubon says.
The crabs are used as bait for eel and conch, which have become
popular in Europe and Asia. And a substance in crab blood is used
to detect bacteria in surgical implants and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew a cut was coming, and so they tried to manipulate
the numbers so that a cut would have no real effect on the status
of the fishery,'' said Perry Plumart, senior policy adviser at
Audubon. The group has sought cuts as high as 60 to 80 percent to
save the crabs. As is, the crabs ``are poised for a major
collapse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Doug Pizzi, a spokesman for the Massachusetts state
Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, said the state's revised
number reflects solid reporting that was then reviewed by
scientists and fishery managers for accuracy. ``It's the best data
we have, and we stand behind it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Horseshoe crabs thrived for hundreds of millions of years on the
East Coast, but a century of catches for fertilizer and livestock
virtually wiped them out by 1960. They rebounded, thanks to
conservation efforts. Red knots and other migratory birds gorge on
them in Delaware Bay for a few days in the spring, stopping en
route from their wintering grounds in South America to their
breeding grounds in the Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   But with the recent, soaring value of eel and conch, boatloads
of crabs are being caught off the New England coast and elsewhere,
at a time when the commission itself says it has no idea how large
the crab population is.

 UNDATED: traded company.

<P>
   In particular, Calpers pointed to decisions by directors of the
company's board, which it described as ``dominated by Wyly family''
interests, to award themselves and corporate executives overly
lucrative compensation packages and generous golden parachutes.
</P>
<P>
   Those directors also repriced their stock options to benefit
themselves during years when the company's stock was low, Calpers
found.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We find it difficult to accept that these actions are
representative of an independent board,'' said Charles P. Valdes,
chairman of Calpers' investment committee in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly said that in response to Calpers' concerns, Michaels Stores
had since appointed two independent directors. ``We have met with
Calpers,'' he said, ``and I think they are happy today with what we
are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Calpers, Brad Pacheco, said the pension fund was
pleased with the changes but still had questions about the
company's performance.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Wyly, his son, Evan, and his daughter, Lisa, as well as offshore
trusts whose beneficiaries are Wyly family members, also hold
stakes in GreenMountain.com, SEC filings show. Those documents also
show that Maverick Capital invested $15 million in
Greenmountain.com immediately before last year's planned stock
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing barred such an investment. But the move is striking,
given previous comments by Lee S. Ainslie III, a Maverick managing
partner, that it would not invest in a Wyly-controlled company.
Evan Wyly is the fund's other managing partner, said Sam Wyly, and
Wyly family investments make up about $400 million, or 10 percent,
of the fund's assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work very hard to maintain a degree of separation between
the entities,'' Ainslie told Barron's in 1996. ``For instance, we
never have and we never will be able to have any stake _ we being
Maverick _ in Sterling Software or Michaels Stores, just because
there's too much potential for conflict of interest.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ainslie said Maverick's investment in GreenMountain.com, which
first took place in 1997, was not at odds with his previous
comments because the energy concern is a private company.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no change to our policy of not making an
investment in public companies where we believe there is potential
for a conflict of interest that would result from nonpublic
information,'' said Ainslie, who added that he was in charge of the
fund's investments.
</P>
<P>
   SEC documents show that if the planned stock offering by
GreenMountain.com had gone forward, Maverick Capital would have
retained an 11 percent stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Maverick Capital also holds a 9 percent stake in Scottish
Annuity &AMP; Life Holdings, a publicly traded insurer based in the
Cayman Islands. Until last month, Wyly was chairman of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Ainslie said that at the time Maverick's investment was made,
Scottish Annuity was also a private company. SEC filings show that
a major investment by the fund was made one month before the
insurer's initial public stock offering in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly said he did not see any conflicts with Maverick Capital's
investment in GreenMountain.com. David Russ, managing director of
public markets for the University of Texas Management Investment
Co., said the group's guidelines did not bar Maverick from
investing in the energy company.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly said he had no immediate plans to pay for ads against Vice
President Al Gore during the general election, but Wyly he added
that he and another son, Andrew, a Dennison University student whom
he credits with the promotions against McCain, have kicked around
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   They would be built around the theme that Gore, whose
environmental record might appeal to some voters, was a
regulation-happy Democrat who would not be good for business or the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be green without being red,'' said Wyly, testing out a slogan
on a listener. ``Al Gore is an heir to the old czars and
commissars. He never saw a regulation he didn't like.''  &QL;

RANGERS ENVY OF BASEBALL WITH EFFECTIVE PAYROLL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ As the Baltimore Orioles venture about
Florida this spring, they travel with a large stigma. And no, that
doesn't necessarily mean Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   When the O's team bus rolls into a ballyard parking lot, the
reaction among baseball people will include some snickers and
whispers.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, I wasn't a personal witness to any of that yesterday as
the Rangers played host to Baltimore, but what goes without saying,
snickering or whispering is Doug Melvin would never want to be in
the Orioles shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The third-highest 1999 payroll in baseball ($84 million)
produced a grand total of 78 victories to finish 20 games behind
the Yankees in the American League East. And if you think not
keeping up with the $88 million invested by the Yankees isn't
exactly a disgrace, the Orioles were 16 games back of Boston for
the wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore provides a handy excuse for 29 other owners and 29
other general managers. If those parties are being grilled about a
lack of spending for talent, ``see,'' they will say, pointing to
the Orioles, ``it's not always about how high the payroll.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not always, but ...
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, of course, have had a hammerlock on the World
Series, one reason being money is no hindrance. But high-dollar
payrolls for Baltimore and the LA Dodgers (77 wins last season)
couldn't prevent sub-.500 seasons, and frankly, this kind of
malfunction has become, in today's game, the worst of front-office
blunders.
</P>
<P>
   Teams that play better than their payrolls would suggest _ the
Reds and Athletics were examples in 1999 _ have general managers
and managers hailed for their shrewdness in knowing payroll value.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, on the other hand, present a strange payroll
paradox this spring.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Melvin has what a vast majority of his
counterparts would gladly kill for _ a $66 million budget, which is
down from $75 million last season, but a generous owner who is
willing to take it back to 75 mil via any trade that might come
along.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Melvin's payroll structure is the envy of one and all. The
team's three best players are all signed for two years or beyond at
below-market value. Rafael Palmeiro is the highest at $9 million
this season, then comes Pudge Rodriguez at $8 million. The
third-best player on the team, Rusty Greer, is baseball's best
bargain at $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three at those salaries _ that's incredible,'' Toronto
manager Jim Fregosi was saying this week during a Charlotte County
Stadium stop. ``\RThe Rangers\S got that done only because all
three wanted to be in Texas. That kind of loyalty from that kind of
talent is also almost unheard of.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the payroll to do so, Melvin has thus far avoided one
fear _ having a player hit the $10 million or beyond mark in yearly
salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that day is coming,'' Melvin said yesterday, ``but
for 10 million, I've got to have a very special player, someone who
gives the numbers, of course, but also someone who brings
leadership and a community presence.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a Palmeiro-type, as opposed to the departed Juan
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, a year ago, the Rangers offered salaries beyond
the $10 million mark to free-agent pitchers Randy Johnson and Roger
Clemens. Both went elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two qualified as special cases,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   But while the payroll situation is very nicely proportioned,
most of the national preseason guesswork on the 2000 season has the
Rangers being a team in sharp decline. In general, they are mostly
being picked to drop to third in the AL West behind Seattle and
Oakland. ``USA Today'' had this club this week at a massive 50-to-1
to win the World Series. Those 95 victories from last season have
been quickly forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, no baseball-type in this camp believes a word of the
team-in-decline predictions. But should that stuff be correct, then
Melvin's butt quickly goes on the line, no matter his neat bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total balancing act that in the end must lead to
winning,'' Melvin said. ``We have been fortunate with players who
did want to be here, and they didn't put money over happiness. But
others have left or didn't come because more money was offered
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the game today. But I think we've come out ahead
in all areas with those who did choose to be with us at what is
probably now below their market value.''
</P>
<P>
   If Melvin wins with this plan, he'll be next winter's general
manager genius. If not? Well, it's still far too early to be
discussing such unpleasantries. \Ntagtop:Randy Galloway's ``Sports
at Six'' can be heard weeknights, 6-8 p.m., on WBAP NewsTalk 820.

 &HT;    CONGRESS FINDS NO IRS BIAS AGAINST AUDITED CONSERVATIVE GROUPS
 &HT;    660&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A long-awaited congressional study rejects
allegations by some conservative groups that they have been audited
by the Internal Revenue Service because they criticize President
Clinton or his policies.
</P>
<P>
   But the three-year investigation by the Joint Tax Committee
finds evidence that the White House may have improperly sought
information from the IRS about some tax-exempt groups.
</P>
<P>
   There is ``no credible evidence'' the tax-collecting agency was
biased against anti-Clinton groups, the report stated. The IRS had
also audited organizations that ``would be considered supportive of
the Clinton administration,'' said the 170-page report, a copy of
which was obtained by Cox Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional probe was a bipartisan response to allegations
of bias raised by several groups in 1996 after they were audited.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations include the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative research center, and the private watchdog group
Citizens Against Government Waste, both based in Washington, as
well as the Western Journalism Center in Fair Oaks, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Christian Coalition has sued the IRS, charging
it with unfairly rejecting its application for tax-exempt status
after a review process that took almost 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   While the report did not substantiate allegations that tax
audits were used as political weapons, it nonetheless faulted the
Clinton administration for evidence of two ``nonroutine'' contacts
made with IRS employees.
</P>
<P>
   Because of tight secrecy laws involving taxpayer information,
the Joint Tax Committee report avoids mentioning any group by name
but states that it reviewed the records of 83 non-profit
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, White House aides ``appear to have attempted to
obtain taxpayer return information'' that is protected by privacy
law. And in a second example, a Treasury Department official ``was
alleged to have made a 1995 inquiry to IRS employees'' about the
tax-exempt status of an organization under examination by the tax
agency, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These types of contacts lend credence to the allegations that
the administration does intervene in IRS matters pertaining to
specific taxpayers,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the study found that the Treasury Department inspector
general's office took no action on the 1995 incident until the
subject was raised two years later by the congressional staff
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Among other conclusions, the Joint Committee:
</P>
<P>
   _ Disclosed that tracing behavior at the IRS was difficult
because, prior to the middle of 1998, the agency had a practice of
destroying audit information once a decision was made not to pursue
an organization for back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Calculated that members of Congress made nearly 500 inquiries
to the IRS between 1994 and the middle of 1997. But as with the
White House, the report said that the lawmakers' contacts had
apparently not altered the way the IRS handled audits of tax-exempt
groups.
</P>
<P>
   _ Listed eight instances of ``alleged IRS employee misconduct''
relating to tax-exempt groups. Few details were offered, although
one case involved an allegation that an employee in the IRS chief
counsel's office improperly sought taxpayer information.
</P>
<P>
   _ Found no signs of political discrimination in granting
tax-exempt status, but it said that the IRS was ``unacceptably
slow'' in ruling on applications.
</P>
<P>
   _ Confirmed that some high-profile tax-exempt organizations and
individuals ``received intense internal review and scrutiny by the
IRS,'' but the staff again found no ``credible'' evidence that this
scrutiny was politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the IRS said the agency would have no response
until the report is formally released, possibly on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy referred a reporter to Vice
President Al Gore's office, which did not immediately return a
phone call Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Mark Levin, whose conservative Landmark Legal Foundation has
sued the IRS in this controversy, said he was shocked at some of
the findings, especially the information about documents being
routinely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Levin's group has sought to force the IRS to disclose which
lawmakers and which administration officials have sent inquiries to
the IRS. He has told the court that a witness alleges that that IRS
officials spoke of shredding documents he sought.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the Justice Department ``explained this rather
elaborate procedure that they followed to gather information,''
Levin said. ``At no point did they say that they were destroying
documents.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal district court in Washington last week rejected
Levin's attempts to force the IRS to disclose more information or
answer questions about documents. Levin said he is considering
further legal action.

SOFTWARE MILLIONAIRE PLANS TO FOUND FREE ONLINE UNIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 35-year-old software billionaire said Wednesday that he would
spend $100 million to realize his vision of 21st century higher
education: a giant free Web site that would provide access to what
he calls the ``10,000 greatest minds of our time,'' in lectures and
interviews recorded especially for the venture.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Saylor, the chief executive of Microstrategy, a
technology company in northern Virginia, said in an interview that
his goal was ``free education for everyone on earth, forever.'' And
he envisions his institution eventually granting degrees in
countless disciplines, based on final exams that would be
administered once a month in convention halls around the world,
with grading done by computer whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   Saylor is an unabashed self-promoter who rented the Washington
Redskins' stadium in January for a Super Bowl party for his
employees and friends. However, he is worth enough money on paper _
$11.7 billion at the close of stock trading Wednesday _ to make it
difficult to immediately dismiss his idea, however grandiose.
</P>
<P>
   Saylor's donation, which he intends to make in the form of cash
and stock to his foundation, comes at a time when almost every
American university is developing online offerings of its courses _
each one chipping away at the notion that a university must have
bricks and mortar and a physically present student body to be
effective.
</P>
<P>
   But with students at Saylor U. _ he actually hasn't come up with
a formal name, but says it will have ``dot-com'' in it _ requiring
nothing more than a computer to enroll, his effort would take
online education a step further, undermining a university's very
franchise in charging admission for access to knowledge and
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Saylor's spending plans would rank near the top of other online
efforts. A group of investors, including Michael Milken, the
dethroned junk-bond financier, says it will spend as much as $100
million to start an online, for-profit university called Unext,
which would feature course content from professors at the
University of Chicago and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   At his online university, Saylor imagines Bill Clinton teaching
politics, Warren Buffet lecturing on investing and Steven Spielberg
demonstrating filmmaking _ all in 30-hour video packages, with
questions anticipated, and answered, in advance. So far, he hasn't
recruited a single instructor, but he doesn't intend to pay them a
dime. He says they will be drawn to his television studio by the
opportunity to make their thoughts available to the world for
eternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a work in progress,'' a spokesman said Wednesday. ``It's
impossible to say in certitude what the details are.''
</P>
<P>
   Saylor, whose plan was first described in an article in
Wednesday's Washington Post, intends to announce his effort
formally at a business conference Thursday in Washington, D.C. But
his scheme was already reverberating through the halls of higher
education Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Ikenberry, the former president of the University of
Illinois, said he applauded Saylor's idealism but was concerned
that the lectures at Saylor's university would be, in effect,
canned.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe that higher education is simply content
mastery, then you can put that in a can,'' said Ikenberry, the
president of the American Council on Education, a non-profit
organization representing 1,800 colleges and universities. ``But
higher education is so much more than that. It involves judgment,
analysis, synthesis, communication, creativity and innovation,
which are the things that human beings do best.''
</P>
<P>
   Saylor embarked on his road to wealth while working at Dupont
soon after his graduation from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in the late 1980s. It was then that he and several
fraternity brothers started Microstrategy, a company that, before
long, had created software that McDonald's, Victoria's Secret and
K-Mart, among others, were using to tabulate detailed analyses of
sales and inventory.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sales last year were $200 million and, in a
decade, it has grown from four employees to nearly 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Saylor imagines that his company's future lies in a world where
the Jetsons would feel at home: personally-tailored information _
such as a disembodied voice reporting that a doctor's appointment
or flight has been canceled _ that would be broadcast directly to
people through their car radios and cellular phones, which would
then offer them an instant opportunity to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, at least, thinks it's hardly science fiction:
Microstrategy's stock has rocketed from $7 a share to nearly $300
in the span of less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his announcement was intended to draw as much attention
to himself as to his intentions, Saylor said he didn't think the
question was relevant, suggesting that Michelangelo's greatness was
not compromised because he signed his paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great way to combine self-interest and charitable
humanitarian activities,'' he said. ``Everyone wins.''

`BIG DIG' BILL COULD RISE EVEN HIGHER, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Acknowledging remaining construction contracts may cost
more than expected, ``Big Dig'' officials revealed Wednesday the
price tag of the highway project may climb to $12.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the Federal Highway Administration, the state
said a recently discovered $1.4 billion shortfall may actually
range between $1.3 and $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci, concerned that construction bids
continue to exceed estimates, said he instructed project managers
to build in a funding cushion just in case there are unforseen
problems in submerging Boston's Central Artery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a range in there at my request,'' Cellucci said. ``I
don't want to get into the same problems we've had.''
</P>
<P>
   The project cost, which was originally supposed to be $2.6
billion, has risen steadily since ground was broken in 1991 and may
now exceed $12.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The hot economy, with high demand for construction materials and
workers, continues to boost prices. Last month, every bid submitted
for one of the project's final contracts came in more than $22
million over budget, discouraging officials who are trying to hold
the line on spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Dig's report on the cost overrun -- and Cellucci's plan
to use borrowing and cash reserves to cover it -- were delivered to
the Federal Highway Administration's district office Wednesday to
meet a deadline imposed by US Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater.
</P>
<P>
   A federal task force, which includes a Washington auditing team,
will evaluate both documents from the state, along with their own
findings, and issue a report expected to be made public early
April.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Washington, including Bay State Congressman J. Joseph
Moakley, believed the governor should have submitted a more
complete financing report, one that had won the backing of
legislative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's plan has already been roundly panned by the
Legislature, and the final financing strategy is likely to be
dramatically different from what Cellucci proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate are likely to take up the issue next month.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Crockford, the massive project's chief of staff, played
down the revelation that the Central Artery price tag could reach
$12.5 billion. Crockford said the report -- validated by an outside
consulting firm -- was not meant to suggest that costs are sure to
climb. The state wants to err on the side of caution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've maintainted all along that $1.4 billion is a best
estimate and there should be a range,'' Crockford said. ``The point
is not to draw a line in the sand here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Dig document, an in-house financial outline that was
supposed to be submitted to federal highway officials in October,
was delayed because Massachusetts Turnpike Chairman James J.
Kerasiotes was in the midst of a ``top to bottom'' review of the
budget and put the report on hold.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Kerasiotes admitted the $1.4 billion budget gap
last month, triggering the audit and Wednesday's deadline to
explain the overrun.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his faith in Kerasiotes' budget numbers was flagging
and that is why he requested an overrun range be included in the
report, Cellucci hinted that may be the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have (Administration and Finance) Secretary (Andrew)
Natsios working with the Big Dig, double checking, triple checking
all the numbers,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also said the overrun should come in at $1.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But even if it doesn't, he has called for paying down
high-interest debt using surplus funds, a move that could save $600
million over 5 years, which could be enough to cover an additonal
budget gap. Those funds are in addition to his plan to use cash and
borrowing to pay for the $1.4 billion overrun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people to think that's what we're guaranteeing,''
he said of the $1.4 billion figure. ``When you're building
something under a 350-year-old city, we've already run into
construction problems. ... What I do know is that we're almost
two-thirds the way done and that's less exposure we have.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there are two final construction contracts that remain
to be bid this summer which could come in higher than budgeted due
to the hot economy and high fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   One is a $348 million job involving the Interstate 93 southbound
tunnel through Dewey Square and demolition of some of the elevated
artery.
</P>
<P>
   The other is a $144 million contract to finish the South Bay
interchange between I-93 and the Massachusetts Turnpike, along with
the restoration of Albany Street.

BRITAIN'S CHOCOLATE-COATED VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ After years of The Great Chocolate Debate, Europeans may
soon get to eat their British chocolate _ and its fat, too.
</P>
<P>
   The European Parliament lifted a ban on British chocolate
Wednesday, saying it can now be officially sold on the Continent
after more than a quarter of a century of arguments about its
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, those rare Continentals who craved Creme Eggs,
Maltesers and Cadbury's Flake Bars had been able to buy them _ but
not legally as ``chocolate.'' The typical British candy bar is made
with some vegetable fat in place of the expensive cocoa butter.
</P>
<P>
   But ever since the British joined the European Union in 1973,
chocolate purists, notably the Belgians, Dutch and Luxemburgers,
have insisted that European law recognize only chocolate made with
100 percent cocoa butter. What the British made, they sniffed,
could call itself ``vegelate.''
</P>
<P>
   What became known as the Two Chocolates Policy had corollaries,
including the Two Milk Chocolates Policy, based on the British and
Irish taste for as much as 25 percent milk in their milk chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   With the $15 billion European chocolate market at stake, the
British lobbied hard, and Wednesday the opposition finally gave in.
Bars made with up to 5 percent vegetable fats can legally be called
chocolate, as long as the substitute is from a short list: illipe,
shea, sal, kokum gurgi, mango kernel or palm oil.
</P>
<P>
   The British fared less well on the second issue _ their milkier
bars must be marked ``family milk chocolate.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote needs final approval at next week's meeting of European
heads of state in Lisbon, but that is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Paris, Robert Linxe, founder of the famous Maison du
Chocolat, called the decision ``terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks the quality,'' he said. ``It's money, always money.
I will never employ anything but pure cocoa butter, but others will
make it with fat and not mark it as fat, which is very bad. You
must not fool the client.''

 &HT;    $4 billion deal aims to capture wireless billing market
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A British software company has agreed to pay more than
$4 billion to buy LHS Group, a low-profile, but high-growth
Atlanta-based company.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which sent LHS Group stock soaring Wednesday, calls
for London-based Sema Group to give 2.6 of its shares in exchange
for each one held by an LHS shareholder. The agreement is meant to
create a powerhouse in the market for software used to calculate
bills for using wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   The combined companies would be the largest provider of wireless
billing software with nearly 40 percent of the market. Buying LHS
would let Sema leap-frog past Cap Gemini, currently the leading
European company in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Market share is key,'' said Pierre Bonelli, chief executive of
Sema. ``If you are looking for one motivation, that's the one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonelli said there would be ``relatively minimal'' job cuts
after the merger. ``Good people are hard to come by and what we
need is brains.''
</P>
<P>
   LHS officials in Atlanta were unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Cuccio, chief executive of LHS Group, told Bloomberg
News that the company now lacks the muscle to sell systems to the
biggest mobile phone companies. ``Sema gives us the power to
address the largest carriers.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is a relative newcomer to Atlanta, with its roots in
Europe. LHS was established in 1990 as a three-person operation in
Dietzenbach, Germany. The company started a subsidiary, LHS
Communications Systems, basing it in Atlanta to target service
providers in this hemisphere. Later that year, the company shifted
its corporate headquarters to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Company revenues were $200,000 in 1990. Last year's sales were
$263 million. The company has about 1,700 employees, but most are
in other offices throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   LHS customers include Bell Atlantic and Nextel. Sema clients
include Vodafone AirTouch. Chief competitors for LHS Group and Sema
are Amdocs of Missouri and Cincinnati-based Convergys Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement as announced would have been worth $4.7 billion,
providing a stunning 75 percent premium over the price of LHS Group
shares. But then Sema shares fell by about 15 percent,
substantially trimming value from the deal.
</P>
<P>
   When announced, the accord would have valued LHS at $69.70 per
share. By the end of trading Wednesday, the deal would provide $59
a share to LHS shareholders _ still a healthy premium over the
price before the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   LHS stock rose $12.37 1/2 to close Wednesday at $52 a share, a
52-week high. Shares in the company were as low as $22 in November.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Jason Bell of the Robinson-Humphrey Co. said the
companies are attacking a rapidly growing market. Revenues from
wireless services are expanding at a rate of more than 20 percent a
year. Even more robust is the demand for wireless data services,
which is growing at a 50 percent-a-year clip.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a really explosive market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson-Humphrey now rates the stock as neutral, although the
deal has clear benefits for those who were already LHS
shareholders, Bell said. ``We view this transaction as very
positive for shareholders of the LHS Group. The real question is,
long-term, what can the new combined entity deliver?''
</P>
<P>
   As much as demand for wireless is growing, the industry also is
in flux. The ``bundling'' of wireless bills along with those for
other telecommunications services helps to make for uncertain
predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Moore, a money manager at Gartmore Capital Management, told
Bloomberg News that he is uncertain about the prognosis for the
merged company. ``What investors need to look at is the return on
investment and the long-term strategic rationale for the deal,
which right now remains a slightly shrouded mystery.''

 &HT;    Time to crown a new Cinderella
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, in the film ``Caddyshack,'' Bill Murray
actually spoke with perfect clarity. ''It's a Cinderella story!''
he cried, meaning golf. But Murray easily could have been talking
hoops of the most heavenly kind.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Cinderella has become a frayed and overused cliche. No
matter. At least not in the grandest sporting event of all, the
NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, where Cinderella imagery is most
apt. So if the glass slipper fits, wear it. And every March it
does, and they do. Every March, some small school from a mid-major
conference springs a first-round, even a second-round, upset in the
NCAAs and turns a high-seed big-school stepsister ugly. You could
look it up.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gonzaga and Miami of Ohio, each seeded 10th, along
with Southwest Missouri State (12th) and Oklahoma (13th), all
reached the Sweet 16. Gonzaga advanced to the Elite Eight before
the clock struck midnight PST for the Zags in the West Regional
final.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 14th-seeded Richmond stunned No. 3 South Carolina,
while Valparaiso, a 13, won twice before heading home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 15th-seeded Coppin State and its coach named ''Fang''
made one-and-done out of second-seed South Carolina.
Tennessee-Chattanooga, a 14, upset Georgia and Illinois before
falling.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1996, 13th-seeded Princeton showed Jim Harrick's
defending national champion UCLA the back door in the first round,
43-41.
</P>
<P>
   And this year? Hey, it'll happen again. Always does. Probably
starting today, when the Midwest and West regions begin.
</P>
<P>
   Herewith, some Cinderella possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   St. Bonaventure. Fairy tales can come true, they can happen to
you, especially if you're a 12th seed. Since the NCAA field
expanded to 64 teams in 1985, a 12th seed has beaten a No. 5 18
times in 15 years, and at least once every year except '88. So why
not St. Bonaventure, even against mighty Kentucky tonight in
Cleveland?
</P>
<P>
   ''St. Bonaventure is going to beat them,'' said John Chaney,
whose Temple Owls split with the Bonnies during the regular season
before blowing them out in the Atlantic-10 final. ''There ain't no
way they're going to contain that little boy Winn.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Winn, a splendid senior point guard, could make life
miserable for Kentucky's Saul Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But Winn's not alone. ''Those guys on the front line, they're
really going to surprise them,'' Chaney said, referring to
6-foot-11 Peter Van Paassen and 6-foot-9 Caswell Cyrus, who have
the size to battle UK's Jamaal Magloire.
</P>
<P>
   Even given Tubby Smith's traditional tournament tenacity, the
Wildcats were humbled by Arkansas in the SEC Tournament, then lost
starting forward Desmond Allison to suspension Sunday. Factor in
Kentucky's dismal shooting, its worst in 37 years, and St.
Bonaventure's tough zone defense, and Chaney might be right.
</P>
<P>
   Utah State. It might sound odd calling a school with an
enrollment of 20,808 a sleeper, but the 12th-seeded Aggies are
relatively sleepy. Utah State has won its last 19 games, the
nation's longest winning streak, which included taking the Big West
tournament. Even against defending national champ Connecticut, the
Aggies have hope.
</P>
<P>
   They play tenacious defense, allowing 61.1 points a game; have
balanced scoring, with four starters averaging in double figures);
and shoot well from the outside, with guard Tony Brown hitting 45.3
percent on 3-pointers, forward Troy Rolle 41.1).
</P>
<P>
   But at 6-foot-8, coach Stew Morrill is taller than all but one
of his players, 6-foot-11 center Dimitri Jorssen. And UConn is
bigger, physical and experienced. Still, the Aggies could surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra. Six years ago, when Jay Wright walked out for his first
game as Hofstra's head coach, he carried T-shirts to give to
students in the stands. One problem: No students were in the
stands. Not now. The Flying Dutchmen won the last two Holiday
Festivals and on Saturday captured their first America East title
and first NCAA bid in 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   Laden with New York talent, Wright has an NCAA essential: senior
guard Craig ''Speedy'' Claxton, the two-time America East player of
the year. Claxton was eighth in the nation in scoring at 22.9
points a game and, even at 5-foot-11, has legitimate NBA potential.
Forward Norman Richardson (15.8) can fill it. In Oklahoma State,
however, the 14th-seeded Dutchmen face a more physical, experienced
team that plays tough defense. But can the Cowboys slow down
Speedy?
</P>
<P>
   Penn. The Quakers have Michael Jordan. Not that Jordan, but the
6-foot guard who averaged 16.3 points and 4.9 assists a game to
become the Ivy League's player of the year. The 13th-seeded Quakers
by four to Temple on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Owens, the 6-foot-11 center, and freshman forward Ugonna
Onyekwe combined for 100 blocks, and Penn held opponents to 39.7
shooting. Yes, it's the Ivies and yes, Penn's playing Illinois. But
the Quakers are NCAA savvy and have a terrific coach in Fran
Dunphy.
</P>
<P>
   Samford. A year ago, the Bulldogs were a tournament curiousity
before a 22-point first-round loss to St. John's. The Trans America
champs return with familiar strengths; the Bulldogs were second in
the country in field-goal percentage (50.3) and hit 38.7 percent of
its 3-pointers. With coach Jimmy Tillette an acolyte of
ex-Princeton coach Pete Carrill, 13th-seeded Samford ran its
back-door offense well enough to upset St. John's in the
season-opener and to win at Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   A dearth of size and depth could hurt against Syracuse, which is
stinging from an upset loss to Georgetown in the Big East
tournament and whose 3-2 zone could close the back door for
Samford. But the Orangemen, who won their first 19 games, lost five
of their last 10 and have a history of struggling with _ and
sometimes stumbling over _ Cinderellas of all shapes and sizes.
</P>
<P>
   For now, this year's crop is living happily ever after. At least
until the b-ball's over.

 &HT;    Braves make a pitch with diversity training
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the Braves' new world of baseball, curbing foul
mouths has become as important as catching foul balls.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a page from corporate America's playbook, the Braves'
front office has hired a diversity expert to help coach the team
through the difficult time following John Rocker's infamous
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Picture, if you will, a kinder, gentler baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Along with stretching exercises, the team has spent a portion of
spring training in some soul-searching with the help of Cook Ross,
a Silver Spring, Md., consulting firm. Cook Ross also has worked
with the likes of the American Red Cross, the Bureau of National
Affairs and Geico, an insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' sessions, which started in late February, are
mandatory for everyone from farm team rookies to Braves President
Stan Kasten. They've included one-on-one sessions with team
leaders, and group discussions. The topics have ranged from the
O.J. Simpson trial to dealing with stereotypes about athletes, to
how life in America differs dramatically for minorities from what
whites experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased at what we've seen so far. We had a lot of
dialogue. They were very engaging. They asked a lot of questions,''
said Kasten who found the experience eye-opening. Kasten said the
Braves are considering more sensitivity training sessions in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the off-season we had and the attention we have had on
this (Rocker) matter, we thought it would be useful for the entire
organization to go through it. We take the business of our
community relations and our image in the community very
seriously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been beneficial to everybody,'' said general
manager John Schuerholz, whose brother recommended Cook Ross ``Out
of adversity grows the opportunity to be a better organization and
show leadership in the industry, coming to grips with the
situation, embracing it more and becoming a stronger team because
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   For some Braves players, the sessions were as much about
forgiveness as about rebuilding relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody got something out of it,'' said third
baseman Chipper Jones. ``We could heed the advice of a person who's
been through an experience like this before. The gist of it was to
face it. Sweeping it under a rug is not going to solve the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan, who was critical of Rocker early on, said players
were encouraged not to be judgmental.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all make the mistake of, instead of getting to know
someone, you judge them first, then get to know them later when
it's too late,'' the right fielder said. ``It's a shame it had to
come down this way, but it's all part of the learning process.''
</P>
<P>
   While big business has had to face head-on a changing workforce
and ensuing racial and gender conflicts for some time, it's a
relatively new issue for baseball. The National Basketball
Association and Major League soccer are ahead of the sports pack on
this issue, according to one sports industry expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much on point for the audience in the business of
sports today,'' said Jose Masso, chief operating officer at
Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society,
in Boston. ``They realize the business of sports has changed
drastically over the last 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   And that change has meant challenges for diversity experts like
Howard Ross, who makes a living helping others cope with change.
Ross conducted the Braves session with former Chicago Bears
linebacker Mike Singletary.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have a mistaken view of diversity training,''
said Ross, a 15-year veteran of the field and president of Cook
Ross. ``They either think it's Mr. Rogers touchy-feely where you
sit around in a circle and sing 'Kumbaya' or it's about beating up
on white guys and telling them they're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assume that most people want to do the right thing and that
many are pretty ignorant about how to go about doing that,'' Ross
said Wednesday from a cell phone while watching the Braves play
Kansas City. ``They don't know that they don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that baseball is a team sport, and disharmony
in the locker room could hurt the Braves on the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, said Ross, ``have epitomized team work. This is
potentially disruptive to them, so this is why the management of
the team wanted to use it (the diversity program) as an opportunity
to move forward in a positive way.''

 &HT;    Bulldog hoping to rid monkey from his back
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keep asking if the albatross around his neck feels heavier, and
he'll deny one exists. Bring up the obvious Buffalo Bills
reference, and Andy Landers shrugs his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Five times the Georgia Lady Bulldogs have reached the Final
Four. Five times they have failed to stand in the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   Landers is well aware of the goose egg beside his name. No other
women's coach has taken a team to the Final Four as many times and
not brought home a championship trophy. He insists that he never
has dwelled on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely never have. Why should I?'' he asked. ``I'm proud
that we've been there five times. There are probably 310 schools
out there that would like to get there once.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 Georgia, which earned its fifth Final Four appearance in a
surprise last season, has every expectation of making it six before
the month is out. The Lady Dogs (29-3) begin their quest Saturday
night against Montana in a first round West Regional game in
Stegeman Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Only Pat Summitt of Tennessee (64) and Louisiana Tech's Leon
Barmore (50) have won more NCAA games than the 28 by Georgia teams
under Landers. They also have national championships to their
credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a certain amount of luck to win a national
championship, and Georgia just hasn't gotten that break when they
needed it,'' former Mississippi coach Van Chancellor said.
Chancellor is a friend who never got to the Final Four but who has
won three consecutive WNBA titles with the Houston Comets.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Georgia's first NCAA title game, Teresa Edwards fouled
out for the only time that season with 10 minutes left in the game,
clearing the way for an upset by Old Dominion.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia was favored over Tennessee in the 1996 finals. Right
before tipoff, the Tennessee mascot was taunting a stuffed bulldog
toy when the toy exploded, spewed debris on the court and delayed
the start of the game by 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Landers said the incident did not affect the outcome of the
game, but the Lady Dogs came out tight, and Tennessee coasted to
the first of three NCAA titles in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's up to another generation of Georgia players to get
title for the program, and for Landers. Instead of feeling
pressure, however, he is heartened by suggestions from well-wishers
that just maybe it's his team's turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more people pulling for us to win it than
questioning why we haven't done it,'' he said. ``I don't think
there's a lot to feel bad about.''

 &HT;    Let's play two: Elliott says he's in shape
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sean Elliott not only survived his return to the San Antonio
Spurs lineup with a transplanted kidney Tuesday, he felt able to
pass one of the NBA's tests of stamina.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott could have played again Wednesday, had the schedule, and
Coach Gregg Popovich, beckoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop asked me 'if today was a back-to-back, how would you
feel?''' Elliott said Wednesday. ``I said `fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who underwent the transplant last Aug. 16, said he went
through one of his most grueling workouts Wednesday since returning
to practice on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott played 12 minutes against Atlanta on Tuesday, starting
the game at small forward. He expects to be in the starting lineup
tonight against Dallas. Many expected Popovich to move Elliott back
in as a reserve. But Popovich preferred to start Elliott as a
tribute to him, to avoid disrupting the game by sending him in
during the first quarter, and to reunite the lineup that won the
Spurs' first NBA title last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop doesn't want me coming off bench for bunch of games and
then changing during the playoffs,'' Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who underwent surgery to both knees in recent seasons
and lost strength in his legs while he was away from basketball,
said he felt strong on Tuesday. He was particularly pleased with
the driving dunk he made during the third quarter for his only
basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really explosive,'' Elliott said. ``I don't have any
pain in my knees.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs (41-23) have the fourth-best record in the Western
Conference. Despite the dominance of the Lakers, and to a lesser
degree, Portland, Elliott thinks the Spurs can repeat as champions.
Every NBA champion since the Lakers won in 1987 and '88 has
successfully defended its title.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what, I think we have a chance,'' Elliott said. ``I
felt a good chemistry on the court last night. A lot of guys are
quietly confident we can put something together.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who received a kidney from his brother Noel, said he is
not entirely comfortable with all the accolades he has received for
his comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are calling me courageous,'' Elliott said. ``But I took
something from my brother. He's the one who made the sacrifice. My
brother was the one who laid himself on the line.''

ST. JOHN'S WRONGED: THERE ARE NO SAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ It has gone from an eight-team NIT undercard to a
64-team pure-American extravaganza commanding attention from
Ketchikan to Key West.
</P>
<P>
   Its championship weekend has acquired a universally accepted,
and widely copied, nickname. That climax has gone from a Thursday
night/Saturday afternoon format in which only the latter was
televised to the point where its key games are shown in prime time
and every game is available on television to someone.
</P>
<P>
   The show that reveals the participants is a big deal. Every
office in the land has a pool. In a society in which special
interest entertainment is the rule, it may be one of the few
remaining avenues of binding national communal discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The latest television contract was worth $6 billion (Yup, that's
a ``b'').
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA men's basketball tournament is now a certified American
ritual. Mention ``March Madness'' and all but the most obtuse
cultural snobs will understand the reference. All this being the
case, one would think there couldn't possibly be anything new to
say about the NCAA tournament. If persistent in that belief, one
would, of course, be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite safe to say there has never been a circumstance
quite like the one facing St. John's University as the Red Storm _
sorry, but that coerced nickname still grates on the ear _ prepare
for their first-round game Thursday night with Northern Arizona at
the University of Arizona's McKale Center. For almost right up to
the moment the referee throws up the ball, coach Mike Jarvis and
the rest of the St. John's party will be looking to see if a fellow
in a suit is standing behind the bench waving some legal document.
</P>
<P>
   How did Erick Barkley get that car? Who helped pay for his
tuition at Maine Central Institute? Were his SAT scores on the
up-and-up? Does he secretly advocate the violent overthrow of the
American government? The St. John's point guard has been
investigated more than Jerry Tarkanian.
</P>
<P>
   And why now? Isn't the time to ask all the questions before the
season starts? Perhaps L'Affaire Barkley is shady, perhaps not. But
who's dropping the dimes to the NCAA, anyway? And if Erick Barkley
is guilty of something, what about half the starters on just about
every team in the top 40? If any player accepted just one extra
T-shirt or said yes to an offer for one ride across campus from an
assistant coach to avoid walking in the rain he has, strictly
speaking, broken an NCAA regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Aren't you outraged?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, someone is out to get St. John's, and you know what
that means, don't you? It means St. John's, a quite legitimate No.
2 seed, has adopted a definite Us vs. The World mentality, and that
means the Red Storm will be highly motivated. Adding spice to the
plot is the fact that recently there has also been within the St.
John's family a curious Us vs. Us corollary _ a strange fistic
encounter last week at the Big East tournament featuring the
aforementioned Mr. Barkley and a very skilled teammate, Bootsie
Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem to make sense, therefore, for Coach Jarvis to make
sure noted St. John's alumnus Mario Cuomo is present for the game.
For in addition to his famed legal skills, the ex-governor is known
to be a very spiritual man, a healer of sorts. He might come in
handy, at many levels.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's. the Big East champion, can handle itself on the
court, as can Duke, Stanford, Michigan State, Ohio State, Temple,
Iowa State, Connecticut and, yes, Cincinnati. Do not dismiss
Cincinnati simply because Kenyon Martin, the Player of the Year,
broke his leg in the first round of the Conference USA tournament.
You want to talk Us vs. The World? That's Cincinnati's unofficial
motto, every year. They don't ever care what anyone thinks of its
modus operandi. Coach Bob Huggins still has a variety of weapons,
and no team ever out-toughs Cincinnati. A trip to the Sweet 16
would certainly not be out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   Are the above all pure? Define pure. Not getting caught; that's
pure. The competition for, and the care and feeding of, America's
finest young basketball players is a bizarre story that far exceeds
the average American's imaginative capacity. It's the sausage
factory, folks. Don't ask, and we won't tell.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA has engaged us all in a giant fairy tale. For example,
the athletes are never, ever, referred to as ``players'' by those
running the tournament. No, no, no. They are the _ are you ready? _
``student-athletes.'' Perhaps. It sounds good, anyway. But if
you're determined to root only for student-athletes, you'd be
better advised to focus the attention on Salem, Va. That's where
the Division 3 tournament is wrapping up. And you can be sure there
are a requisite number of ``eligibility majors'' even at that
relatively innocent level.
</P>
<P>
   That's simply the way it is. Is it exciting? Is the competition
often absolutely top drawer? Are many of the participants exemplary
people, even some of the coaches? Oh, yes, absolutely. But is it
also cutthroat and deadly serious business for those who really
have a chance to win this thing, as well as for the next level of
wannabes who would engage the services of Beelzebub in a heartbeat,
if guaranteed a trip to the Final Four? Affirmative.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other American industries, it is what it is. If you
take it, you take it, warts and all. Whoever's after St. John's is
just a sore loser.

   BEIJING _ This week at the Great Hall of the People, Chinese
leaders threatened military action against Taiwan, warning that
China ``would not sit idly by'' if the island it claims as its own
moved toward formal independence.
</P>
<P>
   But it was business as usual here at the Purple Vine, an elegant
Taiwan-style teahouse run by a businessman from Taipei that is
snuggled between the Great Hall and China's leadership compound _
and counts many mainland officials as loyal customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political tension hasn't had the slightest impact on me,''
said Zha Fuhua, the owner, as he carefully choreographed the
preparation of oolong tea, a Taiwanese favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure there's been lots of angry talk,'' he said, ``but I think
it's just mouthing off. I'm not the least bit worried. I don't
think war is possible, because there's too much to lose. The
essence of the relationship between China and Taiwan is economic
development, not battle.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be easy to imagine that Beijing's tens of thousands of
residents from Taiwan live a bizarre existence, members of a
divided family in the heart of the enemy camp.
</P>
<P>
   There are occasional vexations: enduring an occasional cabbie's
harangue about the need to bomb Taiwan into submission and
wondering how to respond when a teen-age son is invited to join the
Communist Youth League.
</P>
<P>
   But most Taiwanese here say that they are happy and feel at home
in China, living with a language and culture that they for the most
part understand. They are mostly small-business people, and they
blend in well with Beijing's increasingly affluent middle class.
They have Chinese neighbors and Chinese business partners, and they
often send their children to Chinese schools.
</P>
<P>
   And so with only days to go before Taiwan's presidential
election, which has prompted Beijing's most recent saber rattling,
Taiwanese here seem largely oblivious to the arrows flying above
them in political space, convinced that business interests and
brotherhood will somehow ensure the peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all used to this kind of talk by now, and it's not
something that impacts us greatly,'' said Lin Yen-hung, the manager
of a huge cooking oil company on the outskirts of Beijing, who has
lived here for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   There are now an estimated 60,000 Taiwanese companies operating
directly or indirectly in China, according to the Beijing Taiwanese
Businesspeople's Association, most drawn to the mainland by the
opportunities of its fast-growing market.
</P>
<P>
   At least several hundred thousand people from Taiwan now live in
the People's Republic, the overwhelming number in business.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing they are sprinkled throughout the city and integrated
into the community. Although many leave their families at home in
Taiwan, as the standard of living here has risen an increasing
proportion come with families in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We express our views in an appropriate way, but in general we
avoid the topic of reunification,'' said Chen Kuo-yuen, who owns a
cafe and a leather goods factory. ``Business is business and
politics is politics. But our relationship with the mainland
community is extremely close.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to his cafe, filled with Chinese business people
having power lunches on glass-topped tables. ``My customers are
Beijingers,'' he said. ``My partner's from here too. If I tried to
do it myself I'd be quickly shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   The many business relationships that have evolved in recent
years have various roots. Taiwanese business people want to make
money. The Chinese partners have benefited from the managerial and
technical skills that the Taiwanese bring. And the Chinese
government, which has established special concessions for Taiwanese
businesses, believes that such ties will help reel the island,
separated from the mainland since 1949, into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   Although Taiwanese and mainland figures vary, by both accounts
Taiwanese trade and investment here are growing fast. Bilateral
trade amounted to $14.045 billion in the first seven months of
1999, a 9 percent increase over the comparable period in 1998,
according to Taiwanese figures. In 1998 there was nearly $3 billion
in direct investment from Taiwan to the mainland, according to the
China Statistical Yearbook.
</P>
<P>
   But that probably vastly underestimates the magnitude of
Taiwanese involvement, Chen said, since many Taiwanese invest in
China through a third region, like Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   And he said there was also a good deal of ``invisible''
investment, including his own cafe, in which money is invested in
the name of a mainland partner because it is illegal for a
foreigner to own that type of business in China.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese here say the advantages of doing business in a
familiar culture and language far outweigh the somewhat daunting
prospect of dealing with an unfamiliar communist bureaucracy, one
that spends vast amounts of time and effort maligning the leaders
of their island homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Many say they have tried, or thought of trying, to do business
in Europe or the United States. But they say they fear racial
discrimination as well as huge language and cultural barriers. In
China they feel they have a leg up over the Westerners who are also
rushing in.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came to the mainland in 1992, I felt some terror
toward the Communist Party,'' said Lin, of Tongyi Edible Oil Co.,
whose signs are written in the traditional Chinese characters used
in Taiwan instead of the simplified characters of the mainland,
even though nearly all his employees are from the mainland. ``But I
easily became accustomed to how things work here, and I think it's
because we share many habits and customs in our lifestyles.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And so in the last few years, Taiwanese have continued to rush
in, deaf to the near constant saber rattling in the background.
</P>
<P>
   People were far more nervous in 1996, when China fired missiles
near Taiwan during the island's last presidential election
campaign, the Taiwanese here say. Then, $70 billion left Taiwan in
one week and many Taiwanese, including Zha, the teahouse owner,
started making preparations for their families to emigrate to the
West.
</P>
<P>
   But today the atmosphere is far more relaxed, they say, in part
because of increasing communication and familiarity between the two
sides, and in part because Chinese propaganda campaigns have
changed their tone, no longer decrying oppression in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists from Taiwan made more than 2.5 million visits to the
mainland last year, up from about 500,000 a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago if you got in a taxi and revealed you were
from Taiwan, the driver would start ranting,'' said Zha, who moved
to coastal China to start a seaweed business in 1987. ``But there
are so many Taiwanese here now that there's more contact and
communication, so there's also more understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally people don't bring it up,'' he said. ``And anyway,
if people ask, `Where are you from?' I say, `Jiangxi''' _ the
southern Chinese province where his ancestors once lived. Many
Taiwanese here do not advertise their passports, and some routinely
say they are from Singapore or Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   In general it is easy for Taiwanese to live a life of
``strategic ambiguity'' by avoiding political discussions _ an easy
maneuver in a country where the ruling Communist Party now has
little obvious direct influence on everyday life. Still, there are
times when they feel forced to show their colors.
</P>
<P>
   Lin, who has two children in school in Beijing, said his
teen-age son grappled this year with whether to accept an
invitation to join the Communist Youth League, a group that most
teenagers join as much for its social as its political function.
(He didn't.)
</P>
<P>
   And on the first day of school, Lin's 6-year-old daughter found
herself on stage being introduced by the principal, who proceeded
to lecture the students about the inevitability of Taiwan's return
to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just a child, and I was very angry he had to bring
politics into it,'' Lin said.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been no official polls, the Taiwanese here
appear split among the three leading presidential candidates, just
like Taiwanese voters at home.
</P>
<P>
   And on the question of independence for Taiwan, most seem to
favor maintaining the status quo, something resembling independence
without a formal declaration. Some predict reunification with the
mainland at some point in the distant future, and all reject a
quick bid for independence as too damaging for business.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government ``from top to bottom'' has guaranteed
Taiwan businessmen here that ``Taiwanese business wouldn't be
affected by political tension, that there can be no threats or
personal threats to business people here,'' said Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the question of reunification is difficult for
people like him, whose loyalties are split.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of business people here would oppose any
move to independence,'' he said, ``because it would immediately
bring threats from the mainland. But at the same time, they also
oppose pressure from the mainland.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added, with an apologetic look, ``I know that's a
cautious answer, but under the circumstances, it's the best I can
give.''

 &HT;    N.C. beach still wading through Floyd damage
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAK ISLAND, N.C. _ Mayor Joan Altman walks along the glistening
beach at low tide. It is under water at high, severely eroded by
Hurricane Floyd six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are you going to put your towel when you come here?''
said Altman, 47, showing how the surf washes underneath battered
beachfront cottages still awaiting repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Oak Island is the latest of North Carolina's hurricane-wrecked
beaches scrambling to prepare for the return of vacationers who,
along the state's coast, spend an estimated $3 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   When Floyd roared ashore Sept. 16, it unleashed a 6-foot tidal
surge that washed away four miles of this barrier island's nine
miles of oceanfront dunes. Officials on Oak Island fear damage to
private and public property and losses of property taxes and rental
income will reach $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Floyd just whacked us,'' said Dara Royal, 43, who heads the
Oak Island Beach Preservation Society.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Hurricane Hazel in 1954 has Oak Island been so badly
raked. A popular family beach between Wilmington and Myrtle Beach,
this town of 7,000 permanent residents now claims coastal North
Carolina's highest concentration of erosion-threatened structures.
Floyd damaged 430 of the 500 oceanfront buildings, undermining
foundations and unearthing concrete septic tanks. Along North
Carolina's 150 miles of developed shoreline, from this beach town
near the South Carolina line to the Outer Banks bumping against
Virginia, 968 oceanfront buildings are now threatened by erosion,
according to a new survey by the North Carolina Sea Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the destroyed cottages are on Oak Island, along the four
miles of beach that had eroded badly in recent years, before Floyd.
The narrow breadth of sand couldn't stop Floyd's tidal surge. It
washed away the dunes as it surged underneath cottages on the
second row. Altman figures that 60 percent of the damaged beach
houses will be repaired for summer tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Oak Island spent $2 million to push sand into a temporary dune
running just behind the oceanfront cottages. Littered by broken
concrete and shards of metal and wood, the heaped sand is Oak
Island's primary defense against another storm damaging second-row
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very, very vulnerable,'' said Altman, Oak Island's
mayor for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   She is now president of a new organization that lobbies for
state and federal funds for beach renourishment, the pumping of
sand to rebuild depleted beaches.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is expensive and open to criticism that it does not
stop erosion, making oceanfront development too risky to warrant
spending tax dollars. Altman's group, the North Carolina Shore &AMP;
Beach Preservation Association, argues that it's reasonable to
spend tax dollars to preserve beaches, protecting homes and the
public's access to the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either preserve it, or lose it,'' Altman said. ``Oak
Island is the best example I know.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On West 116th Street between Lenox and Seventh
Avenues, a window in the Gabaron Barber Shop advertises services in
French. A few doors away, a young man in the burgundy-colored robes
of West Africa calls home from a long-distance phone center,
speaking in a gentle French patois.
</P>
<P>
   On the brick and brownstone plain of south-central Harlem,
thousands of new arrivals are putting down roots: black and white,
richer and poorer. In their robes and headdresses, especially on
holy days, West African Muslims may be the most recognizable. The
word has gone out: This neighborhood has cheap rents and many
countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like you have the Chinese in Chinatown,'' said Maimouna
Ndiaye, a Mali immigrant who saved the money she earned cooking
African food in her apartment for homesick compatriots and bought a
coffee shop on West 116th Street. ``We would like to make this
Africatown.''
</P>
<P>
   Two blocks away, Tony Morgan, an Australian-born graphic
designer, is savoring his version of the American Dream. Morgan,
28, sold his Greenwich Village co-op and bought a four-story
brownstone on West 118th Street for $237,000. ``My friends couldn't
believe it when I moved to Harlem,'' he said, laughing. ``But then
they came here, and saw what I had!''
</P>
<P>
   He restored the wainscoting, pocket doors and built-in cabinets
_ and loves to hear that his house might be worth more than
$600,000. But Morgan, who moved in last November, said he is not
selling. From the elegant window in his back parlor, he can see a
town house development rising, and beyond that, the dome of a
mosque, the Masjid Malcolm Shabazz. His favorite sound is the bells
that ring five times a day, calling Muslims to worship.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the retail turnaround of 125th Street, the Main
Street of Harlem, with its glossy mall, its new Old Navy and corner
Starbucks. This is a modest renaissance that encompasses renovated
brownstones, storefront restaurants and new church- and
mosque-sponsored condominiums. Once nearly destroyed by drugs,
crime and debilitation, the square mile bordered by West 110th
Street and West 124th Street, Morningside and Lenox Avenues, is on
the way up.
</P>
<P>
   People like Morgan are helping to make the area a residential
neighborhood again. But many community leaders credit the West
Africans who have settled around West 116th Street with making it a
community once more.
</P>
<P>
   At Joe Pep Dry Cleaners on 116th Street, where West Africans
take their ceremonial robes before Friday services at the mosque,
the owners are jubilant. Four years ago, they closed for the
summer. ``We just weren't making it,'' Errol Joseph, an owner,
said, sitting at a sewing machine with a tape measure around his
neck. ``Now, we're doing fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Kathryn Suggs, a real estate agent on West 145th Street,
said she was afraid to go to the area five years ago; now she sells
brownstones there for as much as half a million dollars. There are
people waiting for any house, no matter how much of a wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe now,'' Suggs said. ``People wouldn't buy in this
part of Harlem until it was safe.'' She said would-be buyers _ who,
increasingly, are of all nationalities and races _ worry that they
have missed the market. Prices of restored brownstones rose an
average of 25 percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The houses are going to men and women who have moved from
neighborhoods like TriBeCa and the Upper West Side. Many are
African-Americans (and a substantial number of mixed-race couples)
who say they seek to discover their roots _ or simply feel
comfortable uptown.
</P>
<P>
   There are also hundreds of lower-income applicants lined up to
rent or buy apartments in fixed-up brownstones and in apartment
complexes just rising, many sponsored by the area's religious
institutions. Renaissance Plaza, a 240-unit subsidized co-op on
Lenox Avenue at 116th Street, has an occupancy date of January 2001
_ and a waiting list of 500, among them Timothy Hopewell, a
newlywed who now lives in the Bronx. Hopewell grew up on West 118th
Street. ``It's kind of nostalgic,'' he said. ``It's kind of a dream
to go back there and live.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramona Smith, whose rental management company controls 600
apartments and 18 storefronts in this area, said West Africans
constituted 60 percent of her tenants. In New York City, the number
of sub-Saharan immigrants, most of them West African, almost
doubled from 1990 to 1996, from 44,000 to 84,000, said Andrew
Beveridge, a professor at Queens College who specializes in
demographics. The exact figure is unclear, and city officials say
new immigrants are reluctant to participate in the census.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them are illegal or do not have their green cards, so
they are afraid,'' said Councilman Bill Perkins, who represents the
district.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from interviews with dozens of West Africans and their
landlords, most of the men and women who have come here have
bettered their living conditions in the last five years. Many
newcomers from Senegal, Guinea, Gambia, Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana,
Mali and the Ivory Coast have left single room occupancy hotels for
studio apartments that rent for $500 to $600 (sometimes with a
bathroom down the hall). The prosperous have moved to one- or
two-bedroom rentals.
</P>
<P>
   West Africans say the language barrier is their greatest
drawback. Fofana Souleymane, a livery driver and aspiring musician
known as King Up Tereby, complained that the social services
agencies do not regularly employ French-speaking translators. On a
morning last week, one French-speaking woman, distressed at the
prospect of hailing a cab, sought someone who spoke her language.
She went into Ndiaye's coffee shop, Farafina's, which car service
drivers frequent for cafe au lait and goat stew. She was quickly
promised a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Ndiaye, who speaks English, came to the United States eight
years ago. ``A lot of African men could not find African food to
eat, so I stayed here,'' she said. ``At first, I cooked for them in
my apartment and they gave me money to cook.''
</P>
<P>
   After six years, she started Farafina's with $5,000. Like many
other African immigrants, she lives with relatives: a cousin and
his wife, on West 112th Street. She pays $1,300 a month rent for
her small coffee shop. She pays another $250 a month for the
espresso and cafe au lait machine. Someday, she wants to move the
kitchen to the back room and put in proper tables and chairs. ``But
no matter how hard I try to save, all my money goes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The West Africans in Harlem are praised by city officials and
local religious leaders for their industriousness and their piety,
but they have been criticized by some older black residents for
what immigrants have always been criticized for: a perceived
unwillingness to adapt to American ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all group together and you don't know what they're
talking about,'' said Charlie Saunders, 52, a construction union
official who has lived in this area all his life and is perplexed
by some of the newcomers' habits. ``That makes a division. I'm not
saying it's wrong, but it segregates them.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Alfonse Jean, 40, a taxi driver, is still puzzling
over New York standard baksheesh. ``Sometimes before you get the
apartment, you are supposed to give a `tip' for the super _ like
$2,000,'' he explained. ``That is everywhere here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Perkins, the councilman, contends there is ``no
significant amount of misunderstanding or bad blood'' between the
longtime African-American residents and the newcomers. But he does
acknowledge some tensions. ``These differences require
sensitivity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Some West Africans have dumped used cooking oil in the street; a
few have tossed trash from commercial buildings and have
double-parked livery cars. In turn, African children are taunted
for their differences.
</P>
<P>
   But things are changing. One example: the Canaan Baptist Church
is sponsoring French classes to help members of the congregation
converse with their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   A few doors east, at a mosque, the Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, its
leader, Imam Izak-el M. Pasha, is also looking for solutions. His
mosque will soon buy a garbage truck and start charging merchants a
fee to pick up their trash.``It's probably just clashing
cultures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   South-central Harlem has always been a neighborhood full of
contradictions _ and nationalities struggling to coexist.
</P>
<P>
   After the Civil War, horses of millionaires raced along what is
now St. Nicholas Avenue and august visitors _ including Ulysses S.
Grant _ cheered. By the turn of the century, most of the
brownstones had been built, along with Graham Court, one of the
grandest rental buildings in New York, an Italian Renaissance
palazzo commissioned by William Waldorf Astor in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say that a 1900 West Side melee between blacks and
police, and the completion of the Lenox Avenue portion of the IRT
in 1904, inspired a black real estate agent, Philip A. Payton, to
urge blacks to move uptown from Hell's Kitchen. Payton formed the
African-American Realty Co.; a rival, the Anglo-Saxon Realty Co.,
quickly formed to combat the trend, Sorin said. To no avail: white
flight increased.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1910, rural blacks from the South streamed into central
Harlem just as the famous Harlem Renaissance started to soar.
Experts agree that the Great Depression killed the renaissance.
Black World War II veterans returned to find bias, along with a
dearth of jobs and services.
</P>
<P>
   But West 116th Street kept going. ``In the '50s, we had three or
four movie theaters on 116th Street alone,'' said Saunders, the
construction official, who lives on Adam Clayton Powell Jr.
Boulevard at West 117th Street. ``We had shoe stores, restaurants,
supermarkets, everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came drugs. And Vietnam, which Saunders said took away the
best of the neighborhood's youth. Many landlords left their
buildings to rot; rent strikes followed. In 1968, a headline in The
Amsterdam News warned, ``Thugs, Addicts Take Over: Terror Reigns on
116th Street.'' By the 1980s, New York City was the area's biggest
landlord.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker arrived at the Canaan Baptist Church
33 years ago. ``The federal government had just declared that this
area had the lowest level of services of any in the country,'' said
Walker, former chief of staff to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, 62 percent of his congregation lived in the
surrounding neighborhood. In five years, that number had dropped to
32 percent. Soon, the churches of Harlem were taking on the job of
building apartment houses and rehabilitating old ones. When the
current imam arrived at the Masjid Malcolm Shabazz arrived in 1993,
the mosque, too, got into the construction business.
</P>
<P>
   June Broxton, a secretary, is buying a new $300,000 three-family
house in Shabazz Gardens, a 41 town-house development co-sponsored
by the mosque. She will use the rents to pay her subsidized
mortgage. ``When I first heard about the area, it was stereotyped
as a bad place,'' Broxton, 36, said. ``But when I visited there, I
realized it was nice, the kind of place where people on the street
said, `Good morning' and `Good afternoon.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Councilman Perkins worries that some of the wealthier people
are buying brownstones for speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Suggs agrees, recounting a recent case of one man who made
$150,000 in a year by ``flipping'' an unrenovated brownstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are not poor,'' Perkins said. ``They're not
coming to Harlem to live the American Dream.'' He paused. ``They're
just moving uptown.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said the new homeowners will have less of an impact than
the West Africans. ``The West Africans come here not only to live
but to run their businesses and build their churches,'' he said.
``That usually suggests they'll be here for a while, as opposed to
the interloper or the transient or the speculator.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. John P. Quinn of the 28th Precinct, whose territory
encompasses south-central Harlem, is optimistic. The crime rate has
dropped 50 percent in five years, according to police statistics,
which is significantly better than the city average. ``Things
aren't perfect,'' he said, ``but it's looking real good right
now.''

<P>
   On Fridays, Fadel Gueye, a butcher, and his wife, Dieynaba Agne
Gueye, exchange their jeans for the traditional long robes of
Senegal to attend services at the mosque near their apartment on
West 116th Street. Gueye moved to Harlem 15 years ago, a single man
living in one of the SROs. He said he was ``the first African on
116th Street'' and he may be right. ``When I came here, there were
maybe two stores _ nothing _ the rest were boarded up,'' he said.
``We built this community.''
</P>
<P>
   They rent a spacious sixth-floor walk-up that bears the traces
of an 1980s renovation: the walls are of Sheetrock and the window
trim is plain, but the living room windows are covered with
glittering cerise draperies. During the day, Gueye, who now owns a
butcher shop on 116th Street, is often found at the slaughterhouse.
When he meets suppliers, he dresses like a film director, with a
camel-color coat and slim-wrap sunglasses. He sometimes dreams of
Senegal but he has not been back, even to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must give my children an opportunity here,'' he said. ``Not
only me, but the West Africans who live here are very hard working.
They are making it from zero.'' &QL;

WALL STREET FLIP: DOW GOES UP, NASDAQ DOWN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Wall Street was turned upside down Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average soared 320 points. But the
Nasdaq tumbled 124 points, extending a three-day loss that pushed
the technology-heavy index within a whisker of a correction five
days after reaching a record high. The Nasdaq is 9.2 percent below
its record close last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Amid an anything-goes atmosphere for investors, the reversal of
roles for the two main stock market indexes was, nevertheless, seen
as bizarre by stock traders and mutual fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow and Nasdaq this year have routinely gone in wildly
different directions, day after day. But it more often has been the
Dow that has drifted down, while the Nasdaq achieved new heights.
This was different: The Nasdaq fell 124.01, or 2.6 percent, to
close at 4582.62. The Dow's 320.17-point gain pushed the 30-stock
index of Blue Chip stocks to 10,131.41.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's quite a divergence _ and it's going in the opposite
direction of what I'd gotten used to,'' said Eric Efron, manager of
the USAA Aggressive Growth fund in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's retreat brought the index's total losses this week
to 401 points. There was no bad news to trigger the index's
decline, which money managers attributed to panic selling by
investors seeking to grab profits in stocks increasingly perceived
as overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Investment specialists say much of the selling is occurring
among day traders and aggressive retail investors whose buy and
sell orders have greatly increased the volatility of the current
markets.
</P>
<P>
   For example, biotechnology stocks were hammered _ some say
irrationally _ on Tuesday after President Clinton questioned
efforts by some biotech companies to guard their discoveries in
decoding the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Those stocks _ PE Corp.'s Celera Genomics Group, Millennium
Pharmaceuticals and Incyte Pharmaceuticals Inc. _ stumbled again,
though the Amex Biotechnology index staged a rebound and rose 2.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nasdaq has had this tremendous rise this year,'' said Jon
Burnham, manager of the $205 million Burnham fund. ``People get
scared _ they've made a lot of money and say, `I've got to get
out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Nasdaq's best-performing stocks this year suffered
the steepest losses. Software and semiconductor shares led the
Nasdaq down. Veritas Software Corp., which had a 77 percent gain
through March 10, lost $21.9375 a share. JDS Uniphase Corp., a
fiber-optics parts maker, fell $6.25 to $118.75. PMC-Sierra, which
sells semiconductor networks, dropped $32 a share to $186, and
wireless provider Nextel Communications Inc. fell $13.4375 to
$132.125.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, established tech stocks, such as Intel Corp., Microsoft
Corp., and Oracle Corp., rose modestly as investors took heart in
their huge revenue streams and their ability to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   As money streamed out of risky technology start-up companies, it
poured into the big companies in the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stocks that were rocketing today were your traditional
names,'' said Michael Ryan, head of trading for State Street
Research &AMP; Management Co. ``People ring up profits (in the
technology sector) and before you know it they are throwing money
into these Dow stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   More than three stocks rose for every two that fell on the New
York Stock Exchange. Gains were posted by Du Pont, Coca-Cola Co.,
J.P. Morgan and numerous large pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   John Ballen, president of MFS Investment Management in Boston,
said the Dow's sharp rise was a classic ``bear-market rally.'' The
Dow is down nearly 12 percent this year despite the rally.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of ``relentless selling pressure'' in the Dow, Ballen
said ``it doesn't take much in terms of moving those stocks
dramatically on the upside. You get the most violent rallies in
bear markets.''
</P>
<P>
   But investors were also heartened by renewed interest in a
broader array of stocks, not just technology. If that trend
continues, some said, the one-day rally might be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   While opinions vary about what is going on in the stock market,
or which way it is headed, most agree it has been a wild ride,
particularly in the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're holding on to the roller coaster seat,'' said USAA's
Efron. The Nasdaq, he said, ``goes through excesses of optimism and
excesses of gloom. We try to focus on the long-term, and we think
long-term prospects of these companies are very good.''

TAIWAN CANDIDATES FIND CAMPAIGN FODDER IN BEIJING THREAT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Presidential candidates here tried Wednesday to
gain a political advantage from China's belligerent warnings
against talk of the island's independence.
</P>
<P>
   And President Lee Teng-hui spent Wednesday trying to dispel
rumors that he secretly supports the opposition candidate over his
chosen successor in a campaign that has been filled with planted
rumors and unsubstantiated charges from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   The election, on Saturday, is essentially a tight contest among
the three leading candidates: Vice President Lien Chan, the
candidate of the ruling Nationalists, or Kuomintang; Chen
Shui-bian, whose Democratic Progressive Party is closely associated
with the cause of independence; and James Soong, a popular
politician whose breakaway candidacy has split the Nationalist
majority.
</P>
<P>
   In danger of losing their power, the Nationalists have resorted
to scare tactics. Lee, although reviled in China for his own
assertion of Taiwan's statehood, has joined Lien in warning that
Chen's election could provoke China to war.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night a spokeswoman for Chen's campaign tried to turn
the tables on the Nationalists for what Chen calls ``terror
tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We find it regrettable that the mainland is using such threats
to try and influence our election,'' said Bikhim Hsiao, director of
international affairs for the Democratic Progressive Party. ``And I
think it hurts the feelings of the Taiwanese people to have the KMT
echoing the statements from Beijing,'' she added, using the
initials for the Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, a former mayor of Taipei, has made some far-fetched
accusations of his own. When Taiwan's stock market plummeted
Monday, supposedly on fears of a Nationalist loss, he immediately
charged that the government had manipulated the market. While no
evidence has been offered, many voters here are prepared to believe
it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chen found few takers for his charge, made at a rally
Tuesday night, that the Nationalists had sent an emissary to
Beijing to ask it to hold military exercises near Taiwan to scare
voters away from him.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, several prominent scholars and businessmen who
are supposedly friends of Lee said they were supporting Chen. In
that atmosphere, the perennial rumor that Lee is a closet supporter
of the independence-leaning opposition gained new currency.
</P>
<P>
   For different reasons, both the Chen and Soong camps find this
to be a helpful rumor, and they miss few opportunities to spread
it.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two days, Lee has urged voters to stick by Lien.
But Lien is widely regarded as the most lackluster of the three
contenders and is struggling to get out from Lee's shadow while
holding on to his fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more votes Lien gets, the more secure our country will
be,'' Lee said Wednesday, wearing the white golf jacket of the Lien
campaign at an unusual news briefing just before the weekly meeting
of the all-powerful Nationalist Party standing committee.
</P>
<P>
   Published polls are banned in the 10 days before the election.
In earlier surveys, the three top candidates were virtually tied,
but at least a quarter of the electorate said it was undecided, and
no one is sure where trends are headed, although the campaigns
selectively leak secret surveys. All sides are making the most of
the polling vacuum, with each claiming a groundswell.
</P>
<P>
   Soong has urged Nationalist supporters to reject Lien, who he
says is losing ground, to prevent a victory by Chen. Lien has urged
just the opposite, a movement to dump the supposedly faltering
Soong.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently in an effort to counter Chen's impressive
endorsements, the Nationalists have released a list of 100
prominent citizens who would form an advisory group to Lien if he
is elected _ not mentioning that a few of those listed have
publicly endorsed the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   And this week, the Nationalists released a statement in support
of Lien signed in New York by the 103-year-old widow of Chiang
Kai-shek, Soong Mayling, better known as Madame Chiang. Many of the
mainland-born Nationalists who fled to Taiwan in 1949 with Chiang
have never been happy with Lee, who was born on the island and
ended the mainlanders' grip on the party. They are switching from
his candidate, Lien, in favor of Soong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could such an old lady really sign her name so clearly?''
asked 83-year-old Chu Zhichung, a onetime resident of Yunnan in
southwest China who fought with the Nationalist army against the
Japanese and the Communists, as he waited for a prescription at the
huge Veterans General Hospital in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   But these old soldiers dislike Chen and his party almost
universally and are appalled at their appeal among the young.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young people don't understand the danger of seeking
independence,'' Chu said. ``They've never known the horrors of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chen Shui-bian is a liar without any credibility when he says
he has changed his mind on this,'' he added. Chen has said that if
elected, he would not push for formal independence because Taiwan
already enjoys it in practice, and he says he could make piece with
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, a senior senator and campaign official of
the Democratic Progressives tried to play down the threat of a
Chinese attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Chen wins, China will accept it and slowly adapt to the
situation,'' said the legislator, Shen Fu-hsiung. ``They'll learn
that he is not as rigid as they thought.''

DOW REGISTERS BIGGEST GAIN IN 17 MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a reversal of fortune, blue-chip stocks recorded
their biggest gain in 17 months Wednesday, while the
technology-dominated Nasdaq market slumped.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq stocks that have been so beloved by investors as the
engines of the new economy have in three days lost a stunning 9.2
percent, just short of what Wall Street considers a correction.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, investors piled instead into financial, drug and
other high-quality stocks that have been old economy laggards. They
drove the Dow Jones industrial average up 320.17 points, or 3.3
percent, to 10,131.41, paring its loss so far this year to 11.9
percent. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index climbed 33 points,
or 2.4 percent, to 1,392.15, narrowing its loss for the year to
5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the money, stock analysts said, came from sales of
Nasdaq stocks. The Nasdaq composite index skidded 124.01 points, or
2.6 percent, to 4,582.62 just three days after hitting a record
5,048.62.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two things are going on,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief
market strategist at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. ``You're getting
some bottom-fishing for the really strong values that had developed
and some long overdue profit-taking in the new economy stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping to lead Wednesday's heavy stock trading was a report on
industrial output last month that some took as a sign the economy's
breakneck expansion might finally be slowing. If the members of the
Federal Reserve board believe this is happening _ and the
production figures are compiled by the central bank _ it reduces
the chance of several increases in interest rates and could rule
out a jump of more than one-quarter point at next Tuesday's policy
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the slide in Nasdaq stocks is viewed as a force for
economic restraint since rapid gains in them have contributed to
consumers' feelings of wealth and their willingness to spend. ``I
think it's the healthiest type of action you could hope for,'' said
Charles J. Pradilla, chief strategist at SG Cowen Securities,
referring to the realignment of values. ``It's the sort of stuff
Greenspan loves to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has often observed in recent
months how expensive some stocks have become in relation to their
demonstrated earning power and how stock-market profits have helped
sustain the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is starting to flow into companies with improving
earnings and more compelling valuations,'' added Robert M.
Balentine, an investment counselor in Atlanta. ``You can't have
such a bifurcated market continue to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's 3.3 percent gain in the Dow while the Nasdaq fell
2.6 percent was the biggest divergence Balentine, a market veteran,
said he could remember. The only other session in which the Nasdaq
dropped more than 2 percent while the blue-chip average jumped more
than 3 percent was the day after the Oct. 19, 1987, crash. And
never before this week has the Nasdaq lost triple-digit points for
three consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Goldman said that while the market was becoming less
unbalanced, high-tech would continue to shine. ``I don't think this
is a sea change,'' he said. ``People aren't selling the Internet
and buying a bank.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jeff Rubin, research director at Birinyi Associates, agreed,
calling the recent action ``your standard, run-of-the-mill Nasdaq
correction, which we have every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology stocks, slammed on Tuesday after President Clinton
and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain said genome research
should be made freely available to all, recovered part of their
losses after investors realized that this did not mean that gene
sequences could not be patented. But the speed with which billions
of dollars of value had evaporated on this development kept a pall
over the sector and spread into other Nasdaq sectors as well,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen, which lost 5 3/4 Tuesday, jumped 6\ Wednesday, to 58{,
but Millennium Pharmaceuticals shed another 4 3/16, to 171 13/16,
after plunging 59{ Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric and J.P. Morgan each soared more than 6 points
to pace the Dow industrials, 27 of whose 30 components advanced, 23
of them by at least a point. Hewlett-Packard was a big loser for a
second straight day, sliding 9[ to 130~.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly all pharmaceutical stocks were huge gainers _
Warner-Lambert, Eli Lilly and American Home Products were up more
than 5 points each. Schering-Plough and Merck were up 3 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Among the financials, Chase Manhattan, SunTrust Banks, Wells
Fargo, State Street and American Express all gained more than 4
points and First Union, which has been down sharply, jumped 2~, to
35~.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, 1.3 billion shares changed
hands, making it the third busiest day on record, with 1,909 issues
advancing compared with 1,130 that declined, much better breadth
than has prevailed in most recent sessions. New 52-week lows
outnumbered new highs by 140 to 27.

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ For an actress who epitomized American cool, Audrey
Hepburn is inspiring a lot of nervous sweat. In life, her fragile
beauty and elegantly pared-down fashion sense made her one of the
most distinctive, most admired stars on the Hollywood screen. And
that is precisely the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very protective of Audrey Hepburn,'' said Susan
Lyne, executive vice president for movies and mini-series at ABC,
which will broadcast ``The Audrey Hepburn Story'' this month.
``They worry that someone will come along and try to besmirch her
reputation. It's not like doing the Marilyn Monroe story where
people are salaciously interested in every misstep she took.''
</P>
<P>
   The drama, starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, will be shown on
Monday, March 27, one day after the Academy Awards. The timing is
no coincidence. Executives hope that the annual love affair with
Hollywood glamour will create an audience keen to relive the
Hepburn story, and starry-eyed enough to accept Hewitt, a former
television teen queen, as a reasonable fascimile of the poised and
sophisticated Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   For the 21-year-old Hewitt _ beloved of teen-agers in the Fox
drama ``Party of Five'' and now the star of a spinoff, ``Time of
Your Life'' _ the decision to star in the film is a risky one, and
the network is plainly concerned that critics will be merciless.
</P>
<P>
   The last time anyone tried to step into Audrey Hepburn's famous
Ferragamo flats, the result was the disastrous 1995 remake of
``Sabrina,'' from which Julia Ormond's career has still not
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   From another perspective, though, the decision by ABC to proceed
with the movie and accept potentially stinging criticism is a
measure of the desperation at the networks for something _
(italics)anything(end italics) _ to halt the hemorrhaging of
audiences to cable and the Internet. They are increasingly willing
to risk crass and shallow programming, the recent vow by the Fox
chairman to swear off ``exploitative material'' notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, for instance, CBS presented ``Perfect Murder,
Perfect Town,'' a drama based on the JonBenet Ramsey murder case,
and late last year NBC offered up an embarrassing ``Mary and
Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans need not worry that ``The Audrey Hepburn Story'' will
detract from their memories of the star. The movie, which
chronicles the actress' childhood and career up to the age of 32,
is in fact gentle. And it has a surprisingly strong pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was written by the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright
Marsha Norman. An executive producer, Robert Greenwald, is one of
the most respected producers in television, with a track record
that includes Emmy Award-winning dramas like ``The Burning Bed''
and ``A Woman of Independent Means.'' The director, Steve Robman,
came to television from Yale Drama School and New York and regional
theater.
</P>
<P>
   But the force behind the project was the determined Hewitt _
everyone calls her ``Love'' _ who has been obsessed with Hepburn
ever since she saw a video of ``Breakfast at Tiffany's'' when she
was 7 or 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother showed me `Breakfast at Tiffany's' and told me to
take some pointers from Audrey Hepburn,'' Hewitt said, ``and I've
never been the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt spoke candidly. ``I'm absolutely scared to death about
playing her,'' she said. ``Two weeks before filming, I was in
tears. I told my mom I didn't know if I could do it. I knew the
press would not say kind things about me. I thought I wasn't pretty
enough. I thought I wasn't talented enough. My mom looked at me and
said, `If that's your decision, OK But think of the three things
Audrey Hepburn was most afraid of: that she wasn't pretty enough,
wasn't talented enough and what people would say about her.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I did it. I'm proud of it, and I'm proud of the fact that
it was something I was terrified of doing but did anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The project was the result of a serendipitous meeting between
Hewitt and Kimberly Rubin, who had worked with Greenwald. ``At the
end of the meeting we were kind of chatting,'' Hewitt recalled,
``and I said that my dream project was to play Audrey Hepburn one
day. She just stared at me. She said that for the last few years
her dream project was Audrey Hepburn.'' ABC quickly approved the
project because of Hewitt's commitment to it. ( Rubin is an
executive producer of the movie.)
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald said that Hewitt's adoration for Hepburn informed the
film. The actress worked with a dialogue coach for months to
perfect the Hepburn accent, and she watched Hepburn films over and
over. ``There's an innocence that she brings to it,'' Greenwald
said. ``There's no cynicism, no wink of the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is, if not a valentine, then certainly an homage to an
actress who was, in the words of the critic David Thomson, a
``fairy queen'' in Hollywood in the 1950s and 1960s. The story
traces Hepburn's life from her difficult childhood in Holland
during the German occupation of World War II through her days as a
dancer on the London stage to her success on Broadway in ``Gigi''
and stardom in ``Roman Holiday,'' ``Sabrina'' and in her signature
role as Holly Golightly in ``Breakfast at Tiffany's'' in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a life that had a lot of inherent conflict,''
Norman said. ``How do you make a story out of that? I think we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The story ends in 1961. ``Once she got to `Breakfast at
Tiffany's,' her transformation from ugly duckling, which she felt
she was, to this kind of princess was complete,'' Norman explained.
``I didn't feel we needed to see the rest of it. The question of
how she became Audrey Hepburn was the thing to see, not how do you
go on being Audrey Hepburn.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Hepburn was no saint, but her life was not bedeviled
by the demons that afflicted, say, Monroe or Ava Gardner. The film
dwells on some painful chapters but skirts others.
</P>
<P>
   Her father (played by Keir Dullea), who was estranged from her
mother (Frances Fisher), was a Nazi lobbyist in England. As an
adult, Hepburn had two unhappy marriages, the first to the actor
Mel Ferrer, the second to Dr. Andrea Dotti, an Italian psychiatrist
and socialite. (She had a son from each marriage.)
</P>
<P>
   She had affairs with several actors, including a difficult one
with William Holden, who was married and an alcoholic. There are
intimations that she may have had an eating disorder. In short, her
life was, for a movie star, perfectly normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried hard to show the adversity this woman lived through,
especially during the war when she nearly died of malnutrition,''
Robman said. ``One has to assume her father was a great source of
turmoil. But there was no terrible dark secret or hidden tragic
mystery here that will rip the image of Audrey Hepburn to shreds.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress died of cancer in 1993 at the age of 63, having
spent the last years of her life working for the United Nations
Children's Fund, often visiting refugee camps in Africa and Asia.
``The fact that she ended up giving back to children, trying to
rescue children the way she was rescued as a child, seemed very
natural to her,'' Norman said. ``It was totally in character.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the aura of her good works, Hepburn is defined for many
fans by her sense of style. Renee April, who designed the costumes
for the movie, said she was not allowed to directly copy the
outfits that Hubert de Givenchy created for Hepburn and for films
like ``Sabrina'' and ``Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' but she tried to
imitate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audrey knew her flaws and her good features,'' April said.
``Her body did not change. She had the same measurements at 60 that
she had at 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt shares some physical similarities with Hepburn. ``She has
that same swan neck,'' April said, ``and she carries herself with a
lot of grace.'' In other respects, the resemblance is more of a
stretch. ``She's shorter, she's bustier,'' April said, laughing.
``She has a tiny waist, but she comes more in curves.''
</P>
<P>
   April, too, was intimidated by Hepburn. ``Who wouldn't be
intimidated?'' she said. ``We were dealing with Audrey Hepburn.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the pitfalls of taking on the film are never far from
the filmmakers' minds. ``To Jennifer Love Hewitt's credit,'' Robman
said, ``when we talked about the fact that it was a dangerous road
to tread, she said that no matter what kind of performance she
gives, there'll be criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Audrey Hepburn was such an important part of her growing up
that she wanted to pay homage to her as best she could,'' he said.
``I thought, if this young woman is as brave as that, I have to be
at least as brave.''
</P>
<P>
   The intrepid Hewitt said: ``I tried not to think of career.
You've got to do some things from the heart. You've got to do
things that challenge you to be better.''

 &HT;    Plaintiffs in Branch Davidian suit claim government tampered
evidence
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Plaintiffs in the Branch Davidian wrongful-death
lawsuit filed a motion Wednesday accusing the government of losing
and tampering with key evidence in the case _ which is set for
trial in Waco on May 15.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Mike Caddell asked U.S. District Judge Walter
S. Smith Jr. to schedule an evidentiary hearing to require the
government to show why it should not be held in contempt for
withholding ``original'' evidence from the court. Smith late last
year ordered the government to ship all original evidence in the
case to his court for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   An example of lost evidence, the motion alleged, are photographs
taken after the April 19, 1993, fire that led to the deaths of
David Koresh and 75 followers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Holle, a Texas Department of Public Safety crime scene
photographer at Mount Carmel, reviewed the rolls of film and field
notes turned over by the FBI. Holle reported that a roll of film
shot by him was missing, according to the motion. The missing
photographs were of items ``found inside the concrete bunker, i.e.,
bodies, guns and hand grenades,'' according to Holle, based on his
recollection.
</P>
<P>
   The missing roll of film is critical to the plaintiffs' case,
according to Caddell.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said an expert witness for the plaintiffs _ Dr. Joe
Burton, chief medical examiner for the city of Atlanta _ has
determined that many Davidians found inside a concrete bunker had
bullet wounds but were not shot at close range.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason Dr. Burton discounts the possibility that
these individuals were shot by gunfire originating outside of the
compound is their location within the concrete food storage area,''
Caddell's motion said. ``The absence of these photographs makes it
very difficult, if not impossible, to determine if any of these
persons were shot outside of that room and moved into it prior to
or after the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bradford, U.S. Attorney for Beaumont, acknowledged
original evidence may be missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have to remember is that this is many years after the
fact,'' said Bradford, who is assisting in the government's
defense. ``Things that are considered significant now might not
have been considered significant six years ago and people didn't
bother to retain the original.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford also said that the government faced a ``short
deadline'' to produce evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of lost evidence cited by Caddell's motion are
the aerial photographs of Mount Carmel taken on the day of the
fire. Charting the timing of the aerial photographs with the time
signatures on the infrared or FLIR tapes shows four major time gaps
in the sequencing _ consisting of approximately five, eight, eleven
and eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the photographs have been 'cherry-picked' to
provide only those photographs which are not incriminating,'' the
motion states.
</P>
<P>
   During the gaps in the aerial photography, Caddell said the FLIR
shows, among other things, apparent gun flashes from behind a
Combat Engineering Vehicle (CEV); a man apparently running from the
demolished corner of the gym to the diving platform at the corner
of the swimming pool; penetration of a CEV into the kitchen at the
front of Mount Carmel; and a lengthy period of time in which a CEV
and a tank retriever were side by side, with agents allegedly seen
between them.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI aerial photographer testified in his deposition that he
took 10 rolls of film, according to the motion. Caddell noted that
only seven rolls of film now exist.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said that Caddell's argument is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``The photographs taken were just randomly taken,'' Bradford
said. ``They were not taken in sequence with the FLIR tape. It was
just an individual taking pictures and not continually. To conclude
that because there were times he didn't snap pictures that
automatically means key photographs have been removed is jumping to
conclusions. He has no basis to make that conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell's motion also raised the question of whether the
government had doctored the so-called bug tapes _ made by slipping
listening devices into items like the milk cartons given the
Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   The government has claimed the bug tapes prove the Davidians
started the fire at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Transcripts taken from them contain references to ``spread the
fuel,'' and ``light the package.'' A government expert, Paul
Ginsberg, reportedly made copies from the original bug tapes last
September at Quantico, Va. Afterward, Ginsberg reported that he
initialed the originals.
</P>
<P>
   However, an expert witness for the plaintiffs, forensic tape
expert Steve Cain, did not find Ginsberg's initials on the bug
tapes given the court, according to Caddell's motion.
</P>
<P>
   Cain asserted in a report filed with the motion that the court's
bug tapes are probably copies, given their 60-cycle harmonic data,
``which is not consistent with original recordings but is
consistent with high-speed copies.''
</P>
<P>
   He also hinted the tapes were spliced together.
</P>
<P>
   Cain reported finding evidence of several ``start'' signatures
at various points on the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There existed a number of suspicious record events (i.e.
anomalies) which cast serious doubt on the tapes' originality and
authenticity,'' Cain wrote in his report.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCHH 19)  
 (af)  
 (Eds: Anthony Tommasini, a music critic of The New York Times, is
the author of ``Virgil Thomson: Composer on the Aisle.'')  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spring of 1947, the composer Virgil Thomson, then the
powerful chief music critic of The New York Herald Tribune,
received an inquiry from a young man, a fledgling culture critic,
that really ticked him off. The writer, seeking feedback, had sent
Thomson an excerpt from a feature piece he was preparing for
Harper's Bazaar on ``The Mother of Us All,'' Thomson's opera to a
text of Gertrude Stein, which was about to receive its premiere at
Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not too happy at seeing my score called whimsical,''
Thomson wrote back. ``Also, I think the idea that Stein and I are
primarily wits is, if you will permit me, both antiquated and
inaccurate. I should appreciate it if you could refer to `The
Mother of Us All' _ both the words and the music _ as a serious
work on a serious theme.'' That theme, of course, is women's
suffrage, and the title character is Susan B. Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to sabotage the article, Thomson ended his letter
tactfully: ``I am sorry to be so critical, because I know you spent
a great deal of thought on the paragraph which you sent me. But
since you have asked for my cooperation, I should be most grateful,
and so would Stein if she were living, for some word that would not
place us quite so definitely with the amusers.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Thomson, who died in 1989 at 92, many who have
enjoyed the opera would agree with the young writer that it is
whimsical. How could they not? On first impression, Stein's text is
delightfully wacky, and Thomson's score seems a crazy quilt of hymn
tunes, parlor songs, bugle calls, ditties and stretches of what
Thomson called his Missouri plainchant.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to a devoted core of admirers, including this critic, ``The
Mother of Us All,'' which comes to the New York City Opera this
Sunday afternoon in a new production by Christopher Alden first
unveiled at the Glimmerglass Opera in 1998, is the most original
and arguably the greatest of American operas.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1984 article in The New Yorker, Andrew Porter, an
infuential critic and opera scholar not known for a casual use of
superlatives, stated that every time he heard ``The Mother of Us
All'' he was ``tempted to consider it the best of all American
operas'' and, on calm reflection, would ``hardly modify that beyond
`one of the three best.'''
</P>
<P>
   True, other critics over the years have dismissed, even reviled
Thomson's two operas on Stein texts. (``Four Saints in Three Acts''
was the first, in 1928.) At worst, one would think, the operas are
harmless novelties. How can they elicit such vehemently negative
reactions?
</P>
<P>
   What typically arouses critics is the unabashed simplicity of
Thomson's style. The 20th century, especially in its early decades,
was characterized by radical innovation in music. Tonal harmony had
been explored, expanded and chromatically thickened, many composers
felt, to the point of inertia. Daring new atonal and 12-tone
musical languages emerged, along with complex rhythmic writing that
shattered regular meter and multilayered musical textures.
</P>
<P>
   Intellectual opinion during the 20th century, driven by
composers themselves, placed a premium on complexity and
methodological rigor in contemporary music. Even works thought to
be excessively complex failures were at least granted intellectual
respect.
</P>
<P>
   Decades before it became fashionable to do so, Thomson bucked
the trend by writing simply, with tonal harmonies, sometimes spiked
with polychords or dissonance, and lucid textures; a master of
prosody, he set words to music so that they were vividly clear. Yet
he tried to write simply in a way that was radical: a kind of
discombobulating simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when it doesn't work, a Thomson piece just sounds
simplistic. When it works, though, Thomson's simplicities seem
fresh and startling. And in none of his compositions did this
radical simplicity work more successfully than in ``The Mother of
Us All.''
</P>
<P>
   While a student of Nadia Boulanger in Paris during the
mid-1920s, Thomson kept abreast of emerging modernist techniques.
In 1926, he composed his raucous ``Sonata da Chiesa,'' impishly
scored for five disparate instruments: clarinet in E flat, trumpet,
viola, horn and trombone. He called it his ``bang-up graduation
piece in the dissonant neo-Baroque style of the period.''
</P>
<P>
   But he felt that the penchant for complexity and ``100 percent
dissonance saturation,'' as he put it, was quickly becoming stale.
So, taking inspiration from his idol Erik Satie, the champion of
inconsequence, he boldly started to compose as things came into his
head.
</P>
<P>
   He simplified his style and drew freely from the music of his
youth in Kansas City, Mo.: Baptist hymns, parlor songs, the band
concerts he attended in the park, his older cousin Cecil's banjo
playing. He also tapped the well of medieval and Renaissance vocal
music he sang as a member of the Harvard Glee Club, which was
directed for years by the pioneering early-music scholar Archibald
T. Davidson. Kansas City and Harvard met stylistically in Thomson's
landmark ``Symphony on a Hymn Tune'' of 1928, a work that
emboldened Aaron Copland to simplify his own style.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson's true declaration of independence from dissonant
complexity came just two months after his ``Sonata da Chiesa'' in
1926 with his first setting of a text by Stein. Thomson had
devoured Stein's works in college and longed to meet her. He
finally did, in Paris in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   Gratified by his appreciation of her work, the imposing American
expatriate writer welcomed Thomson into her circle. Even Stein's
jealously protective companion, Alice B. Toklas, was eventually won
over. The bond was sealed one day when the women found, left at
their door, the score to Thomson's setting of Stein's poem ``Susie
Asado.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The hermetic text would seem to be a portrait of a gracious
hostess, Susie Asado. The first lines read as follows. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet tea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Susie Asado. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet tea.
</P>
<P>
   Susie Asado. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Susie Asado which is a told tray sure. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once one gets immersed in Stein, it is possible to find hints of
meaning in the words and the wordplay. Asado apparently serves very
sweet tea at her gatherings, but she is also a ``sweet tea''
(sweetie) and a ``tray sure'' (treasure). Moreover, she is a
``told'' treasure, meaning, perhaps, that everyone speaks of her
graciousness and sweet tea.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson was fascinated not by the possible meaning in the text
but by the lack of it. In vocal works, clear expression mattered
intensely to him, but not clear meaning. ``My theory was that if a
text was set correctly for the sound of it, the meaning will take
care of itself,'' he wrote in his autobiography in 1966. ``And the
Stein texts, for prosodizing in this way, were manna.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomson treats Stein's words here with utter seriousness. The
vocal line carefully mimics the natural rhythm and flow of the
language; the piano part is spare: just eerie ascending scales in
parallel sevenths and ninths, and plain chords of open fifths. It's
simple yet stunning. This two-minute work was published by Cos Cob
Press in 1935 in a volume of 10 songs by a roster of emerging
American composers, among them Copland, Roger Sessions, Paul
Bowles, Israel Citkowitz and Marc Blitzstein. Today nothing in that
collection seems more radical than ``Susie Asado.''
</P>
<P>
   The libretto for ``Four Saints in Three Acts'' was the first
text Stein wrote specifically for Thomson to set. Finished in 1928,
the opera was not produced until 1934, by which time the creators
had weathered more than three years of a bitter breakup in their
friendship. The necessity of cooperating so that the premiere
production at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford could go forward
forced them to patch up the rift.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is hard to tell from Stein's obscure yet somehow
incantatory text, the opera is a community portrait of 16th-century
Spanish saints, some based on historical figures (Teresa of Avila
and Ignatius of Loyola) but most of them made up. Thomson set the
text despite having no idea what was supposed to be happening in
the opera.
</P>
<P>
   His friend, the painter Maurice Grosser, the closest Thomson had
in his life to a longtime companion, played a critical role by
devising a workable scenario for the dramatically abstract work:
the action would depict the daily rituals of worship, work and
pleasantry among the saints.
</P>
<P>
   The opera made history for its landmark premiere production,
which moved from Hartford to Broadway, where it ran for six weeks.
Thomson daringly cast the work entirely with black singers
recruited in Harlem. Florine Stettheimer created her famous sets
and costumes of cellophane and tulle. Frederick Ashton served as
choreographer and director; John Houseman was the creative
producer.
</P>
<P>
   Many aficionados consider ``Four Saints'' the purer of the two
Thomson-Stein operas. Porter has written lovingly of its
``simplicity, directness, candor, seriousness of utterance.'' A
sensitive production, he added, should leave an audience ``rapt in
a wonderful vision of holiness, rendered _ not without jokes, not
without wit _ in transfigured American speech and transfigured
American song.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the reaction to the work among nonmusicians (poets,
painters, dancers) was ecstatic, the opinions of musicians varied
wildly. The brainy, formidable Sessions hated it. During the New
York run, when the composer Theodore Chanler, who was writing about
the opera for the journal Modern Music, expressed enthusiasm after
a performance, Sessions blew up at him.
</P>
<P>
   He ``pulverized me with scorn and indignation at having dared to
like it,'' Chanler later wrote to Thomson. The young composer was
so intimidated that he reviewed the opera quite negatively, turning
Thomson against him until the truth came out, years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four Saints,'' innocent though it may seem, can still arouse
Sessions-like vitriol. ``The Mother of Us All'' has never been as
controversial and has thrived for years in smaller companies and
colleges. The City Opera production, the company's first, features
the dynamic soprano Lauren Flanigan in the title role.
</P>
<P>
   Though the opera's theme is women's suffrage, in a larger sense
it is a homage to 19th-century American political rhetoric. During
that era the lifeblood of the nation was captured in grandiloquent
orations rich with metaphors, classical allusions and quotes from
Shakespeare. Ordinary citizens routinely traveled great distances
to hear politicians speak and debate. Today, when ``I'm a uniter,
not a divider'' and similar banalities pass for presidential
campaign discourse, it is hard to understand how exciting political
oratory once was.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An early scene in the opera presents a great debate between two
historical figures who of course never actually met: Susan B.
Anthony and Daniel Webster. Stein weaves bits of speeches from the
era into this exchange of non sequiturs. ``Youth is young, I am not
old,'' Susan B. sings in stately, calm music; to which the
imperious Webster replies with grandiose lyricism, ``When the
mariner has been tossed for many days in thick weather, and on an
unknown sea, he naturally avails himself of the first pause in the
storm.'' Certainly, it's funny; but as set by Thomson, with verbal
crispness and mock grandeur, this nonsensical debate seems
genuinely stirring.
</P>
<P>
   The opera is filled with historical figures from different times
who confide in and bicker with each other, like President Andrew
Johnson, the actress Lillian Russell and a gruff, impatient Ulysses
S. Grant, who sings of himself, to a sort of bugle-call motif, ``He
knew that his name was not Eisenhower.''
</P>
<P>
   Two characters called Gertrude S. and Virgil T. serve as
narrators and comment on the opera as it goes along. Several of
Stein's real friends are characters in it, like Constance Fletcher,
a writer of novels, here portrayed as the romantic interest of John
Adams (presumably John Quincy Adams).
</P>
<P>
   Their slightly daffy love scenes are inexplicably touching.
Adams is constrained by his high position from actually doing
anything. ``Dear Constance Fletcher,'' he sings in his first,
gently melodic entreaty, ``it is a great pleasure that I kneel at
your feet.'' In the next breath, he sputters several phrases with
clipped rhythmic insistence: ``But I am an Adams, I kneel at the
feet of none, not anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he returns to his former sweetly lyrical vein. Soon, the
perplexed chorus, singing in emphatic, grim block chords, repeats
the sad facts of the scene just witnessed: ``If he had not been an
Adams, he would have kneeled at her feet.'' And so on. Thomson's
music pokes gentle fun at the heritage of tenor and soprano
operatic love duets yet rescues it from hackneyed sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   The constant verbal and musical interplay makes every moment of
the score, however simple on the surface, surprising. ``The Mother
of Us All'' invites you to listen to words for ``sound and syntax
only,'' as Thomson wrote. For once, you may disengage the part of
your brain that craves cogency and meaning.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the opera does have meaning. Through most of it, we are
exhilarated by Stein's jumbled history lesson and disorienting
language, and by Thomson's patchwork score. Then, in the final
scene, the spirit of the deceased Susan B. appears to sing what is
in effect her own elegy, ``All my long life.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally the music is not radically simple but straightforwardly
simple: a wistful melody, hymn-tune harmonies, the strains of a
church harmonium. Is even Wotan's sublime final scene in ``Die
Walkure'' more profound?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mother of Us All'' was Stein's last completed text. She
died during an operation for cancer on July 27, 1946, before
Thomson had written a note of the score. The premiere at Columbia
University, conducted by the composer Otto Luening, attracted many
major musicians of the day and was critically hailed.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson lived to see the day when an emerging generation of
postmodern composers saw him as a prophet before his time, who had
made straight the paths for a return to simplicity, accessibility
and the use of vernacular sources. Though such acknowledgment was
gratifying, to the end of his life Thomson yearned for respect as a
serious innovator.
</P>
<P>
   He was not against complexity as rendered by the master
composers of the day, just the puffed-up kind of complexity so
often produced by their imitators. A vibrant musical culture should
be able to celebrate Messiaen's ``St. Francois d'Assise'' as well
as Thomson's ``Four Saints in Three Acts.''
</P>
<P>
   In words that could be applied to himself, Thomson once
described Satie's aesthetic as having valued ``consequence,
quietude, precision, acuteness of auditory observation, gentleness,
sincerity and directness of statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The words apply especially to ``The Mother of Us All.'' Just
don't call it whimsical.

SPORTS COLUMN: OUT WEST, A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was only one play, one highlight, but did you happen to catch
the dunk Tuesday night? Did you see Sean Elliott come down the lane
and finish with a flourish?
</P>
<P>
   That didn't look much look like the so-called soft player that
too many people, yours truly included, for so long believed Elliott
to be.
</P>
<P>
   Not long before Elliott left the championship stage for a
hospital bed, before he accepted his brother's kidney and vowed to
play again for San Antonio, there was a day at a Knicks' practice
last June when the subject of Elliott's ``toughness'' was broached
with Don Chaney.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' assistant coach had presided over the
post-championship Detroit Pistons, the Bad Boys turned plain bad,
and was asked if he thought the Knicks might have a bully's edge
for the coming NBA finals over Elliott at small forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had physical problems when he was with us in Detroit,''
Chaney said. ``But then there was the question about whether he was
more of a West Coast player.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Chaney smiled knowingly and said, ``We'll find out.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Elliott's one season in Detroit, 1993-94, was about the
time he learned that he had focal segmental glomerular sclerosis, a
disease that prevents the kidneys from properly filtering waste
from the blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team doctors were saying that he had five years before
kidney failure,'' Matt Dobek, the Pistons' longtime vice president
of public relations, said Wednesday. ``They were alarmed, worried
about the guy's life. He wanted to play. We tried to trade him to
Houston but they looked at our reports and backed out. No one
wanted him, only San Antonio, and eventually we sent him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Laimbeer played in 11 games that season, and went home.
Isiah Thomas played in 58 games, tore his Achilles' tendon, and
retired. Allan Houston was a rookie. Acquired in a criticized trade
with the Spurs for Dennis Rodman, Elliott was said to be everything
the Bad Boys were not. He was, in the minds of the holdovers,
another Western Conference wimp, a symbol of a dynasty turned sour,
gone soft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact was, we weren't any good,'' Dobek said. ``We had no
big men, no help defense. Sean was heavily medicated, and he had
the worst year of his career.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been an All-Star the previous season, and always an
earnest, quick defender. The shallow labels we pin on individual
players in team situations are never easy to shake, though. Dan
Marino, who never had a running game to support his throwing,
retired this week and most testimonials ended with ``but he never
won the Super Bowl.'' By contrast, John Elway, who at the end of
his career lucked into Terrell Davis, is in the dot.com legends'
business with Gretzky and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott didn't have a great series against the Knicks, but it
looked a lot better when we found out that he had averaged 36
minutes and eight points with failing kidneys. Not without some
shame, I can recall Elliott getting a step on the defender in the
dying seconds of Game 5, the Spurs down a point. Soft player, I
thought. He will not take it hard to the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, of course, didn't have to, finding Avery Johnson on the
left baseline for what became the title-clinching jumper. More than
eight months and the kidney transplant later, he was challenging
Dikembe Mutombo and landing on his backside. But in the second half
came another chance to beat his man off the dribble. This time, he
took it to the rim and made his point with a power slam.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he said Wednesday, he was playing for something
greater, ``for people who are going through what I went through or
are just going through adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA managed to undersell the best story it had in this
season of the viewers' discontent. Greg Hughes of Turner Network
Television said the national telecast, Houston at Knicks, featured
cutaways to San Antonio and a pregame feature, but, as far as he
knew, the NBA did not ask the network to switch games.
</P>
<P>
   Here it had a returning member of the defending champions and
the first player to ever to play with a kidney transplant. It had
the donor, Noel Elliott, walking out in the Alamodome to a standing
ovation. The country settled for Jeff Van Gundy allowing the boom
mike into the Knicks' team huddle.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is fine. Humanity is grand. Sean Elliott, a modern
medical miracle, said he was a ``bundle of nerves'' warming up
Tuesday night. But he went, as they say, strong to the hole, and
proved, once and for all, he is as East Coast as they come.

 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States is home to at least twice as many native
species of plants, animals and other wild things _ more than
200,000 in all _ than had previously been thought, according to
what may be the most comprehensive survey of biological diversity
ever undertaken in America. The nation was also found to harbor a
more varied array of ecological systems than any other large
country.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation experts characterized the findings as an unexpected
piece of good news. But as many as one-third of the country's
species are considered imperiled to one degree or another,
according to the study, whose details are to be disclosed Thursday
in Washington by The Nature Conservancy, whose membership of more
than a million makes it the nation's largest private conservation
organization.
</P>
<P>
   In disclosing the results of the survey, the conservancy will
also announce that it has undertaken a five-year $1 billion effort
to preserve large tracts of what remains of wild America. It is
said to be the largest amount of money ever devoted to conservation
by a private organization in one campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The inventory of species was conducted over the last 25 years by
the conservancy's Natural Heritage Network, made up of survey
centers in all 50 states, most of them parts of state governments
and universities. The network's database on species and ecosystems
is widely viewed as the most complete and detailed in the nation,
and is the country's leading source of biological information for
conservation planners, government agencies and land managers.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, the information gleaned from the network's
extensive field surveys and other sources like museum collections
and scientific literature had never been pulled together to produce
a portrait of the status of wild America.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year analysis found that the 50 states contain about 10
percent of all known species on earth, and that the United States
ranks at or near the top among nations of the world in its variety
of mammals (mostly small ones), freshwater fishes, salamanders,
mussels, snails, crayfishes and needle-leafed evergreens like pine
trees.
</P>
<P>
   Among insects, by far the most numerous group of species, there
were many interesting surprises. The United States, for instance,
turns out to be extremely rich in bees, with nearly 4,000 native
species, most of them solitary rather than swarming creatures. And
the United States harbors more species of caddis flies, mayflies
and stoneflies, which are aquatic insects that support many
freshwater ecosystems and are beloved by trout fishermen, than any
other country.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, according to the survey, the United States has
a wider array of ecological regions _ big, distinctly different
swatches of nature like deserts, various kinds of forests,
grasslands and tundra _ than any other of the world's six largest
countries. By one calculation cited in the study, the United States
includes 21 of 28 different types of ecological regions worldwide,
five more than its nearest rival, the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   So lush and variegated is the new portrait of biological variety
in America that the conservancy will also announce Thursday its
commitment of $1 billion in new money to its long-established
effort to protect the wild landscape by buying up large parcels of
land or securing conservation easements on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've described biodiversity in a way that it's never
been described before,'' John C. Sawhill, the conservancy's
president, said of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Its findings, Sawhill said, make America's conservation task
more urgent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a more compelling reason now to invest $1 billion to
try to protect biodiversity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sawhill said $428 million had already been raised from private
sources for the five-year campaign, which has three more years to
run. Most of the money is to be devoted to conservation projects in
the United States, conservancy officials said, but some will be
spent abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the biological inventory and the financial
commitment ``is one of the most important conservation initiatives
I can remember,'' said Jamie Rappaport Clark, the director of the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which is charged with administering
the Endangered Species Act. ``The two-punch effort of the knowledge
and the resources is absolutely unparalleled.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort comes at a time when many conservationists say that
their enterprise is on the financial rise, as private gift-giving
has increased and governments have poured more money into acquiring
and protecting large tracts of landscape. Congress has appropriated
about $1 billion for that purpose over the last three fiscal years,
and in 1999 another $1.8 billion was provided by voters and
governments at the state and local level, according to figures
supplied by the conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now entering the era of big conservation, and this is
not a moment too soon,'' said Dr. Edward O. Wilson, the Harvard
University biologist and biodiversity expert, a member of the
conservancy's board.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the world's species are found in the tropics, and this
has led conservationists and scientists to focus much of their
attention there. The surprisingly high-diversity ranking of the
United States, Wilson said, results partly from the fact that most
scientists who study such matters live and work in the Northern
Hemisphere. The ranking of the United States will fall when the
tropics are better studied, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that countless species are still to be discovered
around the world. The new study says the United States itself may
actually contain double the number of species documented so far.
New ones are being discovered all the time; the study says 30
previously unknown species of flowering plants turn up in North
America every year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uncertainty, the study's authors say, it is clear
that the United States ``ranks quite high in terms of its biotic
diversity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce A. Stein, a conservancy scientist who is one of the
study's editors, put it this way: ``We have an amazing amount of
stuff. The bad news is that a lot of it is not in very good shape.
But there is time to protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 500 species were extinct or missing. Of the
more than 200,000 species, 7 percent were found to be critically
imperiled, 8 percent imperiled, 16 percent vulnerable and about
two-thirds were secure or apparently secure.
</P>
<P>
   Five special ``hot spots'' of imperilment emerged from the
analysis; that is, places where high numbers of species found
nowhere else are at risk: the San Francisco Bay area, Southern
California, the Death Valley region, the southern Appalachians and
the Florida Panhandle.

<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: RETRANSMITTING / ALSO MOVING IN
 &UR; THE ``L'' CATEGORY) &QL; 
Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``AFTERBURN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Colin Harrison (FSG, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The thing about thrillers is that so many of them are bad.
Abysmal, even. It's a genre so plagued by hack writers and
bush-league prose that when you find one like this, you want to
call it by another name. But a thriller it is _ the long, patient
kind, with underplayed dialogue and characters who sidestep
stereotype every time it shows up to claim them. The protagonist is
Charlie Ravich, a former Vietnam fighter pilot and POW now in his
late 50s who faces crisis in his private life and in his
multimillion-dollar corporate affairs. Harrison spends much of his
book establishing a thin connection between Charlie and a young
woman named Christina Welles, who has just been released from
prison and who, with her former boyfriend, is suspected of stealing
from a mobster who really, REALLY, wants his money back. There's
sex. There's violence (we don't want to spoil your fun if you have
a taste for it, but for the sake of the squeamish, we'll mention a
little torture scene involving an electric drill and a circular saw
_ and that's not the last of it). If you can take the gore, this
book is enough to give a weak genre a good name. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``CINEMA SOUTHWEST'' &QL; 
 &UR; By John A. Murray (Northland, $21.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The photo on the cover is of John Ford making a scene from ``The
Searchers'' in 1956, but that's just the predictable side of
filmmaking in the American Southwest. Think of the alternatives. In
1965, Max Von Sydow, as Jesus, delivered the Sermon on the Mount on
Utah's Green River Overlook in ``The Greatest Story Ever Told.''
Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda camped in Anasazi ruins on their way
east in ``Easy Rider.'' Robert Duvall turned his life around on the
Texas prairie in ``Tender Mercies,'' and in ``Bonnie and Clyde,''
Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway robbed an actual bank in the rural
community of Pilot Point, Texas _ the same bank that the real
Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow had robbed about 40 years earlier.
In this book, due out at the end of the month, Murray looks at the
Southwest and its starring role in so many American films. Included
are some great photographs _ our favorite, we confess, is of John
Wayne (in ``She Wore a Yellow Ribbon'') looking grandly out at that
mist-shrouded Big Daddy of film locations, Monument Valley. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``EATING WELL FOR OPTIMUM HEALTH'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Andrew Weil (Knopf, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a chapter here in which Weil sets out to devise what he
calls ``the worst diet in the world,'' which after a few paragraphs
sounded so suspiciously like our own bill of fare that we began to
wonder whether Weil had us under surveillance. It was humbling, but
more fun to read than, say, the section called ``A Healing Story:
From French Fries to Kale,'' or ``The Macronutrients: An
Overview.'' But we are not hopeless, no siree. We love broccoli. We
love salmon. Unfortunately, we have learned from Weil that not all
salmon are equal, that we need to worry not only about our own
diets but about the diets of the fish we eat, which is one step
further down the food chain than we care to go. Eggs are another
research project. ``Eggs of chickens,'' Weil writes, ``(are) good
sources of omega-3 fatty acids if they come from free-range
chickens or chickens whose diets are supplemented with omega-3-rich
algae.'' Are we up to this task? No, but we know that Weil has made
many converts-to-wellness, so rush to the store: His new book is
out, with the author looking hale and hearty on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``TIGERS IN THE SNOW''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Peter Matthiessen (North Point, $27) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of us know that the tiger is beautiful, but we also have
been raised with an unshakable idea of its fierceness, the
fearsome, predatory aggression of Shere Khan in Rudyard Kipling's
``The Jungle Book.'' But Matthiessen points out that the hunter,
Jim Corbett, in his book ``The Man-eaters of Kumaon,'' refers to
the tiger as ``a large-hearted gentleman of bottomless courage.''
That's what this book aims to give you _ a new look at the tiger,
at its history, its endangered habitats, its dwindling numbers, its
extreme vulnerability to poachers, and finally, at the efforts of
researchers and wildlife biologists to study and preserve it. The
book also conveys the quiet majesty of the animal, largely through
the author's eloquent interest and regard for it. With an
introduction and color photographs by Maurice Hornocker, tiger
expert and co-founder of the Siberian Tiger Project. Matthiessen's
fans should also look for ``The Peter Matthiessen Reader''
(Vintage, $14), in which editor McKay Jenkins assembles excerpts
from the author's books of non-fiction, including ``The Snow
Leopard'' and ``Men's Lives.'' &QL;

N.Y. STATE TO CRACK DOWN ON UNSCRUPULOUS LENDING TO HOMEOWNERS

 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Regulators in New York state, the nation's largest
banking center and an industry pace setter, are devising new rules
to crack down on predatory lenders who impose exorbitant fees that
force countless homeowners into foreclosure and bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The abuses at issue are the underbelly of the lucrative $280
billion national market in so-called subprime loans that serve
borrowers with limited credit ratings. Although such loans charge
higher interest rates, they have been a godsend to many people who
otherwise might not get financing.
</P>
<P>
   But some unscrupulous operators seek out unsophisticated
clients, typically elderly or minority homeowners or first-time
buyers in poor areas. They talk the victims into refinancing or
applying for other loans saddled with excessive interest and fees.
The lenders and brokers collect their fees up front. If the
borrower falls in arrears, the mortgage holder seizes the house.
</P>
<P>
   With action on the issue apparently stalled in Congress, the New
York State Banking Board is flexing its powers to license and
oversee mortgage bankers and brokers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, who appoints the board, ordered it to take
up the issue last year after an investigation of a major lender,
Delta Funding, by Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. Pataki was stung
by Spitzer's suggestion that his regulators had gone easy on Delta.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The final regulations, which would apply to so-called high-cost
home loans, are expected to win the board's unanimous support in
the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it will become a model for similar regulation and
legislation in other states and on a nationwide basis,'' said
Elizabeth McCaul, the acting superintendent of banks and the
board's chairwoman. ``We want to end abusive practices, but we
don't want to inadvertently cut off access to credit in those
communities where we are trying to create more access.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulations would make impose several new standards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Defining high-cost loans as those that charge interest more
than eight percentage points above the comparable U.S. Treasury
rate, or up-front fees greater than five points on a loan (a point
is 1 percent of the total loan amount). For second mortgages and
other home loans, the threshold would be nine percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring lenders to consider borrowers' ability to repay and
notify them that impartial credit counseling is available.
</P>
<P>
   _ Banning negative amortization (in which the principal grows),
balloon payments before seven years and higher-interest penalties
after a default.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limiting certain fees and points to 5 percent of the loan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prohibiting the ``packing'' of certain insurance and other
costs into the loan, the ``flipping'' of loans by refinancing at
excessively higher costs, the charging of bogus fees for services
not rendered and unfair mandatory arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   While McCaul said the proposals had broad support from the
public and the lending industry, consumer groups say the plan does
not go far enough. A joint statement from 70 groups and 12 elected
officials last month said the proposal ``leaves serious and glaring
loopholes what would allow creative lenders and brokers, in too
many instances, to continue their predatory practices as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Those endorsing the statement included the American Association
of Retired Persons; New York Public Interest Research Group;
Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, known as
Acorn; Harlem Consumer Education Council; and Greater Rochester
Community Reinvestment Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``All eyes are on the New York State Banking Department,'' said
Sarah Ludwig, a leader of a statewide coalition of groups against
predatory lending. ``The whole country is watching. It's a huge
problem, and they've got to get this right. What's clear is they're
not really serious about putting the screws to this industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Lending-industry leaders, worried that that a few disreputable
lenders are tainting the rest, say they want the abuses stopped.
But they caution that overly stringent rules would hamper
legitimate lenders and curtail access to loans for people who need
them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one bad actor, it puts a black eye on the entire
industry,'' said Robert S. Lotstein, counsel to the National
Association of Mortgage Brokers, which has 12,000 members. ``We are
certainly against predatory lending, but if we need any additional
safeguards, they should be narrowly tailored so that we don't throw
the baby out with the bath water.''
</P>
<P>
   And Stephen A. O'Connor, director for residential financing for
the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, which has 3,000
members, said: ``New York is a bellwether state. Whatever they do
is often copied or emulated.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Other states are also considering action: bills have been filed
this year in the legislatures of California, Illinois, Maryland,
Minnesota, Missouri and South Carolina. The industry warns that a
state-by-state hodgepodge of 50 systems would hinder lenders and
drive up costs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We would much prefer uniformity to a patchwork,'' Lotstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   The subprime lending market exploded after Congress changed the
banking laws in the 1980s in an effort to help the battered savings
and loan industry. The pressure for new regulations stems from a
surge of complaints about loan abuses by a number of lenders. One
high-profile company, First Alliance, a national company with four
offices in New York state, has been under investigation by the
federal Justice Department and regulators in seven states,
including New York.
</P>
<P>
   The only state that has enacted rules against predatory lending
so far is North Carolina, under a law passed last year in a
compromise reached by consumer groups, some industry groups and
government officials. Consumer advocates in New York say that North
Carolina's version is a far stricter and better precedent than the
proposal pending in New York.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina, a major banking state, is home to BankAmerica,
First Union and Wachovia. Since the law is still being phased in,
it is too early to judge the effect, although Alan S. Hirsch, a
deputy to Attorney General Michael F. Easley, a leading proponent,
said: `It's very plain to us that all the major lenders can live
with this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lotstein said, ``We've had clients who have decided it's
just not desirable to do business there anymore, and some have
turned in their licenses.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In New York state, consumer groups say, the regulators have
already yielded to industry criticism and have ignored the
revisions they urged.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig said the coalition wants the rules to bar common devices
like the financing of all points and fees, penalties for paying off
a loan early, the financing of insurance charges paid years in
advance, all balloon payments and all mandatory arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   The critics also say that the regulations should require
stricter review of a borrower's ability to repay and put greater
limits on the frequency of refinancing and on the use of so-called
discount points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposed regulations simply overlook too many victims of
predatory lending,'' said an Acorn member, Gloria Waldron of East
New York, Brooklyn. ``Almost no cases we've seen would even fall
under their definition of high-cost loans.''
</P>
<P>
   Abuses take many forms, beginning with deceptive advertising of
``free money'' and high-pressure sales pitches. In Brooklyn,
unethical brokers comb through court records to find homeowners
already facing foreclosure. The brokers talk the owners into new
loans that save their homes temporarily but sink them deeper into
debt as the operators strip out the remaining equity to pay their
excessive fees.
</P>
<P>
   Some lenders have even preyed on homeowners who have been
declared mentally incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the loans start with shady home improvement contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Acorn cited a couple in Port Jefferson Station on Long Island
who missed a payment and found their interest rate jacked up, to 24
percent from 14. In Brooklyn, a woman told a lender she had lost
her $8,000-a-year job as a home health aide, but it approved a loan
anyway, falsely listing her with a $50,000 salary. Another woman
learned too late that her $45,000 loan required monthly payments of
$500 for 15 years _ $90,000 total _ yet left her owing a balloon
payment of $41,000.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is worst in minority neighborhoods that have been
neglected because of ``redlining'' by more traditional, lower-cost
lenders, critics say. Subprime lenders fill that vacuum. In New
York City, the legacy of predatory abuses has been a proliferation
of foreclosures that community advocates say is devastating central
Brooklyn and southeastern Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Barbara M. Clark, D-Queens, has proposed a bill
that would create protections beyond the proposed banking board
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen people losing their homes outright as a result of
home improvement or debt consolidation loans,'' Clark said.
``They're putting their homes on the line and don't know what
they're getting into, with fees and interest that are just off the
scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Her bill would entitle homeowners to cite an improper loan as a
legal defense to prevent foreclosure. It would also cap brokers'
fees at 3 percent, require disclosure of finder's fees that lenders
pay to home improvement contractors for recruiting borrowers, and
hold bankers responsible for the brokers they deal with.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed several committees last year but did not reach
the Assembly floor. Sen. Frank Padavan, R-Queens, has sponsored the
Senate version.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody needs to do something,'' said Brenda J. Thompson, a
school teacher in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, who said she was
victimized by a subprime lender.
</P>
<P>
   After inheriting her mother's brownstone, which had a small
mortgage with a monthly payment of $154, she talked to a contractor
and lender about renovations. But she was upset when crews tore out
walls without her approval or a loan being issued.
</P>
<P>
   So she went to another lender, who seemed sympathetic and
referred her to a new contractor. He was charming but overcharged
her with a $70,000 fee, took an additional $6,000 of her money and
did incomplete and shabby work, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She was left with a $105,000 loan at 10.9 percent with a $1,002
monthly payment and a balloon balance.

INVESTORS CAST DOUBT ON SPECULATION OF AN EBAY-YAHOO TIE-UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Market Place column) 
(js) 
 By SAUL HANSELL and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So has eBay put itself up for the ultimate auction?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not, financiers close to eBay said Wednesday, the
morning after CNBC carried a report that the company was in talks
that could lead to an acquisition of the auction site by Yahoo, the
big Web portal.
</P>
<P>
   But they said eBay was still trying to figure out a deal that
would let it tap into Yahoo's huge audience of Internet users, as
it had already done with America Online and Disney's Go Network. An
outright sale is far less likely, because eBay's $26 billion market
value makes it an expensive prize.
</P>
<P>
   Even a limited deal that would put eBay auctions on Yahoo's site
would be complex, as Yahoo now has the No. 2 auction service.
</P>
<P>
   And while analysts said rumors about a possible merger had sent
both stocks higher in recent days, investors Wednesday appeared to
conclude that a deal was unlikely, analysts said. Ebay's stock
closed at $189.515625, off $21.484375 from Tuesday's close, while
Yahoo fell to $158.50, a decline of $10.25.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, on the Internet anything is possible, and certainly
there have been any number of cases where companies that began to
talk about small deals wound up at the altar. And few analysts
would have predicted that America Online and Time Warner would be
able come to merger terms, given the disparities of their stock
market valuations.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, analysts and financiers say a combination of Yahoo
and eBay _ two of the few profitable Internet companies _ is, in
fact, more sensible than many possible deals bandied about since
the America Online-Time Warner merger.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, despite a 35 percent drop in stock price since the start
of the year, still has a market value of $96 billion, big enough
buy almost any company willing to take its stock.
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo has steadfastly insisted that its best opportunity is
to be a Switzerland of the Web, linking to information from a wide
range of sources. Devoting more resources to creating its own
information or entertainment, or even buying a media company, it
argues, is simply a burden that will drag down its high margins.
And it is counting on its brand to continue to drive traffic,
rather than owning (or being owned by) a telecommunications
company.
</P>
<P>
   Many wonder whether Yahoo will be able to maintain this strategy
as the focus of the Internet shifts from pages of text to audio and
video delivered over high-speed connections. AOL is betting that it
is better to own both the content from Time Warner's television,
movie and music properties, and the distribution from the company's
cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, by contrast, has maintained its model, buying
Broadcast.com, which maintains links to a wide range of audio and
video content by others. And it just started FinanceVision, a daily
Internet video feed on business and stock market news. It does have
live anchors, but they act as a human search engine, providing
introductions and links to video feeds provided by others.
</P>
<P>
   The one place where Yahoo's strategy has shifted over the years
is that it increasingly wants to earn fees from linking buyers and
sellers, both in its shopping channel and in its auction service.
This approach to electronic commerce can have much higher margins
than the messy and expensive business of running warehouses and
holding inventory that Amazon.com is in.
</P>
<P>
   And no one has proved the potential of such an electronic
marketplace as well as eBay, which has transformed an electronic
flea market of classified advertising into a huge, rapidly growing
and profitable community of buyers and sellers. Ebay's growth has
continued, even in the face of competition from Amazon, the Web's
biggest store, and Yahoo, which lets sellers list items free. (Ebay
and Amazon charge listing fees and take a percentage of each
completed sale.)
</P>
<P>
   So eBay, analysts say, is perhaps the best single acquisition
target for Yahoo. It would make it the undisputed leader in
person-to-person commerce, while keeping the company focused on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a traditional media company would dovetail with
Yahoo's vision, but eBay would give them a great way to monetize
their large user base,'' said Paul Noglows, an analyst with Chase
H&AMP;Q.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the biggest stumbling block for Yahoo is the price.
Henry Blodget, Merrill Lynch's Internet analyst, suggested that
Yahoo could pay up to $300 a share for eBay _ or $40 billion _
without suffering any significant dilution in its earnings. But
others question whether Yahoo, which has a reputation for being
extraordinarily cheap, would be willing to give up what would be 30
percent of the equity in the combined company to get eBay.
</P>
<P>
   For eBay, by contrast, the issue is whether the company needs to
link with a broader service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategic question for eBay is what comes after
auctions,'' said Jim Breyer, a partner at venture firm Accel
Partners. ``To justify their valuation they have to get bold about
their strategy and move beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that eBay has plenty of growth left. In recent
weeks it expanded its auction model to other markets including used
cars and business equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If eBay stays independent, it can become a much bigger company
than it is today,'' said Jamie Kiggen, a Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette analyst. ``The bear case on eBay rested primarily on the
idea their opportunity was not very large. Just in the last two
weeks they have shown they can identify new markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, eBay is constantly looking for ways to expand its
audience and head off potential competitors.
</P>
<P>
   As much as a year ago, even as Yahoo was readying its own
auction site, eBay executives were holding exploratory
conversations with the company about how to capitalize on Yahoo's
extensive distribution network. Then, the dialogue centered mostly
around a strategic partnership, although the two companies flirted
with the idea of a potential merger. Those talks faltered though,
and Yahoo and eBay soon found themselves competitors in the online
auction market.
</P>
<P>
   After that, eBay negotiated, and subsequently expanded, an
arrangement with America Online to operate auctions on all of AOL's
various services. And this year, Disney's Go Network abandoned its
own auction plans and decided to offer links to eBay instead.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay, obviously, would love to gain access to Yahoo's audience
as well, the second largest on the Internet after America Online.
But analysts say such a deal would be more complex than eBay's
arrangements with AOL and Disney, as it would have to find a way to
account for Yahoo's existing auction service. Perhaps, analysts
said, eBay could buy Yahoo auctions for some combination of cash or
eBay shares.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay and Yahoo officials declined to discuss any potential
business arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Farley, an e-commerce analyst at PaineWebber, said it might
be smartest for eBay to partner with as many companies as possible
and not limit itself to an alliance with a single company. ``In
this market they don't know who the next newcomer will be,'' she
said. ``They don't want to limit their options.''

BLEAK WORKS BELIE WRITER RICK MOODY'S JOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
   
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: RETRANSMITTING; ALSO MOVING IN THE ``L'' CATEGORY)
 &UR; Never mind that his novels employ less-than-joyful themes _
electrocution, prepubescent sex, ailing mothers who dribble
``stalactites of drool,'' drug addiction, self-immolation, Richard
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Moody has written such bleak stories as ``The Ice Storm,'' which
became the bleak 1997 Ang Lee-directed movie starring Kevin Klein
and Sigourney Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Writing gloom under cover of mirth, he follows a daily regimen
but works only when the spirit moves him. At his home on Fishers
Island in Long Island Sound, he might write by day or he might
write all night, a comfortable schedule that fosters bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hypothesis is that the best way to convey joy to my readers
is if I am joyful when I'm on the job,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Joy brings productivity. At age 38, he's already published three
novels (``The Ice Storm,'' `` Garden State, Purple America''), a
collection of short stories (``The Ring of Brightest Angels Around
Heaven'') and edited a collection of essays titled ``Joyful Noise''
_ and there's that word again.
</P>
<P>
   Although Moody has been variously compared to the greats who
preceded him _ Cheever, Roth, Updike _ he modestly dismisses such
accolades, eschewing public-relations hype while recognizing that
hype and a hit movie have made him a marketable author who so far
can depend on each new work's being accepted by his publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim also drags him into the Okefenokee Swamp of the book
tour, slogging across America to tout his latest work, leaving
behind his longtime companion, Amy, a computer-software writer who
comes along only to the more attractive cities.
</P>
<P>
   Amy will be coming along when Moody speaks during the Phoenix
Public Library's lecture series, ``Soothing Words,'' a three-month
event that began in January. This month's featured writers include
Moody on Thursday, March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Moody will appear at 7 p.m. at the Burton Barr Phoenix Central
Library to read from his coming collection of stories,
``Demonology,'' due out in January.2001.)
</P>
<P>
   Then he and Amy will head for his father's winter home in
Wickenburg, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Moody is a writer's writer, besotted by the English
language, heir to legendary wordsmiths Hemingway, Fitzgerald,
Joyce, Bellow, Beckett. He loves words as a writer because he loves
words as a reader and sprinkles his conversation with literary
quotations.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's own work is highly stylized _ too much so, some critics
say. But he prides himself on writing that has become denser over
the course of three novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made language exciting again,'' he says, less a boast
than an exaltation in the sheer beauty of well-crafted prose.
</P>
<P>
   Moody has been writing for 30 years. As a boy, he dabbled, but
he was easily distracted by other boyhood occupations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lacked follow-through,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Childhood in suburban Connecticut appeared idyllic from the
outside, but he confesses to harboring ``demons,'' suffering
frequent illnesses and being overly sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivity that plagued him in his youth has served him
well as an adult observer of human emotions. He credits his
``finely calibrated compass that picks up what's going on in a
room.''
</P>
<P>
   In his teens, Moody began to write in earnest, producing short
stories and poems.
</P>
<P>
   Son of literary parents, he majored in English at Brown
University and began to write ``Garden State'' in 1986 while living
in Hoboken, N.J., holding down a day job in the editorial
department of the Simon &AMP; Schuster publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   Although the job slowed work on his novel, it taught him the
intricacies of the publishing business _ how to find an agent, how
to write a contract. It did not help sell his book, which was
rejected 22 times in a 15-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Moody despaired of drowning in the seas of rejection. Then, a
small press called Pushcart threw him a lifeline and even awarded
him its Pushcart Editors' Book Award.
</P>
<P>
   Work on his second novel, ``The Ice Storm,'' began in 1990.
Having quit his day job, he was able to write more swiftly,
completing the book in just two years. He was single then,
supporting himself on freelance editing and living hand to mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ice Storm'' was accepted by big-time publisher Little,
Brown and Co., and Moody forged a relationship with an editor who
respects his distinctive style.
</P>
<P>
   Moody became proficient at his craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured out how to tell a story,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Moody tries to do something different with each of his works,
their thread ``fealty to human emotions and human psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Garden State'' is the story of disaffected youth lost in
suburban New Jersey, contemplating life, death and rock and roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purple America'' is a deeply emotional book that examines how
one family's remorse ``trickles down through the generations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Black Veil,'' a non-fiction work due out this summer,
comes from family folklore about the Rev. Joseph Moody, said to
have inspired ``The Minister's Black Veil,'' a short story by
American author Nathaniel Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Ice Storm'' has been his bestseller, thanks in part to
the movie. The grim saga traces a brief span in the life of
Benjamin Hood, a suburbanite bored with marriage who dallies with a
neighbor, struggles to rein in his precocious daughter, Wendy, and
tries to discover himself during the sexual liberation of the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Moody was warned to fear the worst from Hollywood, and ``I DID
fear the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting the respected Ang Lee, who also directed ``Sense and
Sensibility,'' allayed those fears. One red flag raised was the
casting of Christina Ricci, who had appeared in such films as ``The
Addams Family'' and ``Casper.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ricci's teen sexpot portrayal impressed Moody, as did the
film as a whole. Now he is waiting to hear about options on his
other works. Buoyed by his positive experiences with ``The Ice
Storm,'' he would happily return to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   With such success comes book tours, not the choicest part of the
profession. One tour took Moody on the road for five grueling
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But he enjoys meeting his readers, most of whom are under age
40.
</P>
<P>
   Writing is an isolating profession, after all, he notes as he
sits alone in his home on Fishers Island, while Amy lives across
the water in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   It is Amy who reads his work first and then filters the reviews,
passing along only those that offer constructive criticism.
Although wary of shaping his style to please critics, Moody says he
sometimes can learn from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust in the possibility that some harsh criticism will give
me an opportunity to improve,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And improvement brings joy. &QL; Reach the reporter at

 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an extraordinary surge of interest in an electronic book,
Stephen King's latest novella, featuring a Mustang-driving ghost,
has proved so popular in two days of literary life on the Internet
that several online booksellers could not meet the demand from
people wanting to download digital copies.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher said Wednesday that 400,000 orders were received
in the first 24 hours after the novella, ``Riding the Bullet,''
became available on various retailers' Web sites. Readers
overwhelmed the sites with purchases or orders to download the
digital horror story into their computers, electronic readers or
Palm Pilots.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed sure whether the surprising demand marked the
beginning of a revolution in the fledgling electronic publishing
market, where individual literary works have not sold more than a
few hundred copies, or simply resulted from the novelty of having a
marquee author dabble in bytes.
</P>
<P>
   The novella, the equivalent of 66 written pages, was given away
on the first day by some booksellers to nurture the infant market,
but others were getting brisk orders at $2.50 a copy. The 400,000
figure included both the paid and free downloads, as well as orders
received but not yet filled because of the heavy demand. But even
factoring in the free copies, the enormous first-day demand has
markedly raised the profile of electronic books.
</P>
<P>
   The early sales and orders far outstripped demand for any
traditional book in a similar fleeting period, said Jack Romanos,
president and chief operating officer of Simon &AMP; Schuster, King's
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stunned,'' said Romanos, who has worked in the publishing
industry for more than 30 years. ``I don't think anybody could have
anticipated how many people were out there who are willing to
accept the written word in a paperless format. It's got to be
similar to what the people at Pocket Books went through years ago
when they got the early sales results on the first paperbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were not so sure that a revolution was at hand. They
pointed out that King was a special case _ a best-selling writer
with a huge cult following _ and that the attempt to distribute the
book in volume showed the bugs in the electronic system. Untold
numbers of customers were not able to download the necessary
software for reading or to reach the sites once they had it.
</P>
<P>
   The sales came in the same week that a new wave of prominent
authors were entering the electronic market. For generous dot.com
advances of up to $100,000, 10 authors were commissioned by the
California-based electronic bookseller Fatbrain.com to write short
essays about the Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Among the writers and celebrities, whose essays begin appearing
this week, are Coretta Scott King, Newt Gingrich, Pete Hamill and
Doris Kearns Goodwin. In addition, on Wednesday Fatbrain announced
the signing of a contract with Toni Morrison to publish her 1993
Nobel Prize acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   The sales for these efforts, however, will no doubt pale beside
the demand for King's tale of an impoverished hitchhiker in Maine
who catches a ride with a nightmarish driver. On Amazon.com, which
is offering the title free for two weeks, customers demanded copies
at the rate of one every 1.5 seconds on the first day it was
available. Barnesandnoble.com, which gave away copies only on
Tuesday, the first day of sale, said that customers requested the
title at the rate of 2.5 per second. Some of those first-day orders
may have been duplications as unsuccessful readers tried repeatedly
to put in their orders.
</P>
<P>
   But NetLibrary, an electronic bookseller based in Boulder,
Colo., offered versions of the novella for $2.50 per copy without
interruption, selling them at the rate of 400 an hour. Under his
agreement with Simon &AMP; Schuster, which is the same arrangement he
has for his books, King will receive more than 50 percent of the
profits from the sales.
</P>
<P>
   First-day sales of hardback books by blockbuster writers like
John Grisham, Tom Clancy or King can run between 30,000 and 75,000,
publishing executives said. The books usually cost $25 to $27.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic titles can be delivered in a variety of forms. A
reader can download digital material from a Web bookseller on a
handheld mini-computer, although fewer than 10,000 of these devices
have been sold. Customers can also downloading material directly
into their personal computers for reading with Glassbook software.
Glassbook was so overwhelmed with requests for its software as a
result of the King novella that it posted an apology for delays on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Palm Pilot holders can be used to download books
from personal computers, but the handheld devices have small
reading screens. In all the formats, the digital material is
secured so readers cannot print versions from computers or e-mail
the text to others.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the early frenzy over ``Riding the Bullet,'' some
skeptics think the results were skewed by the free copies and the
author's loyal following.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same crowd buying, with the big advantage that they
can buy it faster and easier online,'' said Robert E. Baensch, a
former publishing executive and director of New York University's
Center for Publishing. ``We're only talking about one of the most
popular superstar authors.''
</P>
<P>
   Baensch added that he expected sales to fade to King's usual
sales volume, which leveled out at about 1.3 million per title for
his more recent works.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fatbrain's move to commission works by name authors was also a
bid to promote the infant market for electronic books and to raise
publicity for the bookseller's newly opened e-book Web site,
MightyWords. Fatbrain is offering the Bill of Rights essays for
free.
</P>
<P>
   The company _ which is backed by millions of dollars from
investors like Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft _ is also in
final discussions to post some digitized collections from the
Bancroft Library at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   But in the delicate process of forging new alliances, Fatbrain
has collided with Simon &AMP; Schuster, King's publisher, which was
riled by the company's brashness in blurring the lines between
retailer and publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the popularity of the Stephen King title, Simon &AMP;
Schuster refused to allow Fatbrain to offer the book on its Web
site for popular books, which posts about 6,000 digital works and
sells them for an average of $3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get it,'' said Chris MacAskill, the chief executive
of Fatbrain.com. ``The stated reason is that we were going out
there and signing up authors.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last year and a half, MacAskill has been trying to seed
the market for electronic books by persuading authors to post
material online of 10 to 100 pages. Initially, he said, traditional
publishers were not interested in the short format, so Fatbrain
started acting like a magazine publisher, commissioning short
pieces for generous advances subsidized by venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict with Simon &AMP; Schuster grew out of Fatbrain's
approaches to several the publisher's authors, including Goodwin,
the historian, and Seth Godin, author of ``Permission Marketing.''
The company maintains that there are no contract violations if it
is not signing a book publisher's authors to write works that are
book length. MacAskill said he was advised by Simon &AMP; Schuster that
he should have sought its permission before approaching the
authors.
</P>
<P>
   Romanos, the Simon &AMP; Schuster president, said that a new,
evolving market calls for a redefinition of what is a book.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key question in electronic publishing _ and one that's
been worked out over many years in traditional publishing _ is who
is a publisher, and who is a retailer and distributor?'' Romanos
said. ``We're more than willing to work with any distributor who
can satisfy the technical and security requirements to protect our
copyrights. But when a distributor decides to take on the
additional role of a publisher, then we will definitely view them
as a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Far removed from such tensions and horrors of publishing was
Stephen King himself. His assistant in Maine said that he was in
Florida, too preoccupied with his own writing to respond to
questions about the success of his first electronic effort.
</P>
<P>
   King, who was seriously injured in an automobile accident last
summer, is making great strides in his recovery, according to his
publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   But the author, whose has written more than 40 books, from ``The
Dead Zone'' to ``Desperation,'' did issue a simple statement about
his electronic title:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very excited at the possibility of a new market opening
up, and as a dedicated and long-term Mac user I am surprised and a
little unhappy at how hard it is for Mac users to access the story,
but thank God for the Palm Pilot, which is making it accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``While I think that the Internet and various computer
applications for stories have great promise, I don't think anything
will replace the printed word and the bound book. Not in my
lifetime, at least.''

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport could
receive $700 million more in federal help for its expansion plans
under legislation Congress approved Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The $40 billion in federal funding goes a long way in helping
the world's busiest airport put together the $5.4 billion it needs
for its 10-year growth program, Hartsfield General Manager Ben
DeCosta said. But holes remain in Hartsfield's financial game plan.
In the $5.4 billion expansion, federal grants are expected to cover
about $245 million, ticket taxes about $1.9 billion with another
$1.1 billion coming from airport and other revenues and about $1.3
billion in bonds underwritten by the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   With the boost from the bill approved Wednesday, the airport is
still about $200 million short, DeCosta said. He is exploring other
funding sources.
</P>
<P>
   The aviation spending bill, which already passed the Senate, won
on a 319-101 House vote and is expected to be signed soon by
President Clinton. Atlanta officials were heavily involved in
lobbying Congress for the funding, including an appearance by Mayor
Bill Campbell at hearings and letter-writing efforts by DeCosta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Atlanta airport is one of the great generators of the
aviation economy,'' said U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), in whose
district the airport is located. ``Hartsfield is the gateway to the
South. It's the busiest commercial airport in the world. This will
mean a great deal in terms of keeping the American people moving
and growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield's expansion plan includes adding a fifth runway,
building another terminal, revamping the internal road network and
adding passenger gates and parking spaces. The runway is expected
to be completed in 2005, when takeoffs and landings are expected to
rise to more than 2,700 per day, compared to 2,500 now.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield handled 78 million passengers last year and airport
officials project that number will reach 121 million by 2015.
Hartsfield pumps about $9 billion a year into the metro area's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation doubles federal funding to Hartsfield from $9
million to $18 million. The total to Georgia airports will rise
from $15 million to $29.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the most critical part of the package includes allowing
airports to charge as much as $4.50 per ticket in a tax to fund
airport expansion. Hartsfield now charges $3, and DeCosta said the
Atlanta airport immediately will apply for FAA permission to charge
the additional tax. The tax, he said, could produce $700 million
over the next 10 years, ``and possibly even more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Georgia's congressional delegation voted in support of
the aviation bill; Republicans Mac Collins and Jack Kingston voted
against.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he did not want to levy another tax on passengers.
``With passengers and air travelers already getting hit with higher
fuel taxes, it doesn't make sense to raise the fee,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Some congressional opponents said the bill would lead to more
air traffic in already congested skies.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), a member of the House
Transportation Committee, said the bill would increase safety at
Hartsfield and the rest of the state's airports by paying for
improvements in technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who uses increasing flights as a reason to be worried
about this bill doesn't understand what's happening in the world,''
Isakson said. ``Aviation use over the next 10 to 20 years is going
to triple. And because of technology, because the world has gotten
so much smaller, because so many more people participate in the
world market today, aviation is just going to grow exponentially,
which is the reason why you need a bill like this so you can make
the improvements in air safety.''

LDS CHURCH OFTEN STILL MISUNDERSTOOD

   &UR; (RETRANSMITTING: EDITORS: INCLUDES KEY
 &UR; POINTS, LIST OF BELIEFS AT END OF TAKE.
 &UR; ALSO MOVING IN THE ``L'' CATEGORY) PHOENIX _ In some ways, the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a quintessential
American success story.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing religious and political persecution in the 1840s,
members of this newly established church left Nauvoo, Ill., and
trekked west, setting up colonies and a distinct way of life. A
century and a half later, the little church organized by Joseph
Smith is one of the fastest-growing religions in the Americas &UR; and
across the globe, as well as the richest church per capita in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   So, why is the Mormon Church still so maligned and little
understood within some Christian circles?
</P>
<P>
   This never-quite-resolved question again moved to the forefront
with an ``East Valley Tribune'' story headlined ``Christian fest
snubs Mormons,'' referring to the Jan. 15 Festival of Faith 2000
event at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix. A gathering billed as the
largest-ever ecumenical assembly of Christians in Arizona history,
it attracted 35,000 people from about 400 Protestant, Catholic and
Orthodox congregations.
</P>
<P>
   The Latter-day Saints, however, were not among these.
</P>
<P>
   Initially included in the festival's planning, the Mormon Church
later found itself excluded, apparently because some conservative
organizers didn't consider Latter-day Saints to be Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world, there would be total acceptance, total
understanding, total love,'' said the Rev. Paul Eppinger, executive
director of the Arizona Ecumenical Council and a Festival of Faith
lead organizer. ``But unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal
world and therefore, in our desire to make the Christian church
more understanding of each group, there are first steps we must
take, then the second step, the third step, the fourth step.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting Evangelicals, mainline Protestants, Catholics and
Eastern Orthodox Christians to meet with each other was that first
step. Broadening the ecumenical net to include churches such as the
Latter-day Saints clearly would be another.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of this issue lie matters of doctrine and theology
_ and the notion of just WHO is a Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelicals who believe in literal biblical interpretation say
the Mormons aren't. The Latter-day Saints, who believe their faith
is a restoration of the original church founded by Jesus Christ and
his 12 disciples, claim they belong to the true Christian church. &QL; 
ROOTS OF DISAGREEMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But just who creates the yardstick that determines which
denominations are Christians? And what standard are these groups
measured against?
</P>
<P>
   Is it a historical faith believed to be derived from the intent
of Jesus' teachings? Or is it the European-spawned brand of
Catholicism and Protestantism, with its various creeds and
traditions influenced by culture?
</P>
<P>
   And does a church's definition of itself determine where it fits
on the religious landscape?
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mormon Church is neither Catholic nor Protestant,
says Phoenix metro area spokesman Wilford Andersen, it's no less
Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people understand we can respectfully disagree on
matters of Christian doctrine,'' Andersen said, ``but should never
disagree on Christian conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly are some (churches) who find it difficult to
work together with us, and I respect that as long as we don't have
ill will toward each other and as long as we don't have
misinformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is the crux of the rift between Mormons and
evangelical Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Ostling, co-author of the acclaimed ``Mormon America:
The Power and the Promise'' (HarperSanFrancisco, $26), says the LDS
Church's ``sweeping policy of secrecy'' contributes to the faith
being misunderstood in mainstream American religious culture. Its
weddings are held in temples that require church-issued
``recommends'' to enter, meaning non-Mormons never get inside. Even
the church's governing documents _ the sort that many denominations
publish on their Web sites _ are off-limits to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have this situation, it creates rumors,
speculations, misinformation,'' said Ostling, who wrote ``Mormon
America'' with his wife, Joan K. Ostling. ``There is room for a lot
of confusion.``
</P>
<P>
   Not that Mormons and their conservative Christian critics tend
to disagree much on matters of morality and social values. Both
groups stress the importance of family and personal responsibility,
and decry abortion, gambling and same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for example, a coalition of Southern Baptists,
Catholics and Mormons recently joined forces to pass Proposition 22
on Tuesday, which would ban same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the disagreement is doctrinal,'' Ostling said,
``rather than moral, political and cultural. The fundamental issues
between Mormonism and traditional Christianity are the nature of
God, the doctrine of Christ, the Bible's authority, and the
doctrine of humanity and relating to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to examine the commonalities and differences between
the groups, professors Craig L. Blomberg of Denver Seminary and
Stephen E. Robinson of Brigham Young University wrote the 1997
book, ``How Wide the Divide? A Mormon and an Evangelical in
Conversation'' (InterVarsity Press, $11.99).
</P>
<P>
   Their point-counterpoint text includes a ``joint conclusion'' at
the end of each chapter and doesn't dwell on trying to prove the
other wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen says this civil tolerance and respect _ rather than
active teaching against other religions _ is central to Mormon
faith. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DIFFERENT, YET SIMILAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ostling says it's ``almost predictable'' that Mormons and
evangelicals butt heads theologically, as both target the same
group of potential converts.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Cornwall, a sociology professor at the LDS Church's
Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Many sociologists believe the animosity between the groups
exists because ``we share the same niche,'' Cornwall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can use that marketplace language, both Evangelicals
and Mormons share the same target: the unchurched,'' she adds. ``We
compete in the marketplace of religion, and evangelicals want to
make sure their targets realize Mormons are different.''
</P>
<P>
   Ostling thinks today's Mormon Church, especially under current
President Gordon B. Hinckley's administration, goes ``back and
forth'' on positioning itself closer to ``mainstream''
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mormonism probably presents less of its doctrine to persons
before baptism than any other religious group I can think of,'' he
said. ``The key to winning converts and solidifying them in the
faith is the community, and not the isolated individual. Some of
the more complex doctrinal areas are left for later on.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Andersen says the church doesn't dilute its theology
just to make connections with potential members or other
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several decades, the church has sought
opportunities to team up with other faiths in humanitarian efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Phoenix area, LDS Church members belong to the InterFaith
Action Coalition of Arizona, which is composed of representatives
of 12 different faiths, from Jewish to Buddhist to Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Mormons' involvement in such groups across the nation probably
is a trickle-down effect of Hinckley's public relations-savvy
administration, which is trying to build bridges with other
religions while highlighting positive aspects of Mormon life.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwall says Hinckley's just-released book, ``Standing for
Something: 10 Neglected Virtues That Will Heal Our Hearts and
Homes'' (Times Books, $24.00), is one such effort, capitalizing on
Americans' interest in back-to-basic values without hitting readers
over the head with Mormon theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mormons want to be both different and the same (as other
Americans),'' Cornwall said. ``Different in the sense we know our
faith is different from other faiths, but the same in that we want
people to see that we can be as successful as anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's establishing this common ground, Andersen says, that
will ultimately break down barriers, both social and doctrinal,
that stand between faith groups. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOME FACTS ABOUT THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS: &QL; 
 &QL; 
_One of the world's fastest-growing religions, the LDS Church
claims 10.3 million members, with just more than half living
outside the United States. About one-sixth of LDS members live in
Utah. &QL; 
_If the LDS Church were a U.S. corporation, its revenues would
place it No. 243 on the ``Fortune'' 500 list. &QL; 
_The Mormon Church is one of the nation's largest landowners, with
property equal to the size of Delaware. &QL; 
_Unlike most churches, the LDS Church has no professional clergy.
Members take turns speaking at Sunday sacrament meetings, or
worship services. Members also serve in unpaid ``callings,'' or
assignments, that get work done throughout the church. &QL; 
_Some of the church's best-known members include Steve Young, a San
Francisco 49ers quarterback; singers Donny and Marie Osmond and
Gladys Knight; Stephen R. Covey, bestselling author of ``7 Habits
of Highly Effective People''; and Orrin Hatch, a Utah senator and
former presidential candidate. &QL; 
_Until 1978, Black men were not ordained to the lay priesthood _ a
position reversed by official declaration of then-President Spencer
W. Kimball. Today, R&AMP;B singer Knight is probably the Mormon
Church's best-known Black member. &QL; 
_Source: ``Mormon America: The Power and the Promise,''by Richard
N. Ostling and Joan K. Ostling. &QL; 
_About 150,000 Mormons live in the Phoenix area, and about 300,000
live within Arizona. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOME KEY BELIEFS &QL; 
 &QL; 
_With the revelations delivered by God the father and his son,
Jesus Christ, to church founder Joseph Smith in 1820, a restoration
of the ``truths, powers and priesthood authority of the ancient
church'' was constituted as the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints. Mormons believe they follow Christ's true
gospel, which they say was lost after the deaths of the original 12
disciples. &QL; 
_Divine revelation for the church's direction comes from God to the
president of the church (currently Gordon B. Hinckley). Presidents
are viewed as prophets in the same tradition as Abraham, Moses and
Peter. &QL; 
_In addition to the King James version of the Christian Bible,
Latter-day Saints consider ``The Book of Mormon: Another Testament
of Jesus Christ'' divinely inspired scripture, along with ``The
Doctrine and Covenants'' and ``The Pearl of Great Price,'' other
revelations and writings given since the church's start in 1830. &QL; 
_Mormons don't believe in the traditional concept of ``original
sin'' (that all humans are born sinners because of the Garden of
Eden sin of Adam and Eve), but rather that people are punished for
the sins they commit. &QL; 
_Mormons abstain from using tobacco, alcoholic beverages, tea and
coffee in adherence to ``The Word of Wisdom,'' a health code
revealed to founder Joseph Smith in 1833. &QL; 
_Members are required to tithe, or give a 10th of their income, to
the church to remain members in good standing and gain access to
temples for sacred ordinances. &QL;

<P>
   Dinosaurs keep evolving. It doesn't matter that they died out en
masse 65 million years ago, that not a single giant lizard remains
alive, even in some remote and steamy Amazonian plateau. None of
that matters: They evolve anyway.
</P>
<P>
   They evolved from cold-blooded sluggards to warm-blooded
amphetamine addicts. They grew feathers. The carnivores bent over
from the anthropomorphized Godzilla posture they used to have to
something a lot more like a gigantic clucking hen.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes shouldn't be surprising. As scholarship advances,
our images of the dinosaurs have had to step forward, too. But it
isn't only paleontology that has caused the changes in our sense of
prehistoric life. It is also politics.
</P>
<P>
   We have a more inclusive sense of culture these days, so the
primarily European and North American bias we have had in the past
about our Mesozoic predecessors has changed to make room for Asia,
Africa and South America.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a boy, fascinated by everything dinosaurian in the
1950s, there were about 20 or so beasts that made up the
``canonical'' list of dinosaurs. They included brontosaurs,
stegosaurs, tyrannosaurs, triceratops and a variety of oddly
ornamented hadrosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   These were the basic animals that populated our vision of a
misty, green tropical prehistory. They are the beasts of ``King
Kong, Lost World'' and dozens of other pop culture permutations of
the terrible lizards.
</P>
<P>
   They also were the fossils found in Wyoming, Utah and New
Jersey. They were ``our'' dinosaurs, and they somehow seemed more
important for that.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there were always more genera of fossil than the popular
ones. And with a recent explosion in dino digs, the number of
official dinosaur genera has increased to something like 350. And
that is just genera: Several of them also include multiple species.
By one count, there are 15 species of triceratops.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the popular awareness of dinosaur genera _ as
evidenced in many of the recent books on the subject for the
general reader _ is as much a change in our openness to diversity
as it is the number of new fossils found.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, a few ``representative types'' were enough to
define the prehistoric world. But now, those types _ and their
origins _ seem too limited.
</P>
<P>
   And further evidence of this are the many names for dinosaurs
that sound multiculti on the tongue: jubbulpuria (India);
yangchuanosaurus (China); austrosaurus (Australia); majungasaurus
(Africa); riojasaurus (Argentina). There is even an antarctosaurus.
</P>
<P>
   And from the Navajo Reservation in northern Arizona comes the
segisaurus, from Tsegi Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Just open the new book, ``Walking With Dinosaurs: A Natural
History'' (DK Publishing, $25), and there on a single page you find
leaellynasaura, muttaburrasaurus and koolasuchus, names with a
decidedly third-world flavor on the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt there is a long way to go before the laplatasaurus of
South America supplants the more familiar North American
apatosaurus (formerly the brontosaurus) in third-graders'
imaginations, but open up any recent book on the subject and you
will find newer, sexier and more politically diverse dinosaurs
showing up.
</P>
<P>
   Prehistory now seems as diverse as today. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ In his first day as his party's presumptive
presidential nominee, Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday warned
organized labor here that the Republicans were going to ``throw
everything they've got, plus the kitchen sink'' at his candidacy
and that the Democrats had to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a huge battle that lies just ahead, and you can make
all the difference,'' Gore told a gathering of more than 2,000
members of the AFL-CIO here in a classic, pro-labor speech intended
to lay down a political marker as much as fire up the troops.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president will be relying on labor here _ and in most
Rust Belt states _ come the fall election, when Pennsylvania, with
its big block of electoral votes, is expected to be a swing state
in his contest with Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican. But the
state's primary, scheduled for April 4, now holds little interest
for either side, because both Gore and Bush have already secured
their parties' nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke to the audience about the ``importance of
intensity,'' in a speech meant to spark enthusiasm and show the
unions that he had considerable fight in him for the eight-month
contest ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to win, we have got to understand, the other side is
going to throw everything they've got, plus the kitchen sink,''
Gore declared. ``They're manning the barricades, they're trying to
funnel unprecedented amounts of money into the campaign. They're
going to stop at nothing.''

<P>
   Gore continued his overtures to Republicans and independents.
One of his new tactics is to divide Republicans from their party by
casting the leadership _ the ``Gingrich crew'' as he called it
Wednesday _ as right-wing zealots, quite distinct from the voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing from a lot of independents and independently
thinking Republicans, who, while they don't want to abandon their
party, they don't want to lend any support to this kind of
right-wing extremist approach, union-busting approach, the old
borrow-and-spend approach,'' he said. Democrats, he added, ``have
our heads screwed on right.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But he was also conscious of not stirring up too much trouble
with his audience, and what he omitted from his speech was just as
interesting as what he said.
</P>
<P>
   He made no mention of the Clinton administration's push for
Congress to normalize trade relations with China. Gore has vowed to
lobby for normalizing relations and for China's entry into the
World Trade Organization, but he has hardly mentioned this subject
on the campaign trail and skipped it again Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor is starting a huge campaign against the China
accord, and two of the federation's most powerful groups, the
Teamsters and the United Auto Workers, have withheld their
endorsement of the vice president because they do not like his
pro-trade position.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Gore mention a second topic that could have unsettled
his labor audience _ his proposal to overhaul the campaign finance
system. Organized labor is expecting to play a central role in the
elections this year, as it has for many years (it infused $35
million into the Clinton/Gore re-election in 1996), and does not
want to hear how Gore would limit its ability to influence the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, however, Gore ascended several flights at his
hotel to attend a fund-raiser on his behalf. About 75 people paid
$1,000 each in the Gore campaign's continuing drive to reach its
maximum fund-raising limit of $33.8 million. Alan Kessler, a
Philadelphia lawyer and a member of Gore's finance committee, said
it was getting much easier for Gore to raise money than it had been
several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did mention his campaign finance proposals to this
audience, saying, ``I want to run this campaign in a way that
honors democracy,'' and repeating his call to Bush for both parties
to eliminate soft money, the dollars they receive that are not
regulated.

COMMENTARY: THE NRA'S CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Return with us now to those thrilling days of
yesteryear _ the 1960s. Cities like Newark and Detroit were going
up in flames. Public figures were being assassinated at a numbing
rate. And crime was beginning its long, relentless climb to
horrifying heights.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon Johnson thought it might be prudent to do something about
guns. He called for the registration of all firearms and said all
gun owners should be licensed. After Sirhan Sirhan shot Robert
Kennedy with a snub-nosed .22-caliber revolver, Johnson implored
Congress ``in the name of sanity ... in the name of safety, and in
the name of an aroused nation, to give America the gun control it
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance. The gun lobby wouldn't hear of it.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Spitzer, in his book ``The Politics of Gun Control,''
noted the hysterical reaction of Harold W. Glassen, the president
of the National Rifle Association, to a watered-down version of
Johnson's proposal. Glassen said the legislation was part of an
effort to ``foist upon an unsuspecting and aroused public a law
that would, through its operation, sound the death knell for the
shooting sport and eventually disarm the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA and its allies and lackeys in Congress made sure
Americans were not disarmed. We have the body counts to prove it.
According to Handgun Control, a group that lobbies for stricter gun
laws, ``More Americans were killed with guns in the 18-year period
between 1979 and 1997 (651,697) than were killed in battle in all
wars since 1775 (650,858).''
</P>
<P>
   Osha Gray Davidson, in his 1998 book ``Under Fire: The NRA and
the Battle for Gun Control,'' wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``The list of casualties from this country's gun violence does,
indeed, read like the body count of a major war. In the United
States today, one person dies by gunshot every eighteen minutes, 24
hours a day. In a year, that adds up to nearly 30,000 deaths. In
two years, more Americans are killed by guns here at home than died
in the entire Vietnam War. Of that annual total, about 15,000
commit suicide, 11,000 are murdered, and some 1,500 die in
accidents involving guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon Johnson said, ``Our citizens must get licenses to fish,
to hunt and to drive. Certainly no less should be required for the
possession of lethal weapons that have caused so much horror and
heartbreak in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The gun lobby was not amused.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA is more than a powerful, single-issue lobbying group.
It's a radical, inflammatory, obsessive outfit, deaf to public
opinion, that has stood like a colossus in the way of reasonable
gun control, and thus has contributed mightily to the long decades
of carnage in our streets and homes.
</P>
<P>
   It has learned nothing constructive since the 1960s. Which
brings us to Wayne LaPierre, the group's current executive vice
president. All you need to know about LaPierre's leadership role
with the NRA is summed up in a passage he wrote in a 1992 column in
American Rifleman magazine. It was cited in Davidson's book:
</P>
<P>
   ``If the NRA was an army at war, and we knew an enemy train was
carrying troops to the front in an attempt to turn the tide of
battle, it would be our duty ... to take up the tracks, or blow up
a bridge ... because when you're at war, you do what it takes to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, on national television, LaPierre made the
disgusting assertion that President Clinton was willing to accept a
certain amount of violence and killing to further the interests of
gun control. In his twisted logic, tragedies like the killings at
Columbine High School strengthened the case for gun control _ at
least in the minds of some people _ and therefore were acceptable
or in some sense tolerable to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how LaPierre put it: ``I've come to believe that he needs
a certain level of violence in this country. He's willing to accept
a certain level of killing to further his political agenda and his
vice president, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times, in an editorial, denounced what it described as
LaPierre's ``sick suggestion.''
</P>
<P>
   What gun control advocates really need are more Wayne LaPierres.
He embodies the extremism and the craziness embedded in the
policies and the philosophy of the NRA. The higher his profile, the
better.

LDS CHURCH OFTEN STILL MISUNDERSTOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN JENKINS  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (RETRANSMITTING: EDITORS: INCLUDES KEY POINTS, LIST OF BELIEFS
AT END OF TAKE. ALSO MOVING IN THE ``A'' CATEGORY) PHOENIX _ In
some ways, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a
</P>
<P>
   quintessential American success story.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing religious and political persecution in the 1840s,
members of this newly established church left Nauvoo, Ill., and
trekked west, setting up colonies and a distinct way of life. A
century and a half later, the little church organized by Joseph
Smith is one of the fastest-growing religions in the Americas &UR; and
across the globe, as well as the richest church per capita in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   So, why is the Mormon Church still so maligned and little
understood within some Christian circles?
</P>
<P>
   This never-quite-resolved question again moved to the forefront
with an ``East Valley Tribune'' story headlined ``Christian fest
snubs Mormons,'' referring to the Jan. 15 Festival of Faith 2000
event at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix. A gathering billed as the
largest-ever ecumenical assembly of Christians in Arizona history,
it attracted 35,000 people from about 400 Protestant, Catholic and
Orthodox congregations.
</P>
<P>
   The Latter-day Saints, however, were not among these.
</P>
<P>
   Initially included in the festival's planning, the Mormon Church
later found itself excluded, apparently because some conservative
organizers didn't consider Latter-day Saints to be Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world, there would be total acceptance, total
understanding, total love,'' said the Rev. Paul Eppinger, executive
director of the Arizona Ecumenical Council and a Festival of Faith
lead organizer. ``But unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal
world and therefore, in our desire to make the Christian church
more understanding of each group, there are first steps we must
take, then the second step, the third step, the fourth step.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting Evangelicals, mainline Protestants, Catholics and
Eastern Orthodox Christians to meet with each other was that first
step. Broadening the ecumenical net to include churches such as the
Latter-day Saints clearly would be another.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of this issue lie matters of doctrine and theology
_ and the notion of just WHO is a Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelicals who believe in literal biblical interpretation say
the Mormons aren't. The Latter-day Saints, who believe their faith
is a restoration of the original church founded by Jesus Christ and
his 12 disciples, claim they belong to the true Christian church. &QL; 
ROOTS OF DISAGREEMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But just who creates the yardstick that determines which
denominations are Christians? And what standard are these groups
measured against?
</P>
<P>
   Is it a historical faith believed to be derived from the intent
of Jesus' teachings? Or is it the European-spawned brand of
Catholicism and Protestantism, with its various creeds and
traditions influenced by culture?
</P>
<P>
   And does a church's definition of itself determine where it fits
on the religious landscape?
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mormon Church is neither Catholic nor Protestant,
says Phoenix metro area spokesman Wilford Andersen, it's no less
Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people understand we can respectfully disagree on
matters of Christian doctrine,'' Andersen said, ``but should never
disagree on Christian conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly are some (churches) who find it difficult to
work together with us, and I respect that as long as we don't have
ill will toward each other and as long as we don't have
misinformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is the crux of the rift between Mormons and
evangelical Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Ostling, co-author of the acclaimed ``Mormon America:
The Power and the Promise'' (HarperSanFrancisco, $26), says the LDS
Church's ``sweeping policy of secrecy'' contributes to the faith
being misunderstood in mainstream American religious culture. Its
weddings are held in temples that require church-issued
``recommends'' to enter, meaning non-Mormons never get inside. Even
the church's governing documents _ the sort that many denominations
publish on their Web sites _ are off-limits to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have this situation, it creates rumors,
speculations, misinformation,'' said Ostling, who wrote ``Mormon
America'' with his wife, Joan K. Ostling. ``There is room for a lot
of confusion.``
</P>
<P>
   Not that Mormons and their conservative Christian critics tend
to disagree much on matters of morality and social values. Both
groups stress the importance of family and personal responsibility,
and decry abortion, gambling and same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for example, a coalition of Southern Baptists,
Catholics and Mormons recently joined forces to pass Proposition 22
on Tuesday, which would ban same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the disagreement is doctrinal,'' Ostling said,
``rather than moral, political and cultural. The fundamental issues
between Mormonism and traditional Christianity are the nature of
God, the doctrine of Christ, the Bible's authority, and the
doctrine of humanity and relating to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to examine the commonalities and differences between
the groups, professors Craig L. Blomberg of Denver Seminary and
Stephen E. Robinson of Brigham Young University wrote the 1997
book, ``How Wide the Divide? A Mormon and an Evangelical in
Conversation'' (InterVarsity Press, $11.99).
</P>
<P>
   Their point-counterpoint text includes a ``joint conclusion'' at
the end of each chapter and doesn't dwell on trying to prove the
other wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen says this civil tolerance and respect _ rather than
active teaching against other religions _ is central to Mormon
faith. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DIFFERENT, YET SIMILAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ostling says it's ``almost predictable'' that Mormons and
evangelicals butt heads theologically, as both target the same
group of potential converts.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Cornwall, a sociology professor at the LDS Church's
Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Many sociologists believe the animosity between the groups
exists because ``we share the same niche,'' Cornwall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can use that marketplace language, both Evangelicals
and Mormons share the same target: the unchurched,'' she adds. ``We
compete in the marketplace of religion, and evangelicals want to
make sure their targets realize Mormons are different.''
</P>
<P>
   Ostling thinks today's Mormon Church, especially under current
President Gordon B. Hinckley's administration, goes ``back and
forth'' on positioning itself closer to ``mainstream''
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mormonism probably presents less of its doctrine to persons
before baptism than any other religious group I can think of,'' he
said. ``The key to winning converts and solidifying them in the
faith is the community, and not the isolated individual. Some of
the more complex doctrinal areas are left for later on.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Andersen says the church doesn't dilute its theology
just to make connections with potential members or other
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several decades, the church has sought
opportunities to team up with other faiths in humanitarian efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Phoenix area, LDS Church members belong to the InterFaith
Action Coalition of Arizona, which is composed of representatives
of 12 different faiths, from Jewish to Buddhist to Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Mormons' involvement in such groups across the nation probably
is a trickle-down effect of Hinckley's public relations-savvy
administration, which is trying to build bridges with other
religions while highlighting positive aspects of Mormon life.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwall says Hinckley's just-released book, ``Standing for
Something: 10 Neglected Virtues That Will Heal Our Hearts and
Homes'' (Times Books, $24.00), is one such effort, capitalizing on
Americans' interest in back-to-basic values without hitting readers
over the head with Mormon theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mormons want to be both different and the same (as other
Americans),'' Cornwall said. ``Different in the sense we know our
faith is different from other faiths, but the same in that we want
people to see that we can be as successful as anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's establishing this common ground, Andersen says, that
will ultimately break down barriers, both social and doctrinal,
that stand between faith groups. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOME FACTS ABOUT THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS: &QL; 
 &QL; 
_One of the world's fastest-growing religions, the LDS Church
claims 10.3 million members, with just more than half living
outside the United States. About one-sixth of LDS members live in
Utah. &QL; 
_If the LDS Church were a U.S. corporation, its revenues would
place it No. 243 on the ``Fortune'' 500 list. &QL; 
_The Mormon Church is one of the nation's largest landowners, with
property equal to the size of Delaware. &QL; 
_Unlike most churches, the LDS Church has no professional clergy.
Members take turns speaking at Sunday sacrament meetings, or
worship services. Members also serve in unpaid ``callings,'' or
assignments, that get work done throughout the church. &QL; 
_Some of the church's best-known members include Steve Young, a San
Francisco 49ers quarterback; singers Donny and Marie Osmond and
Gladys Knight; Stephen R. Covey, bestselling author of ``7 Habits
of Highly Effective People''; and Orrin Hatch, a Utah senator and
former presidential candidate. &QL; 
_Until 1978, Black men were not ordained to the lay priesthood _ a
position reversed by official declaration of then-President Spencer
W. Kimball. Today, R&AMP;B singer Knight is probably the Mormon
Church's best-known Black member. &QL; 
_Source: ``Mormon America: The Power and the Promise,''by Richard
N. Ostling and Joan K. Ostling. &QL; 
_About 150,000 Mormons live in the Phoenix area, and about 300,000
live within Arizona. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOME KEY BELIEFS &QL; 
 &QL; 
_With the revelations delivered by God the father and his son,
Jesus Christ, to church founder Joseph Smith in 1820, a restoration
of the ``truths, powers and priesthood authority of the ancient
church'' was constituted as the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints. Mormons believe they follow Christ's true
gospel, which they say was lost after the deaths of the original 12
disciples. &QL; 
_Divine revelation for the church's direction comes from God to the
president of the church (currently Gordon B. Hinckley). Presidents
are viewed as prophets in the same tradition as Abraham, Moses and
Peter. &QL; 
_In addition to the King James version of the Christian Bible,
Latter-day Saints consider ``The Book of Mormon: Another Testament
of Jesus Christ'' divinely inspired scripture, along with ``The
Doctrine and Covenants'' and ``The Pearl of Great Price,'' other
revelations and writings given since the church's start in 1830. &QL; 
_Mormons don't believe in the traditional concept of ``original
sin'' (that all humans are born sinners because of the Garden of
Eden sin of Adam and Eve), but rather that people are punished for
the sins they commit. &QL; 
_Mormons abstain from using tobacco, alcoholic beverages, tea and
coffee in adherence to ``The Word of Wisdom,'' a health code
revealed to founder Joseph Smith in 1833. &QL; 
_Members are required to tithe, or give a 10th of their income, to
the church to remain members in good standing and gain access to
temples for sacred ordinances. &QL;

 &HT;    Atlanta court: Student prayer OK at graduation
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Prayer at high school graduation ceremonies is
permissible as long as it is initiated by students and free of
state influence, the federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was a policy adopted by the Duval County, Fla., school
district in 1993 that allows students to elect fromtheir ranks a
speaker to deliver a two-minute commencement ``message.''
</P>
<P>
   ``School boards will be able to allow students to make choices
as to whether they want to have an invocation or benediction during
a graduation ceremony,'' Sam Harben, general counsel of the Georgia
School Board Association, said of the ruling's impact. ``However,
boards need to be very careful that the choice should be up to the
senior class and there should be no influence over that decision by
the administration or the board.''
</P>
<P>
   The extension of student-initiated prayer to other school
activities may be possible, Harben speculated. ``But I think the
age of the student and the particular event may make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the policy enacted in Duval, which includes
Jacksonville, the message cannot be edited or reviewed by school
officials. Plaintiffs challenging the policy called it a backdoor
attempt to return state-sponsored prayer to school.
</P>
<P>
   In a 10-2 decision, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta rejected that notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total absence of state involvement in deciding whether
there will be a graduation message, who will speak or what the
speaker may say, combined with the student's complete autonomy over
the content ... convinces us that the message delivered, be it
secular or sectarian or both, is not state-sponsored,'' Judge
Stanley Marcus wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``To conclude otherwise would come perilously close to
announcing an absolute rule that would excise all private religious
expression from a public graduation ceremony,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus added that the policy recognizes the ``crucial
difference'' between state-sponsored religion and private speech.
</P>
<P>
   The court has jurisdiction over Florida, Georgia and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Adler, whose daughter was the lead plaintiff in the case,
expressed disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court never considered what's really going on at the
schools,'' she said. ``They never really considered why the policy
was put in place _ to continue the prayers at schools. I'd like to
see the policy done away with.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the policy was adopted, religious observances have
dominated the messages in the form of prayers, invocations and
benedictions, according to court motions filed by Adler's lawyers.
At some schools, students voted for a class ``chaplain'' to deliver
the message and some campaigned to have prayer at graduation, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Judge Phyllis Kravitch dissented from the court's
majority opinion. ``Although the Duval County school administration
may have distanced itself from prayer offered during graduation
ceremonies, it did not disconnect itself from religious
expression,'' she wrote. ``Nor does the policy mitigate the
influences that coerce audience members to participate in prayers
offered at graduation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marcus, who was appointed to the court by President Clinton,
said the plaintiffs' position leaves school officials with two
choices: Either eliminate student speech altogether, or censor
student speech if it contains a religious message or prayer.
</P>
<P>
   If school officials choose the latter course, Marcus said, they
must excise the religious content before the commencement speech or
even be forced to interrupt ``renegade'' speakers who wish to say a
prayer. If officials choose the other course, they will have
deprived the graduating class of any role in shaping its graduation
and will have banned all private student expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Establishment Clause requires no such Hobson's choice,''
Marcus wrote, referring to the U.S. Constitution. ``What it does
require is a recognition of the critical difference between a
private statement of religious values and a religious utterance
endorsed by the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The Duval County policy ``on its face, does no more than
recognize this distinction,'' Marcus wrote.

BLEAK WORKS BELIE WRITER RICK MOODY'S
 JOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
   
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (EDITORS: RETRANSMITTING; ALSO MOVING IN
 &UR; THE ``E'' CATEGORY)
 &UR; Never mind that his novels employ less-than-joyful themes _
electrocution, prepubescent sex, ailing mothers who dribble
``stalactites of drool,'' drug addiction, self-immolation, Richard
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Moody has written such bleak stories as ``The Ice Storm,'' which
became the bleak 1997 Ang Lee-directed movie starring Kevin Klein
and Sigourney Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Writing gloom under cover of mirth, he follows a daily regimen
but works only when the spirit moves him. At his home on Fishers
Island in Long Island Sound, he might write by day or he might
write all night, a comfortable schedule that fosters bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hypothesis is that the best way to convey joy to my readers
is if I am joyful when I'm on the job,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Joy brings productivity. At age 38, he's already published three
novels (``The Ice Storm,'' `` Garden State, Purple America''), a
collection of short stories (``The Ring of Brightest Angels Around
Heaven'') and edited a collection of essays titled ``Joyful Noise''
_ and there's that word again.
</P>
<P>
   Although Moody has been variously compared to the greats who
preceded him _ Cheever, Roth, Updike _ he modestly dismisses such
accolades, eschewing public-relations hype while recognizing that
hype and a hit movie have made him a marketable author who so far
can depend on each new work's being accepted by his publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim also drags him into the Okefenokee Swamp of the book
tour, slogging across America to tout his latest work, leaving
behind his longtime companion, Amy, a computer-software writer who
comes along only to the more attractive cities.
</P>
<P>
   Amy will be coming along when Moody speaks during the Phoenix
Public Library's lecture series, ``Soothing Words,'' a three-month
event that began in January. This month's featured writers include
Moody on Thursday, March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Moody will appear at 7 p.m. at the Burton Barr Phoenix Central
Library to read from his coming collection of stories,
``Demonology,'' due out in January.2001.)
</P>
<P>
   Then he and Amy will head for his father's winter home in
Wickenburg, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Moody is a writer's writer, besotted by the English
language, heir to legendary wordsmiths Hemingway, Fitzgerald,
Joyce, Bellow, Beckett. He loves words as a writer because he loves
words as a reader and sprinkles his conversation with literary
quotations.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's own work is highly stylized _ too much so, some critics
say. But he prides himself on writing that has become denser over
the course of three novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made language exciting again,'' he says, less a boast
than an exaltation in the sheer beauty of well-crafted prose.
</P>
<P>
   Moody has been writing for 30 years. As a boy, he dabbled, but
he was easily distracted by other boyhood occupations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lacked follow-through,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Childhood in suburban Connecticut appeared idyllic from the
outside, but he confesses to harboring ``demons,'' suffering
frequent illnesses and being overly sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivity that plagued him in his youth has served him
well as an adult observer of human emotions. He credits his
``finely calibrated compass that picks up what's going on in a
room.''
</P>
<P>
   In his teens, Moody began to write in earnest, producing short
stories and poems.
</P>
<P>
   Son of literary parents, he majored in English at Brown
University and began to write ``Garden State'' in 1986 while living
in Hoboken, N.J., holding down a day job in the editorial
department of the Simon &AMP; Schuster publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   Although the job slowed work on his novel, it taught him the
intricacies of the publishing business _ how to find an agent, how
to write a contract. It did not help sell his book, which was
rejected 22 times in a 15-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Moody despaired of drowning in the seas of rejection. Then, a
small press called Pushcart threw him a lifeline and even awarded
him its Pushcart Editors' Book Award.
</P>
<P>
   Work on his second novel, ``The Ice Storm,'' began in 1990.
Having quit his day job, he was able to write more swiftly,
completing the book in just two years. He was single then,
supporting himself on freelance editing and living hand to mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ice Storm'' was accepted by big-time publisher Little,
Brown and Co., and Moody forged a relationship with an editor who
respects his distinctive style.
</P>
<P>
   Moody became proficient at his craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured out how to tell a story,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Moody tries to do something different with each of his works,
their thread ``fealty to human emotions and human psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Garden State'' is the story of disaffected youth lost in
suburban New Jersey, contemplating life, death and rock and roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purple America'' is a deeply emotional book that examines how
one family's remorse ``trickles down through the generations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Black Veil,'' a non-fiction work due out this summer,
comes from family folklore about the Rev. Joseph Moody, said to
have inspired ``The Minister's Black Veil,'' a short story by
American author Nathaniel Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Ice Storm'' has been his bestseller, thanks in part to
the movie. The grim saga traces a brief span in the life of
Benjamin Hood, a suburbanite bored with marriage who dallies with a
neighbor, struggles to rein in his precocious daughter, Wendy, and
tries to discover himself during the sexual liberation of the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Moody was warned to fear the worst from Hollywood, and ``I DID
fear the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting the respected Ang Lee, who also directed ``Sense and
Sensibility,'' allayed those fears. One red flag raised was the
casting of Christina Ricci, who had appeared in such films as ``The
Addams Family'' and ``Casper.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ricci's teen sexpot portrayal impressed Moody, as did the
film as a whole. Now he is waiting to hear about options on his
other works. Buoyed by his positive experiences with ``The Ice
Storm,'' he would happily return to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   With such success comes book tours, not the choicest part of the
profession. One tour took Moody on the road for five grueling
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But he enjoys meeting his readers, most of whom are under age
40.
</P>
<P>
   Writing is an isolating profession, after all, he notes as he
sits alone in his home on Fishers Island, while Amy lives across
the water in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   It is Amy who reads his work first and then filters the reviews,
passing along only those that offer constructive criticism.
Although wary of shaping his style to please critics, Moody says he
sometimes can learn from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust in the possibility that some harsh criticism will give
me an opportunity to improve,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And improvement brings joy. &QL; Reach the reporter at

COMMENTARY: BLESS THIS HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1832, during Andrew Jackson's administration,
Charles Pise, the assistant pastor of St. Patrick's Church in the
District of Columbia, was chosen to be chaplain of the Senate.
There has not been a Catholic chaplain in the Congress since. The
House of Representatives has never been regularly led in prayer by
a priest.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in a fit of democratic outreach, Speaker Dennis
Hastert gave up his prerogative of naming the House chaplain and
appointed a committee of 18 members to come up with a consensus
choice. That was his first mistake.
</P>
<P>
   A priest got the most votes. A couple of Protestant ministers
were runners-up. Hastert interviewed the three and _ on the merits,
no religious prejudice involved _ made his second mistake. This
fair-minded speaker, meaning well, decided that the clergyman who
would do the best job of invoking God's help every morning was one
of the ministers.
</P>
<P>
   All hell _ perhaps all Hell _ has broken loose. Especially after
the controversial visit by George W. Bush to Bob Jones U., which
views Catholicism as a satanic cult, many Catholic members of the
House took offense. Understandably, the rejected priest believes he
would have had the job had he been a Protestant like every previous
House chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker's third mistake was to freeze, allowing this
seemingly minor matter to fester. Democrats look at a state like
New Jersey, where every other voter is Catholic, and see a gut
issue that could swing the House majority and affect the
presidential election as well.
</P>
<P>
   Forty House Republicans who are Catholic are leaning on the
speaker to change his mind, while many Protestant GOP members,
egged on by irate evangelicals, see any imputation by Democrats of
religious prejudice as a crass political ploy and demand that
Hastert stand his ground.
</P>
<P>
   How to resolve the impasse? My first thought was to put forward
a compromise of unassailable political correctness, like a female
African-American rabbi; unfortunately, I know of none. And what
with the fuss about the fund raising at the Hacienda Heights
temple, this is not the right year for a Buddhist.
</P>
<P>
   While at it, let us examine an even more startling compromise:
Why have a House chaplain at all? Doesn't this leap the barrier
between church and state? Cannot Congressmen avail themselves of
the spiritual counsel of some 2,500 in the clergy in D.C. without
relying on the perk of a chaplain-on-the-spot?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no; much is to be said for tradition. The
Continental Congress established the office of chaplain in 1774,
and many of the same men who framed the Constitution voted for such
an office in the Senate and House. In over two centuries, it has
not been a force for the establishment of a state religion. And it
was George Washington, taking the first inaugural oath, who added
the words ``So help me God!'' which his successors continue to this
day with no complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, brace yourself to your duty. Recognize
that this is not a theological decision, nor a choice among
counselors to pick one who will best assuage the guilt of
iron-triangulating members voting against the interests of their
constituents (better a house psychiatrist for that). Yours is a
symbolic gesture in a political year.
</P>
<P>
   A run of 58 House chaplains in 210 years without a single
Catholic is enough. With nearly 30 percent of our representatives
Catholic, good ecumenical sense and good politics suggest that it's
time a priest be given the honor of writing and delivering the
nonsectarian prayer that opens the sessions.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush should show some leadership by calling the
speaker on St. Patrick's Day to urge him to name the priest. The
Democratic standard-bearer, Al Gore, should call the House minority
leader, Dick Gephardt, to make a commitment to support the
Protestant now chosen by Hastert to follow on as chaplain, whoever
becomes the next speaker.
</P>
<P>
   That compromise would quickly avert the ugly divisiveness
America doesn't need. And if any black or Hispanic or Asian girl is
now dreaming of rabbinical school, she too should have a chance to
become a chaplain in the Congress of the United States.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Godfrey Reggio is an alien who wants to destroy the
future from within.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that is what he says. And the funny thing is that the
reclusive 59-year-old filmmaker makes a beguiling sort of sense as
he arranges his far-reaching abstractions about humanity's
high-tech dilemmas into pleasant conversation, much as films like
``Koyaanisqatsi'' and ``Powaqqatsi'' string together pearls of
staggering imagery into artful condemnations of Western
civilization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe that technology is not something we use, but
something we live,'' Reggio says, touching a match to a Lucky
Strike in the Sunday afternoon gloom of his friend Philip Glass'
East Village apartment. He has the still charisma of the Christian
Brothers monk he once was.
</P>
<P>
   He also has the engaged, unruly intellect of the kind of monk
who left the order before he could be expelled. ``More important
than empires and wars and other breakthroughs,'' he continues,
``technology is now an environment, the host of human habitation.
We don't live with the natural environment. There's so much
interest in aliens because we (italics)are (end italics) the
aliens. We are off-planet.''
</P>
<P>
   This explains, perhaps, why Reggio's films are such
out-of-this-world experiences, not to mention solar systems away
from conventional Hollywood moviemaking. When ``Koyaanisqatsi''
(the title is a Hopi word meaning, roughly, ``life without
balance'') made its debut at Radio City Music Hall as the opening
selection of the 1983 New York Film Festival, audiences found
themselves at a fulcrum of puzzlement and awe: here was a movie
with no plot, no actors, no soundtrack other than Glass'
percolating original score.
</P>
<P>
   And yet as magisterial shots of Monument Valley gave way to
frenzied sequences of urban life, ``Koyaanisqatsi'' delivered a
sensory head trip with a decidedly spiritual point of view. ``To
this day,'' says Francis Ford Coppola, who lent his name to the
project, ``images and sequences from the film remain with me.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Reggio returned with a follow-up called ``Powaqqatsi''
(``Life in Transformation''), this time focusing on vanishing ways
of life in the Southern Hemisphere. Despite another groundbreaking
Glass score, critics were less enchanted. The Washington Post
commented that ``watching it, you feel as if you were being forced
at gunpoint to flip through hundreds and hundreds of back issues of
National Geographic,'' and the director was accused of, in his
words, ``aestheticizing poverty'' and was spat on at the Berlin
Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 12 years later it is difficult to deny the influence of
Reggio's vision on the surfaces of modern pop culture. The
time-lapse sequences of clouds scudding across natural and manmade
landscapes have leaked into television and Hollywood films _ they
are the very bedrock of the Weather Channel _ and the pas de deux
of imagery and score has become the coin of music videos and
television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``His style of filmmaking was adopted by the advertising world
for good reason,'' says Jon Kane, the commercial film director
responsible for VH1's ``Go Behind the Music'' spots and a recent
Tommy Hilfiger campaign featuring Jewel and Lenny Kravitz. ``In
commercials, where you only have 30 seconds to create a world,
music and pictures cut deeper and faster than words.''
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Powaqqatsi,'' Reggio has directed only two films:
``Anima Mundi,'' a half-hour tour of the animal kingdom made in
1991 under the auspices of the World Wide Fund for Nature, and
``Evidence,'' a seven-minute short on the subject of children and
television, filmed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, the ``qatsi'' films have been kept curiously
in the here and now by way of screening tours featuring live
orchestral performances of the Glass scores. Starting on Tuesday,
the Brooklyn Academy of Music will present ``Koyaanisqatsi,''
``Powaqqatsi'' and, in its United States concert premiere, ``Anima
Mundi'' as part of its ``Philip on Film'' series, a weeklong
festival of Glass film scores.
</P>
<P>
   This is not why Reggio is in New York, however. While the
filmmaker is deeply appreciative of Glass' ongoing support of their
past collaborations _ ``Philip is willing to stay on the road for
over 100 days of concerts, around the world,'' he marvels _ Reggio
is merely passing through. While based in Santa Fe, N.M., he has
spent the better part of a decade ``living out of a suitcase,''
searching for the financial backing to create a third ``qatsi''
film. It will be called ``Naqoyqatsi,'' and if it gets made it may
be his most extreme work by far.
</P>
<P>
   The title, another Hopi derivation, translates roughly as
``civilized violence,'' and the film Reggio envisions will
acknowledge that technology has triumphed over nature. Where
``Koyaanisqatsi' dealt with the mechanistic lock step of life in
the Northern Hemisphere, and ``Powaqqatsi'' eulogized what the
director calls a ``handmade way of living'' that is rapidly
disappearing from the Southern Hemisphere, ``Naqoyqatsi'' will be
about the shiny new global village of technological homogenization.
</P>
<P>
   And ``at the leading edge of that phenomenon,'' says Reggio with
the relish of a surgeon presented with a particularly interesting
tumor, ``is something we call the Internet. The Internet, like much
of the technology we have today, resulted from research and
development related to war. It is a phenomenon that is literally
changing the way we live, the way we perceive, the way the world is
organized. In that sense, it becomes the subject of the film.''
</P>
<P>
   The style of ``Naqoyqatsi'' promises to be similarly radical.
Instead of going on location to shoot original material, as he did
for the first two films, Reggio plans to create a visual symphony
of existent footage, gleaned from a multitude of stock sources. He
will then ``revivify'' this ``spent imagery'' by manipulating it
with digital editing effects in a process of what he describes as
``perfected degradation.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that such techniques have become standard
practice in art forms as distinct as avant-garde filmmaking, music
videos and mainstream films. ``In some of Oliver Stone's work, he
uses digital imaging,'' Reggio says. ``But it's not the main drive
of his films. I'm going to make a full language out of
degradation.''
</P>
<P>
   And what, exactly, will the result look like on the screen?
``Well,'' he laughs, ``it would be like trying to tell you what a
persimmon tastes like.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, a somewhat hefty paradox in using
technological means to critique technology. Reggio welcomes it. ``I
want to grab on to those contradictions,'' he says, ``and use them,
as it were, with the spirit of Troy, and enter something into the
market.'' Thus, his ambitious plans to use the Internet in the very
creation of ``Naqoyqatsi,'' recruiting collaborative media _
additional footage, for example, through an official Web site.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to implicate the Internet, both as a subject
matter and as an aspect of the production,'' he says with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   After talking with Reggio for a while _ or rather, after sitting
spellbound as he weaves concepts and philosophy into dazzling,
sometimes inscrutable tapestries _ one begins to wonder how a man
who spent his adolescence and early adulthood as a Christian
Brothers novitiate has come to surf the edge of the techno-media
tsunami.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in New Orleans, Reggio came from a working-class
family yet managed to live what he refers to as a ``pretty fast
life'' with the country club set by an early age. At the same time,
he was intrigued by the selflessness of the monks who taught him in
school, men who ``weren't about themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker still feels that his decision to enter the
Christian Brothers order at the age of 14 was the right one. ``It
allowed me, in effect, not to grow up in the 1950s of the United
States, but in the Middle Ages, or in 16th-century Europe. Not that
that was better, but it was certainly different. I mean, instead of
collecting baseball cards I was collecting holy cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet by the time Reggio was ready to take his vows 14 years
later, he was heeding other calls. By then he was studying at the
College of Santa Fe, a Christian Brothers school in New Mexico, and
his work with the local community _ in particular with youth gangs
_ was rankling his superiors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chicano community, the community of poverty where I lived,
was gaping with need,'' he says. ``So I would teach during the day,
and at night I would be out working with street gangs. And I think
I became a scandal to my brothers.'' In 1968, it was suggested to
Reggio that he stop his activities and go to work in the Christian
Brothers archives in Rome. Instead, he left the order.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1970s, his community-building efforts had flowered
into an American Civil Liberties Union-backed project called the
Institute for Regional Education, whose first campaign,
presciently, was a series of billboards and prime-time television
ads calling the public's attention to governmental incursions on
personal privacy. The combination of his work with the
underprivileged and his deepening distrust of techno-culture began
to coalesce into the first stirrings of ``Koyaanisqatsi.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling was that America was becoming rootless,'' he says.
``That the family was dying, that it wouldn't be long before we
would have a technological society. And I felt that `Koyaanisqatsi'
would be a way of putting into cinema something that if, I was a
painter, I would try to make on a large painting.'' Never having
made a film before, he began to assemble like minds, and, realizing
that music would be crucial, approached Glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, about 30 or 40 minutes was shot,'' Glass recalls.
``We got together, and I began by telling him that I didn't write
film music. But we had a viewing, and I was so impressed that I
immediately said that I would do it.''
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, the two were in close collaboration, with
the cinematographer Ron Fricke's images affecting Glass' score and
the score setting the pace for the editing. Nevertheless, as Glass
is at pains to clarify, ``the whole conception of the trilogy of
films is Godfrey's aesthetic and his idea.'' When ``Koyaanisqatsi''
was finished in 1982, the team had an extremely singular film and
no idea of how it might reach an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Francis Ford Coppola. Introduced to the ``Godfather''
director through a mutual friend, Reggio and Glass arranged a
screening. ``I fully expected to hear the sound of seats folding
up, and the door opening and shutting,'' Glass remembers. ``It
never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, says Coppola, ``I was very moved and impressed with the
power, the imagery, the music, and the innovative way ideas and
emotions were presented. I felt the film was uniquely cinematic.''
Under the banner of ``Francis Ford Coppola presents,''
``Koyaanisqatsi'' unspooled at the New York Film Festival and went
on to a theatrical release.
</P>
<P>
   Finding angels, particularly financial backers for
``Naqoyqatsi,'' is proving to be a harder task. Last November,
Reggio met with George Lucas (who was a co-presenter with Coppola
of ``Powaqqatsi,'') and the result is that Rick McCallum, the
producer of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' is
actively seeking money for the project. Still, why his famous
friends have yet to step up to the plate is a delicate conundrum
for Reggio. ``It's like I've been given an enormous Rolls-Royce and
a teaspoon of petrol,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the subject of the film _ not to mention the
director's embracing of the Internet in its creation _ it is
perhaps not too much to hope that a newly minted dot-com
billionaire might see the happy irony in backing ``Naqoyqatsi.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggio is not above optimism. In the material he gives to
potential investors, the film's final sequence is titled
``Startling Hope.' All the filmmaker will say about it is that,
after being assaulted with images of technology rampant, audiences
will find themselves looking at ``a human situation _ completely
human, in perhaps one of our most human acts, the act of
dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   The alien's eyes crinkle with the subversiveness of it all:
``Human beings are more mysterious than we know.''

 &HT;    Possible Graham-Gore team keeps Florida Democrats hopeful
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ The one Florida Democrat who could have
stopped Jeb Bush from becoming governor may get a chance to stop
Bush's brother from becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing makes Florida Republicans tremble more or Democrats
giddier than the thought of U.S. Sen. Bob Graham teaming with Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Is it going to happen? Only Gore knows and he says it is too
soon to worry about running mates.
</P>
<P>
   Does Graham want it? As always, Graham is being coy, saying only
that he is happy with the job he has now. But on primary night, he
appeared to be auditioning for the post with a rousing speech at a
Tallahassee rally for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate moderate who was Florida's governor from 1979 to 1987,
Graham, who will be 64 in November, came close to being President
Clinton's running mate in 1992. He also made the short list in 1988
when then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis was looking for a
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Graham has not had a serious race since winning his first
election to the Senate in 1986 against incumbent Republican Paula
Hawkins. Since going to the Senate, Graham has kept a low profile,
rarely appearing on the Sunday talk shows and often reluctant to
take the lead on major issues.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, as he was closing in on his 60th birthday, Graham
flirted with the idea of leaving the Senate to make an
unprecedented run for a third term as governor. Democrats hailed
the idea, believing that Graham was the only Democrat who could
defeat Bush in the 1998 governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   After months of weighing both the personal and political
consequences, Graham decided not to challenge Bush. Later, Graham
even praised Bush's performance during his first year as governor.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, supporters urged Graham to consider running
for president. Graham never seemed to have the desire for the top
job. Supporters now say he is perfectly suited for the No. 2 spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the knowledge, the temperament and the stature to be
vice president,'' says Attorney General Bob Butterworth, Gore's
Florida campaign chairman. ``I think with Bob Graham on the ticket,
Al Gore can win Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   That is an important consideration. It takes 270 electoral votes
to become president and Florida has 25, nearly 10 percent of the
total needed. Democrats point to the fact that Clinton won Florida
in 1996, the first Democrat to do so since Jimmy Carter in 1976.
They also note that Clinton nearly defeated President George Bush
here in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never taken Florida for granted,'' insists Al
Cardenas, chairman of the Florida Republican Party. ``We've always
known we would have to fight to win here.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Cardenas admits that if Graham is on the ticket, it
changes the equation. ``I don't think people vote for who is No. 2
on the ticket,'' said Cardenas. ``But if Bob Graham is on there, it
could bring more Democrats to the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is not likely to make a decision until late summer. By
then, his strategists will have a better idea whether the Sunshine
State is winnable and whether Graham will help the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it will be a decision based largely on the numbers.
If Gore finds he has a better chance of winning other important
states with a different running mate, Graham will be out for his
third and likely final time.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Rebuffing calls from prominent Republicans to
reach out to Sen. John McCain, Gov. George W. Bush insisted
Wednesday that he had no intention of making concessions to his
vanquished rival for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush passed up several opportunities to embrace McCain's remedy
for overhauling the campaign finance system, the senator's
signature issue. He said he had learned nothing new about reform
from McCain, although he conceded that his challenger forced him to
be a more spirited competitor. And he was sparing in his praise of
McCain, whose supporters his campaign is counting on to win the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't change my views,'' Bush said in an hour-long
interview at the governor's mansion here on the day after he all
but officially clinched his party's nomination. Asked if McCain had
illuminated any new ideas for him or affected his positions, he
said, ``No, not really.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that McCain helped propel record turnouts in the
primaries, Bush responded curtly, ``Well, then, how come he didn't
win?'' He also noted that in South Carolina his candidacy helped
draw record numbers of Republicans to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments were notable because they suggested that despite
the bruising, bitter and sometimes humbling nature of his primary
campaign against McCain, the Texas governor had emerged from that
experience without any regrets about his campaign's conduct, any
second thoughts about his strategy or any new resolves for the way
he positions himself for the general election. His confidence, if
anything, seemed fortified.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond campaign finance reform, he refused to cede ground on any
of his positions. The governor said, for example, that he was not
daunted by polls showing that his plan to cut taxes by $483 billion
over five years has not caught on with voters. The proposal, he
said, would be a pillar of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I make something really clear to you, once again,'' he
asked. ``I don't care what the polls say. I don't.'' Insisting
there was no reason to turn back, he explained, ``It's a well
thought out plan backed by numbers, backed by credible sources, and
it's something I'm going to stay with, you bet.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he was not deterred _ or haunted _ by the
memory that voters were never drawn to the ambitious tax cut
proposal of Bob Dole, the Republican nominee four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different because one, I started early, and two, there's
a different budget projection,'' he said, drawing a contrast with
the plan Dole put forth late into the campaign. ``There's a
different budget picture. I'm still going to have to fight the same
thing he fought, with an administration that's desperate to keep
the money in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Signs that the economy is getting a bit shakier, he said, are
``all the more reason to provide tax relief,'' explaining that his
plan would not only jolt the economy but provide an insurance
policy against any downturn.
</P>
<P>
   To persuade Americans to back his plan, ``I'm going to have to
battle,'' he said. ``I'm going to have to battle with a vice
president who'll say risky this, risky that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said that in the end, voters will be less moved by
whatever sniping occurs between him and Gore and will make their
decisions based on a few overarching considerations. ``What's
critical to my election is a lot of things,'' he said. ``One, that
people trust my judgment. Two, that people hear the call for
reform. Three, that people know that I can renew what I call the
spirit of America. Four, that people are comfortable with the types
of people that I'll bring into my administration. Five, whether
people are happy or not with the status quo. I readily concede that
if people want four more years of Clinton-Gore, I've got a tough
road. I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what my position is. I'm the outside, and I'm the
challenger. I'm coming from outside Washington, and I'm the
challenger candidate. People say, I hear them talking out of
Washington, well, he doesn't have enough experience. As if being
the governor of the second biggest state and having served as a CEO
in the private sector isn't experience. It's a Washington
mentality. And I'm going to have to battle it. I'm fully aware of
the odds I'm going to face.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aggressiveness toward Vice President Al Gore was the
latest reminder of how quickly the general election campaign had
become ferocious. The governor made no effort to mask his animosity
toward Gore.
</P>
<P>
   With little prompting at the start of the interview, Bush said
that his Democratic rival was not to be trusted. Scoffing at an
e-mail Gore had sent to him Tuesday night calling for something of
a disarmament on both sides' use of unregulated soft money, Bush
said: ``I don't trust the man. He has no credibility as far as I'm
concerned about campaign funding reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush repeated six times the fact that he did not trust Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Gore said in his e-mail that he had instructed the
Democratic National Committee not to spend a cent on soft money for
issue commercials against the Republicans unless the Republicans
did so first.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Christopher Lehane, Gore's spokesman, mocked Bush's
comment that the vice president will do anything to win the White
House. Lehane said: ``If nothing else, the Republican primary
proved one thing: George W. Bush will do anything to get elected,
included embracing extreme right positions on choice, gun control,
tolerance, the environment and, of course, the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But if Bush's combative tone toward Gore was not surprising, his
relatively complacent attitude about any remaining rift between him
and McCain was.
</P>
<P>
   It could simply be part of an effort to maintain a brave public
face while the campaign's emissaries privately reach out to McCain
and his representatives. Even so, one of the few times Bush said
something explicitly favorable about the senator was in the course
of condemning Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, Al Gore is no John McCain,'' Bush said. ``Please
don't lump John into that category. Secondly, I think John McCain
is a person that basically wanted to elevate the discourse and had
a reason for running, rather than tearing somebody down.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked, then, if Gore had a reason for running, Bush replied,
``I'm sure he's got a reason, but their style, as we've seen from
the last eight years, is to demean and degrade.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's reluctance to reach out more aggressively to McCain, at
least publicly, could be politically perilous for the governor.
McCain has captured enough delegates that he has the leverage to
embarrass Bush at the party's convention this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bush supporters on opposite ends of the Republican spectrum
_ from Senate Republican leader Trent Lott to Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani of New York _ have called for a rapproachement between the
two on reform issues.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he needed to make any concessions to McCain, Bush
said: ``No. I think what I need to do is explain to John that we
agree a lot more than we disagree. There's a lot of room for reform
in Washington, D.C.'' But in an interview last week, McCain said it
would be ``unacceptable'' if Bush thought they could unite simply
over their opposition to Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was also unrepentant about the pointed attacks that his
campaign _ and supporters of his campaign _ had waged on the
Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was anything in particular, he said: ``Like what?
Give me an example. What should I regret?'' Pressed about the
negative tone of the campaign, he said, ``I didn't take the
negative tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was also unwilling to concede that his campaign had
squandered its record war chest of roughly $70 million to win the
primaries. He said he had ordered no changes in his organization
and was not worried about spending for the general election, when
each campaign will get roughly $67 million in federal subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush talked about how he manages his campaign and, by extension,
how he would function in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make suggestions on what to say all the time,'' he
said. ``I'll give you an example: I don't read what's handed to me.
People say, `Here, here's you're speech.' Or, `Here's an idea for a
speech.' They're changed. Trust me. Last night's a good example. We
could have been a lot harsher in tone on Vice President Gore last
night. I chose not to.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor resisted the temptation to criticize Clinton for
failing to negotiate lasting peace agreements in several regions,
from the Middle East to Northern Ireland to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for Americans and elected officials to be
patient with the peace process, to be diligent and patient,'' he
said. ``It's very important for the president not to impose a
United States solution on the peace process. So to the president's
credit, it seems to me on the Middle East he's working hard to
bring people together.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not yet time, he said, to turn over management of the
warring factions in the Balkans to the United Nations. ``I do think
it's time to begin to say to our European allies, `You're going to
have to be the peacekeepers,''' he said. ``I think it's going to be
very important for us to trim United States involvement around the
world from certain peacekeeping missions.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview closed as it began: With Bush's attention riveted
toward his general election opponent. How fierce a competitor would
Gore be?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about to find out,'' Bush said.

   Four Drug Makers Expected to Face FTC Complaints
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission is expected to file complaints
Thursday contending that four drug companies harmed consumers when
they made agreements that delayed the sale of low-cost generic
drugs, according to lawyers and executives briefed on the matter.
The civil actions would be the first to come from a continuing
investigation into deals under which companies that make brand-name
drugs pay rivals that are developing cheaper, generic forms not to
sell the lower cost drug. As a result, consumers pay hundreds of
millions of dollars more than they would if the cheaper drugs were
available.

   Bear Stearns posted a 20 percent increase in its first-quarter

had net income of $278.2 million, or $1.89 a diluted share,
compared with $230.7 million, or $1.45 a share, in the period a

   Stephen King's latest novella, ``Riding the Bullet,'' has proved

   Regulators in New York state, the nation's largest banking

<P>
   Thailand's bankruptcy court declared Thai Petrochemical Industry
insolvent. Creditors regarded the decision as an important victory
that could help them start to recover billions of dollars in unpaid

rejected a request to replace Thai Petrochemical's family-led

UTAH LAW WILL CREATE FIRST `PORNOGRAPHY CZAR' IN NATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Taking aim at the easy accessibility of
sexually explicit material in Utah, Gov. Michael O. Leavitt plans
to sign into law Friday a measure that will give Utah the nation's
first pornography czar.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt conceded that the new obscenity and pornography
complaints ombudsman, a deputy state attorney general, would have
no power over the biggest sources of sexual content _ the Internet
and cable television.
</P>
<P>
   But in a state where the Mormon Church and its socially
conservative views influence almost all aspects of life, Leavitt
said the law would ``codify our highest moral aspirations'' by
adding state powers to community efforts in fighting what some
residents regard as offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the bill in February was nearly unanimous in both
Republican-led chambers of the legislature, and it came just two
days after publication of a book by Gordon B. Hinckley, president
and prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
that urges followers to lead a more moral life and denounced what
Hinckley perceived as a surge in pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a state legislature is looking for a way to improve the
world, this is not an illogical way to strike a blow,'' said
Leavitt, a Republican, in an interview. ``Time will tell if it's a
good use of state money. But to me, there is no harm in trying.''
</P>
<P>
   The sponsor of the legislation, state Rep. Evan L. Olsen, a
Republican, said he did not believe pornography was a greater
problem in Utah than elsewhere. This assessment is shared by
officials in the Utah attorney general's office and supported by
Justice Department statistics that showed that rates of all crimes
had fallen steadily across the country in recent years, including
in Utah's largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Giampietro, a past president and now general counsel to
the First Amendment Lawyers Association, a national organization,
said proliferation of sexually explicit material on the Internet
had stimulated new interest in regulatory actions around the
country, like more restrictive zoning laws for businesses that
offer pornographic products.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I haven't seen any uptick in criminal prosecutions,''
Giampietro said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Olsen's measure creates a position in the attorney
general's office that state officials routinely call the
``pornography czar.'' The responsibilities will include advising
municipal governments about obscenity law, helping tailor
ordinances to suit local tastes as the U.S. Supreme Court has
allowed, arbitrating problems when possible and prosecuting
violations when necessary. Other states prosecute the same crimes,
but not necessarily by one person.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature has set aside $75,000 to cover salary and
expenses in the first year, which begins in January, and will allow
the budget to double the year after.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with no legal authority to take on cable television and the
Internet, the law is largely symbolic, said some legal experts in
Utah, including Carol Gnade, director of the Utah chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union. They also contend that it wastes
taxpayer money in that there is no demonstrable need for the job.
</P>
<P>
   But Olsen insisted that many Utah communities wrestle with how
to apply local obscenity laws and often need advice on how to
prosecute violators. He also said he had been convinced by events
in recent years reflecting public discomfort with sexual material
and activities in Utah that the recent legislative session was
``the right time and the right place to get something done.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a 1996 raid, the authorities in Utah County confiscated 1,000
films from a video-rental company in American Fork and Lehi, and
later charged the manager, Larry Peterman, with 15 counts of
distributing pornographic films. Peterman's first trial ended with
a hung jury, and he was acquitted in a second trial. But the
litigation succeeded in driving the company out of business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the owner of a small video-rental company in American
Fork offered to delete nudity and sex scenes from the film
``Titanic'' for $5. Within weeks, the company received more than
2,000 copies of the film for editing, a demand that led the owner,
Carol Biesinger, to expand the offer to include other films.
</P>
<P>
   In a more recent demonstration of concern, Olsen said the mayor
of a town he declined to identify called him to complain about a
house-cleaning service that was advertising charges of $80 an hour
for a woman to work in a bikini and $100 an hour for a woman to
work topless.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle Ruzicka, leader of the Utah chapter of the Eagle Forum, a
conservative action group, said the pervasiveness of sexually
explicit material in Utah led the group to support the Olsen bill
as a way to take ``a giant step in hopes that other states follow
to protect children and other adults.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry Mooney, a Salt Lake City lawyer and another past
president of the First Amendment Lawyers Association, called the
new pornography law ``rampant stupidity,'' predicting that it would
lead to financial strain on the state through local governments'
losing cases based on First Amendment considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When judges award attorney fees against communities, those
communities are going to say the state should pay the costs,'' he
said. ``This is a lose-lose nightmare situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The law also disturbs Utah business owners who sell sexually
explicit material. Keith Kofoed, the owner of a Salt Lake City shop
called Mischievous, said local police made him remove an
androgynous mannequin he placed in his store window as a
Valentine's Day promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, there is always the possibility they are going to close
you down,'' Kofoed said. ``That's the environment you have to live
with in Utah. Instead of things becoming more flexible here, they
are getting ultraconservative.''

they didn't meet until years later, when they worked in New York
City.
<P>
   Yet within months of their meeting, Shelby Bonnie and Halsey
Minor went into business together, with Bonnie putting up some of
the money for Minor's dream of creating computer shows for cable
television.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie ultimately quit his job, joined Minor and, despite some
struggles in those early years, helped steer San Francisco's Cnet
into becoming one of the leading Internet media firms, specializing
in providing news and reviews of computers and related products.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Minor stepped aside after nearly eight years as
Cnet's chief executive, handing the reins to his longtime friend
and confidant. Minor, who will remain as chairman, will start using
some of the considerable wealth he built at Cnet to help found and
grow new companies.
</P>
<P>
   The two men _ both 35 years old _ live 10 houses apart in San
Francisco's Sea Cliff neighborhood, and, as Bonnie said, ``We can
finish each other's sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie likened the transition to Bill Gates handing off
Microsoft's CEO slot to his old college pal Steve Ballmer, who was
already effectively running the company's operations. In Cnet's
case, Minor is the entrepreneur and visionary who didn't like
getting bogged down with budgets and organizational charts, Bonnie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite naysayers, Minor led the launch of the portal Snap and
was able to sell it to NBC, which is now using it as a centerpiece
of its Internet strategy _ a move that has made Cnet millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie has already been running more of the nuts-and-bolts
aspects of Cnet, which has grown to more than 700 employees and has
a market capitalization of nearly $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than $5 billion last week, before the announcement
of the CEO switch. The stock dropped 23 percent, from $70.56 on
March 6 to yesterday's close of $54.13. Minor's 11 percent stake in
Cnet was worth $436 million yesterday; Bonnie's 13 percent stake
was worth $516 million.
</P>
<P>
   About nine months ago, Minor and Bonnie began discussing the
change. Earlier last year, the company had hired a new president,
Rich Marino, former CEO of IDG's PC World, and with a deeper
management team, Minor felt comfortable exploring his alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Minor took a month off, relaxing in the Hamptons
while Bonnie, Marino and company ran Cnet. The company survived.
</P>
<P>
   A report on TheStreet.com said Minor plans to start an Internet
incubator with Eric Greenberg, founder of Web consultants Scient
and Viant.
</P>
<P>
   Minor, caught the other day in the Cnet corridors between
meetings, refused to confirm his plans except in the most general
sense. ``We're building a little sandbox for me to build other
things,'' he said. ``Cnet is really focused on executing its
business. The days of building Snap in here are over.''
</P>
<P>
   The new venture ``will allow me to participate in the new
economy in a broader sense,'' Minor said. ``I'll be building
companies in spaces outside where Cnet is.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside Cnet, Bonnie said he'll focus on several key initiatives
for the future:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; _Business-to-business commerce:  &LR; Cnet has built its brand by
providing information for consumers, enabling them to buy
technology products. Now, Bonnie plans to steer the company into
providing more service-oriented information to small and
medium-sized &LR;  businesses.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; _International:  &LR; The worldwide market for computer products is as
big as that in the United States, Bonnie said, and growing faster.
Cnet already has plans to launch sites and services in Europe and
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; _Wireless:  &LR; When Cnet acquired the company MySimon earlier this
year, it gained an impressive comparison shopping engine, and it
now plans to put that technology onto cell phones and other
devices. That way, consumers can read reviews and check comparable
prices while they're shopping in a store. ``Comparison shopping is
a killer app model in wireless,'' Bonnie said.
</P>
<P>
   On the walls in Bonnie's Chestnut Street office are several
totems that should serve as ample metaphors for his new role: a
pair of Cnet boxing gloves; framed Cnet shirts that he wore in
running a pair of New York marathons; a worker's belt, presented to
``the guy doing all the heavy lifting''; and a large prop from one
of Cnet's cable television shows that says, ``Reality Check,'' next
to a photo of the young Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIMES TRIBUNE: &QL; 
Watch to see what sort of walls fall in the wake of this week's
media megamerger, in which the Tribune Co. plans to acquire Times
Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune has earned headlines for knocking down the walls between
old and new media; Times Mirror, on the other hand, has sought to
raze the barriers between the business and journalistic sides of
its enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Gordon, who chairs the New Media program at the Medill
School of Journalism at Northwestern University in the Tribune
Co.'s hometown of Chicago, says that although Tribune's pioneering
efforts in new media produced some strong journalism, they did not
bring great success.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune is retooling to be more of ``an e-commerce company
enabled by great content,'' Gordon said. ``That's very different
than other traditional media companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, a former newsman with the Miami Herald and Palm Beach
Post, says some of the criticism of the L.A. Times' blurring the
lines between editorial and advertising was overblown. ``The belief
that there's an impermeable wall between editorial and advertising
in any media company is a myth,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But newspapers at least try. ``Clearly the wall in new media, if
there is a wall, is in a different place, or is a different height,
or has a different permeability. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to seamlessly connect content and commerce online
is one of the inherent attributes of the medium. As much as
journalists don't want to connect them, it's what people want to
do. We have to figure out where to draw the line.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
INTERNET MENACE: &QL; 
How does a big media firm protect its properties in cyberspace? If
the firm is Lucasfilm Ltd., the answer is: aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Tonik Barber, director of business affairs for the maker of the
``Star Wars'' series, told a lunch audience at San Rafael's
Dominican College last week that the Internet poses special
challenges to the owners of content, but that Lucasfilm has been
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   The company sent 700 letters to Internet service providers,
warning them that if any of their customers posted digital versions
of last year's ``Star Wars: Episode One _ The Phantom Menace,'' the
ISP would have to remove it under the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act (DMCA) &LR; , signed by President Clinton in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still feel we're right,'' Barber said. ``We haven't taken
it to court, but we think we're still the only company to take the
DMCA to that level.''

 Firm's Sale Prompts Fraud Case  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The U.S. attorney's office has charged the founders of a Bay Area
medical devices firm with faking safety tests on a brain catheter,
then selling their startup to an unwitting buyer for $70 million in
stock.
<P>
   The indictment unsealed yesterday in U.S. District Court in San
Jose was filed against Ronald L. Dieck and Erin M. McGurk, a
husband-and-wife team who founded Micro Interventional Systems in
Sunnyvale in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   They each owned 10 percent of the startup, which made them
approximately $7 million apiece when they sold the firm to
Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-page indictment alleges the two defendants ``and others
knowingly and willfully conspired to defraud'' the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration by fudging the results of safety tests the
company needed in order to win FDA approval to sell catheters and
other devices used to treat brain tumors and blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   Among other allegations, the indictment charges the defendants
directed a co-conspirator to conceal from the FDA the fact that one
device had unexpectedly killed a test pig.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Robert Van Nest of San Francisco said his
clients will plead innocent to the charges ``and defend themselves
vigorously.'' He declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   A release issued by the U.S. attorney's office said the maximum
penalty for each alleged violation in the nine-count indictment is
five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged wrongdoing was first brought to government attention
in 1998 by Medtronic, which has filed a separate civil action
charging that the defendants used the faked safety tests to inflate
the price that Medtronic paid for the startup.
</P>
<P>
   That civil case, filed in Minneapolis in 1998, is currently &LR;   &LR; in
arbitration, said Medtronic spokeswoman Jessica Stoltenberg.
</P>
<P>
   She said her company did not suspect any wrongdoing in 1995 when
it purchased the startup in order to get into the
$100-million-a-year business of selling brain catheters and related
devices.
</P>
<P>
   It was only in 1998, after Medtronic decided to resell its
acquisition and get out of the business, that an informant inside
the Sunnyvale division disclosed that the safety tests may have
been faked, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No (prepurchase) due diligence can uncover this kind of
fraud,'' Stoltenberg said. ``If people falsify data, you can only
find that (out) if you know it's there and have a full blown
audit.''
</P>
<P>
   After the tip, she said Medtronic conducted such an audit and
shared the results with the FDA. She said Medtronic recalled all
the medical devices tainted by the alleged faking and shut down the
Sunnyvale division, which had once employed 55 people.
</P>
<P>
   Dieck and McGurk did not respond to calls placed to Magic
Venture Capital, the company they operate in Palo Alto.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a series of genetic markers as their evidence,
Manhattan prosecutors announced the indictment Wednesday of the man
known as the East Side rapist, even though investigators still do
not know who he is.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, one of the first times in the nation that a DNA
signature alone has been used to charge a crime, will prevent the
statute of limitations from expiring in three of the seven rapes he
is suspected of committing between 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury charged the man four days before the five-year
statute of limitations would have expired on the earliest attack
cited in the indictment, said Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan
district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said he believed the East Side
rapist was still at large.
</P>
<P>
   In October, prosecutors in Milwaukee announced they had filed
charges in three rapes against a man known only by his DNA code.
There has been at least one other such warrant based on DNA
evidence, a 1991 case in Kansas. No one has been apprehended in
either case.
</P>
<P>
   John Doe indictments are typically used in fraud cases, where
prosecutors may not know the real name of the alleged perpetrator
or in cases where they have a precise physical description but have
not learned the alleged perpetrator's name.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and legal experts said the number of indictments
based solely on DNA codes would increase rapidly in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very new, very creative kind of prosecution,'' said
Linda Fairstein, the chief of the Manhattan district attorney's sex
crimes unit.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Thomas P. Carney said the DNA evidence has eliminated two
suspects in the East Side attacks over the last year. When officers
tested one man's DNA last year, collected surreptitiously, he was
exonerated, Carney said.
</P>
<P>
   The probability that a person other than the attacker has a DNA
profile matching the one in the Manhattan indictment is 1 in 240
billion, Morgenthau said.
</P>
<P>
   The rapist attacked all but one of his victims on the Upper East
Side of Manhattan, after 2 a.m., the police said. He last struck a
year and half ago, and some investigators believe he has left the
city. But the police said the indictment ensures that their work
will not go to waste if he is eventually identified by name.
</P>
<P>
   The statute of limitations has run out on two of the 16 attacks
linked to the rapist, police officials said. The two attacks
following those were included in Wednesday's indictment, along with
another. Morgenthau said DNA evidence was recovered in a fourth
attack linked to the rapist and added that an indictment in that
case was expected. The police have linked other attacks to the same
man by a description and details on how he assaulted his victims,
Carney said.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 12,000 New York City rape cases in which the
evidence has not been examined for DNA signatures. Morgenthau said
his prosecutors and investigators were looking for assaults that
match a pattern, then conducting tests on DNA taken from the
evidence. Cases that follow a pattern would be the next John Doe
indictments, he said.

 E.piphany to Buy Octane For $2.4 Billion  
 By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Highlighting the holy grail of e-commerce _ effectively targeting
Web customers _ two San Mateo software firms said yesterday they
will join forces in a $2.4 billion deal, creating a powerhouse in
the arena of tracking and analyzing customer data.
<P>
   E.piphany Inc. said it will acquire Octane Software by issuing
12.8 million shares of E.piphany stock to Octane shareholders.
Those shareholders, including all 220 or so Octane employees, will
own about 26.5 percent of the combined 500-employee company.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second multibillion-dollar deal in a week involving
Bay Area softwaremakers. On Monday, Dallas' I2 Technologies
announced plans to acquire Aspect Development of Mountain View for
$9.3 billion _ thought to be a record in the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   Though some analysts say E.piphany may be paying too much for
Octane _ the deal drove down E.piphany's stock by almost 25 percent
on an already rough day for the Nasdaq _ some analysts say the two
companies are a natural fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a near-perfect combination of technologies and
strengths,'' Forrester Research analyst Bob Chatham said.
``E.piphany helps you gain insights into customer preference in a
statistical way. ... Octane provides technology for managing
communications.''
</P>
<P>
   E.piphany makes programs that let companies slice and dice
hordes of customer information from Web sites, call centers and
direct mailings in order to better tailor marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Octane's products tally how many times a customer
e-mailed complaints to a company's Web site, then relays that
information to the call center representative who takes a call from
that customer.
</P>
<P>
   Octane founder Tim Guleri, who will become vice chairman and
executive vice president of strategy and business development, said
the alliance creates a complete way for e-tailers to interact with
customers in real time.
</P>
<P>
   With the company's technology, ``A customer comes to a Web site
for self-service, (E.piphany) picks up the data, and if they're
buying blue shirts at Nordstrom's Web site, it tells them they need
to buy a yellow tie,'' Guleri said.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Aspect deal earlier in the week, some on Wall
Street balked at the figure for privately held Octane, which was
days away from filing papers for an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Though Octane is backed by heavy hitters Lucent Ventures and
Sigma Ventures, $2.4 billion is ``an awful lot of money,'' said
Jack Staff, an analyst at Zona Research.
</P>
<P>
   Such consternations _ and the sudden drop in E.piphany's stock
price following a thirteenfold jump since its September IPO _ make
some wonder whether the deal will come off at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that stock price continues to tank too much, E.piphany
might not get the shareholder votes it needs to make (the
acquisition) happen,'' Staff said.
</P>
<P>
   Those enthused about the deal seem to be betting on the customer
relationship management market itself, which is expected to grow to
$18 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are investing a lot of money in this,'' Chase H&AMP;Q
analyst Ian Morton said. ``Can you get repeat customer business?
That's something all companies are fighting for today.'' Morton
rates E.piphany shares a ``buy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Octane purchase bolsters E.piphany's ability to compete with
Palo Alto's Kana Communications Inc., whose software routes
incoming e-mail, studies customer information and identifies
trends. Kana said last month that it would buy Silknet Software
Inc., whose applications let companies track orders on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in both Kana and E.piphany hope the companies' revenue
will skyrocket as more Internet and brick-and-mortar businesses
turn to technology to understand customer preferences and increase
repeat business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Treating customers individually is really in its infancy,''
said Bob Moran, research vice president at the Aberdeen Group, a
Boston research firm. ``People who say we have one-to-one marketing
down are really foolish. Most corporations don't understand
themselves, let alone their customers.''

 Fatbrain Opens New Chapter on D-Books With MightyWords  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Capitalizing on the success of Stephen King's first Internet book
this week, a Santa Clara online book distributor will announce
plans today to sell more downloadable tomes.
<P>
   Fatbrain.com Inc. will announce today it is spinning off its
7 &LR; - &LR; month-old consumer-oriented Web site eMatter.com into a company
devoted to selling downloadable publications from authors such as
Arthur C. Clarke and Caroline Kennedy-Schlossberg.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, which specializes in selling engineering and other
technical publications online, said the new company will be called
MightyWords.com, a name derived from the adage, ``The pen is
mightier than the sword.''
</P>
<P>
   John Logan, an analyst with the research firm Aberdeen Group,
said the move comes at time when ``d-books,'' his term for books
that can be downloaded in electronic form from the Internet to a
computer or handheld device, are about to take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the week that the d-book has gone from being a trend
to an inflection point in how technology will change our lives,''
said Logan, Aberdeen Group's chairman and co-founder. ``There's a
huge demand for a 10- to 100-page d-book.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the popular horror novelist King became the first to
release a book in electronic form only, a 66-page short story
called ``Riding the Bullet.'' Each downloaded copy cost $2.50.
</P>
<P>
   Customer traffic was so high at sites like Barnes &AMP; Noble and
Amazon at 10 a.m. that servers overloaded, and some King fans
couldn't get through.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bell, a spokesman for netLibrary.com, a Boulder, Colo.,
online book distributor, reported no overload problems. The book
distributor and its subsidiary, Peanutpress.com, sold about 10,000
copies in the first 24 hours and more copies in the first hour than
the company expected for one day, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Kirkpatrick, MightyWords.com executive vice president, said
her site offers known and unknown authors the chance to publish
work that big publishing houses normally would not find marketable,
such as how-to manuals for an arcane hobby or short stories about
an offbeat topic.
</P>
<P>
   Famed science fiction writer Clarke, for example, is offering
the text of a speech he wrote on the impact of television and the
soul, Kirkpatrick said. Wendy Goldman Rohm is adding online updates
to her book ``The Microsoft File: The Secret Case Against Bill
Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   The work can be downloaded into a computer in an Adobe Acrobat
format specially encrypted to prevent the file from being re-sent
to someone else for free by e-mail. Users can either read the book
or story on the computer or print it out on paper. Fatbrain CEO
Chris MacAskill conceded that there is no way to prevent consumers
from making multiple paper copies.
</P>
<P>
   MightyWords offers a 50-50 royalties split with the authors;
writers often get 10 percent from traditional publishing houses.
Since its start as eMatter, the online distributor has sold
thousands of publications over the Web, with each sale averaging
$8.
</P>
<P>
   To kick off the redesigned site, MightyWords will offer free
short essays on the Bill of Rights by several writers, including
attorney Kennedy-Schlossberg, daughter of the late President John
F. Kennedy; actress Whoopi Goldberg; former House Speaker Newt
Gingrich; and Coretta Scott King, widow of slain civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Fatbrain CEO Chris MacAskill said MightyWords will start as a
subsidiary of Fatbrain but will spin off into a separate company
``as soon as possible.''

 Fitness sites want to pump you up  
 By Carrie Kirby 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A new fitness technique is being embraced by health clubs and
medical research as a revolutionary way to lose weight and get in
shape. It goes like this:
<P>
   1. Sit down in front of computer.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place right hand on mouse and click.
</P>
<P>
   3. Repeat.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, Web entrepreneurs are trying to accomplish what
the $16 billion fitness industry has so far failed at: Getting
pudgy, sedentary Americans into shape. The Department of Health and
Human Services reports that 35 percent of Americans are overweight.
</P>
<P>
   GetFit.com, eFit.com and Asimba.com are a few of the sites that
have mobilized athletes, dietitians, professional coaches and
doctors to create smart, Web-based applications that act like
personal trainers. The American Heart Association is putting
together a not-for-profit version of the same idea at
www.justmove.org.
</P>
<P>
   Available free online, the applications use an individual's
fitness goals and exercise preferences to develop a personalized
fitness and diet program. As they follow the program, users log
their accomplishments _ and what they eat _ on the site, and then
they can view their progress over time on charts and graphs.
</P>
<P>
   At least one site, Redwood City's Asimba, can be used on a Palm
or other handheld device, so users can record their miles or
calories while they're still at the track or McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites offer encouragement in the form of e-mail reminders,
online support groups and calorie calculators.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites plan to provide exercisers with feedback as they
pursue their goals, either through artificial intelligence or from
staff trainers. If after 10 weeks your goal of adding an inch to
each bicep has eluded you, the site may suggest that you increase
your intake of protein or rest for a shorter time between
weightlifting sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biz model is predicated on a paradox,'' said Asimba chief
executive Kurt Schneider. ``We're using a sedentary medium to
motivate you to get off your keister.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Internet use is often blamed for expanding waistlines
and rear ends, a study by the Brown University medical school
suggests that Internet-based programs can be effective in helping
people lose weight. The ongoing study shows that dieters who
interacted with a Web site by reporting what they ate and by
getting advice from professionals via e-mail lost an average of 9
pounds in 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Another group, which had access to weight-loss advice on a Web
site but didn't receive e-mail reminders or participate in other
interactive activities, lost only about 3 pounds during the study.
</P>
<P>
   Marcie Kay, a Palo Alto mother, became a beta tester for
GetFit.com's still-unreleased personal training program to help her
take off a few pounds after giving birth to her second child. She
says she wants to be in good condition because she hopes to have a
third child soon.
</P>
<P>
   She filled out a GetFit.com questionnaire, informing the site
that she has access to a swimming pool, a health club and a
treadmill, and that she enjoys running. She set the goals of losing
5 to 10 pounds and improving her muscle tone.
</P>
<P>
   The site gave her a weekly calendar that started with 3 miles on
the treadmill Monday, and included workouts with free weights and
the StairMaster exercise machine. If she doesn't know how to do an
exercise she is assigned, she watches animated instructions that
the Web site provides.
</P>
<P>
   Kay has worked with a personal trainer before, but she prefers
using the Web page for a reason many casual exercisers cite: ``I
don't like people watching me exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others who are attracted to the online fitness model, Kay
also says she's too busy to schedule appointments with trainers.
Another major draw is that most fitness Web sites offer their
services for free, while personal trainers charge about $60 per
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of worrying that sites like GetFit.com will steal their
customers, health clubs hope that many users of these sites will,
like Kay, print out workout recommendations and take them to the
gym. In fact, the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub
Association is devoting its annual conference, held at the Moscone
Center next week, to the impact of the Internet on the fitness
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Some gyms are forming partnerships with Web sites. Members of
several hundred clubs nationwide, including YMCAs, can record their
miles run or pounds lifted on kiosks powered by a site called
FitLinxx.com. Logging pounds lifted on a computer instead of on
paper makes it easier to visualize how much you've accomplished:
FitLinxx tells you how many sports cars you could have lifted this
month and how many ice cream cones worth of calories you've burned.
</P>
<P>
   Personal trainers use the system to review their clients'
progress and communicate with them via e-mail, increasing the
amount of contact between scheduled meetings. Clients who aren't
working with a trainer can use FitLinxx to create personalized
workouts much like the other fitness sites provide.
</P>
<P>
   Asimba partnered with Crunch, a nationwide club chain, on a
program called Millennium Challenge, which encouraged participants
to meet their fitness goals by letting them compete against others
and by sending them daily e-mail reminders to work out. Crunch's
staff promoted the challenge to club members.
</P>
<P>
   Asimba CEO Schneider said the company will announce a larger
partnership next week that would put Internet terminals on
treadmills and other exercise machines in gyms, so members'
progress could be recorded automatically. One company, NetPulse,
already provides gyms with Internet/television terminals that
attach to exercise machines, which members can use to log their
progress.
</P>
<P>
   For people who work out at home, the world's largest
manufacturer of exercise machines, Icon Health &AMP; Fitness, has
created its own Web site, called iFit.com. Icon's new
Internet-ready treadmills, stationary bikes and other machines,
priced between $600 and $1,400, can be connected to a home
computer. While on the treadmill, the user might see a virtual
course of rolling hills on the computer monitor. At the same time,
the treadmill tilts to simulate running uphill.
</P>
<P>
   With a Web cam, exercisers can also enter a live teleconference
with a personal trainer for an hourly rate.
</P>
<P>
   Icon is working on technology that will enable users to race one
another on virtual tracks, just as video game players zap each
other in online games.
</P>
<P>
   Some personal trainers are offering their services online,
either through these large commercial sites or on their own. By
pursuing Internet clients, a trainer can see more people and earn
more money. But some trainers worry that eliminating face-to-face
meetings could be counterproductive and even dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Susy Jones, who coaches athletes preparing for triathlons in San
Francisco, says she experimented briefly with online training but
abandoned it because she couldn't be sure that her clients were
exercising properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I trained someone over the Internet, I put a
15-minute warm-up in the program. They skipped it and they pulled a
calf muscle the first time out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most fitness sites sidestep the safety issue by advising that
exercisers meet with their doctor or a trainer before starting a
program. And they require users to indicate that they understand
that exercise involves risk before they can register.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sullivan, a former Stanford athletic coach who now works for
GetFit.com, acknowledged that having in-person training would be
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the ideal scenario, everyone would have their own personal
staff, with their own physician, trainer, dietitian, etc.,''
Sullivan said. ``Can you afford to have a professional staff of
seven or eight people to take care of you every day?''

 _ SF CHRON  
 New Movie Has PG&AMP;E Walking on Eggshells  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The expression on Julia Roberts' face is one of both outrage and
gritty determination. ``She brought a small town to its feet,'' the
ads say, ``and a huge company to its knees.''
<P>
   That huge company is San Francisco's Pacific Gas and Electric
Co., which finds itself in the uncomfortable position of being cast
as the object of Roberts' scorn in the based-on-a-true-story new
film ``Erin Brockovich.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, opening nationwide tomorrow, has caused considerable
consternation among PG&AMP;E's top brass, and, according to one source,
even prompted the utility to plant spies on the set to keep track
of the production.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E, insiders say, is deeply concerned about the movie's
rehashing of one of the most notorious episodes in the company's
history. That case resulted in the utility paying $333 million to
settle charges that it poisoned hundreds of people with a highly
toxic chemical.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Untimely Reminder
</P>
<P>
   This is the last thing the company wants the public reminded of
as it prepares for a trial in November that could make the earlier
settlement seem puny by comparison. More than 1,500 plaintiffs are
participating in the latest case, which their lawyer says will show
conclusively that the utility has repeatedly covered up
environmental mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Connecting the dots _ that's the thing PG&AMP;E is most concerned
about,'' said a former high-ranking company official who requested
anonymity. ``They've got environmental situations all over the
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things come out,'' the former official said, ``a reputation
they've cultivated for environmental responsibility turns out to be
not very responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Erin Brockovich,'' starring the highest-paid actress on the
planet, centers on a 1993 lawsuit over contamination of the air and
water around the small San Bernardino County town of Hinkley.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of exposure to the chemical chromium from PG&AMP;E's
nearby natural-gas pumping plant, local residents were subject to
nearly every physical ailment imaginable, including various forms
of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Film Portrays Justice-Seekers
</P>
<P>
   They are depicted in the film as decent, salt-of-the-earth folk
who, after learning the truth about their predicament from legal
investigator Brockovich, only want justice for the tragedies they
have experienced.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E, for its part, comes off as arrogant, cunning and
duplicitous _ the epitome of corporate evil. The company is
depicted as attempting to deceive Hinkley residents and to cover up
its misbehavior. It's shown to be unsympathetic, at best, toward
the more than 600 people it has hurt.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, the company admitted seems ok here  &LR; that it
released chromium into the environment from 1951 to 1966. However,
it did not inform local residents of the problem until 1987.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E ultimately decided not to contest the resulting lawsuit and
to instead enter into binding arbitration. The case was settled in
July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   An internal memo sent to PG&AMP;E employees last week from Bob
Glynn, chief executive of the utility's parent company, admitted
that ``PG&AMP;E did not respond to the groundwater problem as openly,
quickly or thoroughly as it should have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear, in retrospect, that our company should have
handled some things differently at that time,'' the memo says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it notes that ```based on a true story' doesn't mean that
everything in the story is true. The movie is an entertainment
vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Be that as it may, PG&AMP;E was quick to realize that ``Erin
Brockovich'' could explode into a PR nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bad enough that a film was being made,'' the former
company official said. ``But the fact that Julia Roberts was in it
really heightened anxiety. Everybody figured that Hollywood would
slam the hell out of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Another source, a PG&AMP;E employee who worked for the utility
during the Hinkley lawsuit and is still with the company, confirmed
that PG&AMP;E executives were indeed concerned about the depiction of
the utility in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure there was concern,'' this employee said. ``We didn't know
how the company was going to be portrayed. Would it look like a
stand-up company, or would it look like a sleaze?''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Name Change Not Pursued
</P>
<P>
   The former official, who also was with PG&AMP;E throughout the
Hinkley matter and during the subsequent making of ``Erin
Brockovich,'' said the company at one point considered paying the
film's producers to change PG&AMP;E's name in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never called us,'' said Carla Santos Shamberg, executive
producer of ``Erin Brockovich.'' ``And that's just as well. It
would have made them look even worse to try and bribe us.''
</P>
<P>
   She also defended the overwhelmingly good-versus-evil tone of
the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't come up with what PG&AMP;E did right in this
circumstance,'' Shamberg said. ``These people were victims of
PG&AMP;E's misdeeds. We portrayed (events) as accurately as we could.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep tabs on the film's production, PG&AMP;E hired a Southern
California public relations company to monitor media reports and to
send back dispatches from the set, the former official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of interest in finding out when the film would
open,'' this person said. ``Would it come out just before the
annual meeting?''
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E spokesman Greg Pruett denied that the company hired anyone
to spy on the filmmakers. He also echoed Glynn's position that the
movie ``is a dramatization, not a documentary, and there can be
quite a bit of latitude in how you combine facts and drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Pruett and Glynn said they hadn't yet seen ``Erin
Brockovich.'' That they nevertheless have strong stands on the
film's accuracy indicates how seriously PG&AMP;E executives take
tomorrow's opening.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Braced Then, Braced Now
</P>
<P>
   The publicity should be a good deal more fierce this time around
than when the case was originally settled. Although PG&AMP;E was braced
at the time for a firestorm of lousy PR, the former official said
the company was pleasantly surprised to find the matter all but
ignored by the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a genuine sense of relief that this did not become a
big story,'' this person said.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to the settlement, the former official said, ``we
were extremely concerned that someone in the media would pick up on
how the arbitration happened down there. It was a daily concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the former official said company executives were
worried that some enterprising reporter would piece together that
chromium had been used to prevent corrosion in pumps not only at
the Hinkley plant, but at facilities in Kettleman near Fresno and
in the town of Topock on the California-Arizona border.
</P>
<P>
   The real-life Brockovich investigated the Kettleman plant, and
the real-life lawyer she works for, Ed Masry, has filed another
suit against PG&AMP;E on behalf of about 1,400 former residents of the
area and PG&AMP;E workers seeking compensation for personal injuries,
as well as more than 150 Hinkley residents who missed out on the
first settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``PG&AMP;E is going to get burned bad,'' Masry said. ``Kettleman is
an exact replica of Hinkley, and they continued doing all the same
things.''
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E's Pruett said he could not comment on the Kettleman case or
any other pending lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the former PG&AMP;E official said potential contamination
from use of chromium at the Topock plant ``could be the worst of
all. It's right next to the Colorado River.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Baker, a spokesman for the state Department of Toxic
Substances Control in Sacramento, said investigators have indeed
found evidence of chromium contamination in the soil and ground
water surrounding the Topock plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, the river has not been affected yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A full report on the department's findings will be released next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The former PG&AMP;E official said the company's strategy has been to
isolate Hinkley ``as a one-time situation'' and to not draw
attention to use of chromium at other plants.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, this person added, ``the company has been
doing a lot to bill itself as an environmentally responsible
corporation.'' The chromium cases are ``a distinct threat,
obviously, to that image.''
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E's ``statement of environmental policy'' says the company
``is committed to being an environmental leader'' and will ``comply
fully with the letter and spirit of applicable environmental laws
and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   But the utility is no stranger to accusations of environmental
wrongdoing. In 1993, for example, more than 250 current and former
residents of the Midway Village public housing complex in Daly City
sued PG&AMP;E for allegedly contaminating soil in the area with toxic
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E has challenged claims that chemicals from its nearby
facility are responsible for the illnesses of Midway residents,
although a federal health study last year found that the residents
suffer from an ``abnormal'' number of genetic defects.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the company agreed to pay $14 million to dismiss state
and federal claims that it withheld information about the impact of
the cooling system at its Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant on
marine life.
</P>
<P>
   Masry, the lawyer, said PG&AMP;E seems to believe that its
environmental problems will go away if the company simply persists
in trying to keep them under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their heads are in the sand,'' he said. ``And now they think
this movie is just going to go away. But instead it looks like it
could be a big hit.''
</P>
<P>
   As if that wasn't bad enough for the utility, Masry said CourtTV
has already asked to air the proceedings of the Kettleman trial
live on cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to get a lot worse for PG&AMP;E,'' he predicted.

BMW SHARES SOAR ON POSSIBLE ROVER SALE

<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Shares of BMW AG soared 13.7 percent
Wednesday amid widespread expectations that the German car
manufacturer would decide on Thursday to sell Rover Cars, its
loss-plagued British subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   One day after BMW said that it would consider the sale of Rover
at its supervisory board meeting on Thursday, speculation was
widespread in Britain and Germany about potential buyers. The
Munich-based newspaper Sueddeutsche reported Thursday that BMW was
preparing to sell most of Rover to a Cayman Islands investment
group.
</P>
<P>
   BMW, which said it had been studying its options for the last
several months, said Wednesday that it would announce its plans
Friday. Analysts said its options included closing Rover's main
factory at Longbridge and cutting back the range of Rover car
models; selling off the car business while holding onto the popular
Land Rover sport utility vehicles and Mini subcompacts; or forming
an alliance with a larger automaker.
</P>
<P>
   British union officials at BMW's Longbridge factory, alarmed at
the possibility that thousands of workers could lose their jobs,
flew to the company's headquarters in Munich on Wednesday in an
attempt to find out more about BMW's intentions.

SYCAMORES OF '79 REMEMBER GLORY DAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beer drinking might actually help people's memory _ and not
waste it _ at a sports bar near the Indiana State campus in Terre
Haute, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Purcell, the proprietor of The Terminal sports bar, said
the locals can celebrate the Sycamores' appearance in the NCAA
Tournament against Texas today and remember the last time Indiana
State made it to the tournament every time they order another
round.
</P>
<P>
   All day today at The Terminal, it's 79 cents a beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because it was 1979 the last time Indiana State made it
to the tournament,'' Purcell said. ``If that doesn't work, our
Sycamore Burgers are $3.79.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the beer-and-burger combo, all anyone had to do to
remember the last Indiana State team to play in the NCAA Tournament
was invoke the name of Larry Bird. That was 21 years ago when Bird
and the Sycamores played in one of the more memorable
national-championship games in history. Despite ``Larry Legend,''
Indiana State lost to a team with another legendary player.
Michigan State, led by Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson, beat the
Sycamores, 75-64, in a game that had the highest TV ratings in NCAA
Tournament history.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Indiana State team might not hold a lot in common
with the '79 team. As Sycamores coach Royce Waltman said, ``That
team has taken on a folklore status. People realize that was a
once-in-a-lifetime team and player.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird said, however, that this year's team has a chance to pull a
surprise today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen them play a couple times and they've done a good
job,'' said Bird, coach of the NBA's Indiana Pacers. ``They will
keep the score down and make it tough on Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   In '79, the Sycamores made it tough on everyone. They were
undefeated in 33 games when they faced Michigan State. Indiana
State is 22-9 this season, and the Sycamores lost the chance for an
automatic bid when they were defeated by Creighton in the Missouri
Valley Conference tournament championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pairings for the NCAA Tournament already had been
announced during Sunday's nationally televised selection show, and
it was beginning to look as if Indiana State might miss the
tournament again.
</P>
<P>
   But then the West Region bracket came up on the TV screen and
one of the opening-round sites was Salt Lake City. That's when Brad
Miley, a starter on that '79 Indiana State team, started believing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked over at my wife and told her, `Wouldn't it be
appropriate if we make the tournament and play in Salt Lake City?'
'' Miley said. ``It's where we played in the Final Four. And, sure
enough, we're in. That's really brought back some memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Miley, who's 41 and works with a wholesale liquor
distributorship, is one of two prominent members of the '79 team
that still lives in Terre Haute. Bob Heaton, who made two key shots
to keep the team undefeated in '79, joins Miley as a season ticket
holder for Sycamores games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear you've got that big guy \R7-foot Texas center Chris
Mihm\S,'' Heaton said. ``But Nate Green \Rthe Indiana State
guard\S, he's a player. He's legitimate. If he had an outside shot,
he'd be a first-rounder in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Heaton, and every other Sycamore not named Bird, never enjoyed
much basketball success after college. At 43, Heaton is an
insurance broker and financial planner in Terre Haute.
</P>
<P>
   But he was a part of two major plays for the '79 team. Indiana
State was 18-0 heading into a February game at New Mexico State.
Trailing by two points with less than three seconds on the clock,
Heaton banked in a 50-foot desperation shot to send the game into
overtime. The Sycamores eventually won.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest Region final against Arkansas, Heaton hit a shot
in the lane to break a tie game as time expired. He put up his shot
left-handed. Heaton is right-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Miley was regarded as a defensive stopper. Against DePaul in the
Final Four semifinal game, Miley was assigned to cover Mark
Aguirre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong. Like a lot of guys I covered, he was a
nice player,'' Miley said. ``But I wondered, shoot, didn't they
have better than that? I covered better than that every day in
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Miley covered Bird in practices. With memories like that, he
wonders what's in store today for the Sycamores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is like the way we played because they play hard on
defense,'' Miley said. ``But on offense, well, they don't have
Larry.''

NASA URGED TO PAY RUSSIA TO HELP BOOST SPACE STATION PROJECT

<P>
   The National Research Council on Wednesday urged NASA to
consider paying financially-ailing Russia for equipment and

international space station.
</P>
<P>
   Though politically controversial, the strategy could be less
costly to U.S. taxpayers than having NASA take over Russia's pledge
to launch a half-dozen Progress cargo and Soyuz crew capsules
annually, the research council said in a wide-ranging assessment of
issues facing the orbital station once it's assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Financial and political turmoil in Russia have stalled the
construction of the $100 billion, 16-nation project. Though 27
months late, the Russian three-person crew module that is scheduled
for launching in July will jump start the construction that has
been in limbo since the first two components were lofted in late
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Circling the Earth at an altitude of 250 miles, the new space
station is intended to provide a laboratory where scientists can
study the long-term health effects of weightlessness on astronauts.
Among its other uses, the outpost also will furnish a place for
NASA to evaluate equipment that could be used for future human
expeditions to the moon or Mars.
</P>
<P>
   As tensions between the U.S. and Russian space agencies rose at
that point over the future of the project, NASA made $60 million in
payments to Russia to ensure it could complete the one-of-a-kind
crew module and furnish near-term Progress and Soyuz capsules it
had promised in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Progress capsules will deliver fuel for the propulsion
system that will ensure the massive station does not lose altitude
and re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. The Soyuz capsules will
transport U.S. and Russian astronauts to and from the orbital
outpost and while docked serve as a lifeboat that could whisk a
crew to Earth in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, NASA obtained funds from Congress to modify
its space shuttles so they could periodically raise the station's
altitude if the Progress flights fell behind schedule. The United
States also began development of a propulsion module for the
station that would eliminate the need for any Progress flights.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the research council urged NASA to initiate a
formal study that would compare the costs of paying a Russian
aerospace contractor to build and launch the required Progress and
Soyuz craft against the expense of launching more American shuttle
missions and developing a U.S. propulsion module for the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are urging (NASA) to step back and take another look,''
said Thomas Kelly, the retired Grumman aerospace executive who
chaired the research council's 11-member panel. ``Rather than try
to duplicate the Russian hardware it might be better to buy it up
front.''
</P>
<P>
   A change in strategy would involve ``a trade-off between cost
and political considerations,'' one NASA cannot make until it makes
the cost assessment, the panel concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The politics could be thorny.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, President Clinton signed legislation
restricting U.S. payments to Russia for the station work. Under the
terms of the Iran Nonproliferation Act, payments are barred unless
the United States can confirm Russia has not transferred missile
technology or nuclear, chemical or biological weapons to Iran
during the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's role in the station project was one of a wide range of
issues examined by the research council in its report titled,
``Engineering Challenges to the Long-Term Operation of the
International Space Station.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding nothing troublesome in the fundamental design of the
proposed station, the panel nevertheless was troubled by the amount
of time American astronauts visiting Russia's Mir space station
spent on maintenance tasks rather than on scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   The panel suggested that NASA include one scientist who is not a
professional astronaut among its seven-member station crews to help
establish a balance.

REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE CAN'T MATCH BUSH'S TAX CUT PLAN
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: This story is now on the Times A1; see also BUSH-NYT.)  
(rk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In taking their first step toward a federal budget
for next year, House Republicans were left Wednesday in the awkward
position of backing a smaller tax cut than their party's
presumptive presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The tax and spending blueprint, passed by the House Budget
Committee on a party line vote of 23-18, would provide more money
for the Pentagon and education, freeze or cut many other programs
and set aside at least $150 billion and perhaps as much as $250
billion for tax cuts over five years starting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan calls for a tax cut of $483 billion over five years
starting in 2002. His plan would require roughly $300 billion for
the tax cuts over the period covered by the House Republican plan.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans insisted they had no disagreement with Bush
over the size of the tax cut and said they were confident that with
a Republican in the White House they could find the additional
money needed to close the gap between their plans.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican ``with a reform agenda'' like Bush could easily
squeeze another $50 billion out of government spending over five
years, said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, who is chairman of the budget
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not backing away from the Bush tax cut and neither are
members of this committee,'' Kasich said.
</P>
<P>
   But the difficulty that Republican leaders have had in coming up
with a plan that would give Bush all that he wants highlighted
their problems in translating their ideological penchant for
smaller government into spending restraint that even a
Republican-controlled Congress can swallow. And it gave the White
House, Vice President Al Gore and Democrats in Congress a new
opportunity to portray Bush's plan as excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the budget committee went so far as to tweak the
Republicans Wednesday by offering an amendment to the budget plan
calling for Bush's tax plan to be included. The amendment was
defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the director of the White House's National
Economic Council, said that ``if you were looking for a
definition'' of fiscal irresponsibility, ``it would be a tax cut
that was so excessive that even the House Republicans are basically
forced to admit they couldn't afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said the situation just helped to make his point
that Congress, under pressure from President Clinton, has been far
too willing to spend money and that the best remedy was to send as
much of the government's revenue as possible back to the people who
earned it, the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor believes that money left in Washington is likely
to be spent, and that covers both parties,'' said Ari Fleischer,
Bush's spokesman. ``It will take a new president to change the way
Washington does business and turn things around.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan passed by the committee calls for an increase in
overall government spending of 3 percent, to $1.85 trillion. About
two-thirds of that amount would go to Social Security, Medicare,
interest payments on the national debt and other commitments that
Congress does not revisit each year.
</P>
<P>
   The other third of the budget, which covers everything from the
space program and the FBI to Head Start and environmental programs,
would rise by 3.16 percent under the Republican plan, to $596.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly all of that increase would go to the military, which
would see its budget rise 6 percent next year, to $307.3 billion.
The increase in non-military programs would be held to three-tenths
of 1 percent, well below the inflation rate, which is running
between 2 and 3 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would set aside $40 billion over five years to finance
a yet-to-be developed plan to add prescription drug coverage to
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would reserve the portion of the surplus generated by
excess Social Security revenues to pay down the national debt. It
would also create a $60 billion reserve that Congress could use
either for further debt reduction or additional tax cuts. And it
would reserve for tax cuts any surplus beyond what is currently
projected by the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich said it was not unrealistic to believe that the budget
office will increase its surplus projection this year by $40
billion. That money, combined with the $60 billion reserve, would
allow the $150 billion tax cut over five years to rise to as much
as $250 billion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on
the budget committee, said the proposal would prove to be no more
workable than the Republican budget plans of the last few years,
which set spending at levels for most programs far below what
Congress and Clinton ultimately agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Kasich had made the details of the Republican plan
public, White House officials attacked it. Jacob J. Lew, the
director of the White House's Office of Management, called it
``fundamentally flawed'' and said it would gut a wide array of
programs, from environmental cleanup to aid for poor women and
children.

PRIVATELY RUN JUVENILE PRISON IS ASSAILED FOR ABUSES OF 6 INMATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A state judge in New Orleans has removed six teen-age boys from
a juvenile prison after finding they had been brutalized by guards,
kept in solitary confinement for months for no reason and deprived
of shoes, blankets, education and medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The descriptions of conditions at the prison in Jena, in central
Louisiana, are stark. But the criticism is particularly troubling,
say federal officials and lawyers for the prisoners, because the
prison is run by Wackenhut Corrections Corp., the world's largest
for-profit prison operator. The judge said the company, which
generally has a good reputation in the industry, had treated the
youths no better than animals.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age inmates were freed or transferred to other prisons
by Judge Mark Doherty of Orleans Parish Juvenile Court, who said
that the boys had been entrusted to Jena's personnel ``for the
avowed purpose of rehabilitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Doherty said, they ``wound up in a place that drives
and treats juveniles as if they walked on all fours. These young
people deserve to be treated like human beings, not animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Doherty, a Republican and former prosecutor, said he would
devote the next two weeks to hearings for 12 other boys he has
sentenced who are at Jena to determine whether he can also remove
them.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials and others said the problems at
Jena were at least partly caused by Wackenhut's efforts to cut
costs. Consultants for the department and a federal judge found the
company had stinted on food, clothing, education, and medical
treatment for 276 inmates, and on training for guards.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department sent experts to Jena as a result of an
investigation it has mounted in recent years into widespread
reports of abuses in Louisiana's other juvenile prisons.
Additionally, Judge Frank J. Polozola of U.S. District Court in
Baton Rouge has overseen conditions in jails and prisons throughout
the state for more than a decade following lawsuits on behalf of
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Wackenhut said it was ``disappointed'' by the
Justice Department's charges about Jena. The criticisms, the
company said, were overstated and ignored progress it had made
toward resolving problems at the prison. ``The bottom line is that
the juvenile facility at Jena is a well-managed and safe
facility,'' Wackenhut said.
</P>
<P>
   Other private prisons across the country have drawn official
criticism. But most of those have been run by smaller companies set
up in recent years, as the nation's prison-building boom has
fostered new growth for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Wackenhut, based in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., operates 39,308
beds in 56 facilities in 13 states and seven foreign countries; its
shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The reports do not
make clear whether top officials at Wackenhut knew about the
problems at Jena.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Private prison operators like Wackhenhut say they can make money
by applying better management skills than government. On its Web
site, Wackenhut says it ``insists that each of its facilities is a
model of modern correctional management.''
</P>
<P>
   But a report in February by four experts hired by the Justice
Department concluded that the problems at Jena ``seemed to be
linked to the reluctance of Wackenhut Corrections to spend adequate
funds to provide for the care of the youth.''
</P>
<P>
   And John Whitely, a former warden of the Louisiana state
penitentiary at Angola who examined the Jena prison for for
Polozola, said the pervasive lack of shoes, underwear, blankets and
mattresses for inmates was ``just cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Doherty found that one boy he released, a 17-year-old found
guilty of robbery, had been repeatedly forced to lie on the floor
on his stomach with a guard's knee in his back, which caused
excruciating pain since the boy had recently had an operation for
gunshot wounds in his abdomen and was wearing a colostomy bag.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official said the government had given
Wackenhut and the Louisiana Department of Corrections a proposal
for immediate improvements at Jena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting to hear back from them, but the window is
short,'' the official said, indicating that the Justice Department
was considering a lawsuit against Wackenhut if the changes are not
made quickly.
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case in Louisiana, the Jena prison is also
enmeshed in a political corruption scandal. A friend of former Gov.
Edwin W. Edwards, Cecil Brown, was indicted in November in federal
c in New Orleans for funneling $845,000 in cash from Fred Hofheinz,
a former mayor of Houston, to Edwards for the contract to build the
prison at Jena.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the case,
said Eddie Jordan Jr., the U.S. attorney in New Orleans. Edwards is
now on trial in federal court in Baton Rouge for extortion,
racketeering and money-laundering in connection with the award of a
riverboat casino license. Jordan has said that given the casino
case, it would have been ``superfluous'' to indict Edwards for the
Jena payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though Hofheinz won the Jena contract, he was unable to raise
the money to build the $12 million prison and sold the rights to
Wackenhut.
</P>
<P>
   Before the prison opened 14 months ago near the isolated town of
Jena about 100 miles northwest of Baton Rouge, Wackenhut and state
officials had maintained it was being built to provide treatment
for juveniles with drug addictions. But the Justice Department
experts said they found virtually no drug treatment programs at
Jena.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they found ``a dangerous place to be,'' with a quarter
of the inmates ``traumatically injured'' in a two-month period,
many by untrained guards. Those guards, the experts said, routinely
threw the inmates against walls, twisted their arms or shoved them
to the ground because they had not been taught other ways to
control the boys.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Ray, an author of the report, said many boys had no
shoes or jackets in the winter; some were forced to spend the day
``huddled under a shared sheet or blanket'' to keep warm, rather
than attend classes held in another building.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates often went days without clean underwear, she said, and
sometimes fought over newly washed clothes. Once, she said, inmates
started a riot by rushing a food cart because of a shortage of
food.
</P>
<P>
   Low pay and poor management at Jena, Ray said, have led to high
turnover in personnel: five wardens since Jena has been open, and
600 persons have filled its 180 staff positions. Because of Jena's
remote location, qualified personnel has been difficult to obtain,
Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Wackenhut had skipped some elementary procedures like
background checks on prospective employees for criminal records;
some guards were hired despite having arrest records for assault.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Whitely found some guards who walked off their
posts, leaving the inmates in control of their barracks while the
boys frequently slept through what few classes were offered. Even
one of the wardens told Whitely that Jena was ``a comedy of
errors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to wonder if Curley, Larry and Moe were in charge,''
Whitely wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of the inmates have IQs of less than 70, Ray said, but
no special education is provided for them. Additionally, the
guards, most of whom were white, frequently used racial epithets in
talking to the inmates, who were predominantly black, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-year-old inmate from New Orleans also released by Doherty
tried to commit suicide 20 times by swallowing razor blades or
hanging himself by a sheet, Ray said in an interview. David Utter,
the inmate's lawyer, said that Jena's files contained nearly two
dozen reports that guards had used physical force against the
teen-ager resulting in broken fingers and a broken wrist.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager, whose name cannot be used because he is a
juvenile, said he learned about Wackenhut one day when he was in
the visitors room awaiting an appointment with his lawyer and read
a promotional brochure. ``Then I figured out,'' he said,
``Wackenhut was using us kids to make money.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alan Greenspan is no longer taken as seriously on
Wall Street as he once was. Why else did the strong warnings he
made about the lofty levels of stock prices last month go unheeded
by so many? His basic message was right: Over-speculation can
damage the economy. But while the Dow Jones industrials fell on his
comments, if only moderately, investors defiantly sent the
all-important Nasdaq to record highs.
</P>
<P>
   Some still believe that the Nasdaq rose because the technology
stocks that dominate it are relatively immune from any interest
rate increases Greenspan might impose. But that's wishful thinking.
The new economy is still dependent on the much larger old one.
After all, what is going to be sold on the Internet? Even though
Nasdaq gave plenty back this week, it is above the level that
provoked Greenspan to issue his warnings. For that matter, the Dow
industrial average, after Wednesday's rise, made up all but a
couple of percentage points of the ground it had lost.
</P>
<P>
   For all his bluntness, Greenspan was simply not able to deflate
stock portfolios with his warnings. The nation's mutual funds, for
example, were so top-heavy with the high-technology Nasdaq leaders
that they just kept rising in value. ``Despite the bifurcation in
the market, most investors are still up this year,'' says Michael
Lipper, who monitors the funds. To some on Wall Street, Greenspan
is becoming the chairman who talks loudly but carries a little
stick.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is moral hazard, a technical term that means investors
take too much risk because they know that if all goes wrong, they
will be protected by the central bank from having to absorb severe
losses. Such aggressive investing can drive financial prices to
insupportable levels.
</P>
<P>
   Moral hazard is not the only factor that pushes asset prices to
irrational heights _ greed has no small part. But many believe it
contributed significantly to the Asian financial crisis of 1997.
The bailouts came in the form of giant emergency loans.
</P>
<P>
   To many Americans, moral hazard is something that only happens
elsewhere. But consider our own bailouts. In 1987, Greenspan
admirably engineered an infusion of money worldwide after the
market crash. Stock prices came back, and major economies avoided
recession. In 1997, he supplied liquidity again to offset the
escalating Asian financial crisis. Again, the West averted
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan even injected funds late last year to forestall
problems that some feared would result as computers and other
electronic equipment crossed into 2000.
</P>
<P>
   However necessary these actions were, they had an unfortunate
consequence: Many in the markets now seem to believe Greenspan will
always save the day. Moreover, there is a suggestion in his public
pronouncements that he is not sufficiently sensitive to this. He
warns of irrational exuberance, on the one hand, only to present a
case, on the other hand, that a new economy can continue to grow
rapidly without inflation. Robert J. Shiller, a Yale economist,
writes in his new book ``Irrational Exuberance'' (Princeton
University Press) that cheering on investors while warning them not
to speculate is no way to maintain credibility.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks before Congress last month, the Fed chairman
cloaked his market concerns in terms of fighting inflation, but my
guess is that he was really worried that a stock market flying so
much higher than its historical norms is at risk of collapse.
Greenspan knows that any such collapse could result in a
recessionary reduction in spending by consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately more dangerous, a fall in stock prices could induce a
run on the U.S. dollar as foreign investors withdraw money and U.S.
investors seek greener pastures abroad. A falling dollar would then
push up interest rates and import prices. To control inflation, the
Fed might have to tighten further.
</P>
<P>
   The virtuous circle of a high dollar, high stock prices, low
inflation and low interest rates could suddenly slip into the
vicious circle of a falling dollar, falling stock prices and rising
inflation and interest rates. Recession would not be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Here is my pipe dream. The Fed chairman at last recognizes that
he needs two weapons to fight on two fronts. To be sure, this would
require Greenspan to break the self-imposed rules that restrict the
Fed to monitoring inflation and economic growth. But some of
history's most successful central bankers were at their best when
they broke their own rules.
</P>
<P>
   At next Tuesday's Fed policy meeting, Greenspan should consider
raising interest rates no more than a quarter point, as expected,
but he should also do the unexpected and raise the 50 percent
margin requirement on stock purchases to stanch market speculation.
Admittedly, there are plenty of ways around such margin
requirements these days, which require investors to put up half the
purchase price in cash. But if margin debt, now at record levels,
is so meaningless, why are so many people resorting to it?
</P>
<P>
   Raising margin requirements alone would not have much bite, but
if margin requirements and interest rates were raised
simultaneously, Greenspan could restore some credibility and send a
strong message to the Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed should also consider tightening its capital requirements
on risky bank loans to big investors. Reducing speculation by
restricting credit now would help Greenspan avoid larger and quite
painful rate increases in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The real fear is whether he has waited too long.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ This week at the Great Hall of the People, Chinese
leaders threatened military action against Taiwan, warning that
China ``would not sit idly by'' if the island it claims as its own
moved toward formal independence.
</P>
<P>
   But it was business as usual here at the Purple Vine, an elegant
Taiwan-style teahouse run by a businessman from Taipei that is
snuggled between the Great Hall and China's leadership compound _
and counts many mainland officials as loyal customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political tension hasn't had the slightest impact on me,''
said Zha Fuhua, the owner, as he carefully choreographed the
preparation of oolong tea, a Taiwanese favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure there's been lots of angry talk,'' he said, ``but I think
it's just mouthing off. I'm not the least bit worried. I don't
think war is possible, because there's too much to lose. The
essence of the relationship between China and Taiwan is economic
development, not battle.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be easy to imagine that Beijing's tens of thousands of
residents from Taiwan live a bizarre existence, members of a
divided family in the heart of the enemy camp.
</P>
<P>
   There are occasional vexations: enduring an occasional cabbie's
harangue about the need to bomb Taiwan into submission and
wondering how to respond when a teen-age son is invited to join the
Communist Youth League.
</P>
<P>
   But most Taiwanese here say that they are happy and feel at home
in China, living with a language and culture that they for the most
part understand. They are mostly small-business people, and they
blend in well with Beijing's increasingly affluent middle class.
They have Chinese neighbors and Chinese business partners, and they
often send their children to Chinese schools.
</P>
<P>
   And so with only days to go before Taiwan's presidential
election, which has prompted Beijing's most recent saber rattling,
Taiwanese here seem largely oblivious to the arrows flying above
them in political space, convinced that business interests and
brotherhood will somehow ensure the peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all used to this kind of talk by now, and it's not
something that impacts us greatly,'' said Lin Yen-hung, the manager
of a huge cooking oil company on the outskirts of Beijing, who has
lived here for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   There are now an estimated 60,000 Taiwanese companies operating
directly or indirectly in China, according to the Beijing
Association of Taiwanese Entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   At least several hundred thousand people from Taiwan now live in
the People's Republic, the overwhelming number in business.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing they are sprinkled throughout the city and integrated
into the community. Although many leave their families at home in
Taiwan, as the standard of living here has risen an increasing
proportion come with families in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We express our views in an appropriate way, but in general we
avoid the topic of reunification,'' said Chen Kuo-yuen, who owns a
cafe and a leather goods factory. ``Business is business and
politics is politics. But our relationship with the mainland
community is extremely close.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to his cafe, filled with Chinese business people
having power lunches on glass-topped tables. ``My customers are
Beijingers,'' he said. ``My partner's from here too. If I tried to
do it myself I'd be quickly shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   The many business relationships that have evolved in recent
years have various roots. Taiwanese business people want to make
money. The Chinese partners have benefited from the managerial and
technical skills that the Taiwanese bring. And the Chinese
government, which has established special concessions for Taiwanese
businesses, believes that such ties will help reel the island,
separated from the mainland since 1949, into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   Although figures from Taiwan and the mainland vary, by both
accounts Taiwanese trade and investment here are growing fast.
Bilateral trade amounted to $14.045 billion in the first seven
months of 1999, a 9 percent increase over the comparable period in
1998, according to Taiwanese figures. In 1998 there was nearly $3
billion in direct investment from Taiwan to the mainland, according
to the China Statistical Yearbook.
</P>
<P>
   But that probably vastly underestimates the magnitude of
Taiwanese involvement, Chen said, since many Taiwanese invest in
China through a third region, like Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   And he said there was also a good deal of ``invisible''
investment, including his own cafe, in which money is invested in
the name of a mainland partner because it is illegal for a
foreigner to own that type of business in China.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese here say the advantages of doing business in a
familiar culture and language far outweigh the somewhat daunting
prospect of dealing with an unfamiliar communist bureaucracy, one
that spends vast amounts of time and effort maligning the leaders
of their island homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Many say they have tried, or thought of trying, to do business
in Europe or the United States. But they say they fear racial
discrimination as well as huge language and cultural barriers. In
China they feel they have a leg up over the Westerners who are also
rushing in.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came to the mainland in 1992, I felt some terror
toward the Communist Party,'' said Lin, of Tongyi Edible Oil Co.,
whose signs are written in the traditional Chinese characters used
in Taiwan instead of the simplified characters of the mainland,
even though nearly all his employees are from the mainland. ``But I
easily became accustomed to how things work here, and I think it's
because we share many habits and customs in our lifestyles.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And so in the last few years, Taiwanese have continued to rush
in, deaf to the near constant saber rattling in the background.
</P>
<P>
   People were far more nervous in 1996, when China fired missiles
near Taiwan during the island's last presidential election
campaign, the Taiwanese here say. Then, $70 billion left Taiwan in
one week and many Taiwanese, including Zha, the teahouse owner,
started making preparations for their families to emigrate to the
West.
</P>
<P>
   But today the atmosphere is far more relaxed, they say, in part
because of increasing communication and familiarity between the two
sides, and in part because Chinese propaganda campaigns have
changed their tone, no longer decrying oppression in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists from Taiwan made more than 2.5 million visits to the
mainland last year, up from about 500,000 a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago if you got in a taxi and revealed you were
from Taiwan, the driver would start ranting,'' said Zha, who moved
to coastal China to start a seaweed business in 1987. ``But there
are so many Taiwanese here now that there's more contact and
communication, so there's also more understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally people don't bring it up,'' he said. ``And anyway,
if people ask, `Where are you from?' I say, `Jiangxi''' _ the
southern Chinese province where his ancestors once lived. Many
Taiwanese here do not advertise their passports, and some routinely
say they are from Singapore or Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   In general it is easy for Taiwanese to live a life of
``strategic ambiguity'' by avoiding political discussions _ an easy
maneuver in a country where the ruling Communist Party now has
little obvious direct influence on everyday life. Still, there are
times when they feel forced to show their colors.
</P>
<P>
   Lin, who has two children in school in Beijing, said his
teen-age son grappled this year with whether to accept an
invitation to join the Communist Youth League, a group that most
teenagers join as much for its social as its political function.
(He didn't.)
</P>
<P>
   And on the first day of school, Lin's 6-year-old daughter found
herself on stage being introduced by the principal, who proceeded
to lecture the students about the inevitability of Taiwan's return
to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just a child, and I was very angry he had to bring
politics into it,'' Lin said.
</P>
<P>
   Zha said his in-laws visiting from Taiwan in the mid-1990s were
horrified when his son, then 5 years old, spoke fondly of Mao
Zedong, referring to the founder of the People's Republic as
``Uncle Mao.''

   The boy now lives in Taiwan with his mother, but mostly because
life in Beijing is ``too hard'' compared with Taiwan, Zha said.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese cannot cast ballots from the mainland, but those in
Beijing appear split among the three leading presidential
candidates, just like Taiwanese voters at home.
</P>
<P>
   And on the question of independence for Taiwan, most seem to
favor maintaining the status quo, something resembling independence
without a formal declaration. Some predict reunification with the
mainland at some point in the distant future, and all reject a
quick bid for independence as too damaging for business.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government ``from top to bottom'' has guaranteed
Taiwan businessmen here that ``Taiwanese business wouldn't be
affected by political tension, that there can be no threats or
personal threats to business people here,'' said Chen, the cafe
owner and general secretary of the Beijing Association of Taiwanese
Entrepreneurs, which frequently meets with local and national
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the question of reunification is difficult for
people like him, whose loyalties are split.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of business people here would oppose any
move to independence,'' he said, ``because it would immediately
bring threats from the mainland. But at the same time, they also
oppose pressure from the mainland.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added, with an apologetic look, ``I know that's a
cautious answer, but under the circumstances, it's the best I can
give.''

brownstone on West 118th Street for $237,000. ``My friends couldn't

Morgan, who moved in last November, said he is not selling.

BUSH AND GORE CAMPS APPEAL FOR PRE-CONVENTION DONATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Fla., Ark., Md., Calif., N.M., Puerto Rico)  (See also BUSH, GORE) 
(bl) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With his $70 million campaign treasury spent, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas has started trying to raise a fast $10
million to finance a pre-convention campaign against Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Republican National Committee was
accelerating pleas to big-dollar donors to produce as much as $100
million before the Republican convention in July. The party has
planned extensive television advertising to promote Bush's
candidacy and attack Gore and the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Bush dismissed as a cynical stunt Gore's offer by
e-mail on Tuesday night to forswear advertising financed by soft
money if the Republicans did the same. He said Gore had not
answered questions raised by the possibly illegal fund raising of
the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``New campaign finance laws are needed,'' Bush told Gore in an
e-mail response to the vice president's message. ``What is even
more important is the duty of public officials to obey the existing
laws, and I'm afraid your own record does not inspire confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, with roughly $13 million left to spend before the
Democratic convention in August, would help the Democratic Party
meet a goal of $35 million to produce issue advertisements over the
next four months.
</P>
<P>
   The simultaneous Republican fund raising has been designed to
avoid the problem faced at this time four years ago by Bob Dole,
the Republican presidential nominee. Dole emerged from that year's
primaries bruised and broke while President Clinton mounted a
multimillion-dollar television campaign against him in the months
leading up to the parties' conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six weeks, Bush, his wife and his father are
scheduled to appear at a dozen fund-raising events to replenish his
campaign's hard money accounts. That money, which must come in
increments of $1,000 or less, could be used for almost any purpose
to support his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The first was scheduled for Thursday evening in Wheaton, Ill., a
suburb of Chicago. Over the next two weeks, Bush would also court
donors at events in Palm Beach, Fla., Little Rock, Ark.,
Parsippany, N.J., New York and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush has planned to appear on his son's
behalf at fund-raisers in California, New Mexico and Puerto Rico
over the next three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush's fund-raising challenge is greater this year because
of his astounding financial success last year, when he raised $70
million, three-quarters of it in checks for $1,000, the maximum
allowed under federal law. He must now find new donors to restock
his larder.
</P>
<P>
   The easy fruit has been picked, said Peter Secchia, a longtime
Republican activist from Michigan and one of the Bush Pioneers, the
elite fund-raisers who each collected more than $100,000 for the
Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time we've had to raise money after a
primary,'' Secchia said. ``But the memory of what the Democrats did
to Dole with all their illegal money gives us a stimulus to go out
and compete. The money they spent in '96 from March to August was
horrendous.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Republican National Committee has planned
to amass a large bankroll of soft money, the unlimited
contributions from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals.
That money could not be used to directly appeal for votes for or
against a candidate, but the law has so many loopholes and has been
so poorly enforced that the political message of such issue
advertisements has often been transparent.
</P>
<P>
   Haley Barbour, a former Republican National Committee chairman
and an adviser to Bush, said the Republicans would aggressively
solicit soft money to counteract plans by the Democrats and their
allies in organized labor to spend tens of millions of dollars in
support of Gore now and in the fall. ``We can raise the money to be
competitive, I have no doubt of that,'' Barbour said. ``But the
party has to be careful they have money and a plan for the fall
campaign and doesn't overspend during the interregnum.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush would also be bolstered by spending by groups sympathetic
to Republican causes: anti-abortion groups, business and trade
associations, corporate executives and ideological allies like the
Christian Coalition and the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   One such group, Americans for Tax Reform, has planned to run
advertisements that would indirectly help the Bush campaign by
emphasizing tax cuts, partial privatization of Social Security and
a reduction in the estate tax. The group ran such advertisements in
New Hampshire that were widely seen as pro-Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't advocate election or defeat of candidates,'' said
Grover Norquist, the executive director of Americans for Tax
Reform. ``But we raise issues that others might presume helpful or
harmful to particular candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Wednesday that he was preparing for an onslaught of
negative advertising from the Bush campaign, the Republican party
and conservative groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to understand the other side is going to throw
everything they've got plus the kitchen sink,'' Gore said at an
AFL-CIO meeting in Philadelphia on Wednesday afternoon. ``They're
manning the barricades, they're trying to funnel unprecedented
amounts of money into the campaign. They're going to stop at
nothing.''

OUR BIAS FOR BEAUTY IS SHOWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Dear Applicant: Thank you for your interest in XYZ
Inc. Unfortunately, we have no positions suitable for you at this
time. We only hire attractive people. Sincerely, Ima Bewti.
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful that any job hunter has ever received that kind of
rejection letter. And it would be hard to find an employer who
would admit preferring better-looking employees over less
attractive ones.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that physical appearance counts in the work
world.
</P>
<P>
   Social science research finds that employment discrimination
exists against people who are judged uglier, fatter or
significantly shorter than the socially accepted norms of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Dipboye, a professor of psychology at Rice University,
will lead a discussion on ``the unattractiveness factor'' next
month at the annual Society for Industrial and Organizational
Psychology conference.
</P>
<P>
   Dipboye's research concludes that hiring selections, work
appraisals and promotions are biased in favor of the young, the
physically unimpaired and those who aren't significantly
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   He has found widely shared social norms about what constitutes
attractiveness, and learned that women and men who most closely
meet those norms are more likely to achieve occupational success
than are those who deviate from the accepted standards.
</P>
<P>
   There is an unfortunate side effect from being influenced by
standards of beauty or handsomeness, whether intentionally or
subconsciously: It sustains racism, sexism, ageism and other forms
of physical prejudice in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Author Steven M. Jeffes talks about this kind of prejudice in
Appearance Is Everything: The Hidden Truth Regarding Your
Appearance Discrimination. He includes data from tests and
demographic surveys. He writes that attractive people:
</P>
<P>
   - Are two to five times more likely to be hired.
</P>
<P>
   - Earn 12 percent to 16 percent more.
</P>
<P>
   - Are significantly more likely to be elected to office.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Jeffes writes that unattractive people are:
</P>
<P>
   - Two to four times more likely to be laid off.
</P>
<P>
   - Two to five times more likely to be convicted of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   - ``Extremely likely'' to be passed over for promotions.
</P>
<P>
   We say that beauty is only skin deep. We say that beauty is in
the eye of the beholder. Some of us may truly believe it.
</P>
<P>
   But if the social science testing has any validity at all, we
have to accept that we are, as a society, a bunch of hypocrites.
Looks matter a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffes has gathered data to buttress the argument that
appearance discrimination should be added to the Civil Rights Act
of 1964, which bars discrimination based on other factors of
affiliation and appearance, such as skin color.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, anyone who feels overlooked or outcast because of
looks might want to read his book. (Amazon.com and
Barnesandnoble.com both list it as a special order at $14.95.)
</P>
<P>
   Jeffes does more than cite discrimination examples. He also
gives strategies to help the less comely compete in a world prone
to judge books by their covers.

PETA'S ANTI-MILK, PRO-BEER CAMPAIGN HAS OPPONENTS FROTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Got beer?
</P>
<P>
   That's what People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is
asking college students in a campaign touting beer as a better
beverage choice than milk.
</P>
<P>
   At its Web site for its anti-milk cause _ which can be linked
from the organization's main Internet site, www.peta.com _ PETA
urges college students and others ``to wipe off those milk
mustaches and replace them with ... foam? The largest animal rights
group in the world is releasing the results of research showing
that beer is actually better for you than milk.''
</P>
<P>
   Much later on the site, PETA says its real ``beef'' is the way
dairy cattle are treated.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Perry of the Kansas City, Mo.-based Dairy Farmers of
America, the nation's largest dairy cooperative, said he was used
to attacks on his industry. But this, he said, takes the cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous,'' Perry said. ``What they've done is a
terrible, terrible injustice to everyone. No one ever drank too
much milk, got behind the wheel of a car and killed someone.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the issue of how dairy cattle are treated, Perry said that
there had been instances of mistreatment but that such cases
weren't common.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make economic sense,'' he said. ``You can't afford
to have cows in situations where they aren't comfortable, because
they won't give milk.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Copeland, an adviser to Greeks Advocating Mature
Management of Alcohol at the University of Missouri-Kansas City,
said he found PETA's campaign irresponsible and reprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   A study released just this week by the Harvard School of Public
Health reports that binge drinking on campuses is up from just two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``No good will come of this,'' Copeland said. ``And it's not
just college students who can access (PETA's) Web site encouraging
the drinking of beer _ it's kids of all ages.''
</P>
<P>
   But the animal rights group stands by its claims, saying that by
drinking beer instead of milk, college students will have less fat
in their diets, consume fewer calories and cholesterol, and get
fiber they can't get from milk. It also says milk contributes to
myriad health problems.
</P>
<P>
   PETA, perhaps best known for its red-paint attacks on women
wearing fur, is a 20-year-old group with 600,000 members. Its
mission, as posted on its Web site, ``is dedicated to establishing
and protecting the rights of all animals. PETA operates under the
simple principle that animals are not ours to eat, wear, experiment
on, or use for entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   To publicize its anti-milk campaign, PETA has given away
thousands of bottle openers shaped like beer bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that would be a fun, lighthearted way to get
students to respond,'' said Morgan Leyh, PETA's college action
campaign coordinator, who writes on the Web site: ``Colleges have
been busy banning kegs from campus. But we say, `Ditch the dairy,
not the beer!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a group that
more often than not finds itself on the same side as PETA, is
outraged.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Leyh, her counterpart at the center, Kimberly
Miller, takes PETA to task. She accuses the group of promoting a
heavy-drinking culture that already pervades campuses, contributing
to alcohol poisoning, drunken driving, sexual assault and deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``This juvenile gimmick reflects a gross lack of judgment and
cynical disregard for a very serious public health and safety issue
and further undermines your organization's credibility (such as it
is). ... Surely you can find a way to advance your agenda that does
not come at the expense of college students,'' Miller wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Leyh pooh-poohs the notion that PETA's campaign will further
promote beer drinking on campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many, many college students who drink responsibly,
and this isn't going to change that,'' Leyh said.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles clinical psychologist who
specializes in teen drug and alcohol abuse, vehemently disagrees
and thinks PETA's latest protest will alienate some who in the past
have supported it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, people who have drug and alcohol problems are great at
rationalizing why they drink and do drugs,'' Butterworth said. ``I
can see it now: `Oh, gee, if I drink milk, I'll get too much fat,
so I'll drink beer because PETA says it's healthier.' ''
</P>
<P>
   People posting messages this week on alcohol-related Web sites
were in a tizzy over PETA's tactic, including a visitor to the
self-help site Another Empty Bottle. Her comment:
</P>
<P>
   ``Got brains? Whoever came up with this latest PETA campaign
doesn't.''

APPROVAL OF HOUSE RESOLUTION A RARE VICTORY FOR GUN CONTROL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pressure mounted on gun-control opponents Wednesday
as House Democrats succeeded in passing a symbolic resolution that
would at least require child safety locks on all handguns.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, New York Republican Gov. George Pataki stunned
some gun-control opponents by calling for more ``common sense'' gun
laws, including mandatory trigger locks, increasing the age for gun
ownership from 18 to 21, instant background checks at gun shows and
``ballistic fingerprinting'' to help trace spent ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned about the politics here. I'm concerned about
the policy and the policy will make our streets safer,'' Pataki
said. He rejected claims by pro-gun Republican leaders that the
Democrats are trying to play election-year politics with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he decided to speak out in part because more
New Yorkers are being killed each year by gun violence than in car
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Gov. George Bush, the presumed GOP presidential
nominee, also backed Pataki's call for trigger or safety locks,
dealing another blow to gun control opponents in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in the House was 218-205 on a non-binding resolution
that is not likely to force members of the Senate and House
judiciary committees to meet and resolve differences over gun
control measures. But its passage, combined with Pataki's comments,
sent a strong signal to gun control opponents that support is
growing not only in Congress but around the country for tougher
laws to help reduce the number of deaths each year caused by gun
violence, especially among children.
</P>
<P>
   It is up to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the
House-Senate committee, to call a meeting. On Wednesday, Hatch did
not specifically address the resolution but said he was
disappointed that President Clinton has ignored his suggestions for
bolstering enforcement of existing gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge, he has acted on none of these overdue
reforms,'' Hatch told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in the House followed a heated two-hour debate in which
Democrats accused Republicans of stalling on the issue and
Republicans charged that the Democrats were trying to make
political hay out of it by using recent gun violence tragedies to
help make their case for more control measures.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association also joined opponents in lobbying
against the resolution, warning members that their votes on the
issue would be watched closely to gauge their loyalty to the NRA,
one of the richest and most powerful special interest groups in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Calling attention to the NRA lobbying effort, Rep. Sheila
Jackson Lee, D-Texas, told her colleagues that the organization
``has such a dominant hand on members of this Congress that they
can't even wiggle themselves out'' to support moderate gun safety
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA tactics also came under fire from President Clinton, who
said the organization is intent on preventing a conference from
taking place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again the gun lobby and their allies in the leadership of
the Congress is standing in the way of real progress,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre told
the AP that the White House was trying to ``demonize'' the NRA to
distract attention from ``the complete collapse of enforcement'' of
existing gun laws by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton spoke at the White House, he was surrounded by a
number of Democrats and a handful of Republicans who would like to
see gun control measures passed this year. They included Rep. James
Rogan, R-Calif., who was a member of the House prosecution team
that outlined the case against Clinton in his Senate impeachment
trial last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan did not comment, but an aide said later that he was there
to show his support for a House-Senate conference on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach a compromise between the House and Senate on
new gun control laws have been in limbo since August when a
juvenile justice bill containing provisions requiring child safety
locks on handguns, three-day background checks for gun shows and
other measures was shelved because of differences with the House.

DETAILS OF SPRINT-MCI MERGER ARRIVING IN SHAREHOLDERS' MAILBOXES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shareholders of Sprint Corp. and Sprint PCS will begin receiving
textbook-size packets this week detailing the company's proposed
merger with MCI WorldCom and asking for their vote in favor of the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The company began mailing a proxy statement of more than 400
pages and an addendum to its 141,800 shareholders of record this
week in preparation for a special shareholders meeting set for
April 28 at Sprint's Westwood, Kan., headquarters. MCI WorldCom
will hold its own special shareholders meeting on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   The packet describes the merger, the merger agreement,
background to the merger and stockholder rights, among other
things, and includes an amended copy of Sprint's bylaws and
articles of incorporation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the merger, shareholders are asked to approve an
amendment to the company's bylaws concerning its former partners in
Global One _ France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom _ and approve
issuing additional shares of Sprint PCS for Sprint's employee
stock-purchase program.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the usual boilerplate language, the documents offer
shareholders a detailed account of how the deal came together. The
proxy, for example, provides a blow-by-blow account of the
company's competing merger talks with Deutsche Telekom and
BellSouth Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It also explains how investment bankers quantified Sprint's
value and potential synergies from the deal, and details the
financial interests that Sprint's directors and executive officers
have in the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Those interests are substantial, as outlined in the summary
table of executive compensation included in the proxy.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the huge option awards made to senior executives in
recent years, Sprint's board of directors topped off chairman
William T. Esrey's 1999 compensation of $2.5 million with fresh
options. Those option awards would generate about $57 million if
exercised today, and would be worth around $90 million at the time
of the merger if the price of Sprint PCS remains steady.
</P>
<P>
   Other executives whose options were detailed in the proxy
include Ronald T. LeMay, president and chief operating officer;
Kevin Brauer, president of Sprint business and national integrated
services; Arthur Krause, chief financial officer; and Andrew
Sukawaty, president of Sprint PCS.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey, LeMay and Krause received special retention options
designed to keep them at the company after Sprint's special
shareholders meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey, who is expected to become the chairman of the new
WorldCom, got options to buy 216,000 shares of Sprint at $61.94
each and 216,000 shares of Sprint PCS at $54.25 each.
</P>
<P>
   LeMay, who is expected to become chief operating officer of
WorldCom, got options on 135,000 shares of Sprint and 134,000
shares of Sprint PCS. Krause, whose future has not been discussed,
received options on 54,000 shares of Sprint and 54,000 shares of
Sprint PCS under the retention arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The merger agreement also provides for an employee retention
pool of as much as $100 million to be used for cash retention
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's merger with MCI WorldCom still needs regulatory
approval from the Department of Justice, the Federal Communications
Commission and the European Commission. It has faced vocal
opposition from consumer groups, unions and some business advocacy
groups, who think it would result in too much concentration in the
Internet and long-distance businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey has said the company is willing to address any issues
regulators have with concentration in the Internet market,
indicating a willingness to divest some assets to get the deal
approved.
</P>
<P>
   But his public position on long-distance is less flexible.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for some of the consumer groups who constantly fear the
specter of high prices, let me just say, for God's sake, `Take an
economics course,' '' he told an audience in New York on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the average long-distance call costs less than a third
of what it did in 1984,'' he said. ``And prices will continue to be
under pressure because of an abundance of capacity.''

U.S. AND 3 STATES HALT EFFORT TO BLOCK BP AMOCO-ARCO DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Calif., Ore., Wash.)   (SUBS for additional detail and rewriting throughout, including the
involvement of the 3 states and more info about Philips' role;
story grows by about 700 words; former double byline becomes single
byline)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Moving briskly toward a settlement of a landmark
antitrust case, the federal government and three states suspended
their lawsuit Wednesday to block BP Amoco's $30 billion acquisition
of ARCO.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the Federal Trade Commission and the states
of California, Oregon and Washington came less than a week before a
hearing on the matter was set to begin in a federal court in San
Francisco. It also came the same day that the companies formally
announced that once the acquisition was completed, BP Amoco would
sell one of the crown jewels of the deal _ ARCO's large oil
holdings in Alaska _ to Phillips Petroleum for $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Issuing a one-sentence statement Wednesday morning, the top
staff antitrust official at the FTC suggested that the talks had
yielded significant progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the substantial and constructive proposals made by
the defendants, all parties have agreed to seek adjournment of the
federal court proceedings in FTC vs. BP Amoco and Atlantic
Richfield Co. in order to conduct negotiations,'' Richard G.
Parker, director of the FTC's competition bureau, said in a
statement referring to ARCO's incorporated name. Late last year,
the competition bureau recommended blocking the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In not setting any deadline for the completion of the talks, the
lawyers also sent a clear signal that many of the most difficult
issues of the case had been resolved in principle. Lawyers for the
government and the companies were exchanging drafts of proposed
consent decrees Wednesday that would clear the way for BP Amoco to
close the deal, and there was wide expectation that a settlement
could be announced in the next few weeks after a review and vote by
the agency's five commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at BP Amoco and ARCO were ebullient about the
progress being made in talks that had, for months, been bitter and
fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   ``After months of uncertainty for staff and customers of BP
Amoco and ARCO, and the states and communities where we operate, we
are pleased to be in discussions with the FTC,'' said a joint
statement issued by Sir John Browne, chief executive of BP Amoco,
and Mike R. Bowlin, ARCO's chairman. ``Those discussions are
constructive and Wednesday's sale agreement greatly advances the
prospects for their successful conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The move to sell ARCO's Alaskan assets to Phillips holds the
promise of resolving the government's biggest objection to the
acquisition of ARCO by BP Amoco and would signal a new entry in
Alaska after years of consolidation, layoffs and declining
production.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips would pick up ARCO's 21.9 percent interest in the
Prudhoe Bay oil rim, its 55 percent interest in the greater Kuparuk
area and a 78 percent stake in the Alpine field. ARCO would also
sell 1.1 million exploration acres on the North Slope, a 22.3
percent interest in the Trans-Alaska pipeline and a crude oil
shipping fleet of six tankers in service and three under
construction.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The proposed acquisition that BP Amoco and ARCO announced nearly
a year ago would have initially given the newly combined entity
control over about 70 percent of the oil produced in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement with Alaska's governor reduced that to 55 percent,
but failed to satisfy the concerns of the major consumers of
Alaskan crude in California, Washington and Oregon, as well as the
federal government. Higher than average gasoline prices on the West
Coast have long been a volatile political issue. As the cost of
gasoline at the pump has soared around the nation in recent months,
it has once again risen as an election-year topic on the West
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Surging gasoline prices have not been the only problem for BP
Amoco and ARCO as the review of their deal dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade
Commission, concluded that the surge in mergers by energy companies
required the agency to give particularly rigorous scrutiny to any
new oil deals. Last year, Exxon completed its $81 billion merger
with Mobil in the same week that staff officials at the FTC
recommended taking steps to block BP Amoco's acquisition. Before
that, BP had acquired Amoco, and Texaco and Shell had entered into
a joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed in February to block the deal, the FTC and
the three West Coast states maintained that BP Amoco's acquisition
of ARCO was anti-competitive and violated the Clayton Antitrust
Act. They said the proposed deal would reduce competition by
refiners on the West Coast that use Alaskan crude and that it would
substantially diminish the quality of bidding among oil companies
that want to lease and develop Alaskan lands owned by the state and
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The government also said that the deal would enable BP Amoco and
ARCO to manipulate the price of oil futures because the companies
control a major crude oil marketing hub in Cushing, Okla., that is
used to store West Texas intermediate crude, the most actively
traded futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger was the largest in American history to be
challenged by the government and the first in the oil industry
since the commission blocked Mobil's $6.5 billion bid to buy
Marathon Oil in the early 1980s. But unlike scores of other
companies that have dropped their proposed mergers in the face of
opposition from the government, executives at BP Amoco and ARCO
were determined to close their deal even if it meant selling one of
the most attractive pieces of the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the companies said Wednesday that an announcement
would soon be made about a deal to sell ARCO's holdings in Cushing
that should satisfy antitrust regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Wednesday's developments, the deal's largest
congressional critic, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., urged Pitofsky to
seek greater concessions to benefit consumers on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden said Wednesday that he had asked Pitofsky in a telephone
call to press the companies to significantly increase their supply
of oil in the hopes of driving down prices. Wyden, in an interview
Wednesday afternoon, also said he had told Pitofsky to insist as
one of the conditions of the deal that BP Amoco reduce its exports
of North Slope crude to the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the overall deal advances competition in the oil markets,
I'm certainly willing to reconsider my opposition,'' Wyden said.

HOUSE COMMITTEE VOTES TO HOLD PATHOLOGIST IN CONTEMPT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Commerce Committee voted 34-0 on
Wednesday to hold Lee's Summit, Mo., pathologist Miles Jones in
contempt of Congress for failing to respond last week to a
subcommittee subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was subpoenaed to testify at a hearing on whether he or
others violated federal laws on fetal-tissue removal and marketing.
Jones' company, Opening Lines, did fetal-tissue work at an Overland
Park, Kan., clinic that performs abortions. The tissue is used in
the research and treatment of many diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The full House could vote early next week on the contempt
motion. If it passes, the Justice Department would have to ask a
grand jury to indict Jones before he could be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Jones lives in the congressional district of Rep. Karen
McCarthy, a Kansas City, Mo., Democrat and member of the Commerce
Committee. McCarthy said Wednesday she was puzzled that Jones did
not answer the subpoena, which was issued by the committee's Health
and Environment Subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would certainly serve his interest to come forward
and tell what he knows,'' McCarthy said during a committee recess.
McCarthy, who is not a member of the subcommittee, said that if she
had known Jones wasn't cooperating, she would have tried reach him
to tell him how serious a subpoena is.
</P>
<P>
   Jones did not respond to numerous subcommittee phone calls and
letters, staff members said. Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley
Jr., a Virginia Republican, wrote a letter to Jones on Jan. 31
asking 17 questions about his fetal-tissue work.
</P>
<P>
   That letter and a follow-up letter Feb. 16 went unanswered. A
U.S. marshal served Jones with the subpoena March 1 in Illinois,
records show.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 47, has not returned repeated phone calls from a
reporter, but he did send a two-paragraph e-mail Tuesday implying
that the investigations was racially motivated. Jones is black.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI in Kansas City, Mo., opened an investigation March 10
into fetal-tissue marketing that Opening Lines and a Georgia
company, Anatomic Gift Foundation, did while under contract at
Comprehensive Health, an Overland Park clinic affiliated with
Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Jones published a price list for fetal organs. In a
hidden-camera interview with an ABC News reporter, Jones said
researchers will ``pay whatever you ask'' for hearts or other
organs if the need is strong. Anatomic Gift did not have a price
list and said it did not sell tissue or organs for a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law states that organs must be donated but that
reasonable costs can be charged for staff, equipment and facility
time. Opening Lines and Anatomic Gift paid rent to Planned
Parenthood. Planned Parenthood terminated the contracts with both
companies and no longer has fetal-tissue removal done at the
clinic.

REPORT ON ANGOLA SANCTIONS IS CHALLENGED IN THE U.N. 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ An explosive report on how sanctions against a
rebel army in Angola are being broken, and by whom, provoked a
heated debate Wednesday in the Security Council. A dozen or more
African and European nations challenged the investigators' methods
and evidence.
</P>
<P>
   French-speaking Africans charged bias in the investigation,
which was ordered by Canada's U.N. representative and led by a
Swedish diplomat. France was also critical, saying the report was
imprecise in making allegations and vague on dates and other facts.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by 10 international experts working for the
council's committee on sanctions in Angola, implicated two current
African presidents as well as the government of Bulgaria and the
world's largest diamond exchange, in Antwerp, Belgium, in the
methods that rebels have used to smuggle Angolan diamonds to buy
weapons to sustain decades of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The report also tracked illegal fuel shipments to the rebels,
known as the Unita movement, led by Jonas Savimbi. The rebels have
suffered battlefield setbacks recently at the hands of the Angolan
army, and these losses of territory, coupled with warnings that the
Security Council was planning to publicize allegations of sanctions
violations, have already cut into the illegal diamond trade,
members of the investigating panel said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Angola, a nation of 12 million people, has left 1
million dead, and 3 million are now displaced from their homes.
About 200 people, many children, are dying every day, relief
organizations say. Unicef calls Angola the most dangerous country
in the world in which to be a child.
</P>
<P>
   The investigating panel was the first to be created by the
Security Council, which normally relies on carefully worded reports
from the U.N. Secretariat and information collected by individual
nations' intelligence services, rarely shared with others.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fowler, the Canadian representative, who is chairman of
the committee on sanctions in Angola and will be the Security
Council president in April, organized the panel. He intends to
press the Security Council to put sanctions on countries or leaders
involved in the illegal arms and diamond trade, as recommended by
the panel. The investigation was led by Anders Mollander, a Swedish
Foreign Ministry official who was formerly ambassador to Angola.
</P>
<P>
   With Bulgaria in mind, the panel also asked the European Union
and NATO to evaluate how candidates for membership abide by
sanctions rules. The Bulgarians are accused of shipping arms to
Savimbi through third countries and of training Unita soldiers in
the guise of troops from Zaire, now Congo.
</P>
<P>
   There were 39 recommendations in all, some of them technical
suggestions for how to trace illegal exports and imports or monitor
traffic in the region where Savimbi is based. Others were more
political, including a call for a ban on international conferences
in nations accused of violating sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The panel has done exactly what we asked them to do,'' Fowler
said at a news conference Wednesday after presenting his report to
the council. ``They have named names. They have identified
sanctions busting both in terms of the busters and the methods of
busting.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler's experiment with the sanctions in Angola is being
watched closely in the Security Council and among all member
nations of the United Nations because no diplomat has tried to turn
his committee into an active enforcer of an embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Several delegations applauded the experiment, but others are
wary of what they see as a trend in the United Nations toward
interfering in countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hain, the minister of state in charge of African affairs
in the British Foreign Office, told the Security Council Wednesday,
``It is no good putting our hands up in the U.N. for sanctions, and
then taking no action while citizens in our countries make money
out of misery.'' He welcomed the report as a demonstration, at
least to Savimbi, that ``now there is nowhere to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said his report to the council ``offered a blueprint for
change,'' and said: ``Sanctions had been grievously flouted for
nearly seven years. Every member of this organization knows these
sanctions have been violated.''
</P>
<P>
   All countries named in the report were given the right to reply
in the Security Council Wednesday. All denied the allegations
against them or tried to explain how investigators had
misunderstood them or not listened. But in almost every case,
representatives pledged to cooperate in closing loopholes if any
did exist.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report, completed within six months with visits to 30
countries, was a gamble, because in the time assigned them, the
arms experts _ from Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe,
China, Russia, France, Switzerland, Sweden and the United States _
could not gather as much hard evidence as many nations were
demanding to see Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen nations questioned the heavy reliance on
interviews with defectors from Unita who had since joined the
Angolan Army. Stanlake M. Samkange, a Zimbabwean lawyer and arms
expert who wrote the report, countered at a news conference that
these defectors provided corroboration for evidence already
gathered elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Togo's representative, Roland Y. Kpotsra, dismissed the report
as ``rumor, hearsay, and scraps that are considered verified
because they are confirmed by Unita defectors.'' The report accuses
Togo's president, Gnassingbe Eyadema, of helping Savimbi obtain
arms and fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso was the second president named
in the report as an active partner in Savimbi's illegal trading
operations. Wednesday, the representative of Burkina Faso, Michel
Kafando, told the Security Council that this was a ``report built
on illusions rather than on certainties.'' The government denied
the allegations when they were first reported last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Rwanda's envoy, Joseph W. Mutaboba, denied that
officials there had allowed Unita to use the country as a base for
making diamond deals, as the report alleged. He said these were
``wild allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Several envoys speaking for their nations said they had not
received copies of the 59-page report until Tuesday and could not
reply in detail.
</P>
<P>
   The work of the investigating panel produced some pre-emptive
action. Belgium issued new rules governing diamond sales on March
4, but the report had been largely written by then. Last year, De
Beers, the world's largest diamond trader, said it would no longer
buy Angolan diamonds except from a mine in which it has a direct
interest. Angola said it was also tightening the legal trade of
gems.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa, where the government was not implicated but some
citizens were, on Wednesday outlined steps it has taken to cut ties
to Unita. In the Security Council, the South African
representative, Dumisani S. Kumalo, said the country would take
``firm action'' against any citizens still violating sanctions.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Regulators in New York state, the nation's largest
banking center and an industry pace setter, are devising new rules
to crack down on lenders who impose exorbitant fees that force
countless homeowners into foreclosure and bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The abuses at issue are the underbelly of the lucrative $280
billion national market in loans for people with limited income or
poor credit histories, so-called subprime borrowers. Although such
loans charge higher interest rates, they have been a godsend to
many people who otherwise might not get financing.
</P>
<P>
   But some unscrupulous operators seek out unsophisticated
clients, typically elderly or minority homeowners or first-time
buyers in poor areas. They talk the victims into refinancing or
applying for other loans saddled with excessive interest and fees.
The lenders and brokers collect their fees up front. If the
borrower falls in arrears, the mortgage holder seizes the house.
</P>
<P>
   With action on the issue apparently stalled in Congress, the New
York State Banking Board is flexing its powers to license and
oversee mortgage bankers and brokers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, who appoints the board, ordered it to take
up the issue last year after an investigation of a major lender,
Delta Funding, by Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. Pataki was stung
by Spitzer's suggestion that his regulators had gone easy on Delta.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The final regulations, which would apply to so-called high-cost
home loans, are expected to win the board's unanimous support in
the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it will become a model for similar regulation and
legislation in other states and on a nationwide basis,'' said
Elizabeth McCaul, the acting superintendent of banks and the
board's chairwoman. ``We want to end abusive practices, but we
don't want to inadvertently cut off access to credit in those
communities where we are trying to create more access.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulations would make impose several new standards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Defining high-cost loans as those that charge interest more
than eight percentage points above the comparable U.S. Treasury
rate, or up-front fees greater than five points on a loan (a point
is 1 percent of the total loan amount). For second mortgages and
other home loans, the threshold would be nine percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring lenders to consider borrowers' ability to repay and
notify them that impartial credit counseling is available.
</P>
<P>
   _ Banning negative amortization (in which the principal grows),
balloon payments before seven years and higher-interest penalties
after a default.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limiting certain fees and points to 5 percent of the loan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prohibiting the ``packing'' of certain insurance and other
costs into the loan, the ``flipping'' of loans by refinancing at
excessively higher costs, the charging of bogus fees for services
not rendered and unfair mandatory arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   While McCaul said the proposals had broad support from the
public and the lending industry, consumer groups say the plan does
not go far enough. A joint statement from 70 groups and 12 elected
officials last month said the proposal ``leaves serious and glaring
loopholes what would allow creative lenders and brokers, in too
many instances, to continue their predatory practices as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Those endorsing the statement included the American Association
of Retired Persons; New York Public Interest Research Group;
Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, known as
Acorn; Harlem Consumer Education Council; and Greater Rochester
Community Reinvestment Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``All eyes are on the New York State Banking Department,'' said
Sarah Ludwig, a leader of a statewide coalition of groups against
predatory lending. ``The whole country is watching. It's a huge
problem, and they've got to get this right. What's clear is they're
not really serious about putting the screws to this industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Lending-industry leaders, worried that that a few disreputable
lenders are tainting the rest, say they want the abuses stopped.
But they caution that overly stringent rules would hamper
legitimate lenders and curtail access to loans for people who need
them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one bad actor, it puts a black eye on the entire
industry,'' said Robert S. Lotstein, counsel to the National
Association of Mortgage Brokers, which has 12,000 members. ``We are
certainly against predatory lending, but if we need any additional
safeguards, they should be narrowly tailored so that we don't throw
the baby out with the bath water.''
</P>
<P>
   And Stephen A. O'Connor, director for residential financing for
the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, which has 3,000
members, said: ``New York is a bellwether state. Whatever they do
is often copied or emulated.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Other states are also considering action: bills have been filed
this year in the legislatures of California, Illinois, Maryland,
Minnesota, Missouri and South Carolina. The industry warns that a
state-by-state hodgepodge of 50 systems would hinder lenders and
drive up costs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We would much prefer uniformity to a patchwork,'' Lotstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   The subprime lending market exploded after Congress changed the
banking laws in the 1980s in an effort to help the battered savings
and loan industry. The pressure for new regulations stems from a
surge of complaints about loan abuses by a number of lenders. One
high-profile company, First Alliance, a national company with four
offices in New York state, has been under investigation by the
federal Justice Department and regulators in seven states,
including New York.
</P>
<P>
   The only state that has enacted rules against predatory lending
so far is North Carolina, under a law passed last year in a
compromise reached by consumer groups, some industry groups and
government officials. Consumer advocates in New York say that North
Carolina's version is a far stricter and better precedent than the
proposal pending in New York.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina, a major banking state, is home to BankAmerica,
First Union and Wachovia. Since the law is still being phased in,
it is too early to judge the effect, although Alan S. Hirsch, a
deputy to Attorney General Michael F. Easley, a leading proponent,
said: `It's very plain to us that all the major lenders can live
with this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lotstein said, ``We've had clients who have decided it's
just not desirable to do business there anymore, and some have
turned in their licenses.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In New York state, consumer groups say, the regulators have
already yielded to industry criticism and have ignored the
revisions they urged.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig said the coalition wants the rules to bar common devices
like the financing of all points and fees, penalties for paying off
a loan early, the financing of insurance charges paid years in
advance, all balloon payments and all mandatory arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   The critics also say that the regulations should require
stricter review of a borrower's ability to repay and put greater
limits on the frequency of refinancing and on the use of so-called
discount points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposed regulations simply overlook too many victims of
predatory lending,'' said an Acorn member, Gloria Waldron of East
New York, Brooklyn. ``Almost no cases we've seen would even fall
under their definition of high-cost loans.''
</P>
<P>
   Abuses take many forms, beginning with deceptive advertising of
``free money'' and high-pressure sales pitches. In Brooklyn,
unethical brokers comb through court records to find homeowners
already facing foreclosure. The brokers talk the owners into new
loans that save their homes temporarily but sink them deeper into
debt as the operators strip out the remaining equity to pay their
excessive fees.
</P>
<P>
   Some lenders have even preyed on homeowners who have been
declared mentally incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the loans start with shady home improvement contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Acorn cited a couple in Port Jefferson Station on Long Island
who missed a payment and found their interest rate jacked up, to 24
percent from 14. In Brooklyn, a woman told a lender she had lost
her $8,000-a-year job as a home health aide, but it approved a loan
anyway, falsely listing her with a $50,000 salary. Another woman
learned too late that her $45,000 loan required monthly payments of
$500 for 15 years _ $90,000 total _ yet left her owing a balloon
payment of $41,000.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is worst in minority neighborhoods that have been
neglected because of ``redlining'' by more traditional, lower-cost
lenders, critics say. Subprime lenders fill that vacuum. In New
York City, the legacy of predatory abuses has been a proliferation
of foreclosures that community advocates say is devastating central
Brooklyn and southeastern Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Barbara M. Clark, D-Queens, has proposed a bill
that would create protections beyond the proposed banking board
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen people losing their homes outright as a result of
home improvement or debt consolidation loans,'' Clark said.
``They're putting their homes on the line and don't know what
they're getting into, with fees and interest that are just off the
scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Her bill would entitle homeowners to cite an improper loan as a
legal defense to prevent foreclosure. It would also cap brokers'
fees at 3 percent, require disclosure of finder's fees that lenders
pay to home improvement contractors for recruiting borrowers, and
hold bankers responsible for the brokers they deal with.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed several committees last year but did not reach
the Assembly floor. Sen. Frank Padavan, R-Queens, has sponsored the
Senate version.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody needs to do something,'' said Brenda J. Thompson, a
school teacher in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, who said she was
victimized by a subprime lender.
</P>
<P>
   After inheriting her mother's brownstone, which had a small
mortgage with a monthly payment of $154, she talked to a contractor
and lender about renovations. But she was upset when crews tore out
walls without her approval or a loan being issued.
</P>
<P>
   So she went to another lender, who seemed sympathetic and
referred her to a new contractor. He was charming but overcharged
her with a $70,000 fee, took an additional $6,000 of her money and
did incomplete and shabby work, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She was left with a $105,000 loan at 10.9 percent with a $1,002
monthly payment and a balloon balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a job on me, all right,'' Johnson said.

<P>
   In an extraordinary surge of interest in an electronic book,
Stephen King's latest novella, featuring a Mustang-driving ghost,
has proved so popular in two days of literary life on the Internet
that several online booksellers could not meet the demand from
people wanting to download digital copies.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher said Wednesday that 400,000 orders were received
in the first 24 hours after the novella, ``Riding the Bullet,''
became available on various retailers' Web sites. Readers
overwhelmed the sites with purchases or orders to download the
digital horror story into their computers, electronic readers or
Palm Pilots.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed sure whether the surprising demand marked the
beginning of a revolution in the fledgling electronic publishing
market, where individual literary works have not sold more than a
few hundred copies, or simply resulted from the novelty of having a
marquee author dabble in bytes.
</P>

   The novella, the equivalent of 66 written pages, was given away
on the first day by some booksellers to nurture the infant market,
but others were getting brisk orders at $2.50 a copy. The 400,000
figure included both the paid and free downloads, as well as orders
received but not yet filled because of the heavy demand. But even
factoring in the free copies, the enormous first-day demand has
markedly raised the profile of electronic books.
</P>
<P>
   The early sales and orders far outstripped demand for any
traditional book in a similar fleeting period, said Jack Romanos,
president and chief operating officer of Simon &AMP; Schuster, King's
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stunned,'' said Romanos, who has worked in the publishing
industry for more than 30 years. ``I don't think anybody could have
anticipated how many people were out there who are willing to
accept the written word in a paperless format. It's got to be
similar to what the people at Pocket Books went through years ago
when they got the early sales results on the first paperbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were not so sure that a revolution was at hand. They
pointed out that King was a special case _ a best-selling writer
with a huge cult following _ and that the attempt to distribute the
book in volume showed the bugs in the electronic system. Untold
numbers of customers were not able to download the necessary
software for reading or to reach the sites once they had it. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The novella, which will not be published as a traditional book,
had been promoted in print advertisements, on popular sites like
Amazon.com and elsewhere. Its success came in the same week that a
new wave of prominent authors were entering the electronic market.
For generous dot.com advances of up to $100,000, 10 authors were
commissioned by the California-based electronic bookseller
Fatbrain.com to write short essays about the Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Among the writers and celebrities, whose essays begin appearing
this week, are Coretta Scott King, Newt Gingrich, Pete Hamill and
Doris Kearns Goodwin. In addition, on Wednesday Fatbrain announced
the signing of a contract with Toni Morrison to publish her 1993
Nobel Prize acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   The sales for these efforts, however, will no doubt pale beside
the demand for King's tale of an impoverished hitchhiker in Maine
who catches a ride with a nightmarish driver. On Amazon.com, which
is offering the title free for two weeks, customers demanded copies
at the rate of one every 1.5 seconds on the first day it was
available. Barnesandnoble.com, which gave away copies only on
Tuesday, the first day of sale, said that customers requested the
title at the rate of 2.5 per second. Some of those first-day orders
may have been duplications as unsuccessful readers tried repeatedly
to put in their orders.
</P>
<P>
   But NetLibrary, an electronic bookseller based in Boulder,
Colo., offered versions of the novella for $2.50 per copy without
interruption, selling them at the rate of 400 an hour. Under his
agreement with Simon &AMP; Schuster, which is the same arrangement he
has for his books, King will receive more than 50 percent of the
profits from the sales.
</P>
<P>
   First-day sales of hardback books by blockbuster writers like
John Grisham, Tom Clancy or King can run between 30,000 and 75,000,
publishing executives said. The books usually cost $25 to $27.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic titles can be delivered in a variety of forms. A
reader can download digital material from a Web bookseller on a
handheld mini-computer, although fewer than 10,000 of these devices
have been sold. Customers can also downloading material directly
into their personal computers for reading with Glassbook software.
Glassbook was so overwhelmed with requests for its software as a
result of the King novella that it posted an apology for delays on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Palm Pilot holders can be used to download books
from personal computers, but the handheld devices have small
reading screens. In all the formats, the digital material is
secured so readers cannot print versions from computers or e-mail
the text to others.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the early frenzy over ``Riding the Bullet,'' some
skeptics think the results were skewed by the free copies and the
author's loyal following.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same crowd buying, with the big advantage that they
can buy it faster and easier online,'' said Robert E. Baensch, a
former publishing executive and director of New York University's
Center for Publishing. ``We're only talking about one of the most
popular superstar authors.''
</P>
<P>
   Baensch added that he expected sales to fade to King's usual
sales volume, which leveled out at about 1.3 million per title for
his more recent works.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Fatbrain's move to commission works by name authors was also a
bid to promote the infant market for electronic books and to raise
publicity for the bookseller's newly opened e-book Web site,
MightyWords. Fatbrain is offering the Bill of Rights essays for
free.
</P>
<P>
   The company _ which is backed by millions of dollars from
investors like Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft _ is also in
final discussions to post some digitized collections from the
Bancroft Library at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   But in the delicate process of forging new alliances, Fatbrain
has collided with Simon &AMP; Schuster, King's publisher, which was
riled by the company's brashness in blurring the lines between
retailer and publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the popularity of the Stephen King title, Simon &AMP;
Schuster refused to allow Fatbrain to offer the book on its Web
site for popular books, which posts about 6,000 digital works and
sells them for an average of $3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get it,'' said Chris MacAskill, the chief executive
of Fatbrain.com. ``The stated reason is that we were going out
there and signing up authors.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last year and a half, MacAskill has been trying to seed
the market for electronic books by persuading authors to post
material online of 10 to 100 pages. Initially, he said, traditional
publishers were not interested in the short format, so Fatbrain
started acting like a magazine publisher, commissioning short
pieces for generous advances subsidized by venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict with Simon &AMP; Schuster grew out of Fatbrain's
approaches to several the publisher's authors, including Goodwin,
the historian, and Seth Godin, author of ``Permission Marketing.''
The company maintains that it is respecting authors' contracts with
other publishers because if it is not signing a book publisher's
authors to write works that are book length. MacAskill said he was
advised by Simon &AMP; Schuster that he should have sought its
permission before approaching the authors.
</P>
<P>
   Romanos, the Simon &AMP; Schuster president, said that a new,
evolving market calls for a redefinition of what is a book.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key question in electronic publishing _ and one that's
been worked out over many years in traditional publishing _ is who
is a publisher, and who is a retailer and distributor?'' Romanos
said. ``We're more than willing to work with any distributor who
can satisfy the technical and security requirements to protect our
copyrights. But when a distributor decides to take on the
additional role of a publisher, then we will definitely view them
as a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Far removed from such tensions and horrors of publishing was
Stephen King himself. His assistant in Maine said that he was in
Florida, too preoccupied with his own writing to respond to
questions about the success of his first electronic effort.
</P>
<P>
   King, who was seriously injured in an automobile accident last
summer, is making great strides in his recovery, according to his
publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   But the author, whose has written more than 40 books, from ``The
Dead Zone'' to ``Desperation,'' did issue a simple statement about
his electronic title:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very excited at the possibility of a new market opening
up, and as a dedicated and long-term Mac user I am surprised and a
little unhappy at how hard it is for Mac users to access the story,
but thank God for the Palm Pilot, which is making it accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``While I think that the Internet and various computer
applications for stories have great promise, I don't think anything
will replace the printed word and the bound book. Not in my
lifetime, at least.''

THAI BANKRUPTCY DECISION SEEN AS A VICTORY FOR CREDITORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In a landmark decision watched closely
throughout Southeast Asia, Thailand's fledgling bankruptcy court
declared Thai Petrochemical Industry, that country's largest
corporate debtor, insolvent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors regarded the decision as an important victory that
could help them start to recover billions of dollars in unpaid
loans left from the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand's Central Bankruptcy Court ruled that Thai
Petrochemical, which defaulted on $3.5 billion in debt in 1997, had
liabilities exceeding its assets and ordered the company to submit
to court-supervised restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Thai Petrochemical's creditors, which include the International
Finance Corp., which is part of the World Bank, and the U.S.
Export-Import Bank, filed court papers to have the company declared
insolvent last month after more than two years of talks on how to
get the company to begin repaying its debts broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Thai Petrochemical's story is one that is being repeated in
various forms around Southeast Asia, reflecting efforts to clean up
the mess left by the financial crisis. Banks and other creditors
have resorted to legal proceedings to uproot the entrenched family
interests that continue to dominate much of the region's economy.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, for example, efforts to sell assets repossessed by
the government have been delayed by legal wrangling over the role
still played by former owners connected to the fallen former
President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors of Thai Petrochemical did not get everything they
wanted. The bankruptcy court rejected their request to replace Thai
Petrochemical's family-led management immediately, saying a meeting
of all creditors and management must take place first. That means
there could be more negotiations between the creditors and Prachai
Leophairatana, Thai Petrochemical's founder and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But Thai officials and analysts still called the ruling a
victory in efforts by creditors to force the most stubborn debtors
to negotiate in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rather good outcome for creditors,'' said Anthony J.
Norman, managing director of Effective Planners Ltd., a unit of
Ferrier Hodgson Ltd., the financial advisory firm that the creditor
committee had put forward to take over management of Thai
Petrochemical.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors were satisfied with the decision, Norman said,
shrugging off the possible delay posed by further negotiations.
``What does a few weeks matter when you've been waiting 30
months?''
</P>
<P>
   Thai Petrochemical owes so much money that the successful
restructuring of its debt would eliminate almost 7 percent of
Thailand's outstanding bad loans. Foremost among the beneficiaries
would be Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest bank, which extended $600
million in credit to Thai Petrochemical and is the company's single
largest lender.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets, which had rallied Tuesday in expectation of a
ruling favorable to creditors, fell back on the news, with the
benchmark index in Thailand falling 3.5 percent. Thailand's
currency, the baht, was little changed against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Wednesday appeared to stop short of setting what many
bankers and lawyers had hoped would be a legal precedent on
interpreting insolvency. Current Thai law, amended in 1998 and 1999
to give more power to lenders, defines insolvency as an excess of
liabilities over assets, but it fails to include situations in
which an otherwise healthy company is unable or unwilling to repay
its debts.
</P>
<P>
   A report made in January by the Asian Development Bank, the
International Finance Corp. and the World Bank to Thai officials
identified this loophole as one of several shortcomings in the law.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai bankruptcy court, established only nine months ago as a
separate entity to expedite cases like this one, appeared to rely
instead on technicalities in deciding in the creditors' favor. It
rejected Thai Petrochemical's defense partly because the company's
financial adviser who had testified about its debt problems was
deemed by the court to be unqualified.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear how long it would take to convene a meeting
of Thai Petrochemical's nearly 150 creditors, which could give
Prachai a new, if diminished, chance to retain control of the
company he and his family founded in 1978. Thai Petrochemical
officials did not return phone calls seeking a reaction to the
court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials had said they would resign if they lost the
case, but there was no immediate sign that they would abide by that
statement. Last week, the company appealed to nationalist
sentiments, issuing a statement to the Thai stock exchange that
accused creditors of trying to destroy the company and of planning
to lay off most of its 20,000 employees.

ANGELS PUNISH THE BIG UNIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Randy Johnson pitches in the National League
now, so the Angels don't have to face the tall and lanky
left-hander much anymore. But they made the most of their
opportunity on Wednesday, knocking Johnson around for 11 runs and
12 hits in his three-plus innings in the Angels' 15-9 victory over
the Arizona Diamondbacks at Tucson Electic Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored 11 runs in the fourth inning, the first eight
off Johnson, who failed to retire any of the eight hitters he faced
in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bengie Molina and Tim Salmon both homered in the inning off
Johnson, but the blow that really irritated Johnson was Gary
DiSarcina's two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   One of the runners who scored on the play was Trent Durrington,
who is among those competing for the second-base job. After
crossing the plate, the 5-foot-9 Durrington and the 6-foot-10
Johnson bumped into each other and words were exchanged before
things calmed down.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's his name?'' Johnson asked reporters after the game.
``They were having a team meeting behind home plate. I'm trying to
back up home plate and I'm running into people. I was trying to get
him out of the way. They don't need three people to tell the guy
coming around third what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the Australian Durrington said to him, Johnson joked:
``Have a Foster's and go ice your arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Durrington also downplayed the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was looking up at a light tower,'' he said of
Johnson. `'It was too many people in one place at one time.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Stay calm: The hit parade against Johnson was nice, but
Salmon said it was nothing to get too excited about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you evaluate our performance or his performance, hey,
it's spring training,'' said Salmon, who has a team-leading four
homers. ``It feels good, but at the same time you try not to get
overly confident. Because when the gun sounds, he's going to have
his A-game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I threw was right down the middle of the plate,''
Johnson said. ``It got frustrating after a while. . . . I'm willing
to give back my meal money this week. I don't deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Mercker sharp: Angels starter Kent Mercker had his best
outing of the spring in his pursuit of one of the spots in the
starting rotation. He gave up three runs (all on solo homers) and
six hits in four innings. He also had two bunt singles off Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came into spring training telling myself it was my job to
lose,'' said Mercker, who pitched for the Cardinals and Red Sox
last season. ''If I don't make the club, it's my own fault. But I
don't plan on giving them that option.''
</P>
<P>
   In three games, Mercker is 1-0 with a 5.87 ERA.

TEENAGERS HAVE LARGELY ESCAPED PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE PROMOTIONAL
CAMPAIGNS, UNTIL NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Depression. Arthritis. High cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Name an ailment and there is probably a television commercial
somewhere that is advertising about the disorder and promoting a
prescription drug that treats it. Only programming for young people
has more or less escaped the trend.
</P>
<P>
   But no longer.
</P>
<P>
   Both Roche Laboratories and Galderma Laboratories have been
running ad campaigns aimed at teen-agers to make them aware of
prescription medications that treat that most common but
angst-laden adolescent condition: acne.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns reflect the phenomenal growth of consumer
advertising of prescription drugs, which exceeded $1.4 billion last
year, according to Competitive Media Reporting, a media research
firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting prescription medicine to young people is unusual _
Galderma may be the first to advertise a prescription product to
teen-agers by brand name _ but it is not illegal. And for acne
medication, the timing may be right. New medications have made it
so no one has to look like Holden Caulfield anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The treatments for acne have improved dramatically over the
years,'' said Stephen Clark, the president of Galderma. ``Just
about anyone who has acne and goes to a dermatologist early can
prevent the scarring and the psychological problems that acne can
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Roche, a unit of Hoffmann-La Roche, and Galderma, a venture
of Nestle and L'Oreal, are running their campaigns on family and
youth-oriented programming on national cable television. Roche, for
instance, has spots on the Nickelodeon Channel. And though both ad
campaigns deal with the emotional toll of acne, their approaches
are very different. Both companies spent more than $8 million on
television advertising for the 11 months ended in November.
</P>
<P>
   Galderma's campaign promotes and talks about Differin, a topical
ointment introduced in 1997. Roche, which markets Accutane, the
leading prescription acne drug, is running ``health education
messages,'' which only talk about acne but never promote nor even
mention its prescription drug by name.
</P>
<P>
   Young people are the natural target because 85 percent will get
acne. But they are also an elusive group for marketers to reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roughly 80 percent of acne patients treat themselves with
over-the-counter brands,'' said Fred Kellogg, chairman of NCI
Advertising in New York, an agency that specializes in
pharmaceutical advertising. ``Advertising will drive parents and
kids to the dermatologist where more medications are available.''
</P>
<P>
   The Roche spots feature a teen-ager upset about acne _ in one he
is called ``pizza face'' by his pals _ and are designed to persuade
parents and children to talk about the condition and seek help with
a dermatologist, said Melissa Ziriakus, a Roche spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The spots let the viewer know that treatment is available
through a dermatologist and includes a toll-free number that
provides general information and doctor referral from the American
Academy of Dermatology. The academy does not endorse companies or
products, said a spokeswoman, Donna Stein.
</P>
<P>
   The Roche ads are probably designed to expand the market, said
Hemant Shah, president of HKF &AMP; Co., pharmaceutical consultants in
Warren, N.J. And, he said, the strategy makes sense because if more
patients go to the doctor for acne, a certain percentage will be
prescribed the most popular medication on the market _ Roche's
Accutane. Pharmaceutical companies have run similar efforts for
other ailments, including high cholesterol, migraines and
depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to expand the market and just get them interested
and motivated,'' Shah said. ``And teen-agers aren't the easiest
patients to motivate.''
</P>
<P>
   One advantage of advertising the ailment, instead of the brand,
is that a drug company avoids mentioning potential side effects of
its drug, which is required under the Food and Drug
Administration's ``fair balance'' guidelines, said Mark Worman,
president of McCann-Erickson Consumer Healthcare, part of the
McCann-Erickson unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fair balance sometimes either doesn't permit a company to be
as specific as they want to, or so clouds the ad that it might
scare people away,'' Worman said.
</P>
<P>
   Of Galderma's two commercials, one is intended for teen-agers
and the other is meant for women 25 to 40. The company is reaching
out to women because of an unexplained increase in acne cases in
that group, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The 60- and 90-second spots tell of a toll-free number to call
for information about Differin. The number is changed according to
where and when the spots run so the company can track the
effectiveness of its ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teen audience is more difficult to reach than the adult
female,'' said Harold Barnett, Galderma's vice president for
marketing. ``The teen has to get Mom or Dad involved, while the
adult female picks up the phone and calls the doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Galderma's direct approach is the more common method of
advertising prescription drugs to consumers. Years ago, companies
were discouraged from directly promoting their drugs in consumer
advertising, but the FDA set specific guidelines in 1997 that
helped pave the way for the current explosion in prescription drug
advertising on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standards for direct-to-consumer advertising have been around
since the 1970s, but before 1997 it was, practically speaking,
hard'' to advertise to the public, said Brad Stone, an FDA
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   No regulations prohibit advertising prescription drugs to
youngsters, and Stone said there was a built-in safeguard in that
they would have to go to a doctor to get a prescription, which
would typically require adult approval.
</P>
<P>
   Even the American Academy of Dermatology is getting into the
act. The academy will for the first time begin a major campaign to
educate young people about help for skin conditions like acne.
Public service ads featuring the magician David Copperfield are
scheduled to run later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is we don't want anything to get in the way of
being a kid,'' Stein said.

<P>
   Archie, who decided to stay, laughs about it now, partly out of
amusement, partly from relief. He's thrilled he didn't leave and
the Waves are, too. The All-West Coast Conference point guard is
the catalyst in Pepperdine's march to the NCAA Tournament, leading
the team in assists (5.7), scoring when needed and showing the
nerve to take the big shot.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, his cool, cocky demeanor rubs off on the
Waves, who feed off his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a certain swagger about him and I think that's good for
the team,'' Pepperdine coach Jan van Breda Kolff said. ``When I
coached at Princeton, (head coach Pete) Carril always told our
point guards that the other four players always look at the point
guard. The way he carries himself is the way the team carries
itself. And (Archie) carries himself in a confident manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waves (24-8) open the first round of the East Regionals
Friday at 7 p.m. (PST) against Indiana (20-8) in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what Archie would have missed had he left:
</P>
<P>
   __ Winning the starting point-guard job, then earning
all-conference honors.
</P>
<P>
   __ Playing for van Breda Kolff, the Waves' first-year coach who
restored Archie's broken spirit by showing confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
   __ Leading the Waves to the NCAA Tournament in the final year of
an often chaotic career at Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   To think, Archie nearly walked away from all that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was close, I'm not going to say I wasn't,'' Archie said. ``I
got to that close point, but my faith in God and my family support
turned it around for me.''
</P>
<P>
   There were compelling reasons for Archie to leave. He's been at
Pepperdine five years and played under !ital!four different
coaches. First was Tony Fuller, who quit during the 1996 season.
Then came Marty Wilson, who finished that season on an interim
basis. Lorenzo Romar took over from 1996-99, and when he left to
coach Saint Louis University, van Breda Kolff replaced him.
</P>
<P>
   Each coach had his own agenda, tried to bring in players that
fit his philosophy and run off the ones who didn't. Some players
stuck around just long enough to learn a few names before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a revolving door,'' Archie said.
</P>
<P>
   It took a little while, but Archie soon realized that college
basketball could be a cold-hearted business, filled with
half-truths, out-and-out lies and little loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't hit me until after my sophomore year,'' Archie said.
``I was still sheltered, coming from a small town like Fresno,
thinking everybody is your friend, nobody will tell you wrong. They
recruit you here, so they're going to do right by you. You're set,
you're going to get into the tournament all four years. But slowly
but surely I started to see it for what it was, a business, a meat
grind.''
</P>
<P>
   As challenging as that was, the hardest part was adapting to
each coach's style of play, especially Romar's slow-down,
half-court offense.
</P>
<P>
   Archie plays with a flair and he's at his best in an uptempo
game. Romar took that away from him, demanding that Pepperdine's
point guards grind the games to a halt, then dump the ball inside.
</P>
<P>
   Archie almost left.
</P>
<P>
   Then Romar left.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Romar was the coach, Tezale wouldn't be on the team right
now,'' Pepperdine forward Kelvin Gibbs said
</P>
<P>
   Two things happened when Romar moved on. He took his style of
play with him, and Pepperdine hired van Breda Kolff, the former
Vanderbilt coach, to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff looked at Pepperdine's roster and saw one thing:
athletes. He quickly shelved Romar's slow game for one much faster,
the type that suits Archie's style and takes advantage of the
Waves' speed and depth.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the starting job in training camp, Archie has
blossomed into one of the top players in the conference, averaging
9.8 points, 5.7 assists and 2.8 steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes to show you how coach van Breda Kolff treats his
players on the court and off it,'' Gibbs said. ``Last year Tezale
had some problems, but this year he hasn't. For him to be on the
team this year, to be an all-conference guard, scoring like he has
been, dishing the ball like he has and just being our team leader
has been important for us. He's had a lot to do with our success.
He might be the main reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Archie credits his family and friends for convincing him to stay
at Pepperdine, but clearly van Breda Kolff has played the biggest
role in his success. Changing Pepperdine's style was the key. But
showing faith in Archie was just as vital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This coaching staff has been behind me from day one, and
they've pushed me from day one,'' Archie said. ``I've made more
improvement this year then I have my whole college career.''

FDA REVIEWS ACCUSATIONS ABOUT DIABETES DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Mass.)   (af)  
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing accusations that
the manufacturer of the diabetes drug Rezulin withheld evidence of
liver toxicity from the agency until six months after Rezulin was
marketed.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the agency said it would look into accusations
by Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a patient advocacy
group, claiming that Rezulin's manufacturer delayed telling the FDA
that 21 patients had developed liver abnormalities while taking the
drug before it was approved. Federal regulations require that drug
companies report adverse drug reactions to the drug agency within
15 days of learning about them.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 14 letter to the agency, Public Citizen requested a
criminal investigation of the manufacturer, Parke-Davis, a division
of the Warner-Lambert Co. of Morris Plains, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bradbard, a spokeswoman for the drug agency, said no
decision had been made about whether an investigation was needed.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Warner-Lambert, Carol Goodrich, said Public
Citizen's accusations were ``baseless.''
</P>
<P>
   Rezulin was marketed in 1997 to treat Type 2, or adult-onset,
diabetes, the most common form of the disease. It was the first in
a class of drugs that lower blood sugar by making the body more
sensitive to the effects of insulin, the hormone that regulates
blood sugar levels.
</P>
<P>
   The drug has been under siege by consumer safety advocates and
negative news reports in the last year, because after it was
approved it became apparent that in rare instances it can cause
serious liver damage and death.
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen has urged that Rezulin be taken off the market.
Since its introduction in 1997, it has been linked to 89 cases of
liver failure, including 61 deaths and at least 10 liver
transplants. But the number of cases is small in comparison to the
1.9 million people who have taken the drug. Goodrich said several
hundred thousand people in the United States were still taking it.
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen says Warner-Lambert had evidence of serious liver
problems before the drug was marketed, but suppressed the data. The
claim is based on a drug agency memorandum, which the group
obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. A copy of the
memorandum was obtained by The New York Times. The document, a
review written by Dr. Robert I. Misbin, an FDA medical officer,
said that by Feb. 3, 1997, Parke-Davis had received reports of 21
patients who developed liver abnormalities while taking the drug.
But the memorandum said the company did not report those cases to
the agency until eight months later, on Oct. 21, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By then, there were 20 additional well-documented cases of
patients with serious liver problems, and the agency required that
Rezulin be relabeled to warn that liver damage could occur and that
patients should have frequent blood tests to detect it early so
that they could stop taking the drug if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   According to an article last week in The Los Angeles Times,
doctors within the FDA, in opposition to their superiors, have
begun saying it is time to take Rezulin off the market.
</P>
<P>
   Bradbard said the agency declined comment on whether there was
dissension in its ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes specialists have been among Rezulin's staunchest
supporters, because the drug helped many patients to lower their
blood sugar, and many doctors thought it could be used safely as
long as the liver tests were performed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Nathan, an endocrinologist at the Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston, said he had patients who had done well
with Rezulin for several years and were staying on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This drug isn't Satan,'' Nathan said. But he also said he no
longer started new patients on Rezulin. ``The requirement for
liver-function testing outweighs its usefulness,'' he said, adding
that he and many of his colleagues felt more comfortable
prescribing two newer drugs in the same class as Rezulin, Avandia
and Actos, which were approved in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But Nathan said, ``at this point in time it's not clear to me
that the two newer ones are truly safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Avandia has already begun to outsell Rezulin. Sales of Rezulin
in 1999 totaled $773 million, according to IMS Health, a company
that tracks the drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   Liver tests are also required for patients taking the two newer
drugs.

BILLINGS COULD USE A BETTER BREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Brook Billings hopes this week's spring break
will give him the needed break from playing on the break in his
leg.
</P>
<P>
   Billings, USC's top volleyball player, has a stress fracture in
his lower left leg, which caused him to miss four matches (the
Trojans went 2-2, including an embarrassing loss to Cal Baptist).
</P>
<P>
   It should have sidelined him longer, except Billings loves to
play and the Trojans need him.
</P>
<P>
   USC, like the rest of the nation, doesn't have many opposite
hitters. Billings, a 6-foot-5 sophomore, leads the team with 350
kills. He's hitting .328 with 93 digs (4th best) for the 15-13
Trojans, who are third in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation's
Pacific Division at 11-2.
</P>
<P>
   In his first match back, against then-No. 1-ranked Pepperdine,
Billings had 23 kills and 17 digs. Both were match highs. Then he
helped the Trojans knock off Hawaii with a 19-kill, 7-block effort.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't suppsed to play last week against Cal State
Northridge, but when the Trojans lost the first game, in came
Billings, and he finished with 26 kills. He followed that with 17
kills against UC Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Powers has no trouble playing Billings because he
limits Billings in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``His timing is a little off with the setter,'' Powers said.
``His percentage goes down without hitting a lot of balls in
practice. But he's all right. We don't push him too hard. We don't
want to hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Billings plays because he believes USC can compete for the
national championship, yet he acknowledges playing now could
jeopardize his health for the NCAA Tournament, which is in May. He
just doesn't think it's that serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like it's more muscle now,'' he said. ``It doesn't
hurt as much as it did.''
</P>
<P>
   If everything works out, Billings will have stayed off his leg
this week while spending time in Lake Tahoe with his fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   Powers knew where Billings was going and he had the following
words of advice for him:
</P>
<P>
   Don't ski. No snowboarding. No lap dances.
</P>
<P>
   __ Postseason: USC's women's basketball team opens in the
National Invitational Tournament tonight at Santa Clara at 7 p.m.
It's the first NIT berth in school history.
</P>
<P>
   It's also just the second meeting between the two schools. USC
won at Santa Clara in the first round of the UC Irvine tournament
Feb. 3, 1978.
</P>
<P>
   USC's Tashara Carter, Tiffany Elmore and Danielle Golay made the
Pac-10 Conference honorable-mention list. Golay led USC with 11.5
points per game. Elmore averaged 10.5 points and shot a team-best
.758 from the free-throw line. Carter averaged 10.1 points and 2.3
assists.
</P>
<P>
   Junior center Annie Garrison averaged 12.1 points and 6.7
rebounds for Santa Clara. She also shot 55 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   __ Academic honor: UCLA senior forward Maylana Martin was named
to the Pac-10 All-Academic second team. Martin has a 3.10
grade-point average, majoring in sociology.
</P>
<P>
   __ On the bar/beam/vault/floor: The Pac-10 gymnastics
championships are Saturday at Arizona State. UCLA's Heidi
Moneymaker will attempt to keep the all-around and vault titles she
won last year. Lena Degteva will try and recapture the vault title
she won in 1998.

CHANGES UNDER WAY AT STOCK MARKETS IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ With plans for a much-vaunted pan-European stock
exchange rapidly unraveling, bourses from London to Paris began to
position themselves Wednesday for what many expect to be a radical
shake-up up in the way investors trade stocks in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In London, the 298 members of the London Stock Exchange voted
overwhelmingly to end almost two centuries of clubby mutual
ownership by converting their stakes in the exchange into tradeable
shares.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgium, Finance Minister Didier Reynders told a news
conference that the Brussels, Paris and Amsterdam stock exchanges
were in advanced talks to merge or form some other kind of
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Traders and analysts said that investors want easier and cheaper
access to trading in Europe as a whole _ the region has 23 separate
exchanges. ``There's a huge demand for cross-border trading in
Europe,'' said John Spencer, director of equities at Merrill Lynch
in London. ``And this demand is one of the driving forces behind
the need for consolidation.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than two years ago, even before the euro, the single
currency used on much of the Continent, was created, the London and
Frankfurt exchanges seemed to be leading a drive to bring eight
European bourses together in a single trading system.
</P>
<P>
   But that effort has faltered. The only agreement between the
eight was to bring their trading hours into line, and that
agreement was broken, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, some organizations, including the Boerse in
Frankfurt and the Tradepoint alternative stock exchange in London,
plan to establish their own online European trading networks this
year, galvanizing smaller, traditional exchanges in particular to
seek alliances with the dominant exchanges. The Nasdaq stock
market, the electronically linked network of broker-dealers in the
United States, plans to open a Europewide exchange earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these little exchanges are inevitably going to merge
together,'' said David Donnelly, chief investment officer at Gordon
House Asset Management in London. Another European equities
investor put it more bluntly: ``These smaller players now have to
get into an alliance or get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynders, the Belgian finance minister, said the proposed
three-way merger of Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels was open to
others who wished to join.
</P>
<P>
   The three exchanges are already linked. Brussels has
cross-membership ties with Amsterdam and Luxembourg, while Paris
and Brussels use the same trading system. Talks about a broader
pan-European exchange, by contrast, have foundered on disagreements
over common trading systems.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said that if the merger was agreed to, the three
bourses would carve up the market so that Paris _ the biggest of
the three, with a market capitalization of $1.489 trillion _ would
mostly trade in blue-chip stocks, Brussels in shares of small and
midsize companies, and Amsterdam in derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   But that seemed too limited a deal to some exchange officials
still seeking access to a broader European markets. ``At this
stage, there will have to be some new formula on how the blue-chip
market in Europe will work,'' said Tom Healy, chief executive of
the Irish Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The change at the London Stock Exchange was widely seen as a
maneuver to enable the market to navigate the upheaval in European
stock trading. ``Today's vote moves the exchange into a new era,
providing a structure that will allow it to compete more
effectively in the rapidly developing environment in which stock
exchanges now operate,'' said Sir John Kemp-Welch, chairman of the
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in the new shares is expected to begin in late April or
early May, but the stock will be traded outside the normal markets.
No single shareholder will be allowed to hold a stake of more than
4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The changes reflect a wider trend in big European and U.S.
exchanges toward a more nimble ownership structure that permits
them to compete against electronic communications networks, known
as ECNs.
</P>
<P>
   But London's moves are also seen as a precursor to redrawing the
European trading landscape not by negotiation but by market forces.
Rather than agreeing to cooperate, some traders said, the various
exchanges will be subject to the wave of mergers and acquisitions
that have swept through many other European sectors, including
banking and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer at Merrill Lynch said stock markets had been ``the forum
for mergers; now the stock exchanges are becoming targets for
M&AMP;A.'' &QL;

UKRAINE LEADER CANCELS U.S. VISIT AFTER IMF COMPLAINT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN with TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The prime minister of Ukraine canceled a visit to
the United States earlier this week after the Clinton
administration told him that he should come only after ``cleaning
up'' his government, which was discovered to have abused a major
international loan program.
</P>
<P>
   Ukrainian officials said the prime minister, Viktor Yushchenko,
postponed his trip on short notice because of a mining disaster at
home, not because of a snub by the president.
</P>
<P>
   Yushchenko, who was confirmed by Parliament as prime minister
late last year and was planning to make his first official visit to
Washington in that capacity, was told that he would not be able to
meet with President Clinton during his stay, a senior
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to discourage the visit came just before the
Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund revealed
that the Ukrainian central bank had done a series of financial
transactions designed to create the impression that it had more
foreign currency than it really did. The fund said that
manipulation of exchange reserves was intended at least in part to
mislead fund officials into disbursing hundreds of millions of
dollars in loans that might otherwise have been withheld.
</P>
<P>
   Yushchenko headed Ukraine's central bank before becoming prime
minister. U.S. officials consider him the leading reformer in a
nation that has been rocked by corruption scandals for years. But
revelations of mismanagement at the central bank while he served as
its leader have undermined the prime minister early in his
administration, analysts who follow Ukrainian politics said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was the sense that they should go fix this and then talk
about a visit,'' the senior administration official said. ``They
clearly have some business to do at home to clean up this
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based monetary fund, which coordinates its
lending programs with the United States, its largest shareholder,
said that Ukraine supplied false information about foreign reserves
from 1996 to 1998. The country's central bank used nearly $1
billion in hard currency to conduct a series of banking
transactions that allowed it to double-count its reserves. The
transactions were designed to make it seem as if it were meeting
IMF-set goals for managing its economy when it actually might not
have met those goals, the fund said this week.
</P>
<P>
   During the period in question, the fund distributed $675 million
in loans to Ukraine. Fund officials said Wednesday that they had
yet to determine exactly how much of that amount would have been
withheld if they had had an accurate picture of Ukraine's financial
health.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations raise questions about political and economic
management in Ukraine, the former Soviet republic that has been a
high priority for the Clinton administration for many years. Until
recently, Kiev was the third largest recipient of foreign aid from
the United States after Israel and Egypt _ aid that was intended in
part to support democracy and foster capitalism. Ukraine, along
with Russia, has also been among the largest recipients of
long-term lending from the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of mismanagement in Ukraine is a blow to the
monetary fund at a sensitive time. The fund has been under pressure
from Congress and the Clinton administration to strengthen its
auditing procedures after Russia was found to have misused foreign
exchange reserves, possibly including IMF aid, in ways that
resemble the problems in Ukraine.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Congress agreed to devote $18 billion to support the fund
in 1998, it set up a commission to investigate ways of streamlining
its operations. The so-called Meltzer Commission last week issued a
report that, among many recommendations, urged that the fund
eliminate the types of long-term lending programs involved in loans
to Ukraine. Lawmakers who vote on United States contributions to
the fund have also demanded the fund do a better job of ensuring
that money it provides is used properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be important to know who knew what and when at
the IMF,'' said Rep. Jim Leach, who is chairman of the House
Banking Committee. ``There also are very serious questions about
how deep the corruption goes in the former Soviet Union _ whether
this is just endemic or whether there is still hope for reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund made a detailed statement about Ukraine's deception in
response to questions from several news organizations, fund
officials said Wednesday. The statement, issued late Tuesday night,
said that Ukraine's central bank, at its request, had hired the
private accounting firm of PriceWaterhouseCoopers to audit it
accounts. Fund officials said they hope that the audit will reveal
more information about how the currency reserves were inflated, how
much money the fund disbursed to Ukraine that it otherwise might
have withheld, and whether off-shore banking transactions generated
profits for Ukrainian officials.
</P>
<P>
   The fund received indications of Ukraine's deception well before
it said anything publicly about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The fund said this week that it spotted problems with Ukraine's
management of its foreign reserves as early as August 1998. In
April of last year, legislators in Ukraine's Parliament sent a
letter to the IMF raising accusations that the central bank was
``round-tripping'' foreign reserves through offshore accounts to
create a false picture of its total reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The mismanagement, at least so far, has not resulted in any
punishment for Ukraine. The nation currently has access to an IMF
loan program initiated in September 1998, though the fund has not
recently disbursed money because Ukraine has failed to meet
conditions of the loan program.
</P>
<P>
   Questions also have been raised about the role of Credit Suisse
First Boston, the New York-based investment banking arm of Swiss
financial services giant Credit Suisse Group. Credit Suisse helped
transfer about $150 million in central bank funds, some of which
might have been provided by the IMF, from Ukraine to Cyprus, a
popular off-shore haven for financial transactions in the former
Soviet Union, government investigators said. The information about
Credit Suisse's role was first reported by The Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
   The fund said the money involved in that transaction was
funneled back into Ukraine from Cyprus, invested in government
securities and double-counted for purposes of tallying total
foreign reserves.

   ORLANDO, Fla. _ The Bay Hill Invitational this weekend will have
a decided generation gap.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Baddeley, who will turn 19 years old Friday, will be
playing in the same tournament with Arnold Palmer, who is 70.
</P>
<P>
   Baddeley was invited by Palmer, the host of the tournament,
after he became the youngest player to win the Australian Open last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Still an amateur, Baddeley could be next in line behind Tiger
Woods and Sergio Garcia to make a huge impact in professional golf
at an early age. When Palmer sees teen-agers good enough to win pro
events, he can't help shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' said Palmer, who won his first PGA Tour event
at age 25. ``The mental attitude of these players is far more
mature than it was 20, 30, 40 years ago. There were some pretty
good young players in those days, but these guys are very seasoned
and very poised.''
</P>
<P>
   While Baddeley and Palmer will certainly draw attention, there
will be an added buzz surrounding the event with Tiger Woods
returning to action after a two-week break, headlining a field that
includes 12 of the top 16 players in the world ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Others top players in the field include Colin Montgomerie, Davis
Love III, Lee Westwood, Vijay Singh, Ernie Els, Hal Sutton, Phil
Mickelson, Tom Lehman, Darren Clarke, Garcia and Tim Herron, the
defending champion.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Hill begins a key stretch in the Tour's schedule, with the
Masters only three weeks away, and the Players Championship next
week in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. Woods looked well-rested and upbeat
Wednesday, and he was looking forward to playing at Bay Hill, which
is less than a 10-minute drive from his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already won at Disney, so it would be nice to win Bay
Hill as well,'' Woods said. ``It would be even more special to win
Arnold's tournament, just because of the fact that he's the king.
I've been fortunate enough to win the Byron Nelson, as well as the
Memorial, which is Jack Nicklaus' tournament. It would be nice to
be part of Arnold's tournament as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has played either 20 or 21 Tour events in each of the last
three years, and he is on pace to play about the same amount in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could probably play a few more, but the problem I run into
is not being fresh,'' Woods said. ``I play differently than some
players on tour. I'd rather focus on quality, not quantity.''
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour commissioner, Tim Finchem, said that next month's
MCI Classic in Hilton Head, S.C., should be kept out of the
controversy regarding the Confederate flag that flies over South
Carolina's capitol. The Knicks have moved their pre-playoff
training camp out of Charleston in response to the flag issue. ``I
don't think we ought to use a sporting event to send that
message,'' Finchem said. ``I think there are other ways to send
that message, and I think the people of South Carolina ought to be
the ones sending that message. A Tour event raises a lot of money
for charities in that community, and I don't think we should use
the tournament to make that point. Personally, I don't think they
should fly the flag. But we have no plans to involve the tournament
in that fight.'' ... Starting in 2001, the American Express
Championship will be moved from November to the week of Sept. 10 at
a site to be determined. That means the Tour Championship will once
again be the last official event of the season.

CAN'T TELL PLAYERS WITH A SCORECARD  
(DW)

   LAKELAND, Fla. _ A woman wearing a ``Jeter 2'' shirt stood,
camera in hand, next to the visitors' dugout scanning the figures
on the field. Another young woman, with ``Knoblauch 11'' on her
back, sat next to the dugout in the first row.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the dugout stood a young man wearing a ``Williams 51''
shirt, another with just the No. 51, another with ``O'Neill 21,''
yet another with a Jeter shirt. They looked in vain for their
heroes. They were not on the field or anywhere else at Marchant
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez, Scott Brosius and Jorge Posada were not in the
vicinity Wednesday either. In their place for the Yankees' game at
the spring home of the Detroit Tigers were players named Juan Melo,
Rafael Bournigal, Julio Mosquera, Clay Bellinger and Jon Zuber. No
truth in advertising there.
</P>
<P>
   As teams often do in spring training, the Yankees played the
game seemingly in violation of an exhibition directive from the
commissioner's office that mandates the minimum number of regulars
a team must have at a road game.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, the head of baseball operations in the
commissioner's office, did not return a telephone call about the
directive, but Phil Garner, the Tigers' manager, said clubs have
been told they have to have a combination of four starters or
players who will ``start a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Yankees were annoyed last Saturday when the Atlanta
Braves visited them in Tampa, Fla., and brought only two players,
Reggie Sanders and Quilvio Veras, who fit that description.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the rule is to protect the ticket-buying fans. When
they see, for example, that the Yankees are playing in Lakeland,
people buy tickets expecting to see the three-times-in-four-years
World Series champions. They might accept the reality that they
will not see the lineup that won those World Series, but for their
$12, $8 or $5 tickets, they might have a reasonable expectation of
seeing a fair share of that lineup, say, Jeter, Brosius, O'Neill
and Posada.
</P>
<P>
   But Mosquera, Zuber, Bournigal and Melo?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the Columbus Clippers' lineup,'' the
public-address announcer commented in the press box, though not
over the public-address system.
</P>
<P>
   To say the Yankees had even three regulars on the field during
their 8-2 loss to the Tigers would be a stretch. Ricky Ledee and
Shane Spencer were in the outfield, but between them they might
count as one starter, two if Ledee winds up as the everyday left
fielder and Spencer part of a designated-hitting platoon. Then
again, they may not start at all. The Yankees are apparently not
enamored of either one as a regular left fielder and have engaged
in talks seeking a more productive hitter for the position.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Raines was in the lineup, but his starting days are behind
him. In fact, before the game, when Joe Torre was running down his
designated-hitting possibilities, he mentioned five players and
Raines was not one of them. When Torre was subsequently asked a
question about Raines, even then he did not talk about him as a
possible starting or platooned designated hitter. Pinch-hitting was
the context in which the manager talked about the veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens was the Yankees' starting pitcher, and he surely
qualifies as a front-line player, but Garner said pitchers don't
count.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm filing a complaint with the commissioner,'' Garner said,
then laughed. Only joking. In fact, he had no complaint at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Joe about it already,'' he said in his office
before the game. ``He just said, `We have a sort of a skeleton
staff.'''
</P>
<P>
   Garner said he understood. ``There are a whole lot of reasons,''
he said, then ticked off the names of players he said he would not
take on Thursday's one-and-one-half-hour trip to St. Petersburg,
Fla., for a variety of reasons, including Juan Gonzalez ``because
his back is going to stiffen up and I don't want that to happen in
spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers' new manager said clubs that train in Florida seem to
be more attentive to the rule than teams that train in Arizona,
where he spent eight springs with the Milwaukee Brewers. But even
there, he said, he encountered trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a general manager may say something to another
general manager,'' Garner said. ``I had that happen a couple years
ago. One of the general managers complained and Sal Bando, my boss,
said, `Take a couple more guys next time.' It's something we want
to do for the fans. You want the fans to see a representative
club.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 7,440, a record for the 35-year-old park, may not
have thought it saw a representative visiting club Wednesday.  &QL;

LOS ANGELES OFFICIALS FEUD OVER INQUIRY INTO POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A simmering feud between the Los Angeles police
chief and the county district attorney over the handling of a major
police corruption scandal erupted Wednesday, with the police chief
refusing to cooperate fully with the local prosecutors and then
being humiliated with a rebuke by several law-enforcement
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The chief, Bernard C. Parks, had instructed his department in
recent weeks to provide documents and other information about the
criminal investigation first to the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles,
several people close to the matter said, and only later to
prosecutors in the district attorney's office if the U.S. attorney
approved.
</P>
<P>
   In an increasingly heated exchange of letters, the district
attorney, Gil Garcetti, wrote on Tuesday that while the police
should provide information to the federal officials, that ``doesn't
relieve you of the responsibility to cooperate with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti said in a radio interview Wednesday, ``You cannot come
up with a valid reason why he is doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Los Angeles city attorney, James Hahn, wrote a
letter to Parks insisting that he had a legal obligation to respond
to the district attorney's requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police chief cannot pick and choose which prosecutors he
deals with,'' Hahn said in an interview, adding that the chief had
never informed him about his resistance or asked for legal advice.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn also said Parks had told him Wednesday that the situation
had been blow out of proportion and misinterpreted. Cmdr. David
Kalish, the department's chief spokesman, did not return calls
Wednesday seeking comment, but he was quoted in The Los Angeles
Times on Wednesday morning saying, ``It doesn't make sense to work
with two prosecutorial agencies simultaneously and have two
parallel investigations. This is the best approach. The cases will
be taken directly to the U.S. attorney, who will make the
appropriate prosecutorial decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The California attorney general, Bill Lockyer, publicly rebuked
the police chief for this stand, saying, ``The current posture of
the Los Angeles Police Department, in refusing to provide
investigatory material to the district attorney is unfortunate,
counterproductive, and without legal authority.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the district attorney's office ``is the best
agency to prosecute those cases arising out of the Rampart
investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   In the scandal, centered on the Rampart station in the
inner-city here, a number of police officers have been implicated
in abuses including stealing drugs, framing innocent people,
beating suspects and shooting at least two unarmed gang members and
then planting guns on them. Hundreds of criminal convictions may be
overturned and the city is preparing for what could be more than
$200 million in civil judgments.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney, Alejandro Mayorcas, refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Parks has vigorously pursued his own investigation of the
wrongdoing and issued a stinging report on the department's
managerial lapses, but he has repeatedly fought with the district
attorney over the speed of the criminal inquiry, and he has
resisted any outside investigation of his department.
</P>
<P>
   Parks' actions also appear to have angered the Police
Commission, the department's civilian oversight body. Despite
corresponding with the district attorney's office for a week on the
problem, the chief never informed the commission of the battle,
even though there was a regularly scheduled commission meeting
Tuesday morning.

WITH INTENSITY IN QUESTION, UT TRIES FINDING HEARTBEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ After the excitement of Selection Sunday, the
Texas basketball team retreated to a players-only meeting in a
conference room in the Moncrief-Neuhaus Athletic Center.
</P>
<P>
   There was no yelling or finger-pointing regarding the team's
disappointing play in a semifinal loss to Oklahoma in the Big 12
tournament the day before. Almost every player had a say. Seniors
Ivan Wagner, Gabe Muoneke, Chris McColpin and Will Clay spoke last.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't mention Oklahoma. But they did talk about last
year's loss to Purdue in the first round of the NCAA Tournament and
the difficult path that lay ahead, beginning today when the
fifth-seeded Longhorns open play against No. 12 seed Indiana State
in the West Region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we talked about how hard we have to play,'' Clay
said. ``We know we're only guaranteed one game and it can be a
short season, or we can go out and play every game like it's our
last and play six games \Rto reach the championship\S.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were watching the bracket, some of the younger players
were talking about LSU or Arizona. I just told everyone that we
can't take any team for granted. We can't look ahead. None of these
teams would be in the tournament if they weren't good teams.''
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, the Longhorns are included in that group.
</P>
<P>
   But as early-week conjecture swirled around which of the six Big
12 teams were most likely to advance to the Sweet 16, Texas was an
afterthought to Iowa State, Oklahoma State and the Sooners. The
obvious reason was that the Longhorns were mentally missing in
action in the Big 12 semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problems weren't technical,'' Muoneke said. ``It was about
playing hard. We were lackadaisical against Oklahoma. At this time
of the season, players have to make plays and, basically, talent
comes out. The difference between us and Duke and those other teams
is not talent. Everybody knows we're stacked in that area. It's a
matter of consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can be bad if we're lackadaisical, or great if we play
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rick Barnes said he has been pleased with his team's
attitude this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a couple of good days of practice and a good workout
this morning,'' Barnes said. ``We'll be OK if we do what we've done
all year long and learn from our mistakes. We have to understand
that we've got to do a better job on the offensive end, a much
better job of staying within ourselves and work the entire game.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's first-round game represents full circle for Longhorns
center Chris Mihm, who after last year's first-round loss in Boston
immediately dedicated himself to making sure his team returned to
the tournament, but with more favorable results. One of the few
players who showed any fire against OU, Mihm said he enters NCAA
play focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in the tournament means a lot to me,'' said Mihm, who
within the coming weeks will decide if he will return for his
senior season or enter the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was frustrated with last year's opening-round loss. It was
something that has driven me to work this year. I want to go out
there and give it my all and see how far I can take this team. The
tournament is such a great experience. I'd like to get as deep as I
can go.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent disappointment notwithstanding, Mihm certainly expects
the Longhorns to play more than one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a much better prepared team than we were a year ago,''
he said. ``This time last year, a lot of guys were running on empty
and we were banged up. We've got the depth we need and a solid
team. We've had a lot better year, and we've got a lot more
confidence. I'm expecting big things. If everyone comes to play, we
can do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Unexpectedly, the word ``if'' has become a disturbing part of
the equation.

FTC EXPECTED TO FILE COMPLAINTS OVER GENERIC DRUG DELAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Colo., Ill., Germany, France)  (js) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission is expected to file complaints
Thursday contending that four drug companies harmed consumers when
they made agreements that delayed the sale of low-cost generic
drugs, according to lawyers and executives briefed on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The expected civil actions will be the first to come from a
continuing investigation by the commission into the growing number
of deals between companies that make brand-name drugs and
competitors that are developing cheaper, generic forms of popular
medications. Under the agreements, the brand-name company pays the
generic company not to sell the lower-cost drug. As a result,
consumers pay hundreds of millions of dollars more than they would
if the cheaper drug were available.
</P>
<P>
   Andrx Corp., a generic drug maker, said Wednesday that the
commission was expected to file a case against it and Aventis,
created last year with the merger of Hoechst A.G. of Germany and
Rhone-Poulenc S.A. of France, over a 1997 agreement between Andrx
and Hoechst. Under the agreement, Hoechst agreed to pay Andrx $100
million a year if Andrx kept its generic version of Cardizem CD,
one of the nation's top-selling heart drugs, off pharmacy shelves.
Cardizem had sales of $850 million in 1998, according to IMS
Health, a market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC is also expected to settle charges with Abbott
Laboratories and Geneva Pharmaceuticals, a generic drug company
owned by Novartis, executives said. The charges result from a deal
between the two companies involving Abbott's blood-pressure drug,
Hytrin, which had sales of $610 million in 1998. Abbott agreed to
pay Geneva millions of dollars a month to not sell its generic
version of Hytrin.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Hahn, president of Andrx, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
said Wednesday that the company's agreement with Aventis did not
harm consumers. Instead, Hahn said, details of the agreement and
Aventis' payments helped the financially struggling Andrx get the
generic drug on the market faster than would have otherwise been
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything we could to get this product out there,''
Hahn said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Aventis also said the agreement with Andrx did
not harm consumers but was solely meant to protect the company's
patent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aware that the commission is expecting to vote on this
issue,'' she said. ``We don't yet know the outcome of that vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswomen at Abbott, based in North Chicago, Ill., and Geneva,
based in Broomfield, Colo., declined to comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the companies are also facing class-action lawsuits
filed by consumers and large purchasers of drugs, including
insurance companies and pharmacies. Abbott disclosed in its annual
10-K report this week that Florida's attorney general was also
demanding information about its agreement with Geneva and about a
similar deal with another drug company, Zenith Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is investigating the generic drug deals at a time
when many popular drugs are nearing the end of their patent
protection. To protect revenues derived from those brand-name
drugs, companies often quickly file lawsuits against any competitor
that applies to the Food and Drug Administration to sell a generic
form. The lawsuits argue that the generic drug company is
infringing on the other company's patent.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of those lawsuits result in the kind of
settlements the commission is now investigating.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hahn said Andrx had submitted applications to develop the
generic form of 10 different brand-name drugs. So far, he said,
Andrx has been sued by the manufacturer of the brand-name drug over
nine of those applications. Just by filing the lawsuit, the company
with the brand-name drug can often delay the introduction of the
generic drug for many months.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the game,'' Hahn said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is expected to file its case involving Aventis
and Andrx before an administrative law judge rather than in federal
court. The FTC could only press for fines or other financial
penalties if it filed the complaints in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Abbott and Geneva, the commission is expected to
approve a consent order that would not involve financial penalties
but would prohibit the companies from entering into similar
agreements in the future. &QL;

NRA BLAMES BYRDSONG SLAYING ON CLINTON'S FAILURE TO ENFORCE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (bl)  
 By MARC LACEY  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Escalating the war of words over gun control, the
National Rifle Association said Wednesday that President Clinton
had blood ``on his hands'' for politicking on the gun issue instead
of enforcing existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   The association's executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, said
the Clinton administration bore responsibility for the shooting
death last year of the former basketball coach of Northwestern
University, Ricky Byrdsong.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre suggested in a television interview that Byrdsong would
not have been shot if the administration had prosecuted the killer
for gun-law violations after he was turned away from a gun store
because of his criminal record. The gunman, Ben Smith, later bought
a gun from an unlicensed dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That death is on the president's hands,'' LaPierre told ABC.
``If he had prosecuted, he would have prevented the death.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre added, ``The key question here for the president is has
he looked into the eyes of Ricky Byrdsong's family, because that
blood is on his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said LaPierre got his facts wrong when
he tried to blame lax federal enforcement for the Byrdsong murder.
It was state officials, not federal ones, who were responsible for
the background checks in Illinois. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms was not informed about Smith's effort to buy a weapon
until after he had killed Byrdsong.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had reacted angrily to LaPierre's suggestions over the
weekend that the president was willing to accept a certain level of
killing to further the Democratic agenda. But at a White House
rally Wednesday aimed at breaking the legislative logjam on gun
legislation, Clinton shrugged off the personal attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a little tickled over the weekend when they got a little
rough with me,'' he said. ``I mean, I have so much scar tissue now,
I can't even feel it. So it's totally immaterial to me what they
say. And that should not be an issue for any of you.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue for the president is gun control legislation that has
cleared the House and Senate in differing forms but has never
emerged from conference. The Senate version sets aside 72 hours to
conduct background checks at gun shows, a provision the White House
backs. But the House bill, pushed by the NRA, reduces the time to
24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking a little time and a little inconvenience to save a lot
of lives is a good deal for America,'' Clinton said. ``Why should
this be the only area of our national life where we say no
prevention, only punishment?''
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates won a symbolic victory Wednesday when the
House voted, 218-205, to urge the House-Senate negotiators to meet
in hopes of forging a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gov. George Pataki of New York offered a gun control
package of his own. He called for taking ballistic ``fingerprints''
of guns, making trigger locks mandatory and raising the age for
handgun ownership from 18 to 21. Another Pataki proposal would
require instant background checks of gun buyers at flea markets and
gun shows.

TWELVES OF MARCH WORSE THAN IDES

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Beware the Twelves of March.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the Ides. The Twelves are more dangerous. There are four
Caesars in this NCAA Tournament who had better watch their backs.
Texas, Kentucky, Florida and defending champion Connecticut all
need to watch behind them. There's a No. 12 seed out there with
their name on it.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the past 11 NCAAs, a No. 12 seed has defeated a No. 5
seed in the first round (perhaps you remember Florida State 96, TCU
87 in 1998). If it happens 11 consecutive times, statistical
analysts feel safe in calling it a ``trend.'' By late Friday
afternoon, fans of either the Longhorns, the Wildcats, the Gators
or the Huskies are likely to be asking, ``What happened?''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, eight double-digit seeds won first-round games, and
five of those won the second round to advance to the Sweet 16.
Seeds 10, 11, 12 this season include Gonzaga, Creighton, Nevada-Las
Vegas, Seton Hall, Dayton, Ball State, Arkansas, Pepperdine,
Indiana State, St. Bonaventure, Utah State and Butler. Remember
them. Some will still be around this weekend and next week.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-seed phenomenon has taken effect before the games have
been played. George Washington coach Tom ``Motormouth'' Penders
said that No. 12 Butler over No. 5 Florida was ``an upset waiting
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida coach Billy Donovan fired back: ``I would love to ask
Tom if he has seen Butler play. I would love to know if Tom Penders
even knows one player on their team. We might as well say we're
co-champions of the SEC and let's wrap it up, because we are going
to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   If you sense a little tension in the air, you're right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 seed is the only seed that gets a break anymore,''
Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim said. ``It used to be the first three or
four seeds had it pretty easy. The landscape has changed. The
middle to bottom teams have come up and the top teams have dropped.
There just isn't much difference anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-seeded Orangemen play 13th-seeded Samford (we're
``Sam''ford, not ``Stan''ford) here today in the first round of the
Midwest Region]. The Bulldogs have a victory against St. John's.
Samford is ``Princeton-Lite,'' running a cut-and-screen offense
that has launched 780 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is tremendous pressure on Syracuse to win,'' Samford
guard Mario Lopez said. True. Having ``No. 4'' next to its name
makes Syracuse the favorite. Having ``No. 13'' next to its name
makes Samford the underdog. But those are just labels.
</P>
<P>
   In today's first game here, No. 5 Kentucky is down to eight
scholarship players because starter Desmond Allison was suspended
this week. Keep in mind that Gonzaga's run to the West Regional
championship game last year began against a Minnesota team depleted
by suspensions brought on by an academic scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into a 5-12 game, we don't want to be caught off-guard,
but we're used to playing underdogs,'' said Kentucky point guard
Saul Smith, speaking like the coach's son that he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about the seedings,'' said Bonnies senior point
guard Tim Winn, who is the type of speedy point guard that has
troubled Kentucky. ``There have been a lot of strange things happen
in the tournament the last few years. We're not afraid to play
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky's Jamaal Magloire was stretching it when he said that
St. Bonaventure could reach the Final Four. But 12 seeds don't
always have a short shelf life. Ten of the 18 No. 12 seeds that
have pulled first-round upsets since 1985 have won in the second
round to reach the Sweet 16. A 12 beating a 5 is not a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be stealth vs. strength,'' Samford coach Jimmy
Tillette said of his team's game with Syracuse. ``If we both play
our best games, I don't think we'll win. Hopefully, their
biorhythms will be off.''
</P>
<P>
   At eight different sites in four different regions over the next
two days, some higher-seeded team's internal clock will start
blinking like a VCR after a power outage. And a double-digit seed
will play another day.

EARNHARDT RESTORING HIMSELF AS CUP CONTENDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NASCAR Nation is sleeping easier this week, now that the
natural order of things has been restored by Dale Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   With his photo-finish victory over Bobby Labonte at Atlanta
Motor Speedway on Sunday, Earnhardt validated the race-worthiness
of the 2000 Chevrolet Monte Carlo and quieted those critics who
dared to question the declining quality of NASCAR Winston Cup
racing.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhat overlooked among the rave reviews of what was a
cracker jack of a Cracker Barrel 500 is the fact that Earnhardt has
recorded a victory and a second-place finish in the season's first
four events. Earnhardt stands a solid third in the points chase,
trailing preseason championship favorite Bobby Labonte by 68
markers and runner-up Mark Martin by 50.
</P>
<P>
   And check this out, Jack Roush. With 597 points, Earnhardt is 51
points ahead of sixth-place Dale Jarrett, the reigning series
champion and Daytona 500 winner and certainly a worthy preseason
pick to repeat.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we only are four events into a marathon 34-race season.
And, right, Earnhardt has not won a Cup championship since 1994,
the year before the emergences of Jeff Gordon and his patron saint,
Ray Evernham. And true, Earnhardt has slid out of the top five in
final points the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But Earnhardt gained four points positions last weekend. By his
current pace, the 48-year-old Earnhardt has demonstrated that he
deserves to be considered a viable contender for what would be the
Winston Cup championship of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   We are referring, of course, to an eighth Cup championship, the
one that would separate Earnhardt and his sneering mustache from
King Richard Petty. Since 1995 _ and most definitely since winning
his first Daytona 500 in 1998 _ the eighth championship has become
Earnhardt's holy grail.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man right here can still win plenty of races,'' team
owner Richard Childress said at AMS, seated next to his sneering
hunting buddy. ``And we ain't forgot about that championship,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt certainly was feisty during Speed Weeks at the Daytona
International Speedway, where he began defense of his International
Race of Champions title with a victory. And while standing in the
backyard of NASCAR president Bill France Jr., Earnhardt also
assumed the role of lead whiner for Chevrolet drivers convinced
that the sanctioning body's new uniform shock absorber and spring
rules had rendered the 2000 Monte Carlo aerodynamically inferior to
the Ford Taurus and Pontiac Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt finished an uncompetitive 21st at Daytona, where
Childress' restrictor plate engine program usually is a
front-runner. See, Earnhardt said, these shocks and springs really
are junk. Earnhardt thereupon rallied for a second-place finish to
Labonte the following weekend in Rockingham, N.C., and was running
eighth at Las Vegas when the race was brought to an early
conclusion by rain and won by Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, NASCAR allowed the Chevrolet camp to extend the
bottom of the Monte Carlo's front air dam by two inches to create
better aerodynamic grip through the corners. It was just enough of
an aero fix for Earnhardt, who scored his 75th career victory by
the margin of 0.010 seconds _ less than two feet _ over Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a better car to race with,'' Earnhardt said. ``The
balance is better on the car than what we had. We just need to keep
tuning on it and see what's left.''
</P>
<P>
   For Earnhardt and crew chief Kevin Hamlin, what's left should
translate into at least a match of the three victories notched by
the No. 3 GM Goodwrench Service Plus Chevy in 1999. And if Gordon
and the other Chevy drivers fail to get a handle on the new Monte
Carlo, maybe Earnhardt will win five Cup races in 2000. And an
unprecedented eighth Cup championship, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've never been as determined as I have this year,''
Earnhardt said. ``I work hard trying to stay focused on the job at
hand. That black 3 car got me there. That's the ball as far as I'm
concerned, and I'm going to keep my eye on it.''
</P>
<P>
   So sleep easy, NASCAR Nation. Hit that snooze button. The
natural order has been restored.
SPOTLIGHT ON... Elliott's Dodge switch keyed to championship Bill
Elliott in a Dodge?
</P>
<P>
   It was the worst-kept secret in the NASCAR Winston Cup garage
area before being made official at Atlanta Motor Speedway last
week. And while Elliott admittedly wrestled emotionally over
breaking ranks with the Ford Motor Co., the former Winston Cup
champion made it clear why he decided to merge his team with
Evernham Motorsports beginning with the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't continue the level I need to be at being a single-car
deal,'' said Elliott, the first of two drivers former
championship-winning crew chief Ray Evernham plans to sign. ``I
don't have the access to technology or anything else. I've been
trying to struggle with how I need to make my team better or
continue in this sport, and you come to a crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was absolutely the best opportunity that could ever
happen to me and the guys back in the shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's defection to Evernham's No. 9 Dodge Intrepid R/T makes
fiscal sense because his primary sponsorship with McDonald's ends
after this season. Competitively, Elliott has 40 Cup victories but
none since the Southern 500 at Darlington (S.C.) Raceway in
September 1994. That is a stretch of 165 consecutive starts.
</P>
<P>
   Since launching his own team in 1995, Elliott is winless in 157
starts and has finished no better than eighth in final points
(1995, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   With that recent history, Elliott sees Evernham as a savior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching him and what he's done the last eight to 10 years is
incredible,'' Elliott said of Evernham, who orchestrated Jeff
Gordon to 47 victories and three Cup championships at Hendrick
Motorsports. ``When he came to me \Rlast fall\S, the reason I
didn't say much was I was trying to pick myself up off the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott said brother Ernie, his longtime engine builder, will be
a member of the revamped team that will work out of his shop in
Statesville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I can get out of the day-to-day running of the
business and transition into next year,'' said Elliott, 44,
determined to make at least one more bona fide championship run.
``Oh, absolutely. For what that man \REvernham\S can do, there's no
question. I don't see nothing but a brighter future.''
PIT STOPS No Bliss for Foyt First-year NASCAR Winston Cup team
owner A.J. Foyt has replaced rookie Mike Bliss with veteran Dick
Trickle for the races at Darlington Raceway this weekend and
Bristol Motor Speedway on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt said he made the move after Bliss failed to qualify the No.
14 Conseco Pontiac Grand Prix for the past three events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I have to see where we're at,'' said Foyt, of
Houston. ``I hired Dick Trickle because I believe his experience
can help us troubleshoot the program.'' TMS books testing Track
time will be at a premium at Texas Motor Speedway next week for
teams testing before the NASCAR Busch Grand National Albertson's
300 and Winston Cup DirecTV 500 April 1-2.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrick Motorsports has rented the track on Monday and Tuesday,
and defending Cup race champion and native Texan Terry Labonte is
scheduled to test. Five BGN drivers also plan to run laps,
including Jack Sprague, Tony Roper, Jason Leffler, Rick Bickle and
Justin Labonte, Terry's son.
</P>
<P>
   Busch drivers Todd Bodine, Tony Roper and Jimmie Johnson will be
at the track for a NASCAR-mandated public relations function on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone has rented the track for Indy-car tire testing on
Wednesday and Thursday, with Al Unser Jr. tentatively scheduled to
attend. And Indy-car and Winston Cup team owner A.J. Foyt is
scheduled to make an appearance Thursday on his way to Bristol
Motor Speedway. Tenth race on hold There will be no 10th race added
to the newly renamed Indy Racing Northern Light Series (formerly
Indy Racing League) schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Series founder Tony George said that despite ``genuine interest
by more than one facility'' in hosting the 10th event, a deal could
not be struck for this season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the long-winded new series name comes on the heels of
a five-year title sponsorship announced by George and officials of
Northern Light, a leading Internet search engine, at Walt Disney
World Speedway on Jan. 29. A new logo also will be on display for
the MCI WorldCom Indy 200 at Phoenix International Raceway this
weekend. Last laps Preseason title favorite Dario Franchitti has
received medical clearance to begin testing for the opening round
of the 2000 Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series at
Homestead-Miami Speedway on March 26. Franchitti, of Team Kool
Green, suffered a fractured pelvis and brain contusions in a crash
at Homestead, Fla., on Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Gary DeHart will mark his 200th Winston Cup race as crew chief
for Hendrick Motorsports at the Mall.com 400 at Darlington Raceway
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time and reigning champion Paul Gentilozzi will open defense
of his BFGoodrich Tires Trans-Am Series title with a new car _ a
Jaguar XKR _ during the Superflo 12 Hours of Sebring on Saturday. A
Jaguar last raced in the series in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Former Indy-car regular Roberto Guerrero and his brother, Jaime,
have been signed by Dallas-based HRT (Hispanic Racing Team)
Motorsports to drive in the NASCAR Busch Grand National Series.
Roberto Guerrero will attempt to qualify the No. 72 HRT Chevrolet
for the Albertson's 300 at TMS on March 30. Last words ``I don't
comment on rule changes since Dale Earnhardt sent me a crying towel
at Charlotte four years ago. I'll never comment on that again.''

ANGELS HAVE NOWHERE TO GO BUT UP
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ In the spirit of the political season, no one
would blame Anaheim Angels president Tony Tavares for engaging in a
little spin-doctoring.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Tavares was refreshingly honest during a visit to the
Angels' spring training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are realistic enough to know our pitching is suspect,''
Tavares said. ``That's different then \Rlousy\S. I personally don't
think it's the worst in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Honest, and more or less accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' pitching indeed is suspect. And, as long as the
Detroit Tigers and Milwaukee Brewers are around, it's probably not
the worst in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It does, however, look like the worst in the American League
West, and it's the main reason why the Angels are a consensus
last-place pick in the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's picking us,'' Angels right fielder Tim Salmon said.
``Everybody looks at us as a team that isn't going to contend.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels didn't contend last season; they brought up the rear
in the West with a 70-92 record. And that was with a semblance of a
No. 1 pitcher in Chuck Finley, who was 12-11 with a 4.43 earned-run
average.
</P>
<P>
   Finley isn't around any more. He became a free agent and, when
the Angels didn't so much as make a courtesy offer, signed with the
Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   In his stead, Ken Hill moves to the head of the rotation. Hill
hasn't hit double figures in victories since 1996, when he won 16
for the Rangers. He landed on the disabled list twice last season,
and finished the season in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Hill showed evidence that he once again can become the quality
pitcher the Angels need him to be when he pitched three perfect
innings in an exhibition outing last week. But on Tuesday against
the Giants, he allowed four runs on seven hits in three innings.
</P>
<P>
   The scouts say that Ramon Ortiz, a 23-year-old right-hander with
481/3 innings worth of big-league experience, has the stuff of a
future No. 1. But he was scratched from a start Monday because of
tendinitis in his right biceps.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Belcher, who was 6-8 with a 6.73 ERA last season, is
supposed to be a key member of the rotation, but December surgery
to repair a muscle tear in his forearm is expected to keep him out
until May. At the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the rumors finally become reality and center fielder Jim
Edmonds is traded for a pitcher, the rest of the rotation will come
from a group that includes veteran knuckleballer Tom Candiotti,
Jason Dickson, who missed all of last season recovering from
shoulder surgery, non-roster invitee Kent Mercker, and youngsters
Jarrod Washburn, Brian Cooper and Scott Schoeneweis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope the young kids can step up and do their job,''
shortstop Gary DiSarcina said.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels aren't asking the rotation to be great, just pretty
good. That's because they expect the offense to be much better than
it '99, when it scored just 711 runs. Only the Minnesota Twins
(686) had fewer.
</P>
<P>
   Because of injuries Salmon played just 98 games, DiSarcina 81,
and Edmonds 55. Slugging first baseman Mo Vaughn missed the first
two weeks after hurting his ankle falling into the dugout on
Opening Day, an injury that bothered him most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had guys miss not weeks, but months,'' DiSarcina said.
``It's not an excuse, it's not an alibi, it's just fact. When you
have three or four starters missing for an extended period of time,
it's tough to overcome. I don't foresee something like that
happening again. It was kind of an aberration.''
</P>
<P>
   Healthy seasons from Vaughn, Salmon, Edmonds and DiSarcina could
close the gap between the Angels and the offensive juggernauts in
the division, particularly since the Rangers traded Juan Gonzalez
and the Seattle Mariners traded Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been a team that the offense has carried,''
Salmon said. ``We've always been able to swing the bats, and
contend that way. This year looks no different. If we have the
offense that we're supposed to have, we're going to score some
runs. We're going to provide some relief for our pitching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Angels expect to win, they'll have to.

MAVS' COACHING PARADE CONTINUES: HEARD JOINS STAFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ If this is the fourth day of the work week, then it
must be time for the Mavericks to hire their fourth assistant coach
this week.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the pattern for a team that realizes it's on
the verge of missing the playoffs for the 10th consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   After Gar Heard agreed yesterday to become a defensive assistant
and big men's coach, the Mavericks have an NBA-high 10 coaches on
their staff. Brad Davis was hired Tuesday as an assistant defensive
coordinator and guards coach, one day after Del Harris signed a
three-year contract to become the Mavericks' defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are \Rthe flood of assistants\S necessary?'' Mavericks coach
Don Nelson asked. ``I think they will be as we go through our
summer program, and as we get it sorted out, we'll start our
individual work with the players.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio's Sean Elliott may be the feel-good story in the NBA
this season. But with the entry and exit of Leon Smith, an
ownership change, the entry and exit of Dennis Rodman and a
double-digit coaching staff coming in less than one season, the
Mavericks have become one of the most curious franchises in the
NBA, maybe in league history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to the coaches and I asked them if giving them help
would help them do their jobs better, and they said yes,''
owner-to-be Mark Cuban said. ``So from there, who cares what
anybody says?
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to make everybody as successful as possible and give
them the tools they need to do their job the best way possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said former Mavericks guard Rolando Blackman also could be
added to the coaching staff before this season is over. Blackman is
still pondering a coaching offer from the Mavericks. Derek Harper,
meanwhile, turned down the job that Davis later accepted so he
could continue concentrating on being the team's vice president of
business affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ro and Derek will have jobs here for life,'' Cuban said.
``We'll work them in wherever we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said no one is auditioning for the head-coaching vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just play it by ear at the end of the year and see what
happens,'' Cuban said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was an assistant coach under Dick Motta from 1993-95, and
was being groomed by Motta to replace him as the Mavericks' head
coach. Then Motta was fired and replaced by Quinn Buckner.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who also will continue as a radio analyst on Mavericks
home games, said he was surprised he was added to the staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be nice just to work with the young guys again,'' Davis
said. ``I enjoy what I'm doing now with radio, and I'm sure I'll
enjoy what I'm doing with Del.''
</P>
<P>
   Heard was 9-44 as an interim coach with the Mavericks during the
latter stages of the 1992-93 season. In January, he was fired as
head coach of the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still want to stay in the game, so this gives me an
opportunity to stay in the game,'' Heard said. ``They have a lot of
coaches here, but I think what the owner wants to do is he wants to
try to improve this team anyway he thinks he possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every win we get a new coach,'' guard Michael Finley joked.
``If we win \Rtonight at San Antonio\S, then I guess we'll have
another coach for our game Saturday.'' \Nsubheds:Rodman a mistake?
Mark Cuban came close to admitting that signing Dennis Rodman last
month was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it plays out where we win the next 10 games against quality
opponents, then I'll be the first to admit that it was a mistake to
bring him in,'' Cuban said. ``You beat Phoenix and you beat Indiana
back-to-back, then you raise the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``In talking to everybody, we thought we could improve \Rby
signing Rodman\S, and we didn't.'' \Nsubheds:Supporting an old
friend Mavericks center Sean Rooks is happy to see the return of
San Antonio Spurs forward Sean Elliott less than seven months after
a kidney transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Rooks and Elliott played on the 1988-89 Arizona basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a high drive, and I knew he was going to try to come
back if he could, and I hope that he's healthy and I hope he does
well,'' Rooks said. ``I played with him, so I have nothing but love
for him.'' nn

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Rebuffing calls from prominent Republicans to
reach out to Sen. John McCain, Gov. George W. Bush insisted
Wednesday that he had no intention of making concessions to his
vanquished rival for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush passed up several opportunities to embrace McCain's remedy
for overhauling the campaign finance system, the senator's
signature issue. He said he had learned nothing new about reform
from McCain, although he conceded that his challenger forced him to
be a more spirited competitor. And he was sparing in his praise of
McCain, whose supporters his campaign is counting on to help him
win the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't change my views,'' Bush said in an hour-long
interview at the governor's mansion here on the day after he all
but officially clinched his party's nomination. Asked if McCain had
illuminated any new ideas for him or affected his positions, he
said, ``No, not really.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that McCain helped propel record turnouts in the
primaries, Bush responded curtly, ``Well, then, how come he didn't
win?'' He also noted that in South Carolina his candidacy helped
draw record numbers of Republicans to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments were notable because they suggested that despite
the bruising, bitter and sometimes humbling nature of his primary
campaign against McCain, the Texas governor had emerged from that
experience without any regrets about his campaign's conduct, any
second thoughts about his strategy or any new resolves for the way
he positions himself for the general election. His confidence, if
anything, seemed fortified.
</P>
<P>
   As with the overhaul of campaign finance reform, he did not cede
ground on any of his positions. The governor said, for example,
that he was not daunted by polls showing that his plan to cut taxes
by $483 billion over five years has not caught on with voters. The
proposal, he said, would be a pillar of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I make something really clear to you, once again,'' he
asked. ``I don't care what the polls say. I don't.'' Insisting
there was no reason to turn back, he explained, ``It's a well
thought out plan backed by numbers, backed by credible sources, and
it's something I'm going to stay with, you bet.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he was not deterred _ or haunted _ by the
memory that voters were never drawn to the ambitious tax cut
proposal of Bob Dole, the Republican nominee four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different because one, I started early, and two, there's
a different budget projection,'' he said, drawing a contrast with
the plan Dole put forth late into the campaign. ``There's a
different budget picture. I'm still going to have to fight the same
thing he fought, with an administration that's desperate to keep
the money in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Signs that the economy is getting a bit shakier, he said, are
``all the more reason to provide tax relief,'' explaining that his
plan would not only jolt the economy but provide an insurance
policy against any downturn.
</P>
<P>
   To persuade Americans to back his plan, ``I'm going to have to
battle,'' he said. ``I'm going to have to battle with a vice
president who'll say risky this, risky that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said that in the end, voters will be less moved by
whatever sniping occurs between him and Vice President Al Gore and
will make their decisions based on a few overarching
considerations. ``What's critical to my election is a lot of
things,'' he said. ``One, that people trust my judgment. Two, that
people hear the call for reform. Three, that people know that I can
renew what I call the spirit of America. Four, that people are
comfortable with the types of people that I'll bring into my
administration. Five, whether people are happy or not with the
status quo. I readily concede that if people want four more years
of Clinton-Gore, I've got a tough road. I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what my position is. I'm the outside, and I'm the
challenger. I'm coming from outside Washington, and I'm the
challenger candidate. People say, I hear them talking out of
Washington, well, he doesn't have enough experience. As if being
the governor of the second biggest state and having served as a CEO
in the private sector isn't experience. It's a Washington
mentality. And I'm going to have to battle it. I'm fully aware of
the odds I'm going to face.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aggressiveness toward Vice President Al Gore was the
latest reminder of how quickly the general election campaign had
become ferocious. The governor made no effort to mask his animosity
toward Gore.
</P>
<P>
   With little prompting at the start of the interview, Bush said
that his Democratic rival was not to be trusted. Scoffing at an
e-mail Gore had sent to him Tuesday night calling for something of
a disarmament on both sides' use of unregulated soft money, Bush
said: ``I don't trust the man. He has no credibility as far as I'm
concerned about campaign funding reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush repeated six times the fact that he did not trust Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Gore said in his e-mail that he had instructed the
Democratic National Committee not to spend a cent on soft money for
issue commercials against the Republicans unless the Republicans
did so first.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Christopher Lehane, Gore's spokesman, mocked Bush's
comment that the vice president will do anything to win the White
House. Lehane said: ``If nothing else, the Republican primary
proved one thing: George W. Bush will do anything to get elected,
included embracing extreme right positions on choice, gun control,
tolerance, the environment and, of course, the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But if Bush's combative tone toward Gore was not surprising, his
relatively complacent attitude about any remaining rift between him
and McCain was.
</P>
<P>
   It could simply be part of an effort to maintain a brave public
face while the campaign's emissaries privately reach out to McCain
and his representatives. Even so, one of the few times Bush said
something explicitly favorable about the senator was in the course
of condemning Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, Al Gore is no John McCain,'' Bush said. ``Please
don't lump John into that category. Secondly, I think John McCain
is a person that basically wanted to elevate the discourse and had
a reason for running, rather than tearing somebody down.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked, then, if Gore had a reason for running, Bush replied,
``I'm sure he's got a reason, but their style, as we've seen from
the last eight years, is to demean and degrade.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's reluctance to reach out more aggressively to McCain, at
least publicly, could be politically perilous for the governor.
McCain has captured enough delegates that he has the leverage to
embarrass Bush at the party's convention this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bush supporters on opposite ends of the Republican spectrum
_ from Senate Republican leader Trent Lott to Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani of New York _ have called for a rapprochement between the
two on reform issues.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he needed to make any concessions to McCain, Bush
said: ``No. I think what I need to do is explain to John that we
agree a lot more than we disagree. There's a lot of room for reform
in Washington, D.C.'' But in an interview last week, McCain said it
would be ``unacceptable'' if Bush thought they could unite simply
over their opposition to President Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was also unrepentant about the pointed attacks that his
campaign _ and supporters of his campaign _ had waged on the
Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was anything in particular, he said: ``Like what?
Give me an example. What should I regret?'' Pressed about the
negative tone of the campaign, he said, ``I didn't take the
negative tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was also unwilling to concede that his campaign had
squandered its record war chest of roughly $70 million to win the
primaries. He said he had ordered no changes in his organization
and was not worried about spending for the general election, when
each campaign will get roughly $67 million in federal subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush talked about how he manages his campaign and, by extension,
how he would function in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make suggestions on what to say all the time,'' he
said. ``I'll give you an example: I don't read what's handed to me.
People say, `Here, here's you're speech.' Or, `Here's an idea for a
speech.' They're changed. Trust me. Last night's a good example. We
could have been a lot harsher in tone on Vice President Gore last
night. I chose not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush came to President Clinton's defense in his confrontation
with the National Rifle Association, which had asserted that
Clinton was content with a certain prevalence of gun deaths so he
could keep gun control as an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way,'' he said, ``I didn't think the NRA was right to
characterize the president the way they did. I don't believe the
president is anxious to use death to advance an agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he criticize Clinton as failing to negotiate lasting
peace agreements in several regions, from the Middle East to
Northern Ireland to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for Americans and elected officials to be
patient with the peace process, to be diligent and patient,'' he
said. ``It's very important for the president not to impose a
United States solution on the peace process. So to the president's
credit, it seems to me on the Middle East he's working hard to
bring people together.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not yet time, he said, to turn over management of the
warring factions in the Balkans to the United Nations. ``I do think
it's time to begin to say to our European allies, `You're going to
have to be the peacekeepers,''' he said. ``I think it's going to be
very important for us to trim United States involvement around the
world from certain peacekeeping missions.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview closed as it began: With Bush's attention riveted
toward his general election opponent. How fierce a competitor would
Gore be?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about to find out,'' Bush said.

SECRET MEETINGS BETWEEN AUCTION HOUSE EXECUTIVES CITED IN LAWSUIT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   and CAROL VOGEL   c.2000 N.Y. Times News
Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The top executives of Sotheby's and Christie's, the
two archrival auction giants under federal antitrust investigation
for collusion, held secret discussions and meetings to fix prices,
and one maintained ``a highly unusual, concealed separate filing
system'' to hide the conspiracy from shareholders and government
regulators, a new complaint contended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, filed in a civil action on behalf of disgruntled
customers who say they were bilked by illegal anti-competitive
practices by Sotheby's and Christie's going back to at least 1993,
offered new details of how the houses were said to have conspired
to share the multibillion-dollar market in art and antiques.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the companies and its top executives have refused to
discuss the investigation or the multitude of lawsuits that have
been folded into a class-action lawsuit. Matthew Weigman, a
spokesman for Sotheby's, said late Wednesday night that the company
would not comment because ``our lawyers haven't seen the amended
complaint yet.'' A representative for Christie's did not respond to
messages.
</P>
<P>
   During the first half of 1995, the latest complaint said, after
the two companies had already fixed buyers' premiums, Alfred
Taubman, Sotheby's chairman and major shareholder, pursued a
similar illegal agreement on sellers' fees through secret meetings
with Sir Anthony Tennant, the chairman of Christie's, and its chief
executive, Christopher M. Davidge.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period, it went on, Sotheby's president, Diana D.
Brooks, met secretly in the New York area with an executive of
Christie's. The complaint did not say whether that was Davidge, but
people close to the investigation and lawsuits said that Davidge
had made trips from London to New York to meet with Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the complaint said, the two companies shared
``incriminating'' communications and Davidge ``had maintained and
retained the notes of such communications in a highly unusual,
concealed separate filing system that was wholly outside of
Christie's PLC's regular files and Davidge's' regular files.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, long considered the most influential woman in the
auction business, resigned from Sotheby's on Feb. 21 along with
Taubman, a Detroit shopping center mogul. Davidge's resignation
from Christie's was announced on New Year's Eve, and a month later
Christie's said it had turned over incriminating information to the
Justice Department and been accepted into a government amnesty
program.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan late
Wednesday by six lead lawyers representing auction customers
seeking monetary damages, was largely a restatement of earlier
claims. But it added the intriguing allegations of the secret
meetings and filing system to accounts that have tantalized the art
and auction community since allegations of collusion surfaced in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   That the two auction rivals, who each do about $2.3 billion
worth of business a year, shared some areas of collaboration was
long an open secret in the industry. For years, executives from
both companies met regularly to coordinate the dates of their
auctions so they would not conflict with each other.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Greene, the antitrust prosecutor who is heading the
investigation in New York, declined to say whether such meetings
fell within permissible boundaries, but he said it might depend on
what else, if anything, was discussed. Other antitrust specialists
said that even setting noncompeting dates for auctions seemed to
constitute restraint of trade, but that if it were done openly a
jury might conclude that it was done without guilty intent.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the antitrust investigation are two 1992 fee
increases by Sotheby's and Christie's. On Nov. 2, Sotheby's
announced that starting in January 1993, its buyer's premium in the
United States would rise from 10 percent of the purchase price to
15 percent for the first $50,000 and 10 percent for everything
above that.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 22, Christie's announced an identical increase.
Subsequently, both houses retained that same buyer fee structure.
</P>
<P>
   The identical rates gave buyers no choice, the lawsuits contend.
Moreover, the suit says, with the competition now shifting to the
sole remaining arena of sellers' fees, Christie's and Sotheby's
held collusive meetings to fix these amounts as well. In 1995,
Christie's changed its sellers' fees from a flat 10 percent
commission to a complex and nonnegotiable sliding scale from 2
percent to 20 percent. Weeks later, Sotheby's followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each company's revenues increased,'' the complaint stated.

RAIL BID'S NEXT STOP: WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY MARY JO PITZL  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lopsided victory of Phoenix's transit tax is one for the
record books _ and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sends a message to the (Arizona) congressional
delegation,'' said Steve Beard, deputy project director for Valley
Connections, a regional effort to build rail. ``Not only did we
win, we blew them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional support is important because Phoenix sold its
light-rail system with the promise that federal funds would help
build it.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix transit proponents said the federal government will pay
half of the $1.2 billion cost, but the Federal Transit
Administration says nothing is guaranteed. That's why congressional
support is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., went to bat for the Phoenix region last
spring when rail-planning money was in jeopardy. But Kyl's support
was grudging because Phoenix lacked matching dollars _ a crucial
component for securing the federal funds. With the transit tax now
providing that local match, transit boosters hope Arizona's
congressmen and senators will get on board.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 2000, which increases the city sales tax to 7.5
percent from 7.1 percent, should allow Phoenix to raise $2.9
billion over 20 years. That will pay for more bus routes, longer
operating hours and greater frequency. The first payoff will come
in August, when Phoenix will start Sunday bus service for the first
time in six decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm thrilled to death because we've been out
standing alone in our field,'' said Mary O'Connor,
transportation-planning administrator in Tempe. ``It's kind of nice
to have a big buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   The two cities already have coordinated service across city
boundaries, but Phoenix's pending expansion will multiply those
opportunities, O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tempe Mayor Neil Giuliano said the Phoenix victory
will move his city to a discussion of rail sooner than anticipated
_ perhaps as soon as next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tempe voters authorized a half-cent sales tax increase
for transit, a public referendum must be held before any of that
money is spent on rail.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday, Tempe was the only city with a transit tax. That
measure passed in 1996 with 52 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's 65 percent approval was among the most lopsided
transit victories ever, said Rose Sheridan of the American Public
Transit Association. Transportation measures passed with 67 percent
of the vote in St. Louis in 1994 and 66 percent in Denver last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliano predicted that the issue would pass easily. Tempe
voters have historically supported mass-transit issues.
</P>
<P>
   In Scottsdale, the Phoenix win is propelling a major-investment
study on a ``rapid-transportation corridor'' to a spring session of
the City Council, said Michelle Korf, the city's transportation
planning director.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale, with Tempe as a partner, will explore whether to
embark on a $750,000 study to create a north-south link to the
east-west rail line that was at the heart of Phoenix's rail
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of excitement out there now,'' Korf said.
</P>
<P>
   That excitement is not shared by all. Opponents predicted on
election night that people will come to regret the transit tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fasten your seat belt, fellow Phoenicians, it is going to be
one bumpy trolley ride,'' said Vivian Valle, a member of the
De-Rail the Tax Committee. &QL;

RECRUIT KEEPS USC ON HOLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Laguna Beach High guard Travis Hanour, who orally
committed to USC last month, has changed his mind and is trying to
decide between the Trojans and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really sure what to do yet,'' Hanour said. ``It's
pretty much a tossup. . . . I'm just taking it day-to-day. I don't
know. I really have no clue. I like them both.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanour, a 6-foot-6 guard capable of playing point guard,
shooting guard and small forward, made his official campus visit to
Arizona last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked it, but I'm waiting to mellow out now,'' Hanour said.
``After I visited USC, I was really excited, too, then I mellowed
out after a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanour plans to visit Utah on March 23, but the Utes are his No.
3 choice.
</P>
<P>
   After averaging 21.7 points, 9.4 rebounds and 5.4 assists,
Hanour is considered USC's No. 1 recruit for the spring signing
period. He committed during his visit on Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Hanour re-evaluated his decision was USC's
recruitment of 6-6 swingman Zelimir Stevanovic of Gulf Coast
Community College in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Hanour, who said he would prefer to be the only guard USC signs
in the spring, has no timetable for making his final decision.

EARLY VOTES GOOD, BUT DELAY THE RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY BETTY BEARD AND CAROL SOWERS  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the first election of the new millennium. We're wired.
We're digitized. And yet we can't find out for days who won an
election. What gives?
</P>
<P>
   The culprit holding up the Mesa mayor's race and a handful of
other races across the Phoenix area is early balloting, the latest
rage in voting.
</P>
<P>
   You can't beat a system that lets you fill out long ballots at
your kitchen table instead of the voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   But the downside is that it's become impossible anymore to get
the results of close races on election night.
</P>
<P>
   That's because many of the ballots are turned in right up until
the time the polls close on Election Day, piling up faster than
elections workers can verify and count them.
</P>
<P>
   The votes cast in the ballot box end up getting counted first,
before those that in some cases were filled out weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Voters and candidates in six communities that had Tuesday
elections will have to wait until Friday to find out who won, as
the county Elections Department on Wednesday still had almost
10,000 ballots to count.
</P>
<P>
   But in city after city, election workers learned just how
popular early ballots have become.
</P>
<P>
   In Mesa, for example, 8,000 turned in early ballots in the 1998
election. But in this year's election, that number jumped to
13,731, plus an additional 4,657 still to be counted. That could be
enough to swing the mayor's race, where Keno Hawker leads Pat
Gilbert by 1,600 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale had a record 66 percent of the 30,496 ballots cast
early, with 1,100 uncounted. But they're unlikely to alter the
results.
</P>
<P>
   In Paradise Valley, where all seven council seats are undecided,
nearly a third of the 2,600 votes cast in the town's first all-mail
election were early ballots dropped off Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new phenomenon for the county,'' Scottsdale spokesman
Mike Phillips said. ``There were big stacks of ballots at the
polling places. People were coming in and just dropping off their
early ballots.''
</P>
<P>
   Fountain Hills has three council seats undecided, and Town Clerk
Cassie Hansen said, ``That's what elections are all about. The
anxiety. The anticipation. The waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayoral elections in Litchfield Park and Guadalupe and council
races in Glendale and El Mirage were also held up.
</P>
<P>
   But although many people were surprised to see how early ballots
can delay final results, elections workers said they've been
counting early ballots after election night for years.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the recent Republican presidential primary election,
workers were left with 12,000 ballots to verify and count
afterward. But because Sen. John McCain was the overwhelming
winner, the late ballots really didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   What made the first election of 2000 unusual was that there were
so many close races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen that before that I can recall,'' said Yvonne
Reed of the county Elections Department. ``We were all a little bit
surprised. But this too shall pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for her to say. Of course, the waiting is not so simple for
the dangling candidates. Perhaps the closest race was the recall
election for Guadalupe Mayor Frances Osuna, who was just four votes
behind her opponent, with 147 ballots to be counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so sorry for those people who don't know,'' said Mary
Rose Evans, city clerk in Litchfield Park, which experimented for
the first time this year with an all-mail election.
</P>
<P>
   She said Tuesday's 62 percent was a record turnout even though
224 uncounted ballots could force a runoff or topple either
candidate in a close race for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The county Elections Department legally can take up to five days
to verify, count and report the results.
</P>
<P>
   Workers have to verify signatures and make sure people don't
vote twice, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Although early ballots leave close races in the air, elections
officials endorse them because they get more people to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they get more people involved in the political process,
delays are no big deal,'' said Peter Mahoney, a successful
Litchfield Park council candidate. &QL;

SOFTWARE MILLIONAIRE PLANS TO FOUND FREE ONLINE UNIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (subs 7th graf to change `Buffet' to `Buffett'; subs 2nd from last
graf to change `nearly $300' to `$268.625')

<P>
   A 35-year-old software billionaire said Wednesday that he would
spend $100 million to realize his vision of 21st century higher
education: a giant free Web site that would provide access to what
he calls the ``10,000 greatest minds of our time,'' in lectures and
interviews recorded especially for the venture.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Saylor, the chief executive of Microstrategy, a
technology company in northern Virginia, said in an interview that
his goal was ``free education for everyone on earth, forever.'' And
he envisions his institution eventually granting degrees in
countless disciplines, based on final exams that would be
administered once a month in convention halls around the world,
with grading done by computer whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   Saylor is an unabashed self-promoter who rented the Washington
Redskins' stadium in January for a Super Bowl party for his
employees and friends. However, he is worth enough money on paper _
$11.7 billion at the close of stock trading Wednesday _ to make it
difficult to immediately dismiss his idea, however grandiose.
</P>
<P>
   Saylor's donation, which he intends to make in the form of cash
and stock to his foundation, comes at a time when almost every
American university is developing online offerings of its courses _
each one chipping away at the notion that a university must have
bricks and mortar and a physically present student body to be
effective.
</P>
<P>
   But with students at Saylor U. _ he actually hasn't come up with
a formal name, but says it will have ``dot-com'' in it _ requiring
nothing more than a computer to enroll, his effort would take
online education a step further, undermining a university's very
franchise in charging admission for access to knowledge and
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Saylor's spending plans would rank near the top of other online
efforts. A group of investors, including Michael Milken, the
dethroned junk-bond financier, says it will spend as much as $100
million to start an online, for-profit university called Unext,
which would feature course content from professors at the
University of Chicago and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   At his online university, Saylor imagines Bill Clinton teaching
politics, Warren Buffett lecturing on investing and Steven
Spielberg demonstrating filmmaking _ all in 30-hour video packages,
with questions anticipated, and answered, in advance. So far, he
hasn't recruited a single instructor, but he doesn't intend to pay
them a dime. He says they will be drawn to his television studio by
the opportunity to make their thoughts available to the world for
eternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a work in progress,'' a spokesman said Wednesday. ``It's
impossible to say in certitude what the details are.''
</P>
<P>
   Saylor, whose plan was first described in an article in
Wednesday's Washington Post, intends to announce his effort
formally at a business conference Thursday in Washington, D.C. But
his scheme was already reverberating through the halls of higher
education Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Ikenberry, the former president of the University of
Illinois, said he applauded Saylor's idealism but was concerned
that the lectures at Saylor's university would be, in effect,
canned.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe that higher education is simply content
mastery, then you can put that in a can,'' said Ikenberry, the
president of the American Council on Education, a non-profit
organization representing 1,800 colleges and universities. ``But
higher education is so much more than that. It involves judgment,
analysis, synthesis, communication, creativity and innovation,
which are the things that human beings do best.''
</P>
<P>
   Saylor embarked on his road to wealth while working at Dupont
soon after his graduation from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in the late 1980s. It was then that he and several
fraternity brothers started Microstrategy, a company that, before
long, had created software that McDonald's, Victoria's Secret and
K-Mart, among others, were using to tabulate detailed analyses of
sales and inventory.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sales last year were $200 million and, in a
decade, it has grown from four employees to nearly 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Saylor imagines that his company's future lies in a world where
the Jetsons would feel at home: personally-tailored information _
such as a disembodied voice reporting that a doctor's appointment
or flight has been canceled _ that would be broadcast directly to
people through their car radios and cellular phones, which would
then offer them an instant opportunity to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, at least, thinks it's hardly science fiction:
Microstrategy's stock has rocketed from $7 a share to $268.625 &UR;  &LR; in
the span of less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his announcement was intended to draw as much attention
to himself as to his intentions, Saylor said he didn't think the
question was relevant, suggesting that Michelangelo's greatness was
not compromised because he signed his paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great way to combine self-interest and charitable
humanitarian activities,'' he said. ``Everyone wins.''

FINDINGS OF WEST NILE VIRUS IN MOSQUITOES AND A DEAD HAWK SPUR
CONCERN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reports of West Nile virus in dormant mosquitoes living
underground in Queens, N.Y., and of a red-tailed hawk toppling out
of a tree in Westchester County, dead from the infection, have
energized plans by health and wildlife officials to ward off any
renewed threat to people this spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference on mosquito control in Atlantic City, N.J., on
Wednesday, federal health officials said it was imperative to act
in the last days of winter to prevent an outbreak in humans as the
weather warms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The virus is clearly still here, and there's a good chance
that it will amplify this coming summer, and we need to be prepared
for that,'' said Nicholas Komar, a vertebrate ecologist with the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquito-borne virus can cause deadly brain swelling in a
small number of infected people. It is endemic in Africa, the
Middle East and western Asia and has periodically emerged in
Europe, but the outbreak that killed seven people in the New York
City area last summer was its first appearance ever in the Western
Hemisphere, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with spring approaching, officials are trying to address
the health risks without inflaming fears about what remains a
relatively rare disease. Officials encouraged residents to remove
containers holding water from rooftops and yards and to dispose of
old tires.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, they are focusing on eliminating mosquito
larvae on the ground now to avoid aerial spraying of insecticides
later, which generated almost as much fear last year as did the
disease itself.
</P>
<P>
   Hints that the virus remained a threat emerged last week, when
federal health officials reported finding genetic clues that it was
present in a small sample of dormant mosquitoes that were living in
underground rooms at Fort Totten in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Also this week came news of the infected hawk, which fell from a
tree in Bronxville, in southern Westchester, around Feb. 6. Two
laboratories in Connecticut identified the cause of death as West
Nile virus, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   The dead hawk is the first bird found to be infected with the
virus anywhere in the country since Nov. 5, said Herbert J. Van
Kruiningen, the director of the Northeastern Research Center for
Wildlife Diseases at the University of Connecticut at Storrs, one
of the laboratories that tested the bird's body.
</P>
<P>
   News of the infected hawk reverberated on the Internet and
around the conference in Atlantic City. Scientists wondered how a
hawk could have become infected during the winter with a virus that
is only known to be transmitted by mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   It was highly unlikely that the hawk had been freshly infected
by a midwinter mosquito bite, many scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities were that it had been bitten by an infected
mosquito last year and lived with the virus for several months;
that it had flown in from a warmer place carrying the virus; or
that it had acquired the infection by eating an animal that carried
it.
</P>
<P>
   So far, eating an infected animal has never been seen as a route
of infection, according to the federal health officials.

ONCE AGAIN, PATAKI DEFIES EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Once again, Gov. George Pataki has demonstrated
his knack for defying expectations and, with little warning,
jumping far ahead of other politicians, particularly his fellow
Republicans, on a hot issue.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki on Wednesday proposed perhaps the widest-ranging gun
controls in the country, a subject in which he had previously shown
little interest. Over the last nine months, he has proposed a
campaign finance reform package, imposed the nation's strictest air
pollution limits on old power plants and signed into law a major
new health care program for the poor, financed by a large increase
in the cigarette tax.
</P>
<P>
   Common to each step was that it was opposed by many leaders of
his own party and embraced by Democrats, and that it caught nearly
everyone off guard. Even after five years in office, Pataki, who
arrived as a law-and-order tax-cutter railing against the state's
entrenched liberalism, remains hard to pin down, a governor largely
unencumbered by ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Given Pataki's interest in national office, perhaps as a running
mate for George W. Bush, he touched off speculation about what his
latest bombshell meant to those ambitions. One school of thought
says he has given up on this year's vice presidential bid and is
aiming to tighten his hold on New York's political center,
intending to run for a third term in 2002. Another school says that
the more liberal Pataki appears, the more attractive he becomes to
Bush as a ticket-balancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not it's politically popular or unpopular, you do
what you think is right,'' Pataki said Wednesday, when asked about
such talk. He said gun control was a natural outgrowth of his
efforts to fight crime.
</P>
<P>
   But a few points are beyond question. Championing gun control _
like his other major initiatives of the last year _ will make
Pataki more popular in New York, a state that still leans leftward.
And this latest move will go a long way toward undoing the damage
done to his image by the state's recent presidential primary
campaign, when he tried to keep Sen. John McCain off the ballot,
only to have a court rule in favor of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's newest proposal adds to the wide gap between some of
the nation's Republican governors and the much more conservative
Republican leadership in Congress, on everything from gun controls,
which they have resisted, to tobacco to health care.
</P>
<P>
   But highly publicized shootings, especially in schools, have
raised the volume on calls for new controls. Republican governors
like Bill Owen of Colorado, Michael O. Leavitt of Utah and Bob Taft
of Ohio have proposed gun measures, and others, like Christie
Whitman of New Jersey and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, have signed
them into law. Leavitt and Owen, frustrated by their state's
Legislatures, are supporting gun-control ballot initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past couple of years, some of our strongest allies
have been Republican governors,'' said Joe Sudbay, political
director of Handgun Control Inc., a lobbying group in Washington.
``There's been a real turnaround on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bush, the governor of Texas and the apparent Republican
presidential nominee, whom the National Rifle Association has
called one of its best friends, praised Pataki's gun plan in
general terms Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki will get most of what he wants here, if not all. The
Democrats who control the state Assembly embraced his package, most
of which they have passed before.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled state Senate has resisted gun measures
in the past. But Wednesday, Joseph L. Bruno, the majority leader,
said his house was amenable to much of what the governor proposed,
and acknowledged the change was due to events like the Columbine
High School shooting in Colorado last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, when you see some atrocity out there, some tragedy,
whatever it is, we collect ourselves and say, `Is there something
that we can do to prevent that from happening in the future?''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Republicans said the issue still deeply divided those
in rural areas, who oppose gun controls, from those in the cities
and suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said the Senate was prepared to ban assault weapons and
require that trigger locks be included in all gun sales, as Pataki
proposed. As for raising the minimum age for gun ownership from 18
to 21, he said, ``We're open to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The most innovative element of Pataki's plan would require that
before a new gun was sold in New York, it would have to be test
fired so that the unique pattern of marks it leaves on a bullet and
shell casing could be recorded and entered into a state database,
making guns used in crimes easier to trace. Bruno did not rule it
out, but questioned whether the so-called ballistic fingerprinting
was technologically feasible, though police agencies say it is.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno seemed equally concerned about being snubbed by the
governor, with whom he is feuding. Pataki did not notify the Senate
leader before making his proposals in an interview on ABC on
Tuesday night, but he did warn the leaders of the Assembly. Bruno
said derisively that it was hard to gauge the governor's plan
because there was no bill yet, and dismissed Pataki's talk of gun
control as hype.
</P>
<P>
   The governor proposed requiring background checks for gun sales
at gun shows and flea markets, and closing a loophole in the
federal law that requires background checks on sales in stores.
Sudbay said that 16 states have similar laws.
</P>
<P>
   Ten states, he said, set the minimum age at 21. Only five _
California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania
_ require trigger locks with gun sales. Just four _ the same list,
minus Pennsylvania _ ban assault weapons. (Federal law has banned
most assault weapons since 1994, but gun control advocates say
state laws are needed so that local police and state prosecutors
can enforce the ban.)
</P>
<P>
   No state requires ballistic fingerprinting, ``and the only state
that's even considering it is Maryland,'' Sudbay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these proposals are, in fact, substantive,'' he said,
``then this would put Governor Pataki in the forefront of governors
pushing common-sense gun safety agendas.''

NETS' WILLIAMS   BREAKS A BONE   IN LEFT FOOT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Only days after returning from a
right-leg injury that threatened to end his career, Jayson Williams
suffered the unthinkable Wednesday: a season-ending injury to his
left foot.
</P>
<P>
   While attempting a jump shot, Williams landed awkwardly on the
foot of Evan Eschmeyer, breaking the fifth metatarsal of his left
foot and ending his hopes of making a comeback this season.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Russell Warren, who performed surgery on Williams' broken
right leg last April, and Dr. Mike Kelly, the Nets' team doctor,
are at an orthopedic conference in Florida. When they return in a
few days they will determine whether Williams must undergo surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who had worked arduously to recover from a severely
broken right leg, left the Champion Center practice facility for
the hospital without making a comment. Coach Don Casey, who saw
Williams after the diagnosis was made, described his player's
disposition as understandably ``terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to improve Williams' mood, Casey said he would try
to assure that Williams attends all home and away games. ``He
worked so hard to be there, and the guys on the team were looking
forward to him being around, so at this juncture we need him
spiritually,'' Casey said.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a week ago that Williams, 32, was cleared to compete
in full-contact practices. After a series of tests, his right leg,
had been declared 80 percent as strong as his left, and he
exuberantly took the practice floor with his teammates last
Thursday. Williams, who also practiced last Saturday, had
experienced swelling and soreness after both practices, but he was
aiming to play in Saturday's home game against the Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked real powerful, extremely powerful,'' Stephon Marbury
said before the extent of Williams' injury became known. ``He shot
the ball well. For a guy who hasn't played for a year, he played
unbelievable. That's the God-honest truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has previously broken the fifth metatarsal bone in both
of his feet. As a senior at St. John's (1989-1990), he played in
only 13 games because of the injury. Since then, Williams has
played through and recovered from numerous injuries, earning a
reputation as one of the league's toughest players.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, before breaking his leg in a freak collision with
Marbury in a game against the Atlanta Hawks, Williams played with
an injured left thumb that later required surgery, and an injured
shoulder. His broken right leg, however, was by far the worst
injury of his career. There was doubt if he would ever play again.
</P>
<P>
   On April 2, Williams underwent nearly five hours of surgery in
which Warren inserted five screws and a plate to repair a displaced
tibial-plateau fracture and partly torn meniscus. Williams and the
Nets immediately predicted a return by this season's October
training camp, but the charismatic center was not ready to play by
then.
</P>
<P>
   During the first week of January, the strength in his right leg
was measured at only 28 percent of that of his left leg, far below
the 80 percent figure required for him to be cleared to practice.
Williams changed his workout regimen by doing less sprinting and
more power training and within seven weeks, his strength was at 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   When he was cleared to play last Wednesday, Williams, who signed
a six-year, $90.75 million contract before last season, was
ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be back and to earn my money,'' he said with a
wide grin. ``And it's exciting because I really don't know how I'm
going to play. I'm waiting to see. It's like playing poker.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey said Williams at least proved that his right leg could
undergo the strain of live competition, which means that he should
be able to play at the beginning of next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a bad situation, that's one plus,'' Casey said. &QL;

U.S. WARRANT   SEEKS RAPIST   SET FREE   ON NO NOTICE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Fla., Ariz.)   By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ A federal warrant was issued Wednesday for
the arrest of the 57-year-old rapist who was freed from a New
Jersey prison last week because of an apparent administrative
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant formally brought the Federal Bureau of Investigation
into the nationwide search for the man, Raymond Alves, and
underscored anxieties among both state and federal law enforcement
officials that Alves is a danger to the public, especially to
women.
</P>
<P>
   As the manhunt broadened, criticism of Alves' release mounted
here and in Trenton. The Bergen County prosecutor, William H.
Schmidt, and his special investigations chief, Ike Gavzy, contended
that the prison psychologist's report that cleared the way for the
release on March 9 contained factual errors about both Alves'
criminal past and his prison record.
</P>
<P>
   The report, they said, mentioned that Alves had only one victim,
when, in fact, he had kidnapped and raped a 16-year-old girl and
threw another teen-age girl off a 40-foot-high railroad bridge in
1976. In addition, they said, the report omitted 15 of the 22 years
he had served in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt would not comment on a report in The Star-Ledger that
Bergen County detectives had long suspected Alves of killing six
women between 1966 and 1970: three teenage co-workers, a
19-year-old friend and a 20-year-old neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt spoke out this week about the prison system's failure to
provide him 30 days' advance notice about Alves' release, as
required by law. His office received a letter about the release
last Friday, a day after Alves was freed.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said the lack of notification prevented him from filing
a motion to detain Alves so the prosecutor's staff could ask a
state judge to declare Alves a violent sexual predator and commit
him under civil law to an institution for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The federal warrant, sought by the U.S. attorney for New Jersey,
Robert Cleary, and signed in Newark by a federal magistrate,
Stanley R. Chesler, made Alves a federal fugitive, charged with
interstate travel to avoid prosecution. An affidavit accompanying
the FBI's request for the warrant said Alves had told people in the
Southern State Correctional Facility in Delmont, N.J., before he
was freed that he planned to go to either Florida or Arizona and
obtain a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Alves had finished serving a 7-year term for
a parole violation in 1992, after he had been released after
serving 15 years of a 47-year term for the attacks on two
teen-agers in 1976.

__  
Backcourt: Ball State has the tough, experienced guards necessary
for first-round upsets. Mickey Hosier, 5-11, isn't much of a scorer
(5.8 ppg), but his assist-to-turnover ratio is better than 2 to 1.
Duane Clemens, 6-0, is quick and crafty, capable of scoring 30
points and making game-winning shots in the stretch.

<P>
   If Earl Watson performs with the poise and judgment he showed
against Stanford (13 assists, four turnovers), the Bruins will be
difficult to beat. His partner will be one of three players: Ryan
Bailey (ballhandling), Ray Young (defense) or JaRon Rush (scoring
and rebounding). __ Edge: Even. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Frontcourt: Both teams start a freshman and two sophomores.
Ball State rookie Theron Smith, 6-8, is its No. 1 rebounder (7.7
rpg) and No. 2 scorer (12.4 ppg). He has Big Ten talent. Sophomore
Josh Murray, 6-7, is a tough role player. Center Lonnie Jones,
6-11, is a defensive intimidator with the size and athleticism to
match UCLA's Dan Gadzuric.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins need freshman Jason Kapono to shoot well to extend the
defense. Will Jerome Moiso match Ball State's toughness? Or will he
recoil from contact and disappear? Gadzuric's confidence has been
soaring since the Cal game, but he must avoid foul trouble. __
Edge: UCLA. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Bench: Ball State relies heavily on two reserves; both are
small guards. Sophomore Patrick Jackson, 5-11, and junior Cedric
Moodie, 6-1, combine for 17.5 points and are excellent 3-point
shooters. No reserve over 6-2 averages more than two points a game.
</P>
<P>
   This is UCLA's greatest advantage. It has Sean Farnham and Matt
Barnes for size, Young and Rico Hines for defense, and Billy Knight
for shooting. If Rush doesn't start, he'll play before the first
timeout. __ Edge: Big to UCLA. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Intangibles: Mid-American Conference teams have won
first-round games in four of the last five years. UCLA has lost
three of its last four first-round games when seeded lower than No.
2 (ie, when it doesn't play a patsy). This year, the Bruins are No.
6. __ Edge: Ball State. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Coaching: This is the second tournament appearance for Ray
McCallum, who is the second-winningest coach in Ball State history.
</P>
<P>
   This is a critical game for UCLA's staff, which has made all the
right moves in recent weeks. The Bruins have been poorly prepared
and poorly motivated in first-round games against Miami and Detroit
Mercy. Have Steve Lavin and his lieutenants learned from past
mistakes? __ Edge: Even. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Outcome: Two factors will decide the game: Ball State does
not play the grinding, straittjacket style that caused UCLA such
trouble against Miami and Detroit Mercy. Ball State will shoot
quick and let UCLA run. Also, the Bruins are executing better than
they have in three years; add selflessness and multiple scoring
options and they are a dangerous team. __ Edge: UCLA, by 8-10
points.
