<HEADLINE> Graf Stopped by Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Rain stopped the action of Steffi
Graf after just 17 minutes on the Wimbledon centre-court here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The German champion, who is bidding for a seventh Wimbledon
singles title, raced a 5-1 lead in the opening set of her
fourth-round match against 15 year old Martina Hingis of
Switzerland, but a steady drizzle force to competition to stop.
</P>
<P>
She played with her suspect left knee taped. Graf nearly
withdrew on the eve of the Championships after straining her
knee in an exhibition event in Prague.
</P>
<P>
Graf's injury complaints have led to nine-times champion
Martina Navratilova claiming that they are just a smokescreen.
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, commentating on the Championships for the American
HBO network, has said of Graf's knee strain: "The knee injury is
just an excuse ahead of time in case she needs it. If you read
the newspapers you'd think she belongs in hospital. But if you
look at her on court she is running like a gazelle."
</P>
<P>
The former champion's relationship with Graf soured 12 months
ago when Graf pulled out of a women's doubles line-up with
Navratilova to protect a back injury.

Speaking to newsmen here this afternoon, however, BNP

some burning national issues.
</P>
<P>
"Sure, we can reach consensus on some major issues. But we can
not think of a government of consensus under the existing
constitution and multi-party parliamentary system," she said,
making it very clear that the BNP would not join the government of
consensus described by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the prime minister called on the BNP to join her
government of national consensus. "I call upon the BNP to join
this government of national consensus if it wants to do so. We do
not want to monopolize everything like the past government," she
explained.
</P>
<P>
But Khaleda said that "in a parliamentary democracy there has
to be an opposition political party and the BNP would play its
positive, pragmatic and new role in the opposition bench of the
parliament."

<P>
NEW YORK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- One suspected drug dealer was
killed and another seriously wounded Saturday night in a major
police offensive against the drug gang, the New York Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the offensive, the first ever since the beginning of this
year, a task force of New York city and state police officers and
members of the Drug Enforcement Administration stormed into the
city-owned Bronx Terminal Market which has been used as a drug
distribution center and where gangs and dealers have been
operating for years.
</P>
<P>
During a chase that raged along 20 blocks in the South Bronx,
seven of the gangmen surrendered peacefully while two men fired at
the police through the windows of their car. After a furious
gunfight in which officers fired as many as 30 rounds, one man lay
dead and another was struck several times and later listed in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Administration said
Sunday that its investigators had been monitoring the gang's
action for about two months. "It's a very violent gang known for
the use of weapons and intimidation tactics," she added.

SHANGHAI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Yongle Film and TV
Movie (Group) Corp. was established here today, pumping
competition into the movie industry in China's largest city.
</P>
<P>
Ye Zhikang, director of the Shanghai Film and TV Movie
Administration Bureau, said that the Yongle Corp. has broken the
monopoly in the city's movie industry held by the Shanghai Film
Studio.
</P>

Shanghai is considered the cradle of China's modern film-making
industry. China's first film was shot here in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
The city had many film studios until the mid-1960s, when
independent film producers were integrated into the Shanghai Film
Studio. It monopolized local film-making from that point.
</P>
<P>
Yongle Corp, with a registered capital of 100 million yuan, is
the second film studio in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Yongle's members include the Yongle Stock-holding Co,. Ltd, the
Shanghai Donghai Film and TV Production Base, and the Shanghai TV
Play Production Center.
</P>
<P>
The company currently is shooting a film and some TV movies.

<HEADLINE> US Economic Expansion to Cool Down in 2nd Half of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. economic expansion will
cool down in the second half of 1996 but low unemployment and
strong business spending will keep the moderate growth into next
year, according to a semiannual survey by The Wall Street
Journal.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported today that the consensus of 58 economists
participating in the survey showed a 4 percent or better annual
economic growth rate was seen in the just-ended second quarter.
</P>
<P>
But it will not be repeated in the third quarter and economists
predicted that the growth rate in the July-September quarter will
be closer to the first quarter when the economy grew at an annual
rate of 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the expected fall-off reflects a delayed
reaction to this year's climb in long-term interest rates and the
prospect of higher rates to come.
</P>
<P>
On the short-term interest rates, many economists said that the
U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) will push interest rates slightly
higher in the second half, possibly in the fall, although the Fed
is unlikely to do it this week.
</P>
<P>
The survey predicted that the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP)
adjusted for inflation will grow at an annual rate of 2.19 percent
in the second half if the Fed raises the short-term rates a
little.
</P>
<P>
The economists believe that the inflation rate in the country
will remain at 3 percent or below for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
Importantly, the economists see only a 14 percent chance of a
recession starting this year and a 29 percent likelihood it will
occur by mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that the low unemployment, rising export sales
and strong business spending will keep the U.S. economy increasing
at a moderate rate into next year.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Expected to Attract 4 Million Tourists in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Over 4 million tourists are expected
to visit Egypt this year, an increase of over 30 percent over last
year, Egyptian Tourism Minister Mamdouh el-Beltagui said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette, Egypt's only English-language daily,
quoted Beltagui as saying that the government has allocated 42
million Egyptian pounds (12.35 million U.S. dollars) this year to
promote the tourism industry, the country's second largest source
of foreign currency income just behind overseas remittances.
</P>
<P>
Egypt aims to attract 6 million tourists annually by the year
2000, the minister said, adding that Egypt is now implementing 389
projects in an effort to increase hotel rooms from the current
67,000 to 176,000.
</P>
<P>
Beltagui, who stressed the role of the private sector in the
development of tourism, called for more arts, cultural and sport
events to attract more tourists, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's tourism, which had suffered a slump since 1992 largely
because of a violent campaign launched by Islamic fundamentalist
militants against the government, greatly recovered last year and
is continuing to pick up this year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the industry earned the country about 2.7 billion
U.S. dollars with over 3 million tourists coming to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is especially famous for its archeological monuments left
over from the Pharaonic era, religious sites, the mild weather in
winter and unpolluted sand beaches along the Red Sea coast.

HANGZHOU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Army troops and several local
people have been busy fighting floods caused by torrential rains
that hit the northern part of east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
During the 24-hour period from 2 a.m. June 30 to 2 a.m. July 1,
the average rainfall around Tianmu mountain approached 200
millimeters, and rainfall recorded by 13 monitoring stations
across the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou plain exceeded 200 millimeters.

According to reports, 100,000 hectares of farmland in Hangzhou
and Huzhou were inundated by the floods.

<HEADLINE> Bildt's Office Demands Action Against Karadzic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Western countries were today urged
to take action against the Bosnian Serbs unless their leader
Radovan Karadzic effectively relinquishes his power.
</P>
<P>
A senior official in Bosnian peace co-ordinator Carl Bildt's
office said sanctions would be one possible course of action
against the Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Bildt announced on Sunday that he had a letter of resignation
from Karadzic, who has been under mounting international pressure
to step down as self-styled president of Republika Sprska, the
Serb entity in Bosnia, and that he would relinquish all power to
his deputy Biljana Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
However, Plavsic later contradicted Bildt, saying that Karadzic
would remain president until the Bosnian elections scheduled for
September 14 and that his replacement as president would only take
place in "free elections."
</P>
<P>
Bildt has come in for criticism over his announcement of
Karadzic's resignation. Some Western powers are unhappy about the
validity of the document Bildt presented as evidence of the
leader's resignation following Plavsic's statements.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic has been indicted for war crimes committed during the
three and a half year war in Bosnia and is required under the
Dayton peace agreement which ended the war to give up public
office and surrender to the U.N. warcrimes tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
Last week's G-7 meeting of the world's most industrialized
nations in Lyon, France, threatened to reimpose sanctions against
Bosnian Serbs if Karadzic refused to step down.

the force and when it would be in place, he said Major-General
Paradzai Zimonte had already been appointed chief of staff of the
reserve force.
</P>
<P>
Zimonte and his team were working on the command, control,
administration and conditions of service of such a force before
coming up with a policy governing its operation.
</P>
<P>
''When they have completed their findings, they will submit
them to the commander of the defence forces who will then submit
them to the minister of defence, who will then issue an official
announcement on the establishment of a reserve force,'' said
Mugoba.
</P>
<P>
While the army was reducing its size from over 50,000 to
40,000, he said the exercise was also part of the re-organisation
of the defence forces. enditem

<HEADLINE> Hubei, Leading Arena for Hong Kong's Investment in China Inland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Convenient transportation and an
improved investment environment have qualified central China's
Hubei Province as a leading arena for investment from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The reciprocal cooperation between Hong Kong and Hubei is
expected to not only help businessmen from Hong Kong earn higher
economic returns, but also guide them to invest in the country's
central-west areas, said Jiang Zhuping, governor of the province.
</P>
<P>
One of the largest financial, trade and information centers in
southeast Asia, Hong Kong has many incomparable advantages in
finance, trade, tourism, transportation and information.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan, the largest central city, traffic hub and communication
center in China's inland, and the capital of the province, has a
fine investment environment, advanced science and technology, and
rich but cheap labor forces.
</P>
<P>
A ideal spot for Hong Kong's investors, Wuhan is expected to
join Hong Kong and Shanghai to form a golden economic triangle in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth along the Yangtze River valley, the ongoing
water-control project in the Yangtze River, and the country's
policy to shift its investment focus from coastal to
central-western areas have turned Hubei into a hot investment spot
in China's inland.
</P>
<P>
One of the country's leading industrial and agricultural
production bases, Hubei Province intends to provide more
high-quality farm and side-line produce to Hong Kong, and also to
strengthen cooperation with Hong Kong to develop entrepot trade.
</P>
<P>
The province is expected to export five billion US
dollars-worth of goods by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
It now has more than 60 universities and colleges, and some
1,000 research institutes, as well as the nation's second largest
hi-tech development zone, second only to Zhongguancun, "China's
silicon valley," in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996-2000 period, Hubei plans to use nine billion US
dollars of overseas investment to improve local infrastructure
construction and export-oriented enterprises, and to upgrade
technology of local outmoded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the province's largest trade partner. The trade
between Hong Kong and Hubei accounted for 40 percent of the
province's total 3.7 billion US dollars of foreign trade in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The province mainly exports textile, garments and black metals,
as well as fresh foodstuff to Hong Kong, with the number of live
pigs transported to Hong Kong reaching 300,000. And the province
imports complete sets of equipment, raw material for chemical
industry, and iron and steel from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
More than two-thirds of overseas investment in the province
comes from Hong Kong, making Hong-Kong-funded enterprises in Hubei
account for two-thirds of the local total foreign-funded
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation between Hong Kong and Hubei is expected to help
enliven the province's economy and contribute to stability and
prosperity in Hong Kong, said Jiang Zhuping.
</P>
<P>
During the next five years, Hubei Province will give priority
to cooperation with Hong Kong to invigorate the economy in both
areas.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Take Measures to Cope with Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government decided
today to set up a special committee to look into problems facing
the island's tourism industry, such as competitiveness and high
costs.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken during a meeting of a ministerial
committee set up by the Council of Ministers to study the issue
and submit a report on ways of handling the problems.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, Minister for Trade, Industry and
Tourism Kyriakos Christofi said the higher cost of Cyprus' tourist
product and its poorer quality are some of the problems the
tourist industry faces.
</P>
<P>
Christofi noted that costs should be reduced and the tourist
products upgraded. He said that the liberalization of charter
flights is being examined.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Cyprus Tourism Organization (CTO)
estimates that the number of tourists this year will remain at
the same level as last year, which is 2.1 million.
</P>
<P>
He said the government officials headed by CTO Director Frini
Michael will complete their report before the end of this week
and the ministers will discuss the matter next week.
</P>
<P>
The eastern Mediterranean island last year attracted about 2.1
million tourists, earning the country 1.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But according to figures released by the CTO last week, total
arrivals during the first five months of the year showed a one
percent drop.
</P>
<P>
The CTO has called for an immediate halt to financing new
hotels and apartments as one of the major steps to curb the
down-trend situation in the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the House of Representatives approved an extra fund
of one million Cyprus pounds (about two million U.S. dollars) to
the CTO for advertising.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to promote Cyprus as a winter holiday
center primarily in European countries, either through direct
campaigns or as subsidies to major tour operators who advertise
Cyprus as a winter destination.

<HEADLINE> French Financial Company Leader Given 2 Years of Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Bernard Tapie, president-general
director of the Bernard Tapie Finances company, today was given
two years of prison in suspense with a fine of 300,000 francs
(about 57,700 U.S. dollars) by a local court of legal suit in
Bethune, Pas-de-Calais.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports quoted Me Jean-Yves Lienard, the attorney
of Tapie and several others involved in the case, as saying after
the court announcement that Tapie would not appeal to a higher

</P>
<P>
Tapie, who was accused by the attorney-general in Bethune of
embezzling some 10 million francs (19.2 million dollars), was also
ordered not to intervene in the business of the Testut, a
weighing-machine company the Bernard Tapie Finances owned.
</P>
<P>
The case was opened with a complaint by a shareholder of the
Testut company in December 1992, and was followed by a legal
inquiry against Bruno Flocco, general director of Testut, in May
1993, after Tapie himself accused Flocco of embezzling 3 million
francs.
</P>
<P>
In June 1993, Flocco accused Tapie and Elie Fellous, then the
new general director of Testut, of abusing social funds and
funding election campaigns of a local politician.
</P>
<P>
Flocco was today given one year of prison in suspense plus
50,000 francs of fining. Fellous was given 18 months of prison
plus 200,000 of fining. Michel Gallot and Bernard Gachet, two
other persons involved in the Testut scandal, were both given six
months of prison in suspense.

given prison terms or other penalties by the Bethune court of
legal suit five times for financial and other offenses. In all the
former cases, Tapie made appeals.

opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, attended by Arab ministers of agriculture at
Sheraton Hotel on the bank of the Nile, is part of the efforts to
deal with problems linked with water resources and desertification
in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
It will focus on water studies programs in seven projects to

underground water resources.
</P>
<P>
The Arab ministers are also expected to discuss how to develop
river resources in the Arab world and to control desertification
in Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The Arab center has carried out studies which show that the
available water resources would cover only 50 percent of the
agricultural sector's needs if Arabs were to turn self-sufficient in
food supplies.
</P>
<P>
The biennial meeting comes at a time when the Arab world faces a
great water problem, which also constitutes a security problem. To brace
themselves for this, some Arab countries such as Egypt have

(FYROM) following an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the
neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
A circular issued by the Agriculture Ministry said the ban
affected both livestock products and animal feed. The circular
sent to border posts also barred Greek shepherds from allowing
their herds to graze closer than three kilometers from the
Greek-FYROM border.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles crossing the border into Greece are obliged to pass
through a special trench filled with caustic potash to disinfect
their wheels in accordance with the decision.
</P>
<P>
Similar measures were also taken recently at the Greek-Albanian
border following outbreaks of the disease in Albania.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls Iraq to Cooperate in Scrapping Mass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Head of the U.N. special
commission (UNSCOM) in charge of scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction Rolf Ekeus today called on Iraq to cooperate with the
U.N. to destroy all weapons of mass destruction it "concealed."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here this afternoon, the Swedish
diplomat who is on a visit to Kuwait said that "we are
determined to destroy and eliminate everything of Iraqi
destructive weapons identified piece by piece."
</P>
<P>
"If Iraq decides to cooperate with the special commission of
the United Nations, this can be a process which can go relatively
quite quickly," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed Iraq still have between six to 16
conventional long-range ballistic missiles. "We will continue our
inspection activities," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Baghdad was still withholding information about its
biological and chemical programs and failed to supply proof about
their destruction. But he ruled out any possibility that Iraq has
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
He said UNSCOM believes that most of the prohibited items have
been identified and indeed been destroyed although some limited
but significant items are unaccounted for and may still exist in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"During my mission in Baghdad last week, we agreed on a
joint program of action between UNSCOM and Iraq aiming at
finally clarifying these substantive issues," Ekeus said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that UNSCOM need evidence to prove Iraq's
statement that it destroyed all the prohibited weapons in
secrecy and unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Iraq, in the current situation and as
long as UNSCOM inspectors are still continuing their mission,
does not constitute any military threat to the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
He said an agreement was reached and from now on, "we will
need each second month to review progress" in respect of
eliminating Iraq's prohibited weapons still believed to be
concealed.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar to Have 70,000 Tourists This Year: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Minister for Tourism of
Zanzibar Issa Mohammed today predicted that more than 70,000
foreign tourists will visit Zanzibar where 700,000 people live,
in 1996/97 financial year.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his ministry's estimates before the House of
Representatives in the Town of Zanzibar today, Mohammed said the
visitors are expected to spend 120 million US Dollars for various
charges including accommodation, food and beverages.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here said the minister told the house that
tourism in the isles is growing at an average rate of 15 percent
annually in the past few years due to tourist attraction sites
including historical sites and sandy beaches.
</P>
<P>
He said the government continues to rest hopes on tourism
because potential for increased monetary returns by the sector is
tremendous.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue to put emphasis on construction
of first-class hotels in Zanzibar as proposed by the tourism
policy, Mohammed noted.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that in the new fiscal year, five first-class
hotels will be built in the isles to accommodate the anticipated
rise in tourist traffic.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the house that a feasibility study to
promote tourism in the isles was handed over to the government
last January and more than 35 tourism projects were proposed.
</P>
<P>
The feasibility study was done under a loan by the World Bank
through the Tourism Infrastructure Project in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar has been depended on cloves export but the glut in
the clove export market has made tourism the main alternative
foreign exchange earner for the two Indian Ocean islands of
Zanzibar and Pemba.

<HEADLINE> US Supreme Court Leaves Intact Ruling on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Supreme Court today let
stand a federal appeals court ruling that threatens all
affirmative action programs at state-run colleges in three
southern states.
</P>
<P>
The federal appeals court ruling struck down, as unlawful
reverse discrimination, the University of Texas law school's
former affirmative-action admissions plan to boost enrollment of
blacks and Mexican-Americans.
</P>
<P>
The court rejected appeals in which Texas officials and two
civil rights groups had urged it to decide whether state schools
nationwide may continue using race or ethnicity as a factor in
their admissions decisions.
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ruling is binding law for Texas, Louisiana
and Mississippi, and it could influence other courts across the
nation confronted with similar disputes.
</P>
<P>
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a brief opinion joined by
Justice David H. Souter, noted that the program invalidated by the
appeals court has long been abandoned by the law school.
</P>
<P>
"We must await a final judgment on a program genuinely in
controversy before addressing the important question raised in
this petition," Ginsburg said.
</P>
<P>
A three-judge panel of the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled last March that the law school's 1992
admissions policy discriminated against whites.
</P>
<P>
The school had set lower test-score standards for black and
Mexican-American applicants, and provided a separate review board
for those applications. The plan was aimed at obtaining an
entering class consisting of at least 10 percent Mexican-Americans
and 5 percent blacks.
</P>
<P>
A federal trial judge and the appeals court ruled that the
quota system violated the rights of four unsuccessful white
applicants.
</P>
<P>
The appeals court went further and ruled that a landmark 1978
Supreme Court decision allowing the use of race or national origin
as one factor in college admissions is no longer good law.
</P>
<P>
The supreme court first endorsed the concept of affirmative
action in that 1978 ruling. It said race could be considered as
one of many factors in a school's admission policy but struck down
separate admissions tracks for whites and minorities.
</P>
<P>
In the Texas case, the 5th Circuit Court ruled that "the law
school may not use race as a factor in law school admissions."
</P>
<P>
"A university may properly favor one applicant over another
because of his ability to play the cello, make a downfield tackle
or understand chaos theory," the appeals court said. "An
admissions process may also consider an applicant's home state or
relationship to school alumni."
</P>
<P>
"Schools may even consider factors such as whether an
applicant's parents attended college or the applicant's economic
and social background," the appeals court said, acknowledging that
those factors may have a correlation with race or ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
"But the key is that race itself cannot be taken into account,"
the appeals court added in a ruling that is binding in Texas,
Louisiana and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ruling was appealed by Texas officials and,
separately, by two civil rights groups -- the Thurgood Marshall
Legal Society and the Black Pre-law Association.
</P>
<P>
Both appeals were denied.
</P>
<P>
In the state's appeal, Texas officials said minority students
in those three states now "may be given special consideration by
colleges and universities on the east and west coasts but not in
their home states."
</P>
<P>
"This imbalance is as ironic as it is intolerable, given the
long history of official discrimination in the education of
minorities in these Gulf Coast states," the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, nine states and the District of
Columbia supported Texas' appeal in friend-of-the-court briefs.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Ranks No.1 in Kidney Transplant Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus ranks first worldwide in
the number of kidney transplants in terms of its ratio to the
island's population, a medical official said here today.
</P>
<P>
George Kyriakides, Director of the Paraskevaideon Transplant
Center in Nicosia, made the remarks at a press conference here to
promote a nine-day campaign to alert people about organ donation.
</P>
<P>
Kyriakides said with an annual rate of about 30 kidney
transplants, Cyprus tops the bill.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, doctors carried out 289 kidney
transplants on the island, and the number is expected to reach 300
by the end of this year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The official expressed the hope that his center will be able
carry out bone marrow, liver and heart transplants in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
He praised the Cypriot people for their well-responding to
appeals for organ donations, but he said his center is still
facing a shortage of organs.
</P>
<P>
He called on the public to consider offering organs of the dead
for transplants. "Our objective is to convince people that dying
patients, who are suitable donors, must offer their organs for a
transplant," he said.
</P>
<P>
Radio programs, concerts and other events will take place
between July 1-9 to mark the 10th anniversary of the launch of the
island's transplant center.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Implement Oil-for-Food Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Amir
al-Anbari said here today Iraq's food distribution plan does not
violate or is not inconsistent with provisions of the Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accepted U.N. Security Council Resolution 986 in May that
allowed it to export oil worth 2 billion dollars in six months to
buy humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
Following the resolution and the agreement the U.N. and Iraq
reached last May, the Iraqi envoy submitted the distribution plan
to the United Nations Secretariat last Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright said that the Iraqi plan was
unacceptable because the Iraqi regime tried to figure out how to
get around the rules and to skim off the humanitarian goods for
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Al-Anbari said that the plan was worked out by Iraqi
authorities through close cooperation with U.N. agencies in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 986 authorizes the secretary-general only to examine
and approve the plan, he insisted.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed economic sanctions on Iraq after its invasion
of Kuwait in August 1990. The six-year-long sanctions have
crippled the Iraqi economy and resulted in a widespread food
shortage.

<HEADLINE> General Aidid Urges Rivals to Join His Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leader General
Mohamed Farah Aidid has again called on his opponents to refrain
from "altercation and violence" and join his Somali government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Mogadishu Stadium today to mark Somalia's 36th
anniversary of its independence, Aidid said he will have dialogue
with his opposition groups if they "work with him in
reconstructing the country and reconciling among the Somalis".
</P>
<P>
Aidid said he is offering the change of heart for the sake of
the Independence Day. However, he warned that his government will
not sit back and watch if those groups keep "jeopardizing the
security and stability of the nation".
</P>
<P>
He did not name the groups, but it is understood he meant his
main rivals Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Osman Hassan Ali Atto.
</P>
<P>
During his speech to thousands of jubilant supporters, Aidid
announced the imposition of Sharia laws in the areas under his
control and called on Moslem scholars to meet and discuss the
ways the Sharia laws could be implemented.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time General Aidid declared implementation
of Sharia, to the applause of the crowd. Sharia laws have been in
effect in North Mogadishu controlled by his rival, Ali Mahdi
Mohamed since August 1994.
</P>
<P>
Similar festivals were also held in North Mogadishu and other
parts of the country. North Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi
Mohamed has addressed his supporters through his radio over the
commemoration of the historic day.
</P>
<P>
The celebration of July 1 came at a time when the situation
here is very tense and just a few days after heavy tripartite
clashes between Aidid on one hand, and Osman Atto and Ali Mahdi
on the other in South Mogadishu and along the Green Line that
divides the Somali capital.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 people died and over a hundred others were
wounded during the recent armed conflicts in Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Green Paper on Employment Equity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa made public its
employment and occupational equity green paper today, making it
easier for black people, women and the disabled to get jobs and
promotion.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the green paper in Pretoria, Labor Minister Tito
Mboweni said it is not a foundation for reversed job reservation
but an attempt to remove discrimination from work place.
</P>
<P>
Mboweni said the document is "an integral part of the process
that will ultimately lead toward true justice for all in the
South African labor market."
</P>
<P>
"These things won't correct themselves naturally, there has to
be intervention," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the green paper, employing organizations in South
Africa should develop plans to minimize barriers to people from
historically disadvantaged groups and accelerate their hiring,
training and promotion.
</P>
<P>
The document said employers who promote employment equity will
be favored when the government considers tender contracts and in
the granting of subsidies.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the "considerable racial gap in education", the
document also proposed to lower formal qualification requirements
and recognize the value of experience.
</P>
<P>
Employers will in future be prohibited from using recruitment
and selection criteria which discriminate unfairly. To this end,
they have to develop advertizing mechanisms which will reach all
realistic candidates.
</P>
<P>
Other measures to ensure equity include the building of
infrastructure to accommodate women and disabled people and more
flexible working hours.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government for its part will monitor progress
in improving equity and enforce planning requirements.

<HEADLINE> Two French Space Giants to Merge in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Two giants of France's space
industry, the state-owned Aerospatiale and the private
aircraft-producer Dassault Aviation, will merge at the beginning
of 1997, said a French government communique issued today.
</P>
<P>
The planned merger, one year earlier than formerly expected,
will produce a state-controlled group which will open its
estimated 60 billion franc (11.5 billion U.S. dollar) capital to
other European space enterprises such as British Aerospace and the
Daimler-Benz Aerospace (DASA).
</P>
<P>
Except plane motors, the new group -- to be named either as
Dassault-Aerospatiale or Aerospatiale-Dassault -- will put
together all their assembly lines that produce the Ariane rockets,
the Falcon commercial planes, the Aerospatiale helicopters, the
Airbus and ATR aircraft, the Dassault combat aircraft, the
Aerospatiale satellites and the Aerospatiale missiles.
</P>
<P>
A French Defense Ministry source said, "The objective of the
government is that the general plan of the merger could be
finalized in autumn, so that the precise modalities (of the
merger) could be fixed before January 1, 1997."
</P>
<P>
At the Dassault, however, the interpretation of the calendar is
a little different. Dassault officials said that they would spend
six months studying the conditions for the bringing together of
the two in best conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Then, we will see the time that is needed for the real
procedures of coming-together,"said a Dassault source.
</P>
<P>
According to the government communique issued in coordination
with the Dassault, the state will maintain control over the
majority of the shares of the new group, but the state will also
fully consider the interests of private participants in the
airspace industry.
</P>
<P>
Details of the percentage of shares to be controlled by the
Dassault family remain unknown.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac fixed the aim for the merger of the
two giants in February: to build one of the world's strongest
airspace industrial enterprises. He ordered the two companies to
finalize a framework for the merger by June 30.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Romanian Presidents Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and his Romanian counterpart, Ion Iliescu, held talks here
this afternoon, with both sides pledging to cultivate their
friendship from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
During the talks at the presidential palace, Jiang and Iliescu
described Sino-Romanian friendship as "the common wealth of the
two peoples."
</P>
<P>
"Under the new international circumstances, both sides should
treat and handle bilateral relations with a far-reaching view
toward the 21st century and leaders of the two countries should
shoulder the responsibility to cultivate and pass on the
friendship from generation to generation," the two presidents
agreed.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the friendly cooperative ties between the
two countries have been continuing to develop in new situations
and on a new basis in recent years, frequent contacts have been kept
between leaders of the two countries, and so have exchanges and
cooperation in many fields, such as politics, economy, science and
technology, culture and education.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also have close cooperation in international
affairs, the two presidents said.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations have not been affected but continued to
develop smoothly despite international turbulences and drastic
changes in their respective countries, which is valuable, they
noted.
</P>
<P>
"The traditional friendship, which was tempered through various
tests, is the common treasure of our two peoples," they said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides pledged to keep regular high-level contacts, promote
and guide bilateral friendship, support direct exchanges between
parliaments, governments, various departments and localities,
develop comprehensive cooperation in every field and push forward
bilateral relations to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said Romania is an important country in Central Eastern
Europe and China attaches great importance to bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"Despite differences in development road and social system, our
two countries respect each other's choice," Jiang said. China
respects the domestic and foreign policies adopted by the Romanian
government and supports its effort in safeguarding national
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to be a reliable friend of Romania on the basis
of the principles such as mutual respect, non-interference in each
other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit," he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Iliescu said Romanian-Chinese relations, which are based on
mutual trust, are solid and sound. "We believe China is an
important balancing element in maintaining world peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries have many common viewpoints and
interests in international affairs, and closer bilateral
cooperation and strengthened bilateral friendship accord with
their fundamental interests.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the two sides will further encourage and support
companies, enterprises and localities to forge direct links and
carry out multi-formed cooperation, including mutual investment
and setting up of joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
"In all, we should join efforts to make economic and trade
relations match with the real potentials of the two countries'
economies and our excellent political relations," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Iliescu agreed to Jiang's remarks, adding the cooperation
agreements to be signed place an even sound foundation for future
economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said any country, big or small, rich or poor, strong or
weak, has the right to choose its own social system and road for
development.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government has made unremitting efforts and
attained great accomplishments in maintaining social stability,
recovering and developing economy and raising people's living
standards, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two heads of state also dwelled on the
current international situation as well as regional issues of
mutual concern, and reached extensive agreement.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Interference in Zambian Elections Opposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Movement for Multi-party
Democracy (MMD) said today it opposes any interference by foreign
and local election monitors in Zambia's constitutional matters
for this year's general elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a party organizers workshop in Kasama, northern
province, MMD Chairman Sikota Wina said election monitors have no
right to dictate who should stand for elections as that is a
responsibility of the Zambians.
</P>
<P>
"Observers should stick to their role of ensuring that
elections are free and fair and conducted in an orderly and
peaceful manner," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Wina also called on opposition parties to desist from violence
in their campaigns for this year's elections.
</P>
<P>
The MMD took power peacefully in 1991 and any parties aspiring
to challenge the MMD should do so peacefully without causing any
violence in the nation, Wina added.
</P>
<P>
A constitution amendment bill was adopted in Zambia, which
stipulates that only the aboriginals, including the grandsons of
immigrants in Zambia are qualified to run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
This actually bars former president and opposition leader
Kenneth Kaunda from contending for the post as his parents were
immigrated from Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties consider the move unfair and have urged the
cancellation of the amendment.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Jordan and Syria Need Time, Patience to Bridge Differences (by Wen Xinnian) (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Syria, two of the key
players in the Middle East peace process, have started to restore
their normal ties, beginning from the highest level, in the light
of the latest developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Hussein and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
held talks, in the presence of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
at the Cairo Arab Summit last month, the first since Jordan and
Israel signed their peace treaty in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The concerted efforts to improve ties between Jordan and
Syria, which was aimed at unifying their stands vis-a-vis Israel
in the peace process, came within the context of Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hardline policy towards Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders had conversation today over telephone, two days
after the meeting between Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti and Syrian Charge d'affaires Wahid Jaber. Local press
said that Kabariti was seeking to build on the budding
rapprochement between the King and al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that the two leaders will hold a summit by
the end of this summer after the prime ministers of the two
countries solve security and political issues.
</P>
<P>
Although intensive contacts have been made since the Arab
summit, observers believe that the two countries till have a long
way to go before restoring their normal ties. They cited lots of
outstanding differences to be settled between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's peace treaty with Israel signed in 1994 was the main
element leading to the tense relations between Amman and
Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Syria accused Jordan of "running" its peace treaty with Israel
without an Arab coordination, and had asked Jordan to make an
official apology before retoring Jordanian-Syrian ties.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordan rejected Syria's accusations, saying that
Egypt and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed peace
accords with Israel before Jordan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Amman maintained that there existed secret
contacts between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Analysts and western diplomats here also said terrorism is
also a stumbling block in the way of normalization of ties between
the two countries.

Jordan disclosed it has defuzed 56 terrorist attempts in the
kingdom by armed men who had crossed the Syrian border. They
planned to assassinate senior Jordanian officials and attack
Israeli tourists.
</P>
<P>
During the Arab summit, King Hussein presented the files on
terrorism to President al-Assad, but the Syrian president denied
that his country encouraged such acts and promised to make
investigations and then inform Jordanian officials of the results.
</P>
<P>
In turn, Syrian officials said Jordan harbors Syrian opposition
members who are against the Syrian government.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials argued that they have no right to act
against any Syrian living on Jordanian soil.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jordan's close ties with Turkey and Syria's special
relations with Iran, will also hinder the improvement of the
Jordanian-Syrian ties.
</P>
<P>
Syria argued that Turkey occupies Arab lands and has signed a
military agreement with Israel, which also drew severe criticism
from other Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Amman stressed that Iran occupies Arab islands in
the Red Sea and supports terrorism against Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the media role, the Jordanian side said that Syria
had started a negative press campaign against Jordan.
</P>
<P>
During the Arab summit, Syrian Prime Minister Mahamoud Zouebi
denied that such campaigns were taking place in Syria, explaining
that he was merely addressing the Jordanian people.
</P>
<P>
This triggered a response from Kabariti who denied that there
was a campaign against the Syrian prime minister, but said he was
also addressing the Syrian people.
</P>
<P>
Differences between the two countries, at the same time,
reflected in terms of their respective positions towards Iraq and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been stressing the need for comprehensive efforts
to solve all issues before holding a summit between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that to remove outstanding differences between
Amman And Damascus need more time, more meetings and more
patience.

<HEADLINE> US Construction Spending Down by 0.9 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Construction spending
declined by 0.9 percent in May, the first drop in three months,
the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that spending on residential,
nonresidential and public projects totaled 563.4 billion dollars
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in May, down from a revised
568.3 billion in April.
</P>
<P>
The department also revised up the increase of construction
spending in April to 2 percent from the 1.4 percent initially
reported a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The construction spending in May was pulled down by the
decreasing private spending which offset the increase of
government expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Government spending on construction rose 1.8 percent to an
annual rate of 143.2 billion dollars, the third straight increase.
But residential outlays fell 1.2 percent to a 248.9 billion
dollar rate, after jumping 2.4 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The residential category represents 45 percent of the total
U.S. construction spending.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, spending on single-family homes slipped by 0.6
percent to a 155.1 billion rate, after rising 2.4 percent in
April, and spending on apartments and condominiums also fell 11.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
Nonresidential spending also fell by 2.4 percent to a 131.9
billion rate after a 0.6 percent increase in April. Industrial
construction, including factories, fell 5 percent. Spending on
other commercial projects such as shopping centers was down 6.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts have been predicting that home construction in
the U.S. would level off because of the rising mortgage rates in
recent months.

<HEADLINE> Tariff Reduction on Zimbabwe's Goods Urged in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's textile and
clothing industry said today it has recommended the government
reduce by about 50 percent punitive tariffs on Zimbabwe exports.
</P>
<P>
South African Textile Federation President Mike Hankinson said
the offer was made at a meeting held in Pretoria last week
between representatives of the textile and clothing sector from
both countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was the first of several planned between three
technical committees set up at Victoria Falls when Zimbabwe and
South Africa met last month to resume stalled talks aimed at
concluding a new bilateral trade pact.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe complains that South Africa has tripled its tariffs
imposed on its goods after a 1964 agreement expired in 1992 and
the two countries are now negotiating a new bilateral trade pact
to replace that pact.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, accusing South Africa of exercising unfair trading
activities, warned earlier to adopt measures to protect its own
industry.
</P>
<P>
Hankinson said a lot of progress has been made on the issue of
local content and tariffs.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe's demand for lower duties is understandable,
and it has to be accepted that international trade in clothing
and textile products is depressed at present.
</P>
<P>
"It is a difficult situation not only for Zimbabwe, but for
South Africa as well and the whole international industry," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Delegation to Probe Border Incident in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Turkish security,
political, military and disciplinary delegation is due in Tehran
next week to probe the recent incident which killed six and
injured 17 others, an senior Iranian official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Gholam Hussein Bolandian, Deputy Interior Minister for Security
and Disciplinary Affairs, said that Turkey should offer an
official apology and compensate the victims of last Wednesday's
attack on Iranian border dwellers by Turkish helicopters.
</P>
<P>
He warned that "if the two countries do not reach an agreement
in their meeting, the Islamic Republic of Iran will take the case
to international tribunals."
</P>
<P>
He regretted that the Turkish side has not so far cooperated
with Iran despite the entrusting of the investigation to
the border officials of the two countries -- Turkey's Hakari
province and Iran's West Azarbaijan province.
</P>
<P>
Bolandian said that the incident occurred in Silavana in the
mountainous Shaheedan region, when Turkish military forces,
thinking that opposition forces were based on the two countries'
common border, fired two rockets on Iranian nomads.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that in 1993 after a similar attack by the Turkish
air force on Iran's Sardasht region, Ankara, shouldering
responsibility, had officially apologized to Iran and paid
compensation for the damage.
</P>
<P>
"But, regarding the recent incident, Turkey has yet to accept
responsibility for its attack," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that Iran "wants an official commitment by
Ankara that such violations will not be repeated by its military
and disciplinary forces on Iranian soil."
</P>
<P>
He said "the Islamic Republic is sensitive to its territorial
integrity and the life and security of its citizens and attaches
high importance to such issues."
</P>
<P>
Iran wants Turkey to compensate for the injured and the families
of those killed in the attack and offer an official apology
to the Islamic Republic, Bolandian said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Iranian military and security forces have
a strong presence on the 511-kilometers long Iranian-Turkish border and
closely follow the issues.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Court Upholds Sentences Against Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's Court of Appeal in
Maseru today upheld the conviction and sentences of the country's
former accountant-general and his deputy for stealing 2 million
Rand (about 456,000 US Dollars) from the government.
</P>
<P>
According to the South African Press Association, dismissing
the appeal, Justice Leonora Van Den Heever, a South African
Appeal Court judge, said the guilt of Daniel Nkane Matebese and
his deputy Pusetso Makotoane "was so clearly established" that no
failure of justice has occurred in their original court hearing.
</P>
<P>
Van Der Heever said: "The totality of the evidence against
them was damning and the lies they told merely made their
situation worse."
</P>
<P>
Matebese and Makotoane were convicted in Lesotho's High Court
in February this year and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment on
each of four courts, the sentences to run concurrently, leaving
them with an effective 10 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
The money which was stolen from Lesotho's central bank was
deposited in banks in South Africa between March 1993 and January
1994, added the report.

TEHRAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara today continued his mediation between Iran and
Bahrain, saying that Bahraini officials are willing to remove
the impediments existing in their relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Shara, who arrived here Monday afternoon from Manama, said

the Amir of Bahrain, expressed satisfaction with the statements
of Iranian officials regarding regional security and stability."

<P>
He said that during the talks, he felt there was an improvement
in relations between Iran and Bahrain, adding that such a
development will have a positive effect on relations between the
Islamic Republic and other Arab states.
</P>
<P>
This is the second visit of the Syrian foreign minister to
Tehran this week. Shara was here last Saturday with a message for
President Hashemi Rafsanjani from Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad. Later he left Tehran for Manama.

<P>
Bahrain has accused Iran of involvement in a plot to topple the
Bahrain government, but Iran has refuted all such allegations.

<HEADLINE> Coup Plotters Granted Clemency in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's Council of State today
granted clemency to seven former army officers imprisoned last
year for treason and sprung from jail during factional fightings
in April.
</P>
<P>
Former general Charles Julu and six other officers were
sentenced last July to seven years' incarceration with hard labor
for plotting to overthrow the government, said a state house
statement, quoted by a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The decision to grant clemency was taken ''in the interest of
reconciliation and peace,'' said the statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, all the seven men have been at large
since they were freed from jail by fellow ethnic Kranns, who
came from a stockade in Monrovia's Barclay training center
shortly after fighting broke out in the Liberian capital in early
April.
</P>
<P>
in September 1994, Julu and 100 dissident soldiers of the
armed forces of Liberia occupied state house, announcing that
they seized power under the leadership of a u.s.-based
organization, the Liberia New Horizon.
</P>
<P>
The coup plotters were evicted after a few hours by troops of
the African peacekeeping force, Ecomog, then arrested and charged
with treason, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Corsican Separatist Killed in Car Bomb Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 1 (Xinhua) - A militant Corsican separatist was
killed and another seriously wounded in a car bomb attack this
afternoon in Bastia, capital of the French-ruled Mediterranean
island, said reports by local media.
</P>
<P>
Pierre-Louis Lorenzi, 34, died in hospital after being wounded
by a powerful explosion of a car parked outside an office building
of guardian service owned by the separatist organization of
Cuncolta Nazionalista, the legal wing of the FLNC-Canal.
</P>
<P>
Charles Pieri, 46, who is national secretary of the Cuncolta
for Upper-Corsica, had his legs and arms blown away in the
explosion, which occurred around 16:00 when the two were entering
the building.
</P>
<P>
Police said the explosives were probably triggered with a
radio commander. Fourteen other people, including five passers-by,
were also wounded in the explosion, which engulfed the building in
fire.
</P>
<P>
Violence has been raging for 20 years in Corsica around the
so-called "nationalist fight" by militant separatists, with
Lorenzi being the sixth separatist killed so far this year.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the militants to resort to car bomb
explosion in their attacks.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Takes Over EU Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Ireland takes over the presidency of
the European Union today with ambitions of "Secure peace, safe
street, solid money and secure jobs".
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton told journalists as he set out
Ireland's above program for its six-month rolling European Union
presidency.
</P>
<P>
It is vital, he said to "bridge the gap" between the leadership
of the EU and its citizens. Bruton conceded that the task would be
long and hard.
</P>
<P>
It is acknowledged the Ireland takes over the presidency of the
EU at a testing time. Just a week ago Europe's heads of government
were desperately trying to patch over divisions caused by the beef
war, and it will be Ireland's aim to ensure that the aftershocks
of the crisis do not continue to undermine progress on Europe's
bigger projects.
</P>
<P>
In the short term, however, Ireland must pick up the threads
from the Italian presidency, whose performance suffered from the
distractions of an election campaign at home and the disruption
caused by Britain's policy of non-cooperation over the ban on
British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Beef could still prove troublesome, particularly if British
Prime Minister John Major fails to secure a partial lifting of
the EU ban in early autumn.
</P>
<P>
By December, Bruton hopes that members states will have agreed
a draft treaty on how to rebuild Europe's institutions in the
negotiations of the inter-governmental conference.

<HEADLINE> EC Invites Automakers For Talks on Fuel Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) is to
invite Europe's auto industry for talks on cutting fuel consumption
to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
</P>
<P>
Although the European car industry has made commitments to
reducing vehicle fuel consumption, the EC is concerned that
current growth levels in carbon dioxide emissions are threatening
the Community's carbon dioxide targets, Environment Commissioner
Ritt Bjerregaard and Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann said
in a letter to Jacques Calvet, president of the European
Automobile Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the EC adopted a strategy to cut emissions from
passenger cars and to improve fuel economy.
</P>
<P>
Now, the EC is to start working on a fuel economy monitoring
system and on a proposal for fuel economy labelling.
</P>
<P>
Average fuel consumption of five liters per 100 kilometers for
petrol cars and 4.5 liters for diesel cars is possible, the EC
says and expects to make major progress towards reaching these
targets by 2005.

<P>
NEW DELHI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Indian External Affairs Minister
I.K. Gujral today expressed the hope that the stalled bilateral
dialogue between India and Pakistan would resume at an "early
date," the Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
The minister, during a meeting with Pakistan High Commissioner
Riaz Khokhar, also conveyed India's desire for establishing a
relationship of friendship and cooperation with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Indo-Pak dialogue was suspended after the foreign
secretaries of the two countries last met in Islamabad in early
1994.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Pakistan High Commissioner told Gujral
that Islamabad was preparing a response to Indian Prime Minister
H.D. Deve Gowda's letter sent on June 9 to his Pakistan
counterpart Bezazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
On June 3, two days after the Gowda-led United Front government
was sworn in, the Pakistan Prime Minister proposed the resumption
of the stalled bilateral talks between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
In his official reply on June 9, Gowda suggested that the two
sides first resume talks at the foreign secretary level.

<HEADLINE> Chrysler Vehicle Sales Slow Down in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chrysler Corporation reported
that its sales rose 1 percent last month to 228,828 vehicles as
customers continued to snap up options-laden mini-vans and cars.
</P>
<P>
That 1 percent gain was still significant, although it seems
paltry compared with Chrysler's double-digit sales increases
earlier this year, according to the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
In January, Chrysler sales rose 7 percent; in February, sales
jumped 20 percent; in March, they rose 8 percent; in April, they
shot up 33 percent; and in May, sales rose 17 percent for a record
month.
</P>
<P>
Strong sales of previous months and last year slowed down in
June but some analysts said they still "look very good." The
numbers are all the more promising because Chrysler "started the
month with very low inventories."
</P>
<P>
The General Motors and the Ford Motor Company will also report
their June sales soon. Analysts expect that their sales will
increase between 1 percent to 3 percent.

HARARE, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government, currently
implementing harsh economic reforms, will introduce a three-year
rolling budget in the next financial year for better planning of
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
At a parliament meeting held today, President Robert Mugabe
announced, "from fiscal year 1996/97 (which begins this month),
my government will introduce a three-year rolling budget, the
main aim of which is to enable ministries to take a longer view
in planning their estimates of expenditure."
</P>
<P>
Members of parliament should recommend to the government
corrective measures to be taken timeously as Zimbabwe implemented
the second phase of the economic structural adjustment programme,
Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
He urged state enterprises to be commercialized and privatized
"more speedily" following cabinet's approval of the establishment
of the national investment trust, whose main thrust would be to
ensure black economic empowerment.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that organizations whose commercialization
would be considered include the National News Agency Ziana, Air
Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority, the National
Oil Company of Zimbabwe, Affretair and the National Railways of
Zimbabwe.

WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Sales of new homes in the U.S.

8.8 percent jump last January.
</P>
<P>
But the advance of new home sales was concentrated in the
Midwest and South of the country and sales fell slightly in the
Northeast and West.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have attributed much of the buying momentum to
consumers rushing to lock in on rates before they rose even
higher. They warned that the higher rates would curb the sales in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages in the nation averaged 8.09
percent in May, up from 7.93 percent in April and 7.03 percent in
January. It was the highest since rates averaged 8.32 percent in
April 1995.
</P>
<P>
For the first five months of the year, sales were 25.1 percent
above those of the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the
end of May was 360,000, representing a supply of 5.2 months at the
current sales rate.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales of new homes shot up by 21.3 percent in the
Midwest and by 10.2 percent in the South. But they slipped 1.7
percent in the West and 1.6 percent in the Northeast.

<HEADLINE> Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain's manufacturing industry
expanded in June for the first time this year due to increasing
demand for consumer goods, a leading business index showed on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The purchasing managers' index, which brings together
information on new orders, output, stocks etc, jumped from 47.6
percent to 50.9 percent between May and June, the latest monthly
survey by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply
indicated.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time the index has risen since December last
year and the first time for four months it has moved above the 50
percent mark. Any reading above 50 percent indicates an expansion
in activity.
</P>
<P>
Cut-price promotions combined with good weather last month
generated a sharp pick-up in demand for consumer goods and
production in this sector was stepped up, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
However, conditions in the investment goods sector remained
depressed, with orders falling for the fifth successive month and
output down.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that prices paid by purchasing managers
dropped to their lowest level since the survey began in 1991 as
suppliers competed for orders.
</P>
<P>
Economists welcomed the combination of subdued cost pressures
and rising output, but warned against premature prediction of an
end to factory gloom.

<HEADLINE> 17,272 People Killed in Drunken Driving in US in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- As many as 17,272 people were
killed in 1995 in alcohol-related crashes in the United States, 4
percent more than the previous year and the first increase in a
decade, said a study released today.
</P>
<P>
The number of deaths had declined steadily each year until 1995
following a peak of 24,045 deaths in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, found that the percentage of alcohol-related
deaths compared to the total number of highway accident deaths
also increased slightly to 41 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The change stands out from the steady decade of decline in the
percentage, from 52.2 percent in 1986 to 40.8 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Transportation-related deaths as a whole were up in 1995 for
the third year in a row. There were 44,347 people killed in
transportation accidents, up 2 percent from 43,433 in 1994,
according to the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
Deaths from highway accidents, which account for more than 90
percent of those from all transportation-related fatalities, rose
by nearly 1,000 to a total of 41,700 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The number of people killed in aviation accidents was 969 in
1995, down from 1,071 the year before.

<HEADLINE> Rules On Loans To Standardize Borrowing And Lending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The objective of the newly-drafted
"General Rules On Loans" is to create a risk-control mechanism for
banks, enhance efficiency of capital funds and improve financial
services, a central bank official said today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Xiaohua, vice-governor of the People's Bank of China, told
reporters in Beijing that the rules, which become effective
nationwide August 1, were designed to complement international
practices and represent an important reform on borrowing and
lending practices in China.
</P>
<P>
The rules state that each borrower should be rated for
credibility. Financial institutions will then issue loans in
accordance with the rating.
</P>
<P>
"The rating system will help enterprises or borrowers to be
aware that lending from banks is not something like 'eating out
from a big pot," said Zhu. "It is also the most effective way of
optimizing the structure of bank credit and improving efficiency
of using capital."
</P>
<P>
The central bank will create detailed rules for the rating
system, which will take into account the realities of China's
economy and the conditions of its enterprises, noted Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that the rules forbid borrowers to use bank loans to
invest in the equities market.
</P>
<P>
"Experiences from both at home and abroad show that bank loans,
if flowing to high-risk markets such as securities, real estate
and futures, are for speculative purposes, which will not only
disrupt financial order, but also contribute to a 'bubble
economy'."
</P>
<P>
The central bank vice-governor said that the rules will also
help standardize financial institutions' lending activity and
safeguard the interests of both the lender and borrower.

<P>
DALIAN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning Province
today presented 397 agricultural projects to attract overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
Xu Wencai, vice governor of the province, introduced local
agricultural development at a news conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
Preferential natural conditions, rich agricultural resources,
advanced farm machinery and convenient transportation have helped
provide good opportunities for overseas businessmen to invest in
local agriculture, said Xu Wencai.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning now has more than 3,000 foreign-funded enterprises in
agriculture, accounting for 22 percent of the province's total
foreign-funded firms.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural companies used more than 1.8 million yuan in
contractual overseas investment, occupying nearly 20 percent of
the total contractual overseas investment in the province.
</P>
<P>
The foreign-funded agricultural companies mainly operate
businesses in the fields of planting, animal husbandry, the
aquatics-raising industry, and forestry and local products
production.

KUALA LUMPUR, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today it will
cooperate with Germany on defense matters if it is felt the move
will benefit the nation.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar told the press
after a meeting with visiting German Deputy Defense Minister
Gunnar Simon here today that Germany had sophisticated technology
and was highly capable in the field of defense which could be of
benefit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"We will see what Germany can offer and how Malaysia can
benefit from the offer before we go deeper into it," Syed Hamid
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the proposed defense cooperation was still
at the discussion stage and there was no final decision on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the visit by Gunnar Simon, Syed Hamid said that
besides looking at the possibility of fostering greater
cooperation, it was also aimed at studying business opportunities
in the field of defense for German companies.
</P>
<P>
He said German companies must cooperate with Malaysian
companies if they wanted to participate in meeting Malaysia's
defense requirement.

<HEADLINE> 2 Tons of Heroin Destroyed in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Two tons of heroin was torched by
Pakistan's Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) in Pakistan's southwestern
Baluchistan province today, said the Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The heroin was burned near Chagai, a town near the Pak-Afghan
border, in the presence of the representatives from the United
States, Canada, Britain, France, Australia, the Philippines and
the UN Drug Control Program.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the foreign representatives, the ANF Director, Ihsan
ul Haq, said that he received a tip that some international drug
smugglers were bringing the heroine from Helmand province of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
According to the tip, the heroin were stacked near the border
for onward smuggling to European countries through land or sea
routes.
</P>
<P>
Upon receiving the information, he detailed a contingent to
patrol the area, which spotted a vehicle at night on June 25, from
which the consignment was being unloaded and stored in a cave.
</P>
<P>
The smugglers resorted to firing when they sensed the danger of
being watched. The ANF men returned fire. As a result, the
smugglers fled from the scene under cover of darkness.
</P>
<P>
During the search of the cave two tons of heroin in packets was
recovered.
</P>
<P>
Ihsan said that the seized heroin could fetch millions of
dollars from the international underworld market.

national law as well."
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong compatriots should familiarize themselves with
the law. It is also imperative for the people in China's inland
areas to study the law," he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE>   France's Oldest Overseas School to Celebrate Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- France and Greece will celebrate in
September the 150th anniversary of the founding of the French
School in Athens (EFA), the school's headmaster said here today.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac and Greek President Constantine
Stephanopulos are expected to send messages of congratulations to
the school, and the prime ministers of the two countries will
attend the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The EFA, set up in 1846 to study ancient Greek culture, was the
first school France established overseas. It has developed into a
prestigious center for archeological studies and excavations.
</P>
<P>
It began archeological research in 1870, the year France and
Germany fought a war, to "compete with German science."
</P>
<P>
Headmaster Roland Etienne said, "The major framework of the
time has not changed too much, but we keep finding new fields of
interest in sub-marine excavations, arts and literature, and
environment designs."
</P>
<P>
The school now has a research staff of nine and offers
programs for about 40 students studying for a doctorate degree in
Greek culture.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 150 years, the EFA has discovered dozens of
monuments, hundreds of statues, thousands of inscriptions and tens
of thousands of coins dating back to ancient Greece.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the EFA, France has four other schools established
abroad specializing in the study of foreign cultures - in Rome,
Cairo, Vietnam and Madrid.

HONG KONG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The amount of outstanding
mortgages rose by 1.3 percent in May to 293.5 billion HK dollars
(37.87 billion US dollars) compared with April, according to the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).
</P>
<P>
David Carse, deputy chief executive of the HKMA said that the

of lower mortgage rates during the period.
</P>
<P>
There were 8,352 loans worth 13.91 billion HK dollars (1.79
billion US dollars) approved but not drawn in May, compared to
5,241 worth 7.82 billion HK dollars (1.01 billion US dollars)
approved but not drawn in April.
</P>
<P>
Prepayments of existing mortgages were 9.3 billion HK dollars

<HEADLINE> 2nd Runway to Raise Capacity of HK New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The second runway at HK's new
airport will increase its declared runway capacity from 37
aircraft movements per hour to 50 movements per hour within the
first year of operation, according to the Hong Kong Airport
Authority (AA).
</P>
<P>
At a media briefing, AA's corporate development director
Clinton Leeks said that the Airport Committee of the Sino-British
Liaison Group agreed on May 30 to the AA's proposal to proceed
quickly with the design and construction of the second runway and
associated facilities.
</P>
<P>
He said that an early start to the construction of these
facilities means that aircraft could be using the second runway at
the new airport by October 1998, just six months after airport
opening.
</P>
<P>
He said that these additional works won't have any impact on
the opening date of the first phase of the airport in April 1998,
and no additional government equity will be required.
</P>
<P>
Graham Plant, AA's head of engineering, said areas of land for
the second runway on the northern side of the airport would be
made available for works to start in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Authority was currently examining contracting
strategies for the design and construction of the second runway
and the northwest concourse, with the objectives to minimize cost
and to achieve the commissioning target of October, 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the detailed design for the second runway
had not yet begun, no significant difference from the first runway
design was anticipated.
</P>
<P>
He said that the first and second runways will be able to
accommodate future new large aircraft that will have 84 meter
wingspans, be 85 meters in length and perhaps be able to carry up
to 900 passengers.

<HEADLINE> EC Clamps Down on Textiles Fraud from Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh, the largest T-shirt
exporter to the European Union (EU), is facing tough new rules to
fight fraudulent textiles licenses.
</P>
<P>
All Bangladeshi textile exports to the EU must use new
forgery-proof export license forms, the European Commission said
today.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh enjoys favorable textile trading conditions with the
EU -- no quotas and zero tariffs. T-shirt exports to the EU rose
28 percent in 1995 to 198 million, with further significant
increases expected this year.
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the dramatic rise is the use of forged
Bangladeshi export license forms.
</P>
<P>
The EC says the new export license form is based on the latest
technology similar to that used for bank notes. Printed on special
security paper, every form has a three dimensional watermark and a
unique serial number.
</P>
<P>
"The security features make the forms virtually impossible to
be forged," the EC said.
</P>
<P>
If the new rule is successful, it may be extended to other
exporting countries to fight fraud.

ZHENGZHOU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Every weekend, students in
Zhengzhou can take in a free concert, a traditional Chinese opera
or a stage play in the city's Youth and Children's Palace, as part
of a project to improve the younger generation's education in the
arts.
</P>
<P>
The project was launched by the city government three months
ago for students in local colleges, middle and primary
schools. Zhengzhou is the capital city of central China's Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
One concert featured the Henan Philharmonic Orchestra playing
works by Beethoven, Chopin and Bizet. During the evening, the
young listeners were told how the different instruments work,
given information about each composer and taught how to appreciate
a symphony.
</P>
<P>
The sponsors of these activities hope that by providing young
people access to classical music and opera, and dramatic works,
they will turn away from the influence of vulgar art performances.
</P>
<P>
The "music and drama" weekends have also helped nurture
civilized manners and moral conduct in young people, sources

GUIYANG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Eleven people were killed in
mud-slides and dozens are missing following heavy flooding in
Guiyang, the capital of southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 residents were trapped by floods in some parts of
downtown Guiyang. Army troops and police have been mobilized to
fight the high waters in the mountainous city, and rescue those
caught by flood waters.
</P>
<P>
During the 13-hour period from 6 p.m. Monday to 7 a.m. today,
the average rainfall in the city's urban areas reached 168.2
millimeters. Rainfall recorded by monitoring stations in the
city's Huaxi District exceeded 204 millimeters.
</P>
<P>
And the rain continues to fall.
</P>
<P>
Sources from a local meteorological observatory said that this
is the heaviest rain recorded here this century.
</P>

The rains caused mountain flooding and high river levels. As a
result, the traffic services were suspended for four major
railways that connect Guizhou with its neighbouring provinces, and
about 30,000 passengers were stranded at the Guiyang Railway
Station.
</P>
<P>
Local meteorologists predicted the rain will end in the next

Vijit earlier today submitted a letter of resignation to
Finance Minister Bodi Chunnanon, but did not indicate the reason
for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Vijit has been under tremendous
pressure to resign because of his failure in tackling Bangkok Bank

rules, which led to some 50 billion baht (2 billion US dollars) of
bad debt with the Commercial Bank.

Vijit was also reportedly involved in other controversies,
including subscription of stocks at par value, and opening of an
overdraft account without putting up any collateral.

Rernchai Marakanond, deputy governor of the Central Bank, will
serve as acting governor until the new governor is appointed, the

<HEADLINE> Six Criminals Executed in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Six criminals, all male, who were
found guilty of theft, robbery and murder by Chinese courts, were
executed this morning, the Supreme People's Court (SPC) announced
at a press conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We should deal relentless blows at those who commit crimes in
defiance of the ongoing anti-crime campaign," said SPC
vice-president Liu Jiachen.
</P>
<P>
Yang Xuegong, a 27-year-old self-employed man from east China's
Shandong Province, was convicted of robbery, murder and larceny.
</P>
<P>
Huang Hu, 24, a worker from south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous region, was found guilty of robbery and murder.
</P>
<P>
Li Ming, Zhang Shengmo, and Zhang Anguo, peasant farmers from
northwest China's Shaanxi Province, were convicted of robbery and
murder.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaodong, 22, a worker from this capital city of Beijing,
was found guilty of robbery, theft and vandalism.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice-president, the six were sentenced to
death penalty by local people's courts in full accordance with
China's law.
</P>
<P>
Many criminals who hoped to be granted leniency from the
courts, have surrendered to the police since the national
anti-crime campaign was launched on April 28. As a result, social
order across the nation has improved, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
However, a small group of hardened criminals, some with records
of re-education through forced labor or have served prison terms,
continue to commit crimes in defiance with the anti-crime
campaign, and have brought great harms to society, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"If a criminal deserves the death penalty by law, he or she
will get the sentence," said the vice-president. "Otherwise we
cannot provide a good environment for the great masses of people."

<HEADLINE> Ramos Urges Opposition to Back Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today urged the opposition to rise above their personal biases and
interests and support peace process in Mindanao, the Southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Ramos made the appeal during his meeting with religious and
political leaders of Zamboanga city upon his arrival in Mindanao
for a two-day tour.
</P>
<P>
He told the leaders that their fears regarding the proposed
Southern Philippines Peace and Development Council "have no basis
at all."
</P>
<P>
"I, therefore, urge everyone to look at this issue objectively,
 he said. "let's not be carried away by our emotions."
</P>
<P>
Ten days ago, the government and the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF) reached an agreement on the setting up of the peace
and development council, which will assist the government in
administrating 14 provinces and nine cities in Mindanao and
Paladin.
</P>
<P>
But since then, officials in the Southern Philippines and some
senators expressed fears that the council, to be headed by MNLF
Chairman Nur Misuari, might weaken the power of the local
governments there. Some senators described the council as illegal,
saying that it would play the role of a provisional government.
</P>
<P>
To dissipate such fears, Ramos told the local leaders that
local government powers, functions and responsibilities will be
intact.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the council is only a transitory
arrangement and the formation of an autonomous government will
still be subject to a plebiscite, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
In giving peace a chance, he said, the full development of
Zamboanga city and the entire Mindanao will be facilitated.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the government and the MNLF are expected to
meet soon in Manila to solve the remaining issues before their
formal negotiations in Jakarta, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF has fought for autonomy in the Southern Philippines in
the past 25 years. Thousands of people were killed in the conflict
between MNLF fighters and government forces.

BRUSSELS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The increasingly serious water
shortage caused by record low rainfall has affected Belgium's
agriculture, livestock husbandry, shipping and other water

Annual rainfall since last July is the lowest for 138 years,

introduced as it was during the last serious drought in 1976.
</P>
<P>
But in spite of the drought, trees and lawns in the capital are
still green, a fact meteorologists attribute to the heavy
rainfalls of the last few years, which has boosted water tables.

ADDIS ABABA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Ministry of
Education said today that preparations are underway to give
vocational training course to dropouts from elementary or
secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national workshop opened here today on vocational
training execution, the education programme and control
department head of the ministry, Awash Gebru, said the training
would start from 1998 and be given in three sections, including
4-7th and 8-10th grade school dropouts, as well as those who have
failed in national examination.
</P>
<P>
The duration of the training ranges from four months to two
years. The courses will involve agriculture, handicraft, home
economics and business administration, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The training will turn out skilled manpower required by the
country in various socio-economic development activities.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government announced last month a three-year
rehabilitation project for over 100,000 street children in the

delegation of the People's Progressive Party (PPP) of Guyana.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, who is also chairman of the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress, extended a welcome on behalf of the
CPC Central Committee to the delegation headed by Janet Jagan,
wife of Guyanese President Cheddi Jagan and a member of the
Executive Committee of the PPP Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that China and Guyana, two developing countries that
are geographically far apart, share the same or similar views on
many important issues. During the past few years, the two
countries have seen a continuous development of exchanges and
cooperation in many fields, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the CPC is willing to continue to develop
its friendly relations with the PPP on the basis of the four
principles for developing party-to-party relations, and China is
ready to continuously strengthen bilateral reciprocal cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Qiao asked Janet Jagan to extend his and Chinese President and
CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin's regards to Guyanese President
and PPP General Secretary Cheddi Jagan.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qiao also briefed the visitors on the
process of China's reform and opening-up, its economic development
and the trans-century development plan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the development of China can only promote peace,
stability and development in the world.
</P>
<P>
Expressing her congratulations on the 75th anniversary of the CPC,
Janet Jagan said she appreciated the CPC's invitation to her to
come to China.
</P>
<P>
She said during her stay here, she has observed the great
changes that have taken place in China in various fields.
</P>
<P>
She noted that China, under the leadership of the CPC, has
found the correct road to development, and she believes the
country will continue to make greater progress.
</P>
<P>
The PPP and the CPC are both ruling parties, and the
development of friendly relations between the two parties is
necessary for the friendly cooperation between the two countries,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Li Chengren, Deputy Head of the International Liaison
Department (ILD) of the CPC Central Committee, attended the
meeting. Li Shuzheng, head of the ILD, also met with the
delegation in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived in China on June 21. Before coming to
Beijing, members visited Shanghai, Qingdao, Jinan and Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
The Guyanese visitors also met with the All-China Federation of
Trade Unions and the All-China Women's Federation. They are

<HEADLINE> Sihanouk Asks Prime Ministers to Pardon Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk
today asked the country's Co-Prime Ministers to agree to a royal
pardon for an opposition newspaper editor who was jailed last week
for defaming them.
</P>
<P>
The king said the offense committed by Chan Ratana, editor of
the Khmer-language Voice of Khmer Youth newspaper, is "evident and
grave," but urged them to exercise Buddhist tolerance.
</P>
<P>
Chan was sued by the two prime ministers last February after
his paper, which supports the opposition Khmer Nation Party, ran a
cartoon and story entitled "Ranariddh is more stupid than Hun Sen
three times a day."
</P>
<P>
A municipal court found him guilty of spreading disinformation,
but an appeal court later changed the charge to defamation in
October.
</P>
<P>
He was jailed on Friday after the Supreme Court upheld the
appeal court ruling of one year's imprisonment and a fine of five
million riels (2,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Your gesture of clemency towards those who unjustly drag you
through the mud will not fail to further increase your
stature ... and will give more credibility and prestige to our
young and liberal democracy," the king wrote in a letter to his
son and First Prime Minister, Norodom Ranariddh, and Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
The king said he too had been a victim of slander by
journalists but he chose neither to respond to them, nor sue
them.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that (you) will accept the inspiration of my example
to give to your enemies who are very unfair and unjustly insolent
to you the same Buddhist tolerance," the king wrote in the letter
released by the palace, but dated from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, the king is entitled to grant anyone an
amnesty, but he said he wanted the support of both premiers before
making a decision.
</P>
<P>
Both the prime ministers later said they would support the king.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe on Restructuring of United Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
on Tuesday intensified his campaign for the restructuring of the
United Nations, saying Africa needs two permanent seats on the UN
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Opening the Second Session of the Fourth Parliament in Harare,
Mugabe said Zimbabwe wanted the UN to be restructured to ensure
accountability and transparency in all its organs.
</P>
<P>
''We support Organisation of African Unity (OAU) calls for two
permanent seats to be allocated to Africa in a restructured UN
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
''Zimbabwe resolutely supports the democratisation of the UN
system. There is need to ensure greater accountability and
transparency in all its organs,'' said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mugabe said Zimbabwe supported the OAU mechanism on
conflict resolution because African problems needed African
solutions.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, this was not to ignore the role of the UN
Security Council as the custodian of world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe would continue to carry out its international
obligations to ensure peaceful resolution of conflicts,
particularly in Africa, in the spirit of co-existence,
cooperation and understanding. enditem

<HEADLINE> Dream Team to Put Up Up-tempo Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Dream Team head coach Lenny Wilkens
hasn't decided on a starting lineup, but he has a clear idea on
how to show the best basketball in the world.
</P>
<P>
"What we're concerned about is being the best that we can be,"
he said after the American Olympic team's first practice. "It's a
40-minute game, not 48 minutes like in NBA, so you never want to
let anybody hang around.
</P>
<P>
"That's why you get after people, I want to play up-tempo. We
aren't out there on a picnic. We'll picnic when the game is
over. That's the only way I know."
</P>
<P>
Charles Barkley agreed with his coach.
</P>
<P>
"It's the Olympics," said the leading scorer on the first Dream
Team. "We want to prove that we are the best basketball team in
the world. I expect to dominate the same way we did at Barcelona."
</P>
<P>
Barkley, one of the oldest players on the team at 33, doesn't
expect to be the leading scorer this time around, however. "I'm
the has-been superstar who's here for moral support," he said.
</P>
<P>
The pressure on the current Dream team is how to match the 1992
squad, which won its eight Olympic games by an average of 43.8
points.
</P>
<P>
"We realize that we're under a magnifying glass and we known
that we're expected to do," said Scottie Pippen, also a member of
the 1992 team.
</P>
<P>
Wilkens, an assistant on Dream Team I, said he he will do a lot
of experimenting.
</P>
<P>
"I told the players everybody is going to play, and through the
exhibitions I'll start different lineups." he said. "As we go into
the Olympics we may have one or two guys who start all the time,
but basically we're going to change it."
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordon, who gave up the chance to play his third
Olympics, was the only player to start every game in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
"I want to give everybody an opportunity to play, but you also
want to keep good flow on the floor, as well," Wilkens added.
</P>
<P>
With such a talented, versatile team, Wilkens can mix and match
and play just about any five he wants, regardless of position.
Some one suggests to play all of three of 7-foot centers --
Shaquille O'Neil, Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robision -- together,
and Wilkens said he would do so.
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to do it one time," Wilkens said. "We'll just have to
see."

<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Now Engines of Economic Prosperity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries in Asia and Latin
America have replaced industrialized nations as the locomotives of
world economic prosperity, a senior German official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a world trade and development meeting in
Bonn, German Minister of Foreign Economic Cooperation Carl
Spranger pointed out the economic growth rate in most developing
countries is estimated at 5.5 percent this year, and 17 of the
22 Latin American countries have controlled their runaway
inflation.
</P>
<P>
But economic growth in almost all the industrial nations
forecast to slow down in 1996. The growth rate in major
industrialized nations like the United States, Germany and Japan
may barely reach the estimated two percent and could be even worse.
</P>
<P>
The German minister said with the same import growth rate, the
top ten Asian economies form a larger market than the United
States and the European Union combined.
</P>
<P>
Rapid economic development in developing countries is one of
the greatest achievements of this decade and one which is due to
their own efforts, he said.

<HEADLINE> India Targeting 100 Billion Dollar Exports by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government will launch
an export drive aimed at increasing the country's share in the
global market from the present 0.62 percent to 1 percent in the
next four years, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Our main aim is to increase exports from 31.8 billion US
dollars last year to about 100 billion by the year 2000," Indian
Commerce Minister B.B. Ramaiah said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of global exports were estimated at 5,000
billion dollars last year and it is growing by about 15 percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
Ramaiah, who assumed the ministerial office following a
expansion of the H.D. Deve Gowda-led ministry on June 28, said
that a cabinet sub-committee under the chairmanship of Prime
Minister Gowda will be formed soon.
</P>
<P>
The new sub-committee is designed to coordinate the activities
of all export-related ministries such as commerce, finance,
railways, surface transport and civil aviation with a view to
removing export bottlenecks, especially infrastructural problems,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he will soon be meeting all the apex chambers of
industry as well as the commodity boards in the country to chalk
out the export targets for the current year.
</P>
<P>
The minister said emphasis will be laid on diversification of
the country's exports to new markets such as those in South
America.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping on Present Situation in Hong Kong  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A combination of positive
influences make the present situation in Hong Kong good, said Lu
Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
During a speech here today, Lu said that since the signing of
the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong,
people's confidence in the future of Hong Kong has kept growing,
rather than weakened.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation between Hong Kong and China's inland areas
has become increasingly closer and their mutual understanding has
deepened daily, he said.
</P>
<P>
These factors all have helped to increase the Hong Kong
residents' confidence in its future, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Hong Kong's economy has maintained a
good momentum for development because it benefitted from the
inland areas' reform and opening up, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Even when the Western countries' economies were at a low ebb,
Hong Kong remained prosperous, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu stressed that the inland areas' reform and opening up,
political stability and economic growth constitute a fundamental
guarantee for Hong Kong's stability and development.
</P>
<P>
His speech also discussed the work of the Preparatory Committee
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and the
relations between China and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the major task for the Preparatory Committee is to
make preparations for the creation of the Selection Committee of
the first SAR government, which will be composed of 400 permanent
Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
The first chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR will be named by
this Selection Committee, which will also elect the Provisional
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping on Present Situation in Hong Kong (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the issue of Sino-British relations, Lu said, Sino-British
relations have improved to some extent over the past year. Last
year, the two sides reached agreement on the question concerning
the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal. And the financial arrangement
for the construction of a new airport in Hong Kong also has
eventually been settled, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Lu noted that Britain began to readjust and improve its
relations with China over the past year in a bid to safeguard both
its economic interests as well as its long-term interests in Hong
Kong. He said China welcomes Britain's efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"It is of vital importance to adhere to the principle of
relying mainly on ourselves on the question of Hong Kong as
proposed by the Central Government," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
"We should also rely on our own strength along with the
involvement of Hong Kong residents in the realization of the
region's smooth transition," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is imperative for China to win over Britain's
cooperation that will be conducted on the basis of the Joint
Declaration, Lu said, because this will be beneficial to
safeguarding Hong Kong's smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
Lu also referred to the relationship between China's inland
areas and the Hong Kong SAR after 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that handling the relations between China's inland
areas and the Hong Kong SAR after 1997 must conform to the
principle of "one country, two systems" and act in accordance with
the Basic Law for the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
No government departments can directly issue orders to or check
up on work of its counterpart of the Hong Kong SAR, he said.
</P>
<P>
If departments, provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities under the central people's government need to set
up institutions in the Hong Kong SAR, they must first get the
permission from the government of the Hong Kong SAR and then
approval from the Central People's government, Lu added.
</P>
<P>
People in China's inland areas who want to enter Hong Kong must
be ratified by the Hong Kong SAR; they do not need go to the
British Embassy for a visa. The control of mainlanders entering
Hong Kong after 1997 will be almost same as it is now, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping also briefed the participants on the Provisional
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR, the Hong Kong residents'
nationalities and their abode rights, and the stability of Hong
Kong's civil servants.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhijian, deputy secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee
of the Chinese Communist Party, presided over the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Sales of Lead-Free Gasoline Rise in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The sales of lead-free gasoline here
have been rising following a government order last year that all
newly-imported automobiles must use lead-free gasoline.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the sales volume in May last year, the sales of
lead-free gasoline rose by 189 percent this year, accounting for
about 30 percent of the gasoline market in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the lead-free gasoline will dominate
Macao's market in three years' time.
</P>
<P>
Macao now has more than 71,000 automobiles running in the
streets, consuming some 33.20 million liters of gasoline each
year.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Government issued the order early last year as a way
to better protect its environment and regularly checked the
implementation of the order.

<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli air force jets earlier
today attacked targets of a splinter group of the PLO's Fatah
faction in Beqaa Valley, Lebanon, according to an announcement of
the army spokesman's office.
</P>
<P>
The operation was apparently aimed at retaliating against the
Palestinian group, which claimed responsibility for last week's
ambush in the Jordan Valley, in which three Israeli soldiers were
killed and two others lightly wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Damascus-based group, which is led by Mohammed Saeed
Moussa, also known by his code name Abu Moussa, said that the
operation was intended to protect peace accords signed between the
PLO and Israel.
</P>
<P>
An army spokesman said that the targets served for preparation
and departure of terrorist attacks. Pilots reported accurate hits
and all planes returned safely to their base, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted reports from south Lebanon as saying
that the planes fired four rockets on the targets which are located
some 20 kilometers from the Syrian border. There are no reports
of casualties so far.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Asked Not to Prolong Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- About half of doctors treating
terminally ill patients have been asked not to prolong their life,
while almost 15 percent say they may not abide by conditions for
mercy killing set by a landmark court ruling, a national daily
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Mainichi Shimbun said its survey of attitudes among the
heads of hospitals around Japan toward euthanasia and death with
dignity shows that many doctors regularly adjust the timing of a
patient's death through such means as terminating life-prolonging
treatment without even gaining the patient's consent.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented survey indicates that a case similar to the
Kyoto hospital chief who recently admitted using a lethal
injection of a muscle relaxant in the "mercy killing" of a patient
in April without the patient's consent could easily occur again at
any time.
</P>
<P>
The Mainichi said it received replies to its questionnaire from
366 doctors at 342 medical institutions.
</P>
<P>
Of the doctors, 172 or 47 percent said they had experienced a
request from a terminally ill cancer patient's family to bring
forward the patient's death.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the replies, however, indicated considerable
resistance to the concept of mercy killing, with 257 doctors, or
70.2 percent, saying mercy killing must not be allowed even under
the court's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Many of the negative respondents said that euthanasia is
"murder" or that the court's guidelines are insufficient.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Raises 1996 Current Account Deficit Projection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government revised
its earlier projection of the current-account deficit for this
year twice as much as 11-12 billion U.S. dollars at an
expanded economic ministers' meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
However, the meeting upheld the forecasts of 7.0 to 7.5 percent
of economic growth and 4.5 percent of inflation rate for the year.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's current-account deficit for the first half of
this year is estimated at 9 billion dollars and the deficit for
the entire year is expected to top 11 billion to 12 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The current account comprises trade in goods and services as
well as investment income and government payments.
</P>
<P>
The country's gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have
grown 7.5 percent on a year-on-year basis in the first half of
this year and the pace is expected to slow down amid slowing
exports and capital investment in the second half. The yearly
growth rate, however, is likely to be somewhere between 7.0 and
7.5 percent as projected earlier.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices increased 3.8 percent on a year-on-year basis
in the first six months, and the new education tax, utility
charges rises and other factors are expected to cause the pace to
surpass the year-end target of 4.5 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
In the final quarter, however, the harvest of farm crops and
stabilized prices of manufactured goods and utilities will push
down the inflation rate to the 4.5-percent level.

<HEADLINE> Way Found to Resolve Aging Drift of Rubidium Atomic Timers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from Beijing University
have found the causes of the ageing drift of rubidium atomic
timers, after 20 years of studies.
</P>
<P>
Atomic timers are precision instruments which provide standard
frequency and time, mostly used in high-tech fields. They are
specifically used in areas such as aviation where micro-second
timing is critical.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the radio and electronics department at the
Beijing University started to develop rubidium atomic timers in
1973.
</P>
<P>
They found that the ageing drift of rubidium atomic timers is
caused by collision frequency and light frequency shifts.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the bad effect that the light frequency shift has
imposed on the rubidium atomic timers, they developed rubidium
absorption bubbles, which was proved effective.
</P>
<P>
Researchers also discovered that both domestically and
overseas-made glass, which is used in making rubidium absorption
bubbles, and the rubidium atoms can produce a kind of chemical
compound through chemical action.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that it is collision between the molecule of
the new chemical compound and rubidium atoms that produces the
ageing drift of rubidium atomic timers.
</P>
<P>
To stop chemical action between rubidium atoms and the glass
wall, they used a kind of glass, which is made from special
materials and well-treated on the surface, in making rubidium
absorption bubbles and made a success.
</P>
<P>
Researchers conducted long-term test on the stability of the
newly-developed rubidium atomic timers, and no ageing drift was
found.
</P>
<P>
There are three kind of atomic timers, which are respectively
made of rubidium, cesium and hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
The ageing drift has blocked the use of rubidium atomic timers
in other, especially high-tech fields.
</P>
<P>
A cesium atomic timer sells for around 50,000 to 70,000 US
dollars, while a rubidium atomic timer sells 30,000 to 40,000 yuan
or about 4,000 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new rubidium atomic timers are expected to replace cesium
atomic timers in some high-tech fields, experts predicted.

Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
An official of the department said that farmers have turned
160,000 hectares of reclaimed land into cropland.
</P>
<P>
Hebei currently still has an estimated 1.9 million hectares of
wasteland that can be reclaimed, the official said, adding that
300,000 hectares of the land can be built into cropland.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the provincial government assigns quotas for
reclaiming wasteland to various counties and prefectures every
year.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has drawn up a plan to reclaim
wasteland throughout Hebei.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever reclaims wasteland will till the land and be benefited
from the land," he said. Individuals farmers and collective units
in rural areas are thus being encouraged to reclaim wasteland with
their money, materials, equipment and techniques.
</P>
<P>
In line with government regulations, farmers can contract for
tilling reclaimed wasteland for at least 20 years and the land
they reclaim can be transferred and inherited, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Launch First Communications Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam plans to launch its first
communications satellite by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Directorate General of Post and
Telecommunications (DGPT), the cost of the system, whose life
expectancy is from 12 to 15 years, is estimated at 200-250
million U.S. dollars. The satellite will help to reduce
telecommunications and tv broadcast charges.
</P>
<P>
At present, Vietnam is receiving world-wide information through
foreign satellites such as Intersat, Intersputnik and Asiasat.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, to ensure the reception and transmission of its tv
programmes, Vietnam now has to lease telecommunications systems
from Thailand (Thaicom), Indonesia (Palapa), and Malaysia (Measat)
at very high rates.
</P>
<P>
As the first step of the project, the DGPT is working out a
plan for orbit slot registration to the International
Telecommunications Union.
</P>
<P>
The dgpt will complete a feasibility study for the project by
the end of 1996 and invite tenders for implementing the project.
</P>
<P>
A number of international companies including Hughes
Corporation and Loral Space of the United States, Alcatel and
Matra Maconi of France, and Nec of Japan have showed their
interest in the project.

<HEADLINE> Aidid Accused of Imposition of Islamic Law in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 2 (Xinhuua) -- North Mogadishu faction leader,
Ali Mahdi Mohamed, has described the announcement of general
Aidid of the Sharia imposition as a very poor treachery meant to
mislead the Somali people.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi, while speaking in his office in north Mogadishu
today, said that he won't trust the call of Aidid to the Islamic
law, adding ''General Aidid has the character of not honoring the
pledges or agreement he reaches with people.''
</P>
<P>
The statement of Ali Mahdi came only a day after General Aidid
has called for the imposition of Sharia laws in the areas under
his control.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to his supporters at Mogadishu Stadium yesterday,
Aidid urged the Muslim scholars to come to a meeting to discuss
the ways Sharia laws could be implemented in the earliest
convenience. ''I am not against the religion, i tell to witness
today that i am calling for the imposition of Sharia laws,'' said
General Aidid.
</P>
<P>
During the press conference, Ali Mahdi called on General Aidid
to stop the bloodleting in Mogadishu and elsewhere in Somalia
before thinking of Sharia imposition in the capital. Ali Mahdi
has also accused General Aidid for being responsible for recent
bloody armed conflicts that occurred in the Somali capital.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the inevitability of war in Mogadishu, Ali
Mahdi said Mogadishu is on the brink of civil war following
General Aidid's continual besiege on Medina neighborhood
inhabited by the clansmen of Ali Mahdi Mohamed. He also said that
General Aidid has received new arms and ammunition from outside
the country, and a senior officer in General Aidid's government
has confirmed the arrival of the ammunition last week.
</P>
<P>
He said the senior officer of the Aidid government has refused
to disclose the amount of the ammunition and its source. But
there are speculations that four planes carrying ammunition have
landed in Balidogle airport, 90 km west of Mogadishu. Unconfirmed
reports say the ammunition has arrived from Libya via Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi has accused the American backed company Sombana and
the Italian compay Somalfruit for providing fuel and money to
General Aidid to further distabilize the situation in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Strike Palestinian Militants' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes carried out this
morning an air strike at a base of pro-Syrian Palestinian
militants in western Beqaa in southeastern Lebanon, but so far no
words on casualties have been given by security sources.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli warplanes launched the air raid around 10:30
a.m. (07:30 GMT) targeting a base of Fatah Al-Intifada at Eit
al-Fakhar just seven kilometers west of the Lebanese-Syrian
border.
</P>
<P>
The Damascus-based Fatah al-Intifada, led by Abou Mussa, is a
splinter group of Palestine liberation organization (PLO) Chairman
Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that two Israeli warplanes fired at the
target seven timing air-to-surface missiles which exploded in
every two minutes and black smokes were witnessed arising into
the sky.
</P>
<P>
Following the air raid, the Israeli forces, from their
positions in the Israeli self-described "security zone" in south
Lebanon, shelled Wadi Usourd near the raided venue.
</P>
<P>
Israeli helicopters also hovered over the area, drawing upward
shots fired by anti-air weapons of the Syrian forces and the
Lebanese army nearby.
</P>
<P>
The security sources added that the Syrian forces and the
Lebanese police blockaded the area shortly after the Israeli air
raid.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio confirmed the raid, and asserted that it came in
retaliation for an ambush taking place on the Israeli side of the
Jordan River last Wednesday, in which three Israeli soldiers were
killed and for which Fatah al-Intifada claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army officers said that the ambush were carried out by
gunmen probably infiltrating from Syria or Jordan.
</P>
<P>
This was the second Israeli air raid at targets in eastern
Lebanon since the Jewish state and Lebanon, under a U.S.-
mediation, reached a cease-fire understanding on April 26, which
ended the 16-day Israeli blitz in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes attacked a guerrilla base of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, near the Moslem Shiite
stronghold of Baalbek city in north of Beqaa Valley on May 31
without causing casualties.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Law-Makers Deliberate Laws on Coal, Mineral Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Eighth National
People's Congress Standing Committee today continued to deliberate
the Draft Law on Coal and Draft Amendments to the Law on Mineral
Resources.
</P>
<P>
Law-makers Li Xuezhi and Tao Aiying held the view that China's
ethnic minority areas have abundant mineral resources but the
state's ownership of mineral resources should not affect local
economy and the life of local residents.
</P>
<P>
Huang Yuzhang said that the Coal Law should have still more
explicit specifications on reducing mining accidents which have
caused serious losses to the state and families.
</P>
<P>
And the state should also make still greater efforts to ensure
the safety of water, electricity, transportation and
telecommunications facilities, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
With rampant coal mining at present, Law-Maker Zhou Zhan'ao
said the state should enhance the protection of state-owned coal
mines, and that private and individual mining businesses should be
kept away from state-run mining areas.
</P>
<P>
As to the draft amendments' stipulation that individual
businesses are allowed to go in for the exploitation of mineral
resources, Law-Maker Zhang Xuwu pointed out that the exploitation
needs advanced technology so as to make fuller use of the limited
resources, but it is doubtful whether individuals are qualified
for the exploitation.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jinghua noted that the interests of people in poor areas,
particular those in ethnic minority areas, should be taken into
account with regard to the exploitation and utilization of mineral
resources.
</P>
<P>
In addition, relations between the state, collectives and
individuals, relations between the central and local governments,
and relations between different departments of the central
government should be well dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Law-Maker Xie Tieli said that those stealing and rushing to
loot coal from trains and at unloading sites must be punished
seriously.

<P>
BANGKOK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has agreed to release
59 jailed Thais to mark the 50th anniversary of Thai King Bhumibol
Adulyadej's accession to the throne, a report reaching here said
today.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi government has informed the Thai embassy in Riyadh of
the decision made in response to Thailand's request.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Saudi royal family members also agreed to attend
ceremonies conducted by the Thai embassy in Riyadh to commemorate
the king's accession to the throne.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries became strained after the
murder of four Saudi diplomats in separate incidents in Bangkok in
1989. As a result, Riyadh began to restrict the number of Thai
workers in the country and delayed the appointment of high-level
diplomats to Thailand.

<HEADLINE> First Tea Farm in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lhasa, July 2 (Xinhua) -- It has been a long, long wait for the
tea-loving people of Tibet. But finally they are able to sip their
very own locally grown tea.
</P>
<P>
Since the 7th century Tibetans have been partial to tea, but
climate and prevailing conditions stopped them from growing their
own tea.
</P>
<P>
Now Tibetans can drink tea produced from a local farm in
Yi'ong, a beautiful place in west China's Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
About 2,250 meters above the sea level on the north slope of
Himalayas, Yi'ong is an ideal place for growing tea.
</P>
<P>
In the summer season the monsoon winds from the Indian Ocean
bring plenty of rain to the farmland, filling the valley with
mists and fog, and in winter, the Nyainqentangla Range blocks the
cold wave from the north.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan people formed the habit of drinking tea in the 7th
century.
</P>
<P>
In the pastoral areas, herdsmen placed brick-shaped tea in
bamboo bags outside their tents to express their wish for a
wealthy life, and in rural areas, the farmers usually boil a pot
of tea beside their fields to drink away their fatigue.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the Tibetans' addiction to tea, no tea trees had
been planted in the region, and all the tea was bought from the
interior areas of the country, until the new tea farm was
established not long ago.
</P>
<P>
Knowing the Tibetan's love of teas, the central government sent
groups of scientists and technicians from the 1960s to carry out
experiments on tea tree planting in southeast part of the region,
which proved successful in Yi'ong.
</P>
<P>
Free from any industrial pollution, the farm has 140 ha of
planting area and can produce 200 tons of green tea and Tibetan
tea a year.
</P>
<P>
The tea trees can be plucked after 10 years of growing, longer
than that in the interior areas. But the harvest season extends to
five months a year in Yi'ong, and the per unit output is four
times that of the farms in the interior areas.

benefit both countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks at a meeting here today with Rod Grams,

<HEADLINE> South Korean Overseas Construction Orders Increase Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's overseas construction
contracts increased an impressive 87 percent in the first half of
this year over the same period last year, the Ministry of
Construction and Transportation said here today.
</P>
<P>
The country received orders worth 5.31 billion U.S. dollars in
the January-June period, up 87.6 percent from the 2.83 billion
dollars registered in the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
The rise was attributed to strong demands in Asia and the brisk
development in the overseas business of South Korean contractors
in the construction sector.
</P>
<P>
Asia came to be the largest market, where South Korean
construction firms obtained orders worth 3.94 billion dollars, or
74.2 percent of the total recorded in the six-month period, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"Seizing upon the government's eased restrictions on foreign
real estate investment, South Korean construction firms have been
actively engaged in developing business overseas," a ministry
official said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry predicted that construction orders from overseas
will surpass the projected goal of 10 billion dollars this year,
given the wide range of international infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Last year, South Korea received overseas orders worth 8.51
billion dollars, 13.9 percent more than the 7.47 billion dollars a
year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Expected To Earn Over 200 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's earnings from exports this
year are expected to exceed last year's figure of 200 million
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
This is revealed on Tuesday by Johnson Mwenya, Manager for
Trade Information and Trade Point Coordinator of the Export Board
of Zambia (EBZ), at the Zambia International Trade Fair (ZITF) in
Ndola of Copperbelt Province.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the expected increase of exports to huge
investment in machinery by most industries this year.
</P>
<P>
Non-traditional products contribute a lot to the export
increase. in this year's ZITF, non-troditional industries are
doing business very well. Mwenya cited some examples such as the
Swarp Spinning Mills earning 22 million U.S.Dollars from
exporting cotton yards, the ZESCO earning 21 million U.S.Dollars
from exporting electricity, and the Kuber Minerals earning three
million U.S.Dollars from exporting emeralds.
</P>
<P>
The EBZ is doing its best to organize Zambian business
companies to take part in trade fairs in neighboring countries as
well as other parts of the world. This will also contributes to
the growth of the country's exports.

city.

government that began with Ssouth Africa's apartheid era in 1948.

The four new cabinet ministers are Pallo Jordan for
environment affairs and tourism, Mohammed Valli Moosa for
provincial affairs and constitutional development, Penuell Maduna

announced the opening of the area in 1990, about 25 billion yuan
has been spent on the construction of major projects such as
highways, bridges, water, electricity and telecommunication
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The construction of two bridges across the Huangpu River, the
major river in Shanghai, have connected Shanghai's east and west,
and the 200 kilometers of advanced highways have linked the area's
four key development zones, Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone,
Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone, Jinqiao Export-Oriented Processing
Zone and Zhangjiang High-Tech Industrial Park.
</P>
<P>
The first phase construction of Waigaoqiao new port area, with
four 10,000-ton terminals, has extended Shanghai Port to the mouth
of Huangpu River.
</P>
<P>
The installation of program-controlled switchboards with a
total capacity of 500,000 lines, as well as the satellite
communication facilities, has also forged closer ties between
Pudong and the rest of China, as well as with the entire world.
</P>
<P>
The four newly built zones are virtually four cities, said Li
Jianeng, whose conclusion has been proved by facts. Looking afar
from the Huangpu riverside, the shabby huts have been replaced by
hundreds of high-rises, modern banks, securities and shopping
plazas.
</P>
<P>
By now about 17 million square meters of apartment buildings,
and seven million square meters of business office buildings, have
shot up in the four zones.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the economic and trade bureau of
the Pudong News Area Administrative Commission, foreign businesses
from 55 countries and regions have funded 3,748 projects in
Pudong, with a total investment of 9.85 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other provinces and municipalities have funded nearly 4,000
projects with an investment of 20 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
At present up to a million construction workers are busy
working on 5,000 projects, such as the third underground tunnel
crossing the Huangpu River, and the second line of the Shanghai
subway, the port and airport projects as well as a concert hall, a
gymnasium and a number of schools and hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Intends to Visit Jordan Before US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has been deeply pondering on which country he ought to
visit first, the U.S., Egypt or Jordan, reported The Jerusalem
Post today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Netanyahu inclined to choose Jordan.
The rightwing Likud leader has an affinity for Jordan, and by
making Amman his first visit as prime minister, he would
underscore this.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is believed to see eye to eye with King Hussein of
Jordan on the need to constrain Palestinian ambitions for
statehood. They also share concern about terror groups harbored in
Syria. During the recent Arab summit, King Hussein complained
about Syria's permitting infiltrations across its border into
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
While in opposition, Netanyahu held at least eight meetings,
secret or open, with either Hussein or Crown Prince Hassan.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu is also concerned that such choice would be seen
as a snub by Egypt, senior officials were quoted as saying.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak invited him to visit Cairo
immediately after his election victory.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is fully aware that Egypt remains the leading
country in the Arab world. In 1992, late Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin visited Cairo before making his trip to Washington as a
symbolic gesture of goodwill and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Piqued by the hard-line stance taken by Cairo at the Arab
summit, Netanyahu is not thought to be keen on visiting Egypt
right now, but he does want to keep his options open in dealing
with Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Ambassador Omar Rifai to Israel said that whenever
Netanyahu would like to come, "we will welcome him. It is only a
matter of scheduling. If he comes in the next few days, it's
fine. If he does not come until after he goes to Washington, this
is also fine."
</P>
<P>
The ambassador sharply denied a report that Jordan is seeking
to publicly distance itself from Israel for fear that it should be
isolated among the Arabs. "Amman has a solid and open relationship
with Israel," he declared. "We feel no reason to be embarrassed
about this. There is no insecurity in the relationship."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu is busy preparing for his journey to
Washington on July 9. He is scheduled to see U.S. President Bill
Clinton, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Defense Secretary
William Perry, and CIA chief John Deutch.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton Administration, which openly supported former
Prime Minister Shimon Peres in the election campaign, is eager to
mend its relations with the Likud government. Clinton invited
Netanyahu to visit Washington immediately after the formation of
his new government. But Netanyahu did not want to do so in a
hurry, saying it would take quite some time to prepare all the
things.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's visit will also include a meeting with Republican
presidential nominee Robert Dole in New York Friday.

1.0789 on March 13.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Universal Atlas Covering All China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- In the computer room at the
National Geomatics Center of China maps emerged on a computer
screen one after another, with deputy director Jiang Jingtong
operating the computer.
</P>
<P>
Asked to see rivers in China, they appeared on the screen. When
asked to narrow it down to Jiangsu Province in east China, the
screen zoomed onto rivers in that province.
</P>
<P>
When asked to view residential areas, Jiang hit the keyboard,
bringing a group of an exquisitely-made maps onto the screen.
</P>
<P>
In another part of the room a worker was busy as a map emerged
from a printer, displaying the poverty counties and regions of
China in different colors. It allowed people to instantly get an
overall idea of the poverty situation in China by viewing the map.
</P>
<P>
All above scenes took place a few days ago, as the center
showed off the latest developments in map-making..
</P>
<P>
China has been making efforts to develop a national fundamental
geographic information system which will provide a digital
information service by collecting geographic information from
national topographic maps, survey control points, air or space
remote sensing technology, some subject information and statistics
data.
</P>
<P>
"We are editing and storing the collected information,
establishing a three-dimensional databank of national fundamental
geographic information," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
"We'll expand its application fields to provide a fundmental
geographic information service to the development of the national
economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
The system consists of four databanks covering topography,
place names, earth, and gravity.
</P>
<P>
Research work on the system began in 1984, and four databanks,
with a scale of one to one million, have been set up since then.
</P>
<P>
"We'll continue increasing the volume and varieties of the
databank, producing maps with such large scales as one to 250,000,
one to 50,000 and one to 10,000," Jiang said, adding that they
will not only set up three dimensional databanks, but also four
dimensional databanks.
</P>
<P>
It has cost the country a long time period, and a large amount
of investment to establish the system. Research staff working on
the system have already applied part of their research results
into practice. More than 30 state departments have accepted their
service, bringing remarkable economic and social benefits to
society.
</P>
<P>
The center has set up a comprehensive databank of the country's
administrative areas, based on the center's topographic data bank
and place name data bank, which can search, display, and draw maps
quickly. The system has been installed and put into use in the
general office of the State Council and the general office of the
Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
"The system is just like an atlas covering all China, which can
provide a rapid search service, analytical data, and basis of
space positioning for subject information, and can speed up the
process of making a chart and bring it up to date," said associate
researcher Liu Ruomei.
</P>
<P>
"Subject information from most of the state departments, such
as highway or railway transportation, forest and plantation,
meteorology and hydrology, geology and seismology, and resources
environment can be added with the fundamental geographic
information to draw various charts," she added.
</P>
<P>
With wide-range application prospects for the system, the
National Geomatics Center will continue to improve the system
after it completes the first ten-year project. Finally it will
become an indispensable atlas for all the state departments and
decision-makers in the commercial sector.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Urged To Repay Borrowed Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 2 (Xinhua) -- All Zimbabweans who borrowed maize
from the government last year have been urged to start repaying
the grain following good harvests this year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Monday, Zimbabwean Minister of Public
Service, Labour and Social Welfare Florence Chitauro said more
than 500,000 tonnes of grain were distributed last year under a
gain loan scheme after an almost total failure of the maize crop
in the 1994/95 season. A special drought levy on income tax was
introduced to help finance the purchases of grain needed.
</P>
<P>
The grain loan scheme was designed to ensure that no one
starved because of the drought, while ensuring that able-bodied
people did not become dependent on state aid.
</P>
<P>
Chitauro said it is important to have the loans repaid so that
the government can rebuild its strategic grain reserve stocks
which should be kept at 954,000 tonnes.

<HEADLINE> Israeli New Coalition Faces Crisis over Religious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli new coalition
governement is facing the first crisis as two religious partners
threaten to quit over a row on a crucial cabinet portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Both the two religious parties, Shas and the National Religious
Party (NRP) want the religious affairs portfolio. For them, the
this portfolio is of major significance which could be used to
exert great influence on the large religious community in this
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Shas escalated its battle with the NRP Monday night by
threatening to quit the coalition if it is not given the religious
affairs portfolio by Wednesday, while the NRP responded with an
identical threat.
</P>
<P>
This underscores the fact that Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu continues to be beset by two coalition problems -- the
allocation of the Religious Affairs portfolio and the National
Infrastructure Ministry he wants to create for Likud veteran Ariel
Sharon.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to bypass the two obstacles to put together the
coaliton before the new Knesset (parliament) opened on June 17,
Netanyahu himself took the religious affairs and housing
portfolios under his control temporarily.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu intends to solve both problems before he
leaves on July 9 for his Washington meeting with U.S. President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
After a relentless tug-of-war, the NRP and Shas finally agreed
to joint custody, but now each wants to be the first, fearing the
other might renege on the rotation deal.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had already decided in favor of Shas, but vehement
protests from the NRP caused him to delay the final decision until
his return from Washington. Shas demanded that Netanyahu implement
at once what he has promised.
</P>
<P>
Nontheless, Netanyahu has expressed hope that a compromise
would be worked out on this matter. Justice Minister Yaacov
Neeman has been required to mediate between the two parties in
order to avert the possible collapse of the new coalition.
</P>
<P>
Another big headache within the coalition for Netanyahu is
that nearly all ministers refuse to give up some of their power
to help create the proposed Infrastructure Ministry allocated for
Ariel Sharon.
</P>
<P>
At this point, no one in the Likud can predict when Sharon
might join the government and in what capacity.
</P>
<P>
The simmering problem is a potential source of trouble for
Netanyahu, as Sharon, to whom Netanyahu is heavily indebted for
forming the Likud-Gesher-Tsomet faction that won the elections,
can mount a powerful internal opposition to him.

<HEADLINE> Official Urges Writers to Learn from Former Cultural Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior Party official today urged
Chinese writers to learn from late cultural minister Mao Dun who
was a genuine Party member and a real revolutionary writer.
</P>
<P>
Zhai Taifeng, deputy head of the Propaganda Department of the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, hoped that writers
would write for the benefit of people, in the way Mao Dun had
pursued, and use Karl Marx's theories to examine various literary
schools and social trends -- even if they are from abroad or
ancient times.
</P>
<P>
"Writers must keep a clear-cut stand in dealing with major and
great issues in literary criticism," he pointed out at an
exhibition in Beijing to recall Mao Dun's deeds. Zhai was helping
launch ceremonies approved by the Party Central Committee to mark
the centennial of Mao Dun's birth on July 4.
</P>
<P>
Mao Dun, one of the first Party members in the 1920s, served as
first Cultural Minister after 1949 when the People's Republic was
founded. He himself was a leading writer in China in the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
His main contribution was to promote the genre of
"Revolutionary Literature", which was a means to help the Party
combat its enemies.
</P>
<P>
One of his representative works, "Midnight", was regarded as a
milestone in contemporary literature. The novel depicted a Chinese
capitalist who was doomed to failure in the 1930s. Mao Dun used
this story to demonstrate the fact that only socialism could save
the country.

China's literature has entered a new era since the reform and
opening policy was introduced in the late 1970s. Various literary
schools have emerged, bringing a cultural renaissance to modern
China.
</P>
<P>
However, some writers, lured by market forces, have created
low-class and spicy works which can spoil people's spiritual
lives, reports said. The Party and government have been repeatedly
called on literary circles to support the socialist cause and
modernization drive.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto: Indonesia to Build Stronger Police Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
continue to strengthen the national police force so that it can
fight both conventional and hi-tech crimes more efficiently, the
local press quoting President Soeharto reported today.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the
Indonesian Police Force Monday, the president said that the
continuation of the police's development will be carried out "in
line with the development of professional, effective, efficient
and modern armed forces based on the (financial) capability of the
state."
</P>
<P>
The police force in Indonesia comes under the jurisdiction of
the armed forces, making the national police strongly dependent on
the military forces for resources.
</P>
<P>
Last week, national police chief Lt. Gen. Dibyo Widodo said the
government had agreed to allow the police, currently with a total
strength of around 178,000, to recruit 30,000 cadets for the
1996-97 fiscal year, which is about three times more than that in
previous years.
</P>
<P>
The police force will also establish eight new provincial
commands this year so that all Indonesia's 27 provinces will have
their own commands.
</P>
<P>
According to Soeharto, the need for the continuation of police
development is meant to help the force curb crimes.
</P>
<P>
"Rapid economic growth, the speedy development of science and
technology, the changes in the community and the influence of
foreign cultures could create criminal acts that we haven't
experienced before," noted the president.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto also urged the police to pay greater attention to the
growth of organized crime syndicates in the country.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe on Government Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
on Monday said members of parliament should not be overzealous in
calling for reduced government spending, but should instead point
out disparities in resource allocation among various sectors.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a reception marking the opening on Tuesday of the
second session of the fourth parliament, Mugabe said that while
the government accepted calls to curb spending, it could not
ignore funding essential social services, such as health and
education.
</P>
<P>
But he said that mps still had a duty to guard against excess
expenditure by the government ministries.
</P>
<P>
The government would ensure that funding for education, health
and infrastructure building was increased while less funds were
reserved for subsidies to public enterprises,he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said commercialisation and privatisation of some
public functions would be used to reduce public funding of
unprofitable sectors.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the land issue, the president urged white
commercial farmers to support the land redistribution exercise,
assuring them there would be enough land left available when the
government acquires farms to resettle landless peasants. Eenditem

<HEADLINE> Clear Waters For China's Baiyangdian Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The water in Baiyangdian Lake
in north China's Hebei Province will become clear again by 1997
with a 300 million yuan (36 million U.S. dollars) environmental
protection project.
</P>
<P>
According to an official at Hebei Bureau of Environmental
Protection, the province is to pour 200 million yuan (24 million
U.S. dollars) to build anther two waste water disposal plants in
the lake area, each with daily waste water treatment capacity of
80,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the two projects will greatly help to reduce
pollution in the lake.
</P>
<P>
The province has already built a power coal ash waste water
disposal plant in the lake area, with daily high-concentration
waste water disposal capacity of 50,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the province has allocated 44 million
yuan to solve pollution problems at 13 big enterprises in the lake
area, and shut down nine paper mills which caused much pollution,
with another 11 paper mills also scheduled for closure soon.
</P>
<P>
Baiyangdian Lake is located in Hebei Province, with a total
area of 366 square kilometers. It consists of 143 shallow lakes.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100,000 boat dwellers live on the lake. With the rapid
economic growth the lake became seriously polluted.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s the water in the lake dried up for four years.
</P>
<P>
After the lake was refilled in 1988, the pollution problem
became worse because of industrial and domestic waste water
drained off from factories and residents in the upper part of the
lake.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years the State Science and Technology
Commission and Hebei provincial government drafted plans to deal
with the pollution problem.
</P>
<P>
A leading group to spearhead the Baiyangdian Lake purification
projects has been established to guide the environmental
protection work.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the building of waste water projects, the
province also built 248 water-proof and anti-pollution toilets in
lakeside villages and 269 domestic waste pools.
</P>
<P>
The lakeside villages have also received money for the
renovation of over 400 oil-burning boats to prevent pollution.

<P>
XIAMEN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Flowers have provided the sweet
scent of success for Zhangzhou City in East China's Fujian
Province.
</P>
<P>
Now the city is set to bloom as China's largest flower
production base with the building of a 50-kilometer long flower
corridor.
</P>
<P>
The grand project has already attracted over 100 million yuan
(13 million U.S. dollars) of domestic and overseas investment from
Guangdong, Guangxi, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines
and Singapore for growing imported varieties of flowers, nursery
stock, potted landscapes and ornamental plants.
</P>
<P>
Zhangzhou, a Chinese traditional flower growing city, is
located in the most southern part of Fujian Province and the
weather and other conditions are favorable for growing flowers.
</P>
<P>
Since China began to implement its opening to the outside world
policy in 1978, the flower industry in Zhangzhou has been
blooming. Annual flower sales volume of the city now has
reached 40 million yuan (4.8 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
To take advantage of the favorable conditions, Zhangzhou
municipal government decided to build a 50-kilometer long and
300-meter wide flower corridor, develop flower-related industries,
processing, transport and organic fertilizer production for flower
growing.
</P>
<P>
A special flower growing administrative center has been
established in the city to deal with flower industry management
affairs and domestic and overseas loans and investment.
</P>
<P>
To attract more flower businesses and flower growers, Zhangzhou
City has introduced preferential policies, such as reducing of
taxes and land leasing fees.
</P>
<P>
The city also provides 3,000 yuan (360 dollars) as subsidies for
growing one hectare of flowers in the planned areas annually in
the first three years of flower growing.
</P>
<P>
Half of the amount will go to growers and the other half will be
given to flower sales people.

<P>
NEW DELHI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- No foreign airlines will be
allowed to operate in the domestic sectors of India at the cost of
Air-India (A-I), the national carrier, Indian Civil Aviation
Minister C.M. Ibrahim said.
</P>
<P>
According to The Times of India today, the minister said this
on Monday when he was specifically asked about the chances of
Singapore Airline coming to operate in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said the code sharing arrangements with
foreign airlines would continue on mutual beneficial basis.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry had urged A-I to take measures to raise
the sagging revenue of the national carrier by operating joint
international routes. Of late, the national carrier has started
losing money in all the sectors it operates except in the gulf
countries.
</P>
<P>
After a review of A-I's functioning, Ibrahim said that he would
request the Finance Ministry to direct government employees to
travel only by A-I on their official foreign tours.

<HEADLINE> Simex Volume UP 46.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore International
Monetary Exchange (Simex) recorded its highest annual volume of
24.3 million contracts in 1995, marking a compounded growth rate
of 46.3 percent over the past 11 years since 1985, its first full
year of trading.
</P>
<P>
Simex Chairman Elizabeth Sam said in the exchange's 1995 annual
report that the exchange more than doubled its net earnings from
19.6 million Singapore dollars (about 13.52 million US dollars) in
1994 to 42.5 million Singapore dollars (about 30.36 million US
dollars) for the year ending December 31, 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Despite Barings, international confidence in Simex has not
been undermined," Sam said in her statement in the annual report,
citing the membership of five new institutions in the year.
</P>
<P>
She said that Simex dealt promptly with last February's
collapse of Barings, with the market functioning normally
throughout. "Neither Simex, nor any of its other members or their
customers suffered losses as a result of the incident," she said.
</P>
<P>
Simex issued its first set of interim financial statements last
September to reassure members and the financial community that the
financial integrity of the exchange had not been affected by the
Barings crisis.
</P>
<P>
Britain's oldest merchant bank Barings collapsed due to futures
trader Nick Leeson's gambles in Nikkei futures on Simex and the
Osaka Securities Exchange.
</P>
<P>
"Simex has proven its inherent strength and ability to weather
major crises such as the Barings incident," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The experience and additional strength that Simex has gained
from dealing under such adverse circumstances can only help to
further secure its foundation for greater advancement in the
coming years," she said.

<HEADLINE> West Dumps Toxic Lead Wastes in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Large quantities of highly toxic
lead wastes from developed countries are being dumped in India in
a form of used car batteries, The Times of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country's legal and illegal import of lead
wastes increased 10 times in the past two years, according to a
study conducted by Delhi-based environmental group Vatavaran.
</P>
<P>
The study said India imported 1,226.45 tons of lead wastes in a
form of old car batteries in 1994-95 against 126 tons in 1992 and
346 tons in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The import rate has increased even more alarmingly in recent
months. Between December, 1995 and March, 1996, the import of
lead wastes totaled 1,533 tons.
</P>
<P>
Vatavaran's Director Iqbal Malik said lax environmental
regulation in India and tightening of controls over recycling of
toxic wastes in developed countries have contributed to this
dangerous flow of wastes into the country.
</P>
<P>
To import wastes, only an open general license is needed. Lead
and other toxic materials are imported in the guise of zinc,
aluminum or other non-ferrous scrap material.
</P>
<P>
Lead emissions absorbed by human blood can cause severe
blood-related disorders. The substance is also known to increase
the risk of hypertension, miscarriage, premature delivery, hearing
loss, low IQ scores and many other physiological, neurological and
kidney abnormalities.

<HEADLINE> India's Trade Deficit Expected to Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- India's Commerce Ministry
projected that the country's trade deficit will decline sharply to
1.5 billion US dollars during the current financial year from 4.5
billion dollars in the previous year, The Times of India reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary Tejendra Khanna told reporters here on
Monday that exports are targeted to reach 38 billion dollars
during 1996-97, while imports are projected at 39.5 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports during 1995-96 amounted to 36.3 billion dollars,
averaging 3 billion dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
The ministry expects a monthly average of 3.3 billion dollars
during 1996-97, adding up to a total import bill of 39.5 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The projections are based on the assumption that world prices
of major import items such as petroleum products would not
increase sharply.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Criticizes Government's Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Leader of Nepal's main opposition
party Man Mohan Adhikari said his party would protest against the
coalition government's policy platform for the coming fiscal year,
according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Adhikari, former prime minister and president of the Communist
Party of Nepal (UML), described as "anti-progressive and
directionless" the policy program presented Monday to parliament
by King Birendra on behalf of the Nepali Congress (NC)-led
government, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The government's policy for the 1996-97 fiscal year starting
July 16 emphasized the decentralization and economic
liberalization while stressing the need for maintaining political
stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, Adhikari was quoted as saying that there was nothing
new in this policy and programs.
</P>
<P>
The government had not included solutions to the problem of
bonded labors in far-western Nepal in the program and failed to
mention measures to maintain law and order in the country,
Adhikari said.
</P>
<P>
Former finance minister and Communist Party leader Bharat Mahan
Adhikari said the government's priorities would only worsen the
economic crisis of the country.
</P>
<P>
The government in its policy platform listed the priority
programs in the 1996-97 fiscal year including unemployment
fighting, tourism development, water resources and export
promotion.
</P>
<P>
The 205-seat lower house of parliament has decided to discuss
the government's policy platform for five days from Wednesday
before holding a vote on it. The main opposition party has 88 MPs
in the house, while the main ruling NC party and its two ruling
partners have a majority of 108 MPs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Militia Members Arrested for Plotting Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Twelve members of an Arizona
militia group were arrested Monday on charges of plotting to bomb
government offices in the Phoenix area, Attorney General Janet
Reno announced.
</P>
<P>
The 12 militiamen were indicted for conspiracy to manufacture
and possess unregistered explosive devices, such as fertilizer
bombs, and unregistered destructive devices.
</P>
<P>
Some of them were also charged with unlawful possession of
machine guns and violation of a statute that prohibits instruction
in using explosives to promote civil disorder.
</P>
<P>
They had trained to use explosives to destroy buildings housing
the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Internal Revenue
Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Secret
Service, the Phoenix Police Department and the Arizona National
Guard, Reno said.
</P>
<P>
The paramilitary group, which called itself the "Viper
Militia," engaged in field training exercises in which members
made and detonated ammonium nitrate bombs and rockets, a
seven-count indictment unsealed in Phoenix says.
</P>
<P>
Ammonium nitrate was used in the bomb that destroyed a federal
office building in Oklahoma City last year. However there was no
indication of any connection between the two incidents.
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, the group made a videotape on May
30, 1994, in which a member discussed approaches, security
measures, communications equipment, fences and adjacent structures
at the various target locations.
</P>
<P>
The tape also provided suggestions for placing explosives so
that they cause the buildings to collapse.
</P>
<P>
The indictment also described that the group since last
November 11 had launched several explosives training exercises,
blasted bombs and fired a grenade.
</P>
<P>
Much of the information in the indictment came from an
unidentified state police officer who infiltrated the militia as
part of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
"These arrests culminate a six-month investigation and avert a
potentially dangerous situation," Reno said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Extradition Still Hard Nut to Crack for Samper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, Colombia, July 1 (Xinhua) -- President
Ernesto Samper now faces sort of a make-or-mar situation as he
tries to mend his fences with both the Colombian congress and the
U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
Semana, a local magazine which hit street today, says that
Washington has requested Samper to take steps so that the
U.S.-Colombian extradition treaty signed in 1979 will become part
of Colombian law before bilateral relations can be normalized.
</P>
<P>
The United States is extraditing Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez
Orejuela, Helmer Herrera Bitrago, and Juan Carlos Ramires Abadia,
four kingpins of the Cali drug cartel, so they could face drug
charges in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Colombia rejected the American request of extradition last week
on the excuse that the Colombian congress clamped a constitutional
ban on extradition of Colombian natives in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Though some judicial authorities in the country argued that the
extradition treaty still remains in effect, the supreme court of
justice refused to incorporate the treaty into Colombian
legislation by reason that some mistakes had been made while
drafting the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Semana magazine quoted Washington as saying that the
president can have the extradition issue resolved since he has the
support of the congress.
</P>
<P>
The lower house of the Colombian congress voted 111-43 last
month to absolve Samper of any wrongdoing stemming from charges
that his 1994 presidential election campaign was partly bankrolled
by drug money.
</P>
<P>
But the majority of the Colombian lawmakers are expected to
block any initiative in reenacting the extradition treaty,
according to the magazine.
</P>
<P>
Fernando Gomez Buendia, director of the Colombian Institute of
Liberal Studies, was quoted as warning that Colombia might be sued
before an international court to have it honor the extradition
treaty.

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The list of "For a United Mostar"
presented by Muslim-dominated parties has narrowly won Mostar
elections Sunday, according to preliminary results.
</P>
<P>
The electoral commission of Mostar reported today the list of
"For a United Mostar" won 48 percent of the votes in the elections
which aimed to set up a unified town council for the
ethnically-torn city under the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The list of Bosnia's Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) won 45
percent of the votes, with the remaining votes going to small
parties and independent candidates.
</P>
<P>
In the 37-seat council, 16 each will be held by Muslims and
Croats with the remaining five by Serbs and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
The elections were formerly scheduled for May 31, but on May 24
the Croat and Muslim sides reached an agreement to postpone the
elections until the second half of June.
</P>
<P>
The delay of the Mostar elections stemmed from Muslim's
complaint that the previous date would prevent refugees abroad
from participating in the elections.
</P>
<P>
During Sunday's elections, the list of "For a United Mostar"
which groups the candidates of the Democratic Action Party, Party
for Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Liberal Bosnia Organization,

municipalities and at the polling stations abroad.

The HDZ list won most votes in the three west Croat-dominated
municipalities.

KUNMING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan Province in southwest China
has established a successful way of forecasting disastrous weather.
</P>
<P>
A low latitude and high elevation have given the province
torrid, temperate and frigid zones, and complicated geological
features tend to cause various disasters, such as mud-rock flows,
hailstone storms, strong winds, floods and freezing.

Through cooperation with scholars at academic institutions in
Beijing, Chengdu and Kunming, meteorological departments in the
province have made major breakthroughs in forecasting weather
conditions. They have been aided by advanced techniques, including
numerical prediction and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological departments have managed to grasp patterns of
activity of disastrous weather conditions, and have established a
computer system to foretell weather conditions in long, medium and
short periods.
</P>
<P>
The system has proved successful in forecasting earthquakes,
forest fires and floods in the province.

<HEADLINE> Ren Shuwen, China's Stone Age Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- China's 'Stone Age' man Ren Shuwen
turned down 300,000 yuan when a Taiwan visitor pleaded to buy a
rare stone from his massive collection.
</P>
<P>
Ren is unique as the country's leading private collector of
rare stones. He is so immersed in his full time hobby that he has
amassed debts, spent his pay and borrowed from relatives to turn
his collection into a mini-mountain of rare and beautiful gems.
</P>
<P>
One of his prized pieces alone is worth a million yuan - but
Ren refuses to part company with a single item from his collection.
</P>
<P>
He was born in Lingbi county, east China's Anhui province, a
place which is famous for its precious stones and jadestones.
</P>
<P>
Ren has collected 100,000 pieces since he first became
interested in rare stones 1987.
</P>
<P>
Lingbi stone is top grade among all China-produced
gemstones. The stone can produce different sounds when people hit
different parts. Linbi stones were used in making musical
instruments in ancient times, a craft continues even nowadays.
</P>
<P>
More people are visiting Lingbi to see the rare stones. Local
people often tell visitors to look for Ren Shuwen, because he has
the largest number of the best and most precious stones.
</P>
<P>
Ren allows people to view his collection, but he refuses to
part with any, even a county magistrate and the secretary of
county party committee had to leave empty handed when they admired
his collection.
</P>
<P>
People said that the stones are Ren's very life.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, Ren nearly spent all his holidays on
mountains, seeking the most precious stones.
</P>
<P>
Other people usually sell their stones, but Ren often buys
them. He uses all his wages, borrows from his relatives and even
gets loans from banks. He now has debts running into tens of
thousands of yuan.
</P>
<P>
Modern household appliances cannot be found in his house, but
there is a mini-mountain of rare and precious stones.
</P>
<P>
Ren's stones weigh from less than 100 grams to several
tons. Some stones can produces beautiful sounds, some present the
images of mountains and rivers, figures and animals.
</P>
<P>
Ren has a stone which is named as "Little Huangshan Mountain",
since it looks like the famous scenic mountain in China's Anhui
province.
</P>
<P>
The stone has a flat bottom which has a circumference of one
meter. The stone contains over 200 hills, the highest is 33 cm and
the lowest is the size of a finger.
</P>
<P>
A Taiwan visitor wanted to buy the stone for 300,000 yuan, but
Ren refused with a smile.
</P>
<P>
It usually takes Ren hours, sometimes several days to give a
proper name to his stones. Sometimes he invites several friends,
sitting together, to seek a name for the latest addition to his
collection.
</P>
<P>
Ren said he has one huge stone, which is valued at least one
million yuan. He wants to donate it to the state.
</P>
<P>
Ren has exhibited his stones in Beijing. He also plans to
compile a picture book about Linbi rare stones and continue to
exhibit his stones in other places around the country.

<P>
Ikeda, who arrived here Sunday after attending the Group of
Seven (G-7) industrialized nations conference in Lyon, France, is
the first senior Japanese official ever visiting Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day visit, the foreign minister declared a
technical aid project worth five million U.S. dollars to help
development in Ukraine's electronics and telecommunications
sectors.
</P>
<P>
He also assured the Ukrainean side of the loan of 200 million
U.S. dollars that the Export-Import Bank of Japan provided under
an agreement signed by Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma with the
Japanese leaders when Kuchma visited Japan in March last year.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said his country welcomes Japan's investment. He added
that Ukraine's new constitution encourages all kinds of foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda also told Kuchma that the just-concluded G-7 summit
highly praised Ukraine for having shipped all its nuclear warheads
to neighboring Russia early in June.
</P>
<P>
Japan would like to help Ukraine further destroy its nuclear
infrastructure, he said.
</P>
<P>
When talking about the Chernobyl nuclear plant, site of the
world's worst nuclear accident in 1986, Ikeda said the G-7
appreciates Ukraine's decision to close down the station
completely by the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under great pressure from the international community, Ukraine
made the decision early 1995 in exchange for at least three
billion dollars in aid from the West.
</P>
<P>
But Kuchma told Ikeda that the delays by the G-7 in providing
the agreed aid might make Ukraine re-consider the timetable for
shutting down of the nuclear plant.

<HEADLINE> Australian Trade Deficit Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Australia saw a blowout in its
current account deficit as its foreign trade imbalance
deteriorated in May.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted current account deficit surged to 2.153
billion Australian dollars (1.701 billion US dollars) in May after
rising to 1.970 billion Australian dollars (1.556 billion US
dollars) in April, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figure was worse than market expectations, with most
local forecasters predicting that the current account deficit
would drop to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.343 billion US
dollars) in May.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit widened to 437 million Australian dollars
(345.23 million US dollars) in May from 232 million Australian
dollars (183.28 million US dollars) in April.
</P>
<P>
The blowout of trade deficit was mainly due to a stronger
Australian dollar that encouraged imports and discouraged exports.
</P>
<P>
Exports fell over 4 percent to 6.184 billion Australian dollars
(4.885 billion US dollars) in May, while imports decreased merely
1 percent to 6.621 billion Australian dollars (5.231 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the monthly current account deficit
climbed above 2 billion Australian dollars (1.58 billion US
dollars) in near one year.
</P>
<P>
The worse-than-expected current account deficit figure is
expected to undermine the strength of the Australian dollar, which
is already under pressure of depress base metal prices on the
world market.

<HEADLINE> Germany's First Solar-Powered Plane Off Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Germany's first solar-powered plane
took off on a test flight at the Stuttgart airport at noon today,
press reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The plane, with a wing span of 25 meters, weighs 165 kilograms,
half the average of a glider. It is powered by 21 square meters
of solar cells on the wings and the elevator.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which cost 1.5 million German marks (about 984,000
U.S. dollars) to build, is the work by 40 students from the
Stuttgart University over a period of two and half years.
</P>
<P>
The plane will fly to Ulm to take part in a solar-powered plane
contest set for July 7. About 30 planes from Austria,
Switzerland, Japan, the United States and other countries are
expected to join in the race, which will offer the winner a prize
of 100,000 marks (65,610 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The German Ministry of Research and Development and the
Daimler-Benz Company provided finance for the project.
</P>
<P>
Rudolf Voith-Nitschmann, head of the project, predicted that
gliders powered by solar energy will be off the ground for
practical use in 10 to 15 years.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- China's market for air-conditioners
is expected to be better than last year because of the hotter
weather and better living conditions, the "Market Daily" has
reported.
</P>
<P>
China sold 5.3 million air-conditioners in 1995, and is
expected to sell up to six million this year, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The paper quotes experts as saying that the brisk market is
mainly concentrated in such areas as the cities along the Yangtze
River, and along the Beijing-Kowloon Railway.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign-made air-conditioners will take only 10
percent of the market share because most of them do not deserve

<HEADLINE> Golden Bridge Program Promotes Sichuan Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese province has won a top
prize for turning ideas into reality as part of the state-backed
"Golden Bridge program."
</P>
<P>
The nationwide program to speed up the translation of
scientific and technological achievements into production has also
provided a massive boost to the local economy in Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The southwest China province implemented the Golden Bridge
program three years ago, and its outstanding performance in the
program earned it first prize at a recent national conference.
</P>
<P>
So far 2,100 projects have been completed, contributing five
billion yuan to the province's annual output value, 960 million
yuan to its annual profits and taxes, and helping save 1.5 billion
yuan each year.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years experts have researched 175 projects to
provide consultation to government policy-making. They have also
worked on a further 324 projects to promote technological progress
for large and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Another focus of the Sichuan Golden Bridge program has been
help for rural enterprises. In the past year 850 rural enterprises
have received aid from the program, which helped over 100 of them
to turn losses into profits.
</P>
<P>
The program has also promoted the introduction of a large
number of farming techniques throughout the province.
</P>
<P>
More than 25,000 scientists and technicians have worked on the
program over the past three years.

<HEADLINE> Longest Newspaper Billboard Erected in Kunming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 passers-by
curiously halted in front of a long "wall", erected in a downtown
square of Kunming City, to read newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The wall is a 320-meter-long newspaper billboard, on which some
280 kinds of domestic newspapers are posted. It is believed to be
the largest one in China.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the billboard, 120 news stalls and 118 small
newspaper billboards have been built throughout the downtown and
suburban areas of Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan
Province, according to the Shanghai-based "Wen Hui Bao".
</P>
<P>
The facilities bring latest home and international news to
Kunming citizens free, and were all provided by Luo Mingsheng, a
private entrepreneur from a local book-reading society.
</P>
<P>
Luo has put more than three million yuan (about 360,000 US
dollars) into the facilities, as well as some 50,000 yuan in
monthly expenditure on newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Luo plans to build at least two newspaper billboards in each of
127 cities and counties of the province, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Presents Before WTO Trade Tiff With US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has presented before
the World Trade Organization (WTO) its row with the United States
over Washington's decision to impose its own "country of origin"
rules for garment imports, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Escolastica Segovia, executive director of the Philippine
Garments and Textile Export Board, said Monday that the board had
filed a complaint over the new US import policy with WTO's Textile
Mediation Board.
</P>
<P>
The rule of origin of a particular export product refers to the
country or location from which the raw materials of the product
were acquired.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, Philippine exports are required to secure
garment export visas from the country where the raw material for
the products is sourced.
</P>
<P>
Segovia said the rule may restrain at least 30 local garments
and textile manufacturers from exporting their products to the US
since they did not clearly define the specific source of origin.
The total loss from the new rule could reach 30 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has described the policy as a form of
unfair trade practice. It is now awaiting the WTO's arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Other Southeast Asian countries have also voiced complaints
about the unilateral US action, arguing that the WTO, not the US
Congress, is the proper body to dram up harmonized country of
origin rules.

<HEADLINE> French, Egyptian Presidents Meet on Middle East Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and his French counterpart Jacques Chirac met here tonight
on the Middle East issue.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process must continue and the principle
of land for peace must be maintained, Mubarak, on a 24-hour visit
here, told reporters after the meeting at the Elysee Palace.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Mubarak briefed Chirac on the main outcome
of the Arab Summit Conference held in Cairo between June 22 and 23.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the French president told Mubarak the major
opinions of the western countries on the Middle East issue that
appeared at the Group of Seven summit in Lyon, France, last week.
</P>
<P>
He said the basic principles of the peace process reached
between Israel's former Labor government and the Palestine
Liberation Organization in Madrid, Oslo and Taba should be
observed.
</P>
<P>
Right-wing party leader Benjamin Netanyahu's win in Israeli
premier election recently has caused great worry in the Arab
world, as he still keeps in closet his main policy on the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the United States have come across some differences
on the issue. "We are holding different opinions on the future of
the peace process," said Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mussa in
Cairo on June 29.
</P>
<P>
But the Arab countries are satisfied with the European efforts,
especially those of France, on the maintenance of Middle East
stability, said Mubarak's political consultant Oussama Al-Baz, who
is accompanying the Egyptian president.

<HEADLINE> Perry Promises Early Release of Bomb Probe Facts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States will release facts
unearthed in its investigation into the bombing that killed 19
Americans in Saudi Arabia without waiting for the probe to be
finished, Defense Secretary William Perry said today.
</P>
<P>
"I will make a full report to the public as the facts become
available," Perry told a news conference after meeting with
Italian Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta.
</P>
<P>
"We will not wait until the 45-day deadline to complete the
investigation", he said. "We will report as the facts come in
during that 45-day period."
</P>
<P>
Perry has appointed a commission to investigate last Tuesday's
bombing at a U.S. personnel residential complex in the eastern
Saudi city of Dhahran that killed 19 air force personnel and
injured dozens.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded in a fuel truck after the two drivers walked
away and got into another vehicle. They had been told by Saudi
security guards to move their truck as they tried to drive into
the northern end of the compound.
</P>
<P>
Perry said the probe would also recommend ways to reduce the
vulnerability of U.S. troops stationed around the Middle East to
terrorist attacks, adding this is where "we believe our troops are
at the greatest risk."
</P>
<P>
Many of the residential compounds where Americans live have
been put under strict security measures and are still guarded by
members of the Saudi National Guard since last November's blast.
</P>
<P>
Four Saudi nationals detonated a car-bomb at a U.S.-run Saudi
National Guard training center on November 13, 1995, killing five
Americans and two Indians and wounding some 60 others. They were
convicted and executed in May.

<HEADLINE> Radioactive Scrap Metal Shipped To China From US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- An emergency team has been called
in after a consignment of radioactive waste was shipped to China
from the United States. The contaminated scrap metal was
discovered in north China's biggest port city, Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials in the port discovered that the contaminated
scrap iron and steel had been shipped from the US. It follows the
arrival in China earlier of large quantities of hazardous waste
from the United States, sparking claims from environmentalists
that the US was dumping its own unwanted rubbish in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials in Tianjin said they had seized 78.336 tons
of radioactive waste iron and steel sent from Houston, Texas. They
claimed it could cause pollution to the local environment and
threaten the health of local people.
</P>
<P>
The scrap metal was stacked in seven non-standard containers
and reported to Tianjin Customs by the China Materials Recycling
Corporation on June 28.
</P>
<P>
A local customs official said all of the scrap metal registered
various levels of radioactivity. One container in particular had a
level 30 times above China's state limit of radioactivity.
</P>
<P>
The radioactive waste could cause serious damage to the local
environment, and threaten local people's health, local official
said.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Customs has formed an emergency work team to handle the
waste and carry out further investigations into the shipment.

<HEADLINE> Pearl River Trade Flows Smoothly From Upper Reaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- With improved water
transportation, the Pearl River is playing an increasing role in
promoting the regional economy along the river.
</P>
<P>
Originating in the Maxiong Mountain in Yunnan Province, the
2,214-kilometer-long Pearl River is the longest in south China,
spanning Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, and Jiangxi
provinces.
</P>
<P>
While the upper reaches of the river are rich in minerals, but
poor in transportation, the lower reaches are economically
developed, while poor in mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
In recent years greater efforts have been made to improve the
port and navigation channels of the upper reaches of the river. As
a result coal, zinc, tin, marble, timber and other materials can
now be easily shipped to the lower reaches along the river.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years a total of 950 million yuan (11.445
million US dollars) have been invested in the building of 38 new
berths, and improving the navigation channel of 448.5 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> China Proposes to Stop Illegal Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Illegal mining activities must be
stopped to protect China's natural resources and prevent further
waste of the country's mineral resources, stated a written
proposal submitted at a symposium on mineral resources, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The 12-day symposium, which concluded on Saturday in Beijing,
was organized by the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources and
teh Organization Department of the Central Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party and aimed to promote the administration of
the country's mineral sector.
</P>
<P>
The proposal said that illegal exploration and exploitation has
wasted mineral resources, which harms a country in need of its
resources. The amount of mineral resources per capita in China is
only 58 percent of the world average.
</P>
<P>
China's mineral sector provides 80 percent of the country's
energy and more than 95 percent of the country's raw materials for
industrial use.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee a sufficient supply of mineral resources for the
country's sustainable development, all levels of government must
protect mineral resources and make mineral administration an
important part of government work, the written proposal urged.
</P>
<P>
The lack of laws on mineral resources in the past and the
insufficient implementation of the laws at present have caused
chaos in the country's mining sector.
</P>
<P>
Many mines are explored or exploited illegally, without
State-issued licences.
</P>
<P>
As China strengthened the implementation of laws and other
mineral regulations in the past several years, notable progress
was made in treating the once chaotic exploration and exploitation
of the country's mineral resources, according to officials from
the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources.
</P>
<P>
About 98 percent of China's mining disputes have been solved,
involving some 400 mining sites in dispute when the Law on Mineral
Resources took effect in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Law-enforcement departments have dealt with 17,526 cases
involving illegal exploration and excavation of mineral resources
during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
About 30,000 excavating units had their excavation licences
suspended, and 3,009 units were shut down.
</P>
<P>
To date, the country has more than 10,000 state-owned mining
companies, 150,000 collectively owned and 130,000 privately owned
mining firms.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen the administration of the mining sector, the
state has since 1994 begun collecting compensation fees from
mining units in line with the Interim Measures on the
Administration of the Use of the Mineral Resources Exploration
Results with Compensation. The fees collected in 1994 alone
amounted to 200 million yuan. The amount increased to about one
billion yuan last year.

<HEADLINE> Hard Work and Brainpower A Winning Formula For Zhejiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese province short of
natural resources has proved that it has an abundance of another
rich resource - brainpower.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang in east China has taken advantage of its army of
hard-working skilled people to chalk up amazing successes in the
business world.
</P>
<P>
Now more township-run enterprises in Zhejiang want to build on
their success by showing more interest in trans-national
operations. Their early global enterprises have not only brought
huge benefits, but sharpened their competitive edges.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 70 township-run enterprises in
the province have so far launched nearly 100 businesses in over 20
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Many of the enterprises have achieved initial successes in
their overseas operations. A township-run resin bottle plant from
the province's Huangyan city boosted its market share in the
Philippines by ten times through four years of endeavor.
</P>
<P>
Another township-run enterprise dedicated to the production of
sewing machines has won 70 percent of the market share in Central
and South American countries.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, Zhejiang is a province short of
natural resources, but rich in skilled laborers. Many of the
township-run enterprises adopted the economic strategy of
developing export-oriented products by taking foreign raw
materials, blazing a new path for local farmers to become rich.
</P>
<P>
Some of the township-run enterprises even run farms or fish
ponds in the United States and Canada, bringing them big
benefits.

Russian Black Sea Fleet, also won support from the Ukrainian
president Leonid Kuchma and the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
According to a protocol signed today by Ukrainian Deputy
Defense Minister and Naval Commander, Vladimir Beskorovainy,
Commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, Victor Kravchenko, and
Victor Seyeonov, mayor of Sevastopol where the fleet is now
anchored, the two navies will carry out a series of activities to
mark the occasion from July to October.
</P>
<P>
This decision is believed to demonstrate the respect of the
military to the glorious past of the two peoples, and to enhance
friendship, cooperation and exchanges between the two navies, the
Independent News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
It also shows that Ukraine and Russia have basically resolved
their dispute over the division of the Black Sea Fleet after
Ukraine won its independence from Russia.

SAN JOSE, July 1 (Xinhua) -- At least four people were killed
by a tropical storm that has been harassing this country since
last Friday, the Red Cross said today.
</P>
<P>
Bad weather is feared to continue for another 36 hours.

that buried two vehicles on a road in the south of the country and
that the number of victims is feared to increase.
</P>
<P>
The storm, originated in the Pacific Ocean, caused landslides
which have closed the Pan American highway and other roads in
southern Costa Rica.

<P>
At least 500 people have been relocated in seven refuge centers
as a consequence of ensuing floods.

<HEADLINE> NZ Business Confidence Dips Further: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence in New
Zealand has dipped further with companies now expecting lower
profits and higher unemployment in the coming year, found the
latest business outlook survey conducted by the National Bank.
</P>
<P>
The result of survey showed a net 30 percent of the respondents
now expect unemployment to rise, and the trend is similar across
all sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture and manufacturing sectors are the most
pessimistic on the question of hiring staff.
</P>
<P>
Though a net 25 percent of businesses surveyed believe trading
conditions to worsen in the year ahead, they are mostly concerned
about the pace of the decline.
</P>
<P>
Tight monetary conditions, which the Reserve Bank favors to
keep down inflation, are one reason causing the decline. The
Reserve Bank forecast the conditions will not be eased until the
second quarter of next year, and many businesses are feeling the
bite with mortgage interest rate rises and falling company
profits.
</P>
<P>
The coming election under the new Mixed Member Proportional
representation system has also brought about uncertainty, the
survey said.
</P>
<P>
"With the general election looming and expectations often self-
fulfilling, a clear signal is being sent to the politicians -- be
up front about your true policy intentions," the survey said.

<P>
WIMBLEDON, ENGLAND, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion
Steffi Graf of Germany swept her young opponent Martina Hingis in
straight sets 6-1, 6-4 on Monday to emerge as the first player to
enter the women's singles quarter-finals of the Wimbledon Tennis
Championships.
</P>
<P>
Graf, also world number one player, took only 54 minutes to
beat the 15-year-old Swiss player to gain revenge for a 6-2, 2-6,
3-6 humiliating defeat by Hingis at the Italy Open in May.
</P>
<P>
It was Graf's third victory in four meetings with the Hingis
and Graf also defeated the young talent in straight sets 6-3, 6-1
in the first round of last year's Wimbledon Championships.
</P>
<P>
"I think I was probably on top of her right from the beginning
on, because I lost the last match against her. I think I didn't
give her the chance to get into the match." Graf said after the
game.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to go for my shots right from the beginning and
that's what I was doing. In the beginning of the second set I
stared not to finish off the points as well, but still there were
some good rallies," Graf said.
</P>
<P>
On the performance of her opponent, Graf said, "I have
mentioned so many times before, she's got really a lot of talent
out there and even if grass isn't her favorite surface."
</P>
<P>
"I think from the way she's been trying (over) the past few
months, there is definitely a very good chance in the near future
she'll be getting a lot closer to the top 5," she added.
</P>
<P>
The-12-seeded Japanese player Kimiko Date created another upset
Monday afternoon by beating 4th seeded Spanish ace Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario 5-7, 7-6, 6-3 to secure a berth in the women's singles
top-8 clashes.
</P>
<P>
Also in Monday's women's fourth round matches, the other top
seeds including Jana Novatona of Czech Republic, Mary Joe Ferandez
of the United States and Mary Pierce of France all defeated their
opponents to enter the women's singles quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Meredith McGrath of United States and Judith Wiesner of Austria
defeated their Slovak and American opponents to became the only

<HEADLINE> Teachers' Families in Henan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- In more than 1,000 families in
Henan Province, family members spanning three generations have
been teachers.
</P>
<P>
There are now nine teachers in the family of Zhang Lijun, a
local teacher in Weishi County in the central China province. His
ancestors began teaching in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911),
according to the genealogy of Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Like his ancestors, Zhang devoted his life to education. He was
a teacher for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tiecheng, a farmer teacher in Shanxian County, became a
primary school teacher 20 years ago due to the influence of his
father, who has been teaching in the mountainous area since 1948.
</P>
<P>
And Wang's son also will be a middle school teacher following
his graduation from a teachers' school.
</P>
<P>
These teachers' families are similar to teachers' schools: both
train teachers from generation to generation, a local education
official said.
</P>
<P>
Ren Zhongmin, who became a preschool teacher at the age of 18,
said that teaching is the ideal career for him. He learned to love
the profession from his parents and grandparents, who have
contributed greatly to the country's education system.

<HEADLINE> Australian Government Still Envoys Support of Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The coalition government of
Australia has still enjoyed strong support of voters despite the
"slip" episodes of its ministers in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The latest public opinion poll Newspoll showed that the
Liberal-National coalition government was still enjoying the
support of 47 percent of voters, comparing with 48 percent two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor party was supported by 40 percent of
voters, unchanged since mid-June.
</P>
<P>
On the question of who would make the better prime minister,
Prime Minister John Howard was leading the opposition leader Kim
Beazley by 28 percentage points. Howard was endorsed by 52
percent of voters, comparing with the 24 percent for Beazley.
</P>
<P>
Though the coalition government has slipped down from a record
high support rate in the federal government's history, it still
enjoyed a comfortable lead over the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer apologized for his
failure to fully reveal Asian countries concern over the
Australian government's dumping of its soft loan program DIFF for
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
John Herron, minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Affairs, became the first minister to be censured since the
coalition took office in March. He was criticized by the Senate
for his handling of Aboriginal affairs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rules Out IFOR's Direct Involvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States today ruled
out an immediate and direct involvement of the U.S.-led
International Peace Implementation Forces (IFOR) in Bosnia in
capturing Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic although it has
voiced dissatisfaction with his resignation statement.
</P>
<P>
"He's an indicted war criminal, and what we hope is that he
will wind up in The Hague for prosecution by the War Criminal-War
Crimes Tribunal," U.S. Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a
press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman noted that capture "does not have as its
primary mandate searching him and others out to capture them."
</P>
<P>
Burns said that the IFOR would take the Bosnian leader into
custody only when "they encounter him."
</P>
<P>
Burns made the remarks when commenting on the statement made by
Karadzic that he had handed power to his deputy but would retain
his title as president of the Serb separatists until Bosnia-wide
elections are held on September 14.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that Karadzic's statement is not going
to meet the strong demand of the international community for his
influence stepping down form the position of power and influence.
</P>
<P>
"Karadzic should be out of power, he should be out of any kind
of political influence, he should be out of the country
physically, and he should be in The Hague (for trial)," Burns
said.

<P>
NEW YORK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street rallied
today, led again by rebounding technology shares, as investors
grew more confident the Federal Reserve won't raise interest rates
at this week's policy meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 75.35 points to 5,729.98,
its best one-day gain since adding almost 100 points on March 18.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indexes rallied into the close too.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with the volume totaling 345.73
million shares, down from the 462.22 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 2.50 to 361.70, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.25 to 675.88.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 12.63 to 1,197.65, its third
straight gain of more than 12 points; and the American Stock
Exchange's market value index rose 3.46 to 580.25.
</P>
<P>
The technology sector continued to bounce back from a recent
slide on worries about computer industry profits.
</P>
<P>
The market initially derived few leads from a series of
conflicting economic signals this morning. But many analysts
concluded that the inflation-leery Fed will keep short-term
interest rates unchanged for now and consider the data comes out
this month and next.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending jumped
0.8 percent to 5.15 trillion U.S. dollars in May, the steepest
advance in three months and double the increase in personal
incomes. The increase was further evidence that consumer spending,
two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, continues to drive
the economy.
</P>
<P>
In another report, the Commerce Department said construction
spending declined 0.9 percent in May, the first drop in three
months.
</P>
<P>
The reports came a day before the Fed's policy makers convene
for a two-day meeting on the central bank's interest rate strategy.
</P>
<P>
Conflicting reports on the economy Monday are causing many
analysts to believe Federal Reserve policy makers will keep
short-term interest rates unchanged this week. This more or less
enhanced the confidence of investors.
</P>
<P>
This week, investors also will see new data on May's factory
orders and June employment levels.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador on Poverty Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Chinese
diplomat said on Monday that while it is essential for the world
organization to strengthen coordination within the system, it is
also important to have coordination with the recipient countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Acting Permanent Representative to the United Nations
Wang Xuexian made the remarks at the coordination segment of the
annual substantive session of the U.N. Economic and Social
Council.
</P>
<P>
"As pointed out by the Secretary-General in his report, many
organizations of the U.N. system have participated in poverty
eradication activities from different angles and in varying
degrees," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore entirely necessary to strengthen coordination
between various organizations and at various levels to enhance
efficiency and ensure that their efforts are not be confined to
within the U.N. system," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But it should be emphasized that coordination between the
relevant organizations of the U.N. system and recipient countries
is also very important aspect," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Only by ensuring sound coordination and cooperation in this
respect and closely linking the U.N. system activities in the area
of poverty eradication with the actual needs and priorities of the
recipient countries can the U.N. play a better role in poverty
eradication activities and the efficiency and effectiveness of
poverty-relief resources and projects be further enhanced." he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Wang also appealed to the world community to create
an international economic environment conducive to the world
efforts of eradicating poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Widespread poverty in the developing countries is a
complicated issue and an expression of economic backwardness and
underdevelopment," he said. "It is caused, to a large extent, by
their unfortunate historical experiences and the unfavorable
international economic environment."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, poverty should not be viewed in isolation," he
said. "it is essential to resolve deep-rooted problems to
eliminate the root causes of poverty."
</P>
<P>
"In this connection, it is necessary to further strengthen
international cooperation in this field of development, establish
an international economic environment that will facilitate the
attainment of development objectives by all countries in the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the international community should take effective
measures to alleviate debt burdens of the developing countries and
provide them with necessary assistance in terms of financial
resources and technology so as to bring into play their inherent
potentials for development and enhance their ability of
eradicating poverty and improving their people's living standards
through economic development.

WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States is not
satisfied with a statement that Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic, an indicted war criminal, had handed power to his deputy
but would retain his title as president until Bosnia-wide
elections are held in mid-September, a spokesman for the U.S.
State department said today.

oblique. It's murky. We're unclear what it means," Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns told a press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a satisfactory outcome. This outcome is not going
to convince anybody that Karadzic has taken the steps that
everyone in the international community is now demanding," the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Burns said that the U.S. administration "has been closely in
touch with" Carl Bildt, the top European diplomat responsible for
implementation the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
"We remain convinced that four things must happen," Burns
stressed. "Karadzic should be out of power, he should be out of
any kind of political influence, he should be out of the country
physically, and he should be in The Hague (for trial)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that not only "remains the American
position," but also is the international position.
