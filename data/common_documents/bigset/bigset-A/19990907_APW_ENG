<HEADLINE> Vodafone Woos Rival Bell Atlantic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Vodafone AirTouch PLC is wooing one-time rival  
Bell Atlantic Corp. in an effort to expand its U.S. mobile phone 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodafone AirTouch, the world's largest cellular phone company,  
confirmed Tuesday that it wants to form a trans-Atlantic alliance 
with Bell Atlantic, a venture that could pose a stiff challenge to 
U.S. competitors Sprint Corp. and AT&AMP;T Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based Bell Atlantic refused to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Such a partnership makes good strategic sense, industry analysts  
said. An alliance would bring together Vodafone AirTouch's business 
in the southwestern United States with Bell Atlantic's operations 
along the East Coast, creating a nationwide mobile-phone network. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bell Atlantic's resentment over an earlier deal could  
undermine the talks before they bear fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodafone AirTouch was formed in January when Vodafone of  
Newbury, Berkshire, bought San Francisco-based AirTouch 
Communications Inc. Vodaphone paid $56 billion, outbidding Bell 
Atlantic in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of ill will on the part of Bell Atlantic,'' said  
Sean Johnston, a London-based analyst with the French bank Societe 
Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	AirTouch and Bell Atlantic had cooperated in a joint venture  
called PrimeCo Personal Communications, which is now being 
disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic is currently working out details in a proposed $65  
billion combination with GTE Corp. The merger is expected to be 
completed later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodafone stressed that agreement on an alliance was far from  
certain, and analysts warned that any deal also could collapse over 
questions of control. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alliances are easy to form and easy to break, and have a  
tendency to break,'' said Steve Scruton of British bank HSBC. 
</P>
<P>
	If the two companies go further and decide to form an outright  
merger, the union could be jeopardized if one partner tries to 
seize a dominant interest in the business, Scruton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodafone AirTouch also said it is continuing to review a number  
of other options to develop its U.S. mobile operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodafone AirTouch has more than 6 million customers in Britain  
and almost 9 million in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Godzilla Returns to Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Godzilla has returned -- and it's not the slick,  
computer-enhanced creation of Hollywood, but the honest-to-goodness 
original in all its skyscraper stomping, zipper-up-the-back glory. 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans of the legendary lizard felt the U.S. film last year  
strayed too far from the spirit of the original. The Hollywood 
creature, for example, looked nothing like the original and 
slithered around Manhattan skyscrapers rather than flattening 
everything in its path. 
</P>
<P>
	But Japan's quintessential B-movie monster is rediscovering its  
roots in ``Godzilla Millennium,'' now being filmed by Toho Co., the 
studio that gave birth to the world's favorite mutant dinosaur in a 
1954 classic. 
</P>
<P>
	The new episode in the Godzilla saga -- this is Toho's 23rd  
Godzilla movie -- is due out in December, and is aimed at saving the 
raging reptile's reputation after the widespread panning of the 
big-budget Hollywood release. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't feel love for Godzilla in the U.S. version,'' said  
Tsutomu Kitagawa, a 41-year-old actor who wore the 180-pound, 
sweltering rubber Godzilla suit during a recent Tokyo shoot. ``In 
Japan, people treat Godzilla with respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To prepare for the Godzilla role, Kitagawa made a point of  
studying the old Toho movies in search of the monster's unique 
charm and to do justice to its grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the secret, he found, was the Godzilla strut.  
</P>
<P>
	``Godzilla heads straight to his goal, no matter what stands in  
his way. In that sense, he's a lot like me,'' said Kitagawa, who 
stands five-foot-three but plays a 180-foot giant reptile. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting a common opinion here, director Kenji Suzuki said the  
American rendition looked more like a sequel to ``Jurassic Park'' 
than a true Godzilla film. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they were going to call it Godzilla, they should have come  
up with a more Godzilla-like Godzilla,'' Suzuki said during an 
interview at the Toho set. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony's Columbia-TriStar, which made the 1998 ``Godzilla,'' has  
distribution rights in the United States, so the new film will only 
be shown in Japan. But it will eventually be available on video in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	With a budget of $10 million, a fraction of the $100 million  
Hollywood ``Godzilla,'' Toho's version doesn't try to get fancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of miniature models of buildings and telephone poles --  
Godzilla's beloved stomping grounds and the film's main settings -- 
have been carefully crafted with glue and spray paint. Some are 
shattered once and then pasted together to make sure the pieces go 
flying apart just right. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie opens with Godzilla emerging from the ocean in an  
eerie fog. From there, Godzilla treks to a nuclear power plant, 
drawn by the radioactivity that was behind its fateful rebirth, 
caused by nuclear testing in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie does use some computer-graphics technology, including  
a still-secret climactic metamorphosis. But the filmmakers say the 
special effects never become more important than the story -- and 
care is taken so that the miniatures never upstage the monster. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's like a childhood friend,'' said 37-year-old set designer  
Isao Takahashi, who like many Japanese of his generation grew up on 
Godzilla movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seeing the American Godzilla was like meeting a stranger with  
the same name.''

<HEADLINE> Big Tobacco Makes Mistrial Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The tobacco industry derailed the start of the  
second phase of a landmark smokers' trial Tuesday with a mistrial 
motion charging jurors are too prejudiced to decide monetary 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury found in July that the nation's five biggest cigarette  
makers deceptively produced a deadly product and was scheduled to 
begin hearing the money question Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The status of the case was uncertain after a state appeals court  
ruled Friday that damages must be decided one smoker at a time, 
eliminating the possibility of a blockbuster judgment some analysts 
feared could be as high as $200 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday Circuit Judge Robert Kaye called the panel into court  
only long enough to tell them they would have to come back later in 
the week after he decides several motions. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaye ordered attorneys to return to court Wednesday on the  
motions. 
</P>
<P>
	The mistrial motion claims jurors are biased based in large part  
on suspicions that some jurors tuned into news media coverage of 
their verdict covering up to 500,000 sick Florida smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	When Kaye asked jurors Tuesday if they had seen any news  
accounts of the case, no one spoke up. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigarette makers believe the jury will be influenced by a  
conscious or unconscious desire to conform to ``an overarching 
theme'' of news coverage that the jury made the right decision by 
going against the industry.

<HEADLINE> Museum Wins Battle Over Monet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An original Claude Monet and two works by Camille  
Pissarro that were willed to the blue-collar city of Lawrence 
cannot be sold to raise money for the city's cultural programs, a 
federal judge ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of the paintings, which includes pieces by several  
lesser-known artists, has sparked a dispute between leaders in 
Lawrence and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly 90 years, the paintings have been at the museum, and  
museum leaders have fought Lawrence's effort to sell the paintings. 
It is estimated the Monet and Pissarro works could bring in between 
$5.5 million and $7.5 million at auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Monet's ``Field of Poppies, near Giverny,'' the Pissarros and 14  
other works were the property of the Rev. William Wolcott, who in 
1911 willed the paintings to the private Daniel White Fund to 
``create and gratify a public taste for fine art, particularly 
among the people of Lawrence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolcott ordered the pictures housed at the MFA until a suitable  
gallery could be built in Lawrence, a city 35 miles north of Boston 
better known for industry than culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a century later, a gallery is still not in the city's  
plans and trustees of the art decided to reclaim the art and sell 
it at auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The MFA fought the move, saying the will stipulates that the  
trustees maintain ownership of the paintings ``permanently and 
inalienably,'' and may not sell them. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Margaret Hinkle agreed. ``The Trustees  
are to have permanent possession and control of the paintings. 
Therefore nothing in the will permits the Trustees to sell the 
paintings,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Griesinger, an attorney for the MFA, said the museum was  
``delighted that the court has decided that the most important 
paintings in the collection will definitely not be sold and will 
remain available to be seen by people in this region, including 
people from Lawrence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of the remaining 14 paintings -- which include much less  
valuable works by American artists Hugh Bolton Jones and Alexander 
Lawrie -- were to be decided separately. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Renehan, an attorney for the art's trustees, said he  
would appeal the decision, and said he would ask that a separate 
trial on the remaining works be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	Griesinger said that if Lawrence were to build a gallery the MFA  
would happily give the paintings back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't own them,'' he said, ``but the will requires us to  
have them under the current circumstances.''

<HEADLINE> Shooting Suspect's Interview Aired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A man charged with killing two U.S. Capitol  
police officers told a government psychiatrist he was trying to 
reach a computer in the building that would make him immortal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been murdered and cannibalized a few times (while  
institutionalized),'' Russell Weston Jr. says in an interview taped 
six months after the July 1998 shootings and broadcast Tuesday 
night on CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes II.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weston, 42, is charged with murdering Capitol Police officers  
John M. Gibson and Jacob J. Chestnut in the Capitol on July 24, 
1998. He has been at the Federal Corrections Center in Butner, 
N.C., since May 5, when U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan 
determined he was incompetent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview broadcast by CBS, Weston told a government  
psychiatrist that a computer in the U.S. Senate will return him to 
life if he is executed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be given the death penalty. I will be made to die,'' he  
says on the tape. ``Whenever I die, I only die for maybe three or 
four seconds. As soon as I do, I end up in the great safe of the 
U.S. Senate which is Ruby Satellite Control. ...That program will 
time reverse sweep me away and when it sweeps me away it will 
reverse me back to a point where I am no longer deceased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS did not say how it obtained the tape. Weston's lawyers could  
be not be reached Tuesday night for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Weston also said on the tape that his mission in life was to rid  
the world of cannibals and that he has learned that the judge in 
his case ``was involved with black-market racketeering, murder and 
cannibalism.''

<HEADLINE> Wizards Sign Top Draft Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Wizards signed first-round  
draft pick Richard Hamilton to a three-year deal worth just over 
$5.9 million, ending a delay that began when Connecticut 
All-America fired his agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy is famous now but he's going to be a hell of a lot  
more famous when he helps the Wizards win the championship,'' owner 
Abe Pollin said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're out to have a very competitive team,'' Pollin said. ``We  
are going to be in the playoffs this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards also announced Tuesday that they signed second-round  
draft choice Calvin Booth from Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, drafted seventh overall this year, had agreed to a  
three-year, $5.9 million deal in July, but fired his agent before 
it was signed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel as though I'm blessed to be here,'' Hamilton said.  
``I'm very excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-6, 185-pound Hamilton scored 27 points to lead  
Connecticut past Duke in the NCAA championship game this year and 
was named the most outstanding player of the 1999 Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton averaged 21.5 points in 1998-99 and was co-Big East  
Player of the Year, with Miami's Tim James. 
</P>
<P>
	Second on the Huskies' career scoring list with 2,036 points,  
Hamilton is the only UConn player to score 700 points in a season 
twice in his career and 500 points in each of his first three 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-11 Booth was the Big Ten career leader in blocked shots.  
He is limited to the rookie minimum salary of $301,875 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel both of these young men have the ability to come in  
and help us be a better team right away,'' general manager Wes 
Unseld said.

<HEADLINE> Buckeyes Insist Rambo's a Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- One game into his career as a starting  
flanker, Ken-Yon Rambo is waiting. He's waiting to catch the ball, 
waiting for Ohio State to throw it his way. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all comes down to patience,'' he said. ``I'm going to let  
things happen out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Buckeyes' 23-12 loss to Miami in the Kickoff Classic,  
Rambo was as invisible as Ohio State's passing game. His stats? One 
catch for one yard gained. The Buckeyes threw to him only twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they schemed us pretty good,'' coach John Cooper said.  
``Maybe we should have gotten him the ball more. But they did a 
nice job on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed they were scared of our speed,'' Rambo said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rambo spent most of his first two college seasons on the  
sideline. Unable to beat out incumbent Dee Miller, he returned 16 
kickoffs for a 21.1-yard average and caught only 12 passes. 
</P>
<P>
	With Miller moving on to the NFL last spring, many thought Rambo  
would finally step in. Ohio State receivers coach Chuck Stobart is 
confident the speedy junior's time will come. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ken-Yon is just a guy waiting for the opportunity. He's no  
different than what Terry Glenn was for a long time, or Dee Miller 
was or Dimitrious Stanley was,'' Stobart said, referring to three 
other late-blooming Buckeye receivers in recent years. ``All those 
guys waited for their time to have the ball thrown to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there were breakdowns elsewhere. The offensive line did not  
offer much protection for quarterback Austin Moherman, who was 
starting his first game. As a result, Moherman didn't have time to 
look for anyone other than the primary receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't that he wasn't seeing me,'' Rambo said. ``He didn't  
have a lot of time back there. They had him shaken up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moherman said it wasn't Rambo's fault.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's making a big deal out of Ken-Yon only having one  
catch,'' Moherman said. ``But Ken-Yon did what he was supposed to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doing a good job blocking and running routes doesn't show up in  
the stats, however. Fans are already howling that Rambo's speed is 
not being used. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Ohio State's starting wide receivers averaged 12  
catches and 196 yards receiving a game, but that was with Big Ten 
player of the year Joe Germaine throwing the ball. Rambo and 
Germany totaled five catches for 57 yards with a rookie 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said the Buckeyes must get the wideouts back in the game  
if they want to beat No. 14 UCLA on Saturday. Otherwise, Ohio State 
could open 0-2 for the first time in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA stopped recruiting Rambo three years ago when he didn't  
meet freshman eligibility requirements. When he finally did make 
the grade, he narrowed his choices to Southern California and Ohio 
State because both continued to recruit him. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he thinks he has something to show UCLA -- and those who  
think he has disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got 12 more games to go,'' he said. ``I'm still looking  
to catch a lot of passes and keep contributing to the team.''

<HEADLINE> 'Candid Camera' Creator Dies at 84 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Allen Funt's comical handiwork  
always popped up where it was least expected: in a talking mailbox, 
a trick coffee cup or a bowling ball that would roll back without 
finger holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Only after viewers enjoyed a hearty laugh would Funt's popular  
catch phrase release his unwitting foil from befuddled wonder. 
``Smile!'' they'd be told. ``You're on 'Candid Camera!' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Funt died Sunday at his Pebble Beach home of complications from  
the 1993 stroke that forced him into retirement, the show reported 
in a statement. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	``Candid Camera,'' which Funt created, produced and directed,  
aired off and on from 1948 to 1990 and was considered a forerunner 
to other reality-based television shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``People toss around the word pioneer all the time, but Allen  
Funt was really one of those rare people,'' said Michael Naidus, a 
spokesman for CBS-TV. ``He created what has become an entire 
programming genre.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The network continues to air ``Candid Camera'' on Friday  
evenings, with Funt's son Peter and Suzanne Somers as hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier years, Funt himself appeared in many ``Candid  
Camera'' gags, along with such regulars as Dorothy Collins in the 
1960s and comedian and author Fannie Flagg (``Fried Green 
Tomatoes'') in the 1970s. A young Woody Allen appeared in some 
early shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The TV program was born of Funt's ``Candid Microphone,'' a radio  
show the New York native originated after his Army service in World 
War II. He was working as artist for an ad agency, but looking for 
a different job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned the power of radio watching Eleanor Roosevelt do her  
show,'' he recalled in a 1987 interview with The Associated Press. 
``I used to go up to Hyde Park and hold her papers. I was just a 
messenger, but it planted the bug of radio in me. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got my hands on an old wire recorder that was the forerunner  
of tape recorders,'' Funt said. ``That's how it began. In those 
days, we had to lug around these enormous recorders and camera 
equipment and find a place to conceal them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show had its television premiere, still called ``Candid  
Microphone,'' on ABC in 1948. It bounced to different networks in 
its early years, eventually getting picked up by CBS in 1960 for a 
seven-year run. In 1960-61, it was the seventh-best rated show in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	A syndicated version ran from 1974-78. In the 1989-90 season,  
CBS aired a number of ``Candid Camera'' specials featuring Allen 
and Peter Funt as co-hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	Funt was born in New York City and went on to earn a bachelor's  
degree in fine arts from Cornell University. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the years, Funt said he was never caught in a  
hidden-camera trick. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awfully hard to catch someone who does this for a  
living,'' he said. ``Nobody ever really turned the tables on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After his stroke, Funt remained an inspiration to his family,  
Peter Funt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He endured many hospitalizations and treatments, yet did so  
with good spirit and a ferocious will to live,'' he said in a 
statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Funt is survived by his five children.

<HEADLINE> Group: China Torturing Tibetans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese police have jailed, tortured and harassed  
Tibetans in areas outside Tibet who are opposed to China's rule of 
their Himalayan homeland, a human rights group said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tibetans have been punished for putting up posters calling for  
China to leave Tibet and for sending letters of support to 
prisoners, Human Rights Watch said in a report based on interviews 
with refugees who fled to India. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of China's ethnic Tibetans live in provinces  
adjacent to Tibet itself -- Sichuan, Gansu, Yunnan and Qinghai. 
``Arrests of local activists in these eastern Tibetan regions 
deserve the same scrutiny and the same condemnation,'' said Sidney 
Jones, Asia director for the New York-based advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited five Tibetans who had been detained for  
criticizing China's control of Tibet. In most cases, they were 
tortured, though police sometimes used gentler treatment in hopes 
of recruiting informants, the report said. Upon their release from 
prison, the men were denied jobs and harassed, and eventually moved 
to India. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolkar Kyap, a student who put up posters advocating Tibetan  
independence, was chained by his wrists to ceiling pipes by police 
in Gansu province, the report said. It said they told him that if 
he did not confess, he would be ``beaten and forced to tell the 
truth like we squeeze out toothpaste.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Badzra Trinley, a Buddhist monk, was detained in 1994 in Gansu,  
the report said. He was beaten and shocked with cattle prods, made 
to strip and doused repeatedly with ice water in midwinter. 
</P>
<P>
	Tension in ethnic Tibetan areas drew attention last month when  
two foreign researchers, an American and an Australian, were 
detained in Qinghai, near the site of a controversial World Bank 
project to resettle Chinese farmers in a traditionally Tibetan and 
Mongolian area. The researchers' ethnic Tibetan translator, a 
Chinese citizen, also was detained. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers were deported after protests by the Australian  
and U.S. governments. The American suffered severe injuries when he 
fell or jumped -- the circumstances remain unclear -- from a third 
floor window while in police custody. The fate of the translator is 
unknown.

	The regions cited in the report were brought under Chinese  
control by the end of the 18th century. Tibet itself remained 
largely independent until Chinese troops invaded in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	Human Rights Watch said it has no position on Tibet's political  
status but supports the right of Tibetans to express 
pro-independence sentiments peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tibetans involved in political activities face arbitrary  
arrest, incommunicado detention and trials that ignore all 
standards of openness and fairness,'' the report said. ``Torture of 
detainees after arrest is common, and conditions in both detention 
centers and prisons are said to be poor in terms of food, medical 
treatment, sanitation and working conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police would not immediately comment on the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	China's constitution guarantees freedom of speech and other  
civil liberties, but dissidents are routinely jailed, often 
sentenced to lengthy prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Tibetans have chafed under China's often severe rule. They  
revere the exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama. He fled in the 
midst of a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959 but remains popular 
despite efforts by Chinese authorities to discredit him.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Presented at U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Richard Holbrooke presented his  
credentials as the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations on 
Tuesday and emphasized the importance of the world body to U.S. 
foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	On his first official day as the U.S. envoy, after waiting more  
than a year to fill the post, Holbrooke had one message: The United 
States is committed to the United Nations at the highest level. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott had asked to  
come to his swearing in ceremony ``to symbolize the nation's high 
and continuing commitment to the United Nations, to the importance 
of the work that it does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not ... have taken this job if the president and the  
administration were not committed to the U.N., and to make it 
work,'' he said. ``So frankly, people should stop asking if the 
United States is committed to the U.N. We have problems ... and 
we're going to work on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the contentious issue of Washington's $1.6  
billion in arrears to the United Nations, Holbrooke has also 
promised the U.S. Senate that he would push for U.N. reform, an 
issue which Annan believes the world body is tackling quite 
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke was the last of five new U.N. ambassadors to present  
his credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the private presentation in Annan's office,  
Holbrooke fielded a few questions from reporters, standing between 
Talbott and deputy U.S. ambassador Peter Burleigh, whom he praised 
for filling in for him for the past year ``with distinction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton tapped Holbrooke in June 1998 to replace Bill  
Richardson, who became energy secretary, but the nomination was 
stalled for 14 months as the Justice and State departments 
conducted ethics investigations into his business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, several Republican senators refused to act on the  
nomination because of various unrelated political issues. 
Burleigh's confirmation as U.S. ambassador to the Philippines is 
being held up for similar reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	After presenting his credentials, Holbrooke discussed the  
challenges in Kosovo and the crisis in East Timor with Annan, 
accompanied by Talbott. The two Americans later met with Russia's 
U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, who just returned from Kosovo, Bosnia, Albania and  
Macedonia, brokered the 1995 Dayton accords that ended the 3 1/2-year 
war in Bosnia and later served as Clinton's special envoy to 
Yugoslavia on Kosovo. He is expected to brief the Security Council 
on Kosovo on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Skip Holtz Remains Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina offensive coordinator Skip  
Holtz remained in the hospital Tuesday as his concerned father 
prepared the Gamecocks' offense for this Saturday's game at 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz, 35, was at Lexington Medical Center for the second  
straight night. Doctors have not determined the cause of the severe 
abdominal pain he's felt since last week, South Carolina coach Lou 
Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been my son for 30-some years and this is the first time  
I can ever remember him going to a doctor,'' Lou Holtz said, 
``ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Holtz was resting comfortably, school spokesman Kerry Tharp  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lou Holtz said Skip was on intravenous treatments for the past  
70 hours. He had a fever since Wednesday night and had gone to the 
doctor Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wouldn't let (the doctor) tell anyone,'' Lou Holtz said.  
``He was in great pain Saturday. But he hid it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Holtzes were at North Carolina State this past Saturday for  
the Gamecocks' 10-0 loss. On Sunday, Skip complained of abdominal 
pain and went to the hospital for tests. He went to the emergency 
room Monday for more tests and antibiotic treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Lou Holtz talked with his son Tuesday and was going to see him  
after practice. Doctors had wanted to perform a laparoscopy, a 
process where a slender endoscope is inserted into the abdominal 
wall. Skip did not want it done without knowing what was wrong, his 
father said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd just like to know what's going to be done before they go  
in,'' Lou Holtz, 62, said. ``If you're my age you don't care. If 
you're 35, you want to know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should Holtz improve, he could come home Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's says he's feeling better,'' Lou Holtz said, ``but we've  
got to see if the temperature went down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fever could be an indication of a viral infection, ``but  
they got different synopses, they don't know,'' Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starter Phil Petty said he wasn't aware last week that Skip, who  
also is quarterbacks coach, was hurting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't a distraction so far,'' Petty said. ``I'm just more  
concerned with talking to him to see if he's OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skip has missed the past two practices and his father took a  
more active role with the offense. He spent about 30 minutes with 
the offensive linemen after practice. Lou Holtz briefly lined a few 
of them up in three-point stances, but mostly sat on the practice 
field talking to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Skip's hospital time, his father wasn't ready to give up  
on his son making South Carolina's opening Southeastern Conference 
game at Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Lou Holtz said there was still time to see if Skip felt well  
enough to travel, ``but I'm counting on him being there.''

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Alan Clark, a maverick Conservative Party  
legislator who blew the whistle on British arms sales to Iraq, 
flaunted his philandering and flirted with Margaret Thatcher, died 
Sunday at age 71. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1993 political diaries hit the bestseller list. They were  
packed with unflattering descriptions of political colleagues, 
betrayals, incompetence and Clark's serial extramarital affairs. 
They included tales of addressing the House of Commons while ``not 
entirely sober'' and of brushes with the one woman to whom he 
appeared faithful -- the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Clark nonchalantly announced during the trial of three  
British executives charged with illegally exporting defense-related 
equipment to Iraq that he had encouraged the sales. The executives 
were acquitted and the government sharply criticized in a judicial 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Retiring once from politics in 1992, he made a successful  
comeback five years later. Nearly 70, Clark secured the nomination 
for London's Chelsea and Kensington district. He returned to the 
Commons in May 1997 elections in which the Conservatives lost power 
to the Labor Party.

<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Alabama native David McFarland, an editor  
at the Pensacola News Journal, died of an apparent heart attack 
Sunday. He was 40. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarland's conversational Sunday column often revolved around  
local news events; and he did not shrink from issuing sharp 
criticism of local newsmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	He also worked at the Alabama Journal in Montgomery; the  
Sarasota Herald-Tribune, the Palm Beach Review and The Anniston 
(Ala.) Star. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarland is survived by his father, Samuel McFarland; two  
half-brothers, Jim Trucks and Virgil Trucks Jr.; and a half-sister, 
Carolyn Beckwith.

<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Robert C. Notson, who joined The Oregonian  
as a reporter in 1925 and retired as publisher 50 years later, died 
Monday. He was 96. 
</P>
<P>
	Notson guided the paper through part of the Depression and World  
War II and rebuilt its staff after a long strike in the 1950s. He 
saw the paper through its transition from paste pots and clackety 
manual typewriters to the first newsroom computers. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the newspaper in 1925 and drew the annual Rose  
Festival as one of his first reporting assignments. He was promoted 
to city editor in 1936 and to managing editor in 1941. He became 
executive editor in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years later, Notson succeeded Michael Frey as publisher, a  
job he held until his retirement in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Notson worked briefly for a Salem newspaper before attending  
Columbia University and joining The Oregonian. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1956, he supervised an investigation by reporters that  
exposed union racketeering and organized crime in Portland. The 
effort won a Pulitzer Prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Notson is survived by his wife, Adelia; two daughters; five  
granddaughters and three great-granddaughters.

Betty Rendel, a longtime GOP activist in Indiana who served five 
years as the president of the National Federation of Republican 
Women. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendel died Sunday at her home after a lengthy illness. She was  
79. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendel served as president of the National Federation of  
Republican Women from 1980 to 1985. She also was vice chairman of

the well of an elevator in Rome. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Ungari's body was recovered on Monday night, but authorities  
believe the accident may have occurred on Friday and gone unnoticed

as head of the government's human rights commission.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Won't Use City Funds for Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- After a spirited debate, the City Council  
went on record Tuesday as opposing the use of existing public funds 
for an NFL team, although it did leave some loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution was largely a symbolic measure, since the city  
has offered no taxpayer money to bring a team to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	A plan by a private group to put an expansion team in a  
remodeled Los Angeles Coliseum stalled when league officials 
complained about a lack of public funds for the project. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution, passed by a 9-5 vote, stated that there would be  
no new taxes, no increased taxes and no risk to the general tax 
fund committed to bringing an NFL team to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution didn't address future taxes on revenue that would  
be generated by a team, and didn't preclude using public money to 
increase parking spaces at the Coliseum. NFL officials have said 
parking at the stadium is inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	Because negotiations with Los Angeles bogged down, Houston  
apparently is the frontrunner for the league's 32nd franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL set a Sept. 15 deadline for a decision on the expansion  
team but league officials have said they still intend to work on 
putting a team in Los Angeles in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL could tell Houston to begin building its stadium and  
promise that city a team without designating whether it would be 
the expansion team or an existing team. That would give groups 
competing for a team in the Los Angeles area more time to work on 
their proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who leads the attempt to return  
an NFL team to the Coliseum, said a new parking structure would 
benefit the museums already in surrounding Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Councilman Joel Wachs was the most adamant supporter of the  
no-tax-money resolution, saying the city had not benefitted from 
the NFL teams that played in the Coliseum in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Raiders didn't do squat, the Rams didn't do squat, and a  
new team is not going to do it,'' Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said contributing public funds for a team would mean ``more  
profits to billionaire owners'' of NFL teams and ``crumbs to the 
taxpayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ridley-Thomas, whose district includes the Coliseum, noted that  
other developments such as the new Staples Center arena are 
improving the areas around them, and argued that a remodeled 
Coliseum and an NFL team would do the same around the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridley-Thomas has been pitching an idea that would use tax money  
generated by an NFL team -- as opposed to present tax funds -- to 
help build a parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are saying no increased taxes, no new taxes, no danger to  
the general fund,'' Ridley-Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wachs didn't like that idea, either.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're talking about future taxes,'' he said. ``That's  
exactly what's wrong with this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the league, which had been negotiating exclusively with  
the Coliseum, decided to open the competition to other proposals, 
suburban Carson has moved back into the picture and a group headed 
by billionaire Marvin Davis has spoken with NFL officials about 
building a stadium at Hollywood Park in Inglewood.

<HEADLINE> Cisneros Trial Finally Set To Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than a year and a half after being  
indicted on conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges, former 
Clinton Cabinet member Henry Cisneros is going to trial in a case 
that relies heavily on tapes secretly recorded by his ex-mistress. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection was expected to begin today in the high-profile  
case against the former Housing and Urban Development secretary, 
who at one time was considered a rising star in the Democratic 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	An 18-count indictment against Cisneros contends that while he  
was being considered for a Cabinet post in Clinton's first 
administration, he conspired with his one-time paramour, Linda 
Jones, to conceal from FBI agents the scope of his more than 
$250,000 in payments to her. Cisneros has pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, who herself ran afoul of the independent counsel  
prosecuting Cisneros, is the government's star witness, albeit one 
whose credibility will come under attack from Cisneros' high-dollar 
legal team. She agreed to testify against her ex-lover in a bid to 
gain a reduction in her 3 1/2-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighty-eight tape recordings that Ms. Jones secretly made of her  
phone conversations with Cisneros as their relationship soured are 
at the heart of Independent Counsel David Barrett's case. Cisneros' 
lawyers labored mightily during a 13-day pretrial hearing in July 
to prohibit their use, saying many tapes bore signs of heavy 
editing. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin rejected the defense's  
argument and will allow prosecutors to use all or parts of the 26 
tapes they want to play for jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros ``has presented no direct evidence that the voice on  
the tapes is not his, nor that the statements attributed to him are 
inaccurate,'' Sporkin said of the tapes, recorded between April 
1990 and December 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones' recordings, some of which the government acknowledges  
were edited, capture conversations in which she and Cisneros 
discussed their financial dealings. The tapes, most of which have 
yet to be heard publicly, also reflect Cisneros' characterizations 
of his discussions about the money with the Clinton transition team 
and the FBI agents conducting his Cabinet background check. 
</P>
<P>
	During that background check, Cisneros admitted giving Ms. Jones  
financial support after their affair burst into public view in 1988 
while he was mayor of San Antonio, costing her a marriage and a 
career as a political fund-raiser. But prosecutors contend he 
falsely told the FBI he never paid her more than $10,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges that Cisneros, who is now president of  
the Spanish-language television network Univision, paid her more 
than $264,000 between 1990 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros, who served as HUD secretary from 1993 through 1996,  
has said he offered financial support because he felt sorry for Ms. 
Jones after their affair became public. 
</P>
<P>
	His legal troubles were triggered when Ms. Jones filed a  
breach-of-contract suit against him in her hometown of Lubbock, 
Texas, in 1994, charging he had reneged on his promise to support 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	A few months later, she took her claims to the tabloid TV show  
``Inside Edition,'' where she accused Cisneros of lying to the FBI. 
Based on that accusation, Attorney General Janet Reno initiated a 
Justice Department inquiry and in 1995 requested the appointment of 
an independent counsel.

<HEADLINE> `Sixth Sense' Soars at Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The end of the summer movie season failed to  
exorcise the ghostly grip ``The Sixth Sense'' has on the box 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The tale of the walking dead took in $28.5 million over the  
four-day weekend, according to industry estimates Monday. It was 
the movie's fifth straight weekend as the country's No. 1 film and 
a new box-office record for Labor Day, when movie attendance 
typically begins to trail off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixth Sense,'' starring Bruce Willis in the tale of a boy who  
communicates with ghosts, grossed almost as much as the next four 
movies' combined total of $30.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just amazing,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of  
Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks movie-ticket sales. 
``Nobody expected it to be this big of a picture, but it's totally 
dominating the market place right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Runaway Bride'' was No. 2 with $8.6 million, ``The 13th  
Warrior'' was third with $8.4 million, ``Bowfinger'' was fourth 
with $7 million, and ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' was fifth with 
$6.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one new movie, the Skeet Ulrich-Cuba Gooding Jr. thriller  
``Chill Factor,'' cracked the top 10 this weekend, grossing $5.7 
million for sixth place. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend's other major opening, ``Outside Providence,'' was  
in 11th place with $3.2 million. The coming-of-age comedy was 
unable to capitalize on the track record of writers Peter and Bobby 
Farrelly, who made ``There's Something About Mary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To date, ``Sixth Sense'' has taken in $175.5 million, and  
distributor Disney projects a final gross of at least $250 million, 
said Chuck Viane, head of distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers continue to talk up the movie among friends, and ``Sixth  
Sense'' is getting a lot of repeat business from people going back 
to see it again, Viane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall box office figures will top $100 million for the  
weekend, breaking the previous Labor Day record of $96 million in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a fitting end to a record summer movie season. The movie  
industry did about $3 billion in business from Memorial Day weekend 
through Labor Day, topping the previous high of $2.6 billion in 
summer 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Monday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
are to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $28.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Runaway Bride,'' $8.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The 13th Warrior,'' $8.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Bowfinger,'' $7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' $6.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Chill Factor,'' $5.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' $5.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``The Blair Witch Project, $3.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``The Muse,'' $3.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``The Astronaut's Wife,'' $3.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Report of Weather Condition Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A breakdown in National Weather Service  
computer hardware Tuesday morning was blamed for delays in 
reporting temperatures and weather conditions across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time in 20 years of service that the computer  
has had failures in both of two duplicate systems, said Art Wick, 
chief of the networking and communications branch at the National 
Center for Environmental Prediction. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures and other weather data are collected across the  
country by the system, called AFOS, which delivers the data to the 
center in suburban Camp Springs, Md. AFOS then relays tables and 
summaries of the data to users such as newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The data collection system was working, but the computer failure  
prevented AFOS from forwarding the information to outside users, 
Wick said. He said the system was back in operation by 
midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``AFOS is configured so there are two sides to the system.  
Ordinarily we can operate fully with either side up. ... For the 
first time we had a hardware failure on both sides,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	AFOS stands for automation of field operations and services.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House said today that terms of a  
soon-to-expire clemency offer for 16 imprisoned Puerto Rican 
nationalists are not negotiable and ``they've had enough time'' to 
decide whether to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the nationalists have until 5 p.m. Friday to respond  
in writing to the clemency proposal from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer has created a division within the first family.  
Hillary Rodham Clinton, a potential candidate for a Senate seat 
from New York, has urged the president to rescind the proposal. 
``It's been three weeks and their silence speaks volumes,'' the 
first lady said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said the White House  
counsel's office has been in touch with attorneys for the 
nationalists. ``They expressed some legitimate issues about trying 
to get to each of these people ... and make the case and discuss 
what the offer is.'' The deal requires that the nationalists sign a 
statement formally renouncing violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they've had enough time,'' Lockhart said. ``Allowing  
them to go to the end of this week to make up their mind is more 
than adequate for them to understand what the offer is and 
understand their rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't speak for any of the people, and I don't know that  
their attorneys have done much talking to the press,'' Lockhart 
said. ``But there were certainly some statements made in the press 
and in public that indicated that ... they needed to stretch this 
out in order to get a better deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons have come under fire from Republican critics and  
some law enforcement officials, who asserted the president's 
clemency offer was aimed at helping his wife garner votes among New 
York's 1.3 million Puerto Ricans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there have been many who have sought to inject  
politics, and many who have thought to inject a motive here, and 
all I can say is that they're wrong,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16 are members of Armed Forces of National Liberation, known  
by its Spanish initials, FALN.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Rejects Uncut 'Eyes Wide' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Authorities have rejected an appeal to let  
``Eyes Wide Shut'' run uncut in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	That means Stanley Kubrick's last work might not be screened in  
the tightly controlled Asian city-state because Warner Bros. is 
under contract to show it exactly as it was made. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not allowed to tamper with the film at all, in any  
way,'' studio spokeswoman Li Sok Heng said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're reviewing our options,'' Li said. ``We'd probably have  
to get back to the makers of the film in the United States and see 
if anything could be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government-appointed Films Appeals Committee, a citizens'  
group with the final say in such decisions, insisted that a scene 
involving oral sex between two women be cut. The panel also said 
chanting from the sacred Hindu text the Bhagavad Gita -- which 
accompanies an orgy scene -- is religiously sensitive and must be 
``muted or replaced.''

<HEADLINE> Fry's Settles Y2K-Compliance Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALNUT CREEK, Calif. (AP) -- Fry's Electronics agreed Tuesday to  
post notices urging customers to investigate whether the computers, 
software and other electronic equipment they buy are Year 2000 
compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement settles Fry's part of a lawsuit filed by a swim  
coach who sued seven retailers in frustration after store clerks 
couldn't tell him if their products would work after the so-called 
millennium bug hits on Dec. 31, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Office Depot settled with Tom Johnson of Concord, Calif., in  
June and agreed to similar conditions. Circuit City, CompUSA, 
OfficeMax, The Good Guys and Staples are the remaining defendants 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 problem occurs because some computer programs,  
especially older ones, might fail when the date changes to 2000. 
Because the programs were written to recognize only the last two 
digits of a year, such programs could read the digits ``00'' as 
1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the settlement, Fry's agreed to post notices at the  
front of all its stores and create a brochure on how to find out if 
products are Y2K-compliant. The retailer also agreed to provide its 
salespeople with Y2K information and instruct them to tell 
consumers they should investigate whether products are compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many products sold today are not compliant,'' said Johnson's  
attorney, Rich Ergo, who filed the suit Contra Costa County 
Superior Court. ``Fry's Electronics has stepped up to the plate to 
disabuse the public of these misconceptions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A call to Fry's by The Associated Press seeking comment was not  
immediately returned. Representatives of CompUSA, Staples and 
Office Max declined to comment. The other defendants did not 
immediately return phone messages.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Open Resembles a MASH Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Back and forth they dueled in the wind at the  
U.S. Open, trading points Tuesday until Magnus Norman was in 
position to break fifth-seeded Gustavo Kuerten. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, suddenly, Norman felt a click in his back that left him  
wincing in pain, one more casualty at a tournament that is 
beginning to look like a MASH unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt an unbelievable amount of pain in the back,'' Norman  
said. ``I felt this is not right. I never felt like this before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He tried to play through the pain and broke Kuerten on the next  
point. But on the changeover, he called for the trainer and it was 
only a matter of time before he was forced to withdraw after losing 
the first-set tiebreaker 7-6 (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
	The victory moved Kuerten into the quarterfinals against Cedric  
Pioline, who defeated No. 14 Tommy Haas 6-4, 7-5, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman was in great pain when the trainer reached him. ``He  
tried to put some hot cream and tried to massage it, tried to 
stretch it,'' the Swede said. ``I tried to serve but it was no way, 
no chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The diagnosis was a lower back strain and Norman became the  
seventh player on the men's side forced to retire in the middle of 
a match. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time defending champion Patrick Rafter led the retreat,  
pulling out in the fifth set of his first-round match against 
Pioline. Julien Boutter lasted less than two sets against Galo 
Blanco, also in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second round, Jan-Michael Gambill went down in the fifth  
set against Fabrice Santoro and Carlos Moya could not continue in 
the third set against Nicolas Escude. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-round casualties were Santoro in the third set against  
Jiri Novak, a rather academic pullout after losing the first two 
sets and trailing 5-1 in the third, and Magnus Larsson, who walked 
off after only one set against Todd Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	That list of injuries doesn't include top-seeded Pete Sampras  
and last-year's runner-up, Mark Philippoussis, both of whom pulled 
out before the tournament even began. 
</P>
<P>
	What's going on here?  
</P>
<P>
	John McEnroe believes the crowded schedule is at fault.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're playing too lengthy a schedule,'' he said on USA  
Network. ``Guys are getting bigger, the equipment's getting faster, 
so you're going to have to make quicker steps. And that may cause 
more injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe said the ranking system which uses the best 14 results  
to determine placings encourages players to play more matches. 
``What they should be doing instead is playing less and focusing on 
each match they play,'' he said. ``Make each match count for 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuerten, who passed on the pre-Open Hamlet Cup which Norman won,  
believes McEnroe might be right. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took the week off to practice here,'' he said. ``For sure it  
was better for me. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some guys play a lot of matches before coming here. You have  
to go out there and play best-of-5 sets, sometimes three, four 
hours on the court. It's tough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if you just prepare yourself for this tournament, you can  
go out on the court and twist your ankle or have a bad injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norman had no complaints about the schedule.  
</P>
<P>
	``I felt very fresh going into this tournament, going into this  
match,'' he said. ``I felt great. I think the schedule is great. I 
love to play tennis. If there were tournaments during the whole 
year, I would play every week because I love the sport so much. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the doctor said, `You just had an enormous amount of bad  
luck today.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe also hinted that players taking supplements like  
Creatine to bulk up might be having consequences of cramping and 
muscle pulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman said he doesn't take those substances, although he knows  
other players do. Why doesn't he use them? 
</P>
<P>
	``Creatine is something that builds your muscles,'' he said. ``I  
think I already have enough muscles.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Holds Top Spot As Aid Donor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Economic doldrums have not prevented Japan from  
remaining the world's biggest aid donor for the eighth consecutive 
year, the government announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's official development assistance, or ODA, in 1998 totaled  
$10.78 billion, up 14.2 percent from the previous year, the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in an annual report. 
</P>
<P>
	Its contribution to Asia more than doubled from the previous  
year, and dominated Japan's overall aid, totaling 61 percent of ODA 
at $3.66 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A ministry official said Japan's continued weak economy has  
actually spurred the country to increase assistance to Asia, 
excluding the Indian subcontinent, and said that area will remain 
the foremost priority for Japan's financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the high ranking of Japan's ODA contribution, it remains  
well below the level some international groups would like to see. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations recommends that the industrialized countries  
allocate 0.7 percent of their total gross national product to ODA. 
Japan's latest ODA figure represents 0.28 percent of GNP, making it 
the 12th largest donor in terms of development assistance per 
capita. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States gave 0.10 percent of its GNP to development  
assistance, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development, placing it at 21st. 
</P>
<P>
	Scandinavians remain the most generous in assisting development  
in GNP terms, with Denmark allocating 0.99 percent of its GNP to 
development assistance, followed by Norway at 0.91 percent.

<HEADLINE> Man Kills Father, Sister, Then Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIPSEY, Ala. (AP) -- A man whose mother recently died of cancer  
opened fire outside a rural home, killing his father and sister 
before committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Those killed in Monday's shootings were Leon Wallace, 75, his  
50-year-old daughter, Sandra Wallace Clifton, and the alleged 
gunman, Wallace's 45-year-old son, Terry, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to witnesses, Leon Wallace was talking to a neighbor  
in his yard when his son emerged from the house and fired about 15 
shots at Mrs. Clifton, who had just pulled up in her car. When the 
elder Wallace tried to help his daughter, he also was shot, family 
members said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Wallace, who worked as a security guard, then went behind  
the house and shot himself, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what the dispute was about, but all I know is  
that my uncle opened gunfire on my mom first and then my 
grandfather,'' said Kevin Gilbreath, Mrs. Clifton's son. 
</P>
<P>
	Sipsey Police Chief Allan K. Thompson said the shootings were  
being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives said the cancer-related death of Wallace's mother,  
Hazel, three weeks ago may have contributed to the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilbreath said she ``was his world and when she passed away, he  
went over the deep end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sipsey is about 25 miles northeast of Birmingham.

<HEADLINE>  German Parliament Returns to Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- The German parliament returned to its historic  
seat in Berlin today with a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary 
of its first postwar session -- and a warning that the seeds of 
democracy must still take root in the former communist east. 
</P>
<P>
	Parliamentarians from around the world attended the session in  
the Reichstag building, newly renovated after decades of disuse, to 
praise Germany's transformation from instigator of two world wars 
to a peaceful and freedom-loving democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet parliament president Wolfgang Thierse, a former East German  
dissident, noted that respect for values of peace, justice and 
solidarity were stronger in the west than the former communist 
east. The region only shook off its postwar totalitarian system 10 
years ago and is still struggling with the social and economic 
ramifications of unification. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two days ago, an extreme-right party trumpeting  
anti-foreigner slogans won seats for the first time in the 
legislature of the eastern state of Brandenburg, the Prussian 
heartland which surrounds Berlin. The victory heightened concerns 
that the German People's Party, already represented in the 
Saxony-Anhalt legislature, would win seats in the Thuringia 
parliament during state elections Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The democratization of West Germany went since 1949 with  
growing prosperity and gradual full employment,'' Thierse said in 
his opening address. ``In East Germany, great unemployment has 
reigned for the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``So it would therefore be too much probably to expect the same  
excitement for democracy from the east Germans that has grown over 
50 years in west Germany. Here, the parliament must first prove 
itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony was the first time parliament met since it began  
its summer break in July to begin the move from the western city of 
Bonn back to Berlin, Germany's historic seat of power. 
</P>
<P>
	It will hold its first regular session in the Reichstag on  
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Capriati Wants To Leave Past Behind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If her tennis racket was a wand, Jennifer  
Capriati would wave it to make her past disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	She found out Monday that there's no such magic, and life isn't  
so simple. 
</P>
<P>
	Desperate to banish the past and avoid comparisons to her youth,  
Capriati spoke of her teen-age rebellion and confusion in an 
emotional news conference an hour after losing to Monica Seles 6-4, 
6-3 in the fourth round of the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Capriati struck a note of maturity in her mea culpa, yet she  
revealed how fragile she remains, leaving the tournament once again 
in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	She began the news conference by reading a statement she said  
she wrote before the tournament and saved until she was finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there is much mystery, much question to what happened,  
and, I must also say, many lies,'' the 23-year-old player said of 
the collapse of her career in 1993, her subsequent arrests on 
shoplifting and drug possession charges, and her rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I made mistakes by rebelling, by acting out in confused  
ways,'' she said, taking deep breaths as she read. ``But it was all 
due to the fact I was very young and I was experiencing my 
adolescence. Most of you know how hard that can be. When you do it 
in front of the world, it is even harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She spoke of taking a different path than other players,  
learning a lot about herself and life along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I knew there would be so much pain in learning life's  
lessons,'' she said, ``I would have been hesitant to take the path 
that I took. It's the only thing I do regret. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me say that the path I did take for a brief period of my  
life was not of reckless drug use, hurting others, but it was a 
path of quiet rebellion, of a little experimentation of a darker 
side of my confusion in a confusing world, lost in the midst of 
finding my identity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made mistakes, and yes, I am to blame, and no one else. I am  
sorry to my loved ones that I humiliated and embarrassed. And I'm 
sorry to my fans who feel I let them down. I'm sorry to myself for 
causing such pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capriati said she has put much of her past behind her and feels  
she's moving in the right direction as she starts a new chapter in 
her life. She added that this would be the last time she speaks 
about the past, and asked the media to respect her wishes to stay 
away from the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the statement was something she wanted to write for a  
long time, and that this felt like the right moment. She had told 
her father about it -- Stefano Capriati sat in the interview room 
listening to her -- but hadn't told her mother, who is divorced from 
her father. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in response to questions about her statement, Capriati said  
she wrote it because she was ``tired of all the questions'' about 
her past, ``all the mystery. Just once and for all, I wanted to get 
it over with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Capriati never really clarified the events that led to her  
arrests or what happened to her afterward. The ``mystery'' remains 
untold, and Capriati said she's still not ready to talk about it 
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	Told that other athletes have experienced a sense of relief  
sometimes after talking openly about their problems, Capriati said 
she thought that's what reading her statement would do for her and 
that she wanted to make sure she explained herself the right way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just really didn't know how to handle it, just how to go  
about saying it, afraid I was going to say something wrong,'' she 
said. ``I didn't know really what to say that was just going to be 
right or I wasn't going to get in trouble. ... Maybe that's why 
I've played with a lot of anxiety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until that point in the long news conference, Capriati kept her  
composure, talking about her statement, her ``self-inflicted'' 
problems, the match with Seles. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she was asked, ``Do you still see the media as your  
adversary?'' Capriati hesitated. She has been the subject of mostly 
sympathetic stories her entire career, despite her troubles, yet 
she remains wary of the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to start crying. It's nothing bad, it's just ...''  
</P>
<P>
	Capriati broke off and began sobbing uncontrollably.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a little overwhelming, that's all,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	A WTA Tour representative, Jim Fuhse, asked her if she wanted to  
stop. Capriati shook her head. 
</P>
<P>
	``It needs to be done,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can stop if you want to,'' Fuhse said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just wish I didn't have to talk about this stuff all the  
time,'' Capriati said, sobbing more heavily. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuhse led her away, and her father came over to put his arms  
around her. Outside the interview room, a reporter who has long 
known her also tried comforting Capriati as she kept crying. 
Finally, after a few minutes, Capriati made her way down the hall 
to the locker room and away from the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	She had left tournaments in tears before -- the U.S. Open in 1992  
after losing in the third round, the Australian Open in 1993 after 
losing in the quarters, among others. She spoke now of being 
stronger than in those days, being able to keep things in 
perspective, yet she remains in some ways as fragile as ever.

<HEADLINE> Airline Attendants Nix Uniforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Cathay Pacific Airways' flight attendants are  
upset with management again, not over salaries but over a new, 
purple uniform with a shorter skirt they contend makes them look 
like ``a walking eggplant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An overwhelming number of the 150 cabin crew members who  
responded to an online survey said they didn't like the new uniform 
to be introduced next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cheap,'' ``too short'' and ``very, very ugly'' were some of  
the comments posted on a Web site that Cathay staff set up 
separately from the official site operated by the Hong Kong-based 
airline's management. 
</P>
<P>
	``The general comment is we look like a walking eggplant,''  
Becky Kwan, an executive committee member of the Flight Attendants' 
Association, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new skirts for women cabin crew members, created by Hong  
Kong fashion designer Eddie Lau, are shorter than the current blue 
or red uniform skirts and have a slit. They are worn with blouses 
that don't tuck in. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay spokeswoman Quince Chong noted that opinions on the new  
design ``can be very subjective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the flight attendants gave in to company  
demands and agreed to work longer hours in exchange for a pay 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay has more than 5,000 flight attendants.

<HEADLINE> Officials Allay Y2K Stock Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's financial markets are fully  
prepared for the Year 2000 date change, the government's top 
securities regulator and Wall Street officials are assuring 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first trading day of the new millennium will be business  
as usual,'' Richard Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock 
Exchange, said Tuesday at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Grasso and the other officials said the securities industry had  
tested and retested all its computer systems, ensuring a 
trouble-free transition to the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, said John Koskinen, who heads the White House  
Council on Year 2000 Conversion, electricity and other basic 
services needed for securities trading should be working normally. 
``We are increasingly confident that the basic infrastructure will 
hold,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, maintained that ``The worst that we have to fear right 
now is public misperception, public fear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said investors ``can rest assured that their trades  
(will) be processed as efficiently as on any other day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC has taken enforcement actions against 13 money  
management firms, 15 securities transfer agents and 37 brokerage 
firms -- all relatively small companies -- for allegedly failing to 
meet deadlines for fully disclosing their computer systems' 
readiness for the Year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency has said it would go to federal court starting Dec. 1  
to shut down brokerage firms and transfer agents that aren't ready 
for the date change. The SEC estimates that only 1 percent or so of 
the 3,900 brokerage firms and 600 securities transfer agents aren't 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC also requires mutual fund companies and publicly traded  
corporations to disclose their Year 2000 readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 problem -- also called Y2K and the millennium bug --  
occurs because some computer programs, especially older ones, might 
fail when the date changes to 2000. Because the programs were 
written to recognize only the last two digits of a year, such 
programs could read the digits ``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC has these tips for investors:  
</P>
<P>
	--Keep good records, including bank and investment account  
statements and bill payments. 
</P>
<P>
	--Stay informed by finding out what your bank, brokerage firm,  
mutual fund, investment adviser and other financial service 
providers have done to become Y2K compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	--Remember that many companies post Year 2000 information on  
their Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	--Continue to invest for the long term.  
</P>
<P>
	--Don't worry about obtaining your stock certificates, since  
brokerage firms keep records and can answer your questions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Check your personal computer to make sure that it and your  
software are Year 2000 ready. 
</P>
<P>
	A Year 2000 investor kit with information on checking personal  
computers and other topics is available through the National 
Association of Securities Dealers' Web site at 
www.nasdr.com/3600--inv--kit.htm. Printed copies can be obtained by 
calling 1-888-227-1330 or sending an e-mail to y2k(at)nasd.com.

<HEADLINE> Poor Preseason a Concern for Vikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- One thing coach Dennis Green won't  
have to worry about is the Minnesota Vikings being overconfident. 
</P>
<P>
	A lackluster exhibition season and trouble on defense have left  
the Vikings with a bounty of worries and nothing resembling a Super 
Bowl favorite's swagger. 
</P>
<P>
	There's worries everywhere.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody's where they want to be,'' cornerback  
Jimmy Hitchcock said. ``Throughout the whole team we've got to get 
better, not just any particular position. Everybody down to the 
water boys have got to do a better job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And soon. The Vikings open the season Sunday at Atlanta against  
the team that stunned them in the NFC championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Ramos McDonald has had his troubles replacing Corey  
Fuller at cornerback. The Vikings are thin at linebacker, where 
versatile backup Pete Bercich was placed on injured reserve with a 
major knee injury and starters Ed McDaniel (knee) and Dwayne Rudd 
(shoulder) have been limited. And the defensive line has been 
shuffled, starting with Dimitrius Underwood's departure on Day 1 of 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota's high-octane offense never got on track in the  
preseason, and that's frustrated receiver Randy Moss, the 1998 
Offensive Rookie of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't get things going, it's going to be a struggle,''  
Moss said. ``The expectations are so high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the Vikings were thumped by the New York Jets on Friday  
night, Green lamented his team's lack of defensive depth and said 
he was greatly troubled by inadequacies in the pass rush, pass 
protection, the running game and in creating turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hope that how you play in preseason will be an indication  
of how you're going to play in the season, if you play well,'' 
Green said after the Vikings' 38-17 loss. ``I don't think we 
necessarily played well. That could be a sign that we don't have 53 
players who can play well enough at this level. I know we got some 
that can. We'll try to focus on those.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Green picked up linebacker Rob Holmberg, a sixth-year  
pro who was cut by the Jets, and brought back pass-rusher Martin 
Harrison, who was waived last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmberg went from the AFC favorites to the NFC favorites.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Jets are a good team and now I come here and it's another  
good team,'' Holmberg said. ``So it's a great situation for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmberg, who agreed to a two-year deal for the NFL minimum of  
$400,000 a year, will back up at both weakside and strongside 
linebacker as well as playing special teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think he's an ideal fit,'' Green said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings stumbled through a 2-2 preseason and have looked  
nothing like last year's team that parlayed a 4-0 exhibition mark 
into a 15-1 regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you line up, you want to win, you want to play well,''  
safety Robert Griffith said. ``We have to work out some kinks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hitchcock said the team's not going to get too alarmed by  
the preseason pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where we want to be is on top of our game, on our A-game,'' he  
said. ``Even if we were playing good, we wouldn't be where we want 
to be.''

<HEADLINE> Stock Car Fans Know Good Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Forget about football. Forget about baseball.  
And don't even think about professional wrestling. Auto racing is 
the fastest-growing spectator sport in America. 
</P>
<P>
	So it's not surprising that investors have sought to capitalize  
on that popularity by investing in companies that provide the 
financial backbone for the auto racing industry. 
</P>
<P>
	One way to do that is through StockCar Stocks Index Fund. This  
no-load mutual fund invests in 59 companies that are sponsors of or 
derive part of their revenue from the NASCAR Winston Cup racing 
series, the largest auto racing circuit in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund's diversified holdings range from the beer and  
cigarette companies that sponsor NASCAR racing teams to the large 
soft drink makers that sponsor the actual races. The fund also 
includes owners of the race tracks and television stations that 
broadcast the races. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of stocks covers a lot of ground -- from such blue chip  
components of the Dow Jones industrial average as chemical maker 
DuPont to profitable upstarts such as Action Performance Cos., a 
merchandiser of NASCAR-related souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
	John Allen, StockCar Stocks' 27-year-old founder and chief  
executive, said the fund can serve as a complementary investment 
for NASCAR fans who already have a broadbased portfolio, or as a 
first-time investment for racing fans seeking a safe index fund 
whose stocks they are familiar with. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any NASCAR fan will be familiar with most of the companies in  
the fund. They buy their products every day,'' Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund manager noted that 40 of the 59 stocks included in  
StockCar Stocks are also included in the Standard &AMP; Poors 500 
index, probably the most widely used benchmark for mutual fund 
performance. And 13 of the stocks are fixtures of the 30-member Dow 
Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
	Performance has been steady if not spectacular. Since its  
inception last Oct. 1, the fund has risen 24 percent, well below 
the 39 percent rise in the S&AMP;P 500 during the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Robert Hagstrom, a senior vice president of Legg Mason  
Fund Advisors and author of a book titled ``The NASCAR Way: The 
Business that Drives the Sport,'' says it may be more profitable 
for investors to look instead for a niche in the racing world that 
stands to gain more directly from the sport's growing popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, Hagstrom points to the race tracks where NASCAR  
events are held, three of which -- Dover Downs Entertainment, 
International Speedway Corp. and Speedway Motorsports Inc. -- are 
publicly traded companies. All three are included in the StockCar 
Stocks fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagstrom said the race track companies are potentially lucrative  
investments by themselves because they own the television rights to 
the races held in their parks. And with more and more Americans 
tuning in to racing, new TV contracts could serve as a huge 
economic windfall for the companies that own the tracks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the three race track stocks included in the fund have  
jumped an average of 96 percent during the past year. Speedway 
Motorsports, for example, which owns five race tracks, including 
ones in such major Southern cities as Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C., 
has seen its stock rise 187 percent since last September. 
</P>
<P>
	``These companies derive 100 percent of their revenues from the  
phenomenon of motor sports,'' Hagstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, many of the other companies included in the  
StockCar Stocks fund get just a fraction of their revenues from the 
sport. That means their stocks are not only vulnerable to factors 
not related to racing, but they won't fully realize the benefits of 
racing's surging popularity, Hagstrom said.

<HEADLINE> Qwest-U S West Merger Clears Hurdle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The proposed purchase of Baby Bell phone company U  
S West by Qwest Communications has cleared another regulatory 
hurdle with the Justice Department raising no antitrust objections. 
</P>
<P>
	The $35 billion deal, recently cleared by the Securities and  
Exchange Commission, still faces scrutiny by the Federal 
Communications Commission and states in the Rocky Mountain and 
Pacific Northwest where U S West sells local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said Tuesday it has completed a mandatory  
federal review of the deal's impact on competition and that no 
further action is planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest agreed to acquire U S West in July after outbidding Global  
Crossing, another company that's building a global fiber-optic 
network for Internet, telephone and TV service. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC could block the deal because Qwest sells long-distance  
phone service and Baby Bells like U S West are currently prohibited 
from entering that business in the regions they monopolize. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baby Bell need to persuade regulators they have opened their  
markets to local phone competition before they can enter the 
long-distance business in those markets. 
</P>
<P>
	While U S West may satisfy those requirements in some states  
soon, Qwest is trying to avoid any conflict by offering to sell its 
long-distance business in U S West's 14-state territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger also may face tough scrutiny from states that have  
accused U S West of providing the worst service among the Baby 
Bells created by the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators also may demand that Qwest share the financial  
benefits the merger with local phone customers.

<HEADLINE> Seminoles' McCray Out for Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE,Fla. (AP) -- Florida State fullback William McCray  
broke his ankle in practice and will miss the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	McCray, injured Monday, will have surgery Thursday, team trainer  
Randy Oravetz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will most likely have to insert some pins, maybe even a  
metal plate,'' he said. ``The surgery will basically have to 
rebuild his ankle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCray, considered the best blocker on the top-ranked Seminoles,  
is eligible for a medical redshirt season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot, 225-pound junior scored a touchdown in Florida  
State's 41-7 victory over Louisiana Tech in the season-opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Dan Kendra will start at fullback Saturday when the  
Seminoles play host to 10th-ranked Georgia Tech. Kendra, coming off 
reconstructive knee surgery, carried the ball twice in Florida 
State's opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be much better in the second game,'' Florida State  
offensive coordinator Mark Richt said about Kendra. ``He's ready.''

<HEADLINE> Athletes' Injuries May Harm Thinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Two or more significant blows to the head while  
playing sports can harm teen-agers' thinking abilities for years to 
come, according to studies that suggest such injuries are more 
serious than some coaches and parents might think. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 63,000 high school athletes a year suffer mild  
concussions, researchers reported in Wednesday's Journal of the 
American Medical Association. Young athletes with learning 
disorders appear to suffer even worse long-term problems from 
multiple concussions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major public health issue that has been given short  
shrift,'' said Michael W. Collins, a neuropsychologist at Henry 
Ford Health System in Detroit and a leader of one of the studies. 
``And this is information parents should know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most people still believe that a concussion means getting  
knocked out, he said. But a concussion is any alteration in mental 
function after a blow to the head. Signs or symptoms may be subtle 
-- a headache, dizziness, difficulty with balance or memory, 
confusion or a personality change. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the studies did not explore the effects of concussions  
but only how often they occurred in football, wrestling, soccer, 
basketball, softball, baseball, field hockey and volleyball at 235 
high schools nationwide from 1995-96 through 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 1,219 concussions -- 63 percent of them in football --  
and 99 students suffered two or more, said researchers led by John 
W. Powell, a professor of kinesiology and an athletic trainer at 
Michigan State University. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers estimated that more than 62,800 concussions  
occur among high school students nationwide annually in the sports 
they studied. 
</P>
<P>
	It has long been known that multiple mild concussions are more  
likely than a single episode to lead to long-term problems, and 
Collins tried to measure the difference in his study. 
</P>
<P>
	His research involved 393 college football players and found  
that about one in three had suffered a concussion at some time in 
the past and one in five had suffered two or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who had suffered two or more were significantly more  
likely to report continuing problems with headaches, sleep and 
concentration, and they scored significantly worse on 
paper-and-pencil tests of the ability to learn words, to think 
quickly and to handle complex tasks. A complex task in the real 
world would be cooking a big Thanksgiving dinner, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	Players who had learning disorders -- 13.5 percent of the sample  
-- fared even worse if they had two or more concussions, suggesting 
that the disorders make the brain especially vulnerable to jarring 
injuries. About 12 percent of all collegians have learning 
disorders, research has shown. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they have a learning disability, if they have one  
concussion, you should be a lot more cautious in returning them to 
game conditions and practices after their first concussion,'' said 
an expert not involved in the studies, Jeffrey T. Barth, chief of 
medical psychology and neuropsychology at the University of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the research on the prevalence of concussions among high  
school students confirms previous work but is by far the largest 
study, and it highlights a problem that ``has been kind of ignored 
over the years.'' Most emphasis on managing concussion has been at 
college and pro levels, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Animal research suggests that the youthful brain remains  
vulnerable after a first concussion for a longer time than a mature 
brain does, so a high school athlete may need a much longer 
recovery time from a concussion before returning to play than a 
college player or a pro, Barth said. 
</P>
<P>
	A third article in the journal reported that amateur soccer  
players scored lower on tests of memory and planning than other 
amateur athletes did, and that repeated blows to the head may be 
the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
	While some research has implicated ``heading'' the ball, Barth  
and other experts believe the more likely explanation is the 
frequent collisions between players and players' heads hitting the 
ground or a goalpost.

<HEADLINE> McEnroe Eyed for Davis Cup Captain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hall of Famer John McEnroe is expected to be  
appointed captain of the United States Davis Cup team, with the 
announcement to be made during a press conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	United States Tennis Association officials refused to confirm  
the report, saying only that there would be an announcement 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe would succeed Tom Gullikson, captain of the team since  
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Gullikson took much of the blame when the United States lost to  
Australia in the Davis Cup quarterfinal at Brookline, Mass., in 
July. He was criticized for using Jim Courier and Todd Martin in 
singles while top-ranked Pete Sampras was relegated to doubles duty 
against the Australians. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe, 40, an ardent Davis Cup fan, has campaigned for some  
time to be named captain of the team. He also had hoped to play 
doubles against the Australians but Gullikson did not name him to 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've wanted to do it for a long time,'' McEnroe said Tuesday.  
``Everybody knows that. This time it feels right. But it won't be 
100 percent until they announce the name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe played on Davis Cup championship teams in 1978, 1979,  
1981, 1982 and 1992. He said that as captain he would still 
consider playing Davis Cup doubles. ``It would be easier to be 
picked than to pick yourself,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Women, Men Differ on Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fight over gun control reflects a battle  
of the sexes. American women say stricter weapon laws would curb 
violence while men want better enforcement of existing laws, an 
Associated Press poll finds. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll notes some erosion of overall support for tougher gun  
laws since the days immediately following the deadly school 
shootings last April in Colorado, but still offers plenty of 
ammunition to both sides of the debate in a divided Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey by ICR of Media, Pa., found 56 percent of  
American adults favored stricter gun laws and 39 percent opposed. 
Sixty-six percent of women favored the tougher laws, compared with 
45 percent of men. Thirty percent of women and 49 percent of men 
were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women have the mother instinct and don't want guns around,''  
said James Rowe, a 73-year-old semiretired contractor and gun 
enthusiast from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	In mid-April, just before the Colorado shootings, 55 percent of  
adults favored tougher gun laws. When the question was repeated in 
an AP poll a week after the shootings, the proportion jumped to 63 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But while a majority favors stricter gun laws, only 43 percent  
in the latest poll said new laws would be more effective in 
reducing gun violence than better enforcement of existing laws. 
Those numbers are statistically unchanged from the poll taken 
before the shootings, but represent a sharp shift in opinion as 
measured in the post-shooting poll, when 51 percent chose tougher 
gun laws and 39 percent picked better enforcement of existing laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Public opinion on this question is fluid, evidenced by the  
shifts in the AP polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have found divisions in their own ranks. The Senate,  
with the help of some Republicans, agreed to legislation that 
requires background checks at all gun shows, outlaws importation of 
large-capacity ammunition clips and requires the sale of safety 
locks with handguns. House Republicans initially stripped out that 
language, but later asked for a compromise version that would 
require background checks for firearms sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Theresa Flippin, a 24-year-old factory worker from Yellville,  
Ark., believes people should be able to own guns and use them for 
hunting. But she wants tougher gun restrictions on people who have 
criminal records. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last five years, it's really gotten out of control,''  
she said, ``the school shootings, the drive-by shootings, the 
road-rage shootings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of Americans say recent shootings in the news  
have made them worry more about their own safety. Almost two-thirds 
of women said they were likely to feel that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worry about my daughter when she goes to school,'' said  
47-year-old Karen Cloud, a nurse from Lexington, Ky. Several women 
in the poll, when asked in interviews later how recent violence 
affects them, mentioned school shootings first. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cloud said she wasn't surprised there is a gender gap on the  
gun control issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of men are just fascinated with guns and want to  
have them,'' she said. ``I dated a guy who insisted that I learn 
how to shoot this rifle. It was so heavy, I couldn't even hold it. 
I went out and shot cans with it, but there was no point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,026 people taken Aug. 27-31 indicated that blacks  
were far more likely than whites, by 83 percent to 52 percent, to 
support tougher gun controls. The poll had an error margin of plus 
or minus 3 percentage points, larger for subgroups like men and 
women. Democrats were far more likely than Republicans to support 
more restrictions, by 71 percent to 43 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Democratic candidates for president, Vice President Al Gore  
and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, have suggested stringent 
steps to control access to guns. GOP front-runner George W. Bush, 
the governor of Texas, said recently that he agrees with some gun 
control steps, such as raising the age of gun ownership to 21 and 
banning large ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half the men interviewed in the poll, 54 percent, said  
they felt that recent shootings in the news were random acts of 
violence that don't affect them personally, while 41 percent said 
they felt threatened. Some of that may be attributed to the 
difference in how men and women view guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to see all the shootings,'' said Rowe, the San Diego  
contractor. ``I have guns of my own, about 18 guns, rifles, pistols 
... 
</P>
<P>
	``I just like to look at them,'' said the World War II veteran.  
``I buy them just like a woman would buy a diamond.''

<HEADLINE> Cable Marks 10 Years in Classrooms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As millions of children head back to school, so  
do more than 40 cable television networks. 
</P>
<P>
	This month marks the 10th year of the Cable in the Classroom  
program, which has quietly wired schools across the country for 
free or low-cost cable TV service and provided programming for 
teachers to supplement their curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 networks participate, most airing educationally  
oriented shows without commercials in pre-dawn hours for teachers 
to tape and use later. Networks, such as CNN, Discovery and The 
Weather Channel produce shows specifically for students. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry estimates it has spent $1 billion on Cable in the  
Classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best use of television,'' said Judith McHale,  
president of Discovery Communications, Inc. ``It is an incredibly 
powerful medium. If used appropriately, it can really enhance a 
child's experience in the classroom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The motives aren't entirely altruistic. If a network's  
programming piques a young consumer's interest, it might create a 
fan for life. Free hookups at schools seem a worthwhile investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-quarters of 800 teachers surveyed last year said they used  
videos or television programs with their classes, just under the 79 
percent who include computers. Two-thirds said they were aware of 
the cable service, and most of those use it, according to the 
survey paid for by Cable in the Classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Programming from PBS, Discovery, The Learning Channel and CNN  
was among the most widely sampled, the teachers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``C-SPAN has been popular among some of the teachers I've talked  
to,'' said Kathleen Lyons, a spokeswoman for the National Education 
Association in Washington. ``Many are using the series on the 
American presidents. People like C-SPAN because they view it as 
nonbiased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers union has worked with the cable industry to develop  
guidelines for appropriate programming and, in some cases, 
curriculum material to go with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Television has been another arrow to put in a teacher's  
arsenal of teaching tools,'' Lyons said. ``It's not something that 
should be overused, but it definitely has its place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The programming specifically produced for students includes  
CNN's daily ``Newsroom,'' which discusses current events, and the 
new ``SportsFigures,'' an ESPN2 show in which athletes like Tiger 
Woods, Juwan Howard and Steve Young talk about the relationship of 
math and physics to sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Networks this month are showing some of their educational  
programming in prime time so parents can see what is being made 
available to schools. While occasionally some of what networks call 
educational seems a stretch -- like VH1's rock star soap opera, 
``Behind the Music'' -- most of it is solid and informative. 
</P>
<P>
	The History Channel, for example, presents a miniseries on ``The  
Great Depression.'' Outdoor Life Network airs a show on the grizzly 
bear and A&AMP;E showcases a biography of P.T. Barnum. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the decade, the networks have learned how to tweak their  
shows to make them more classroom-friendly. For example, Discovery 
has cut some programs into shorter segments because students and 
teachers prefer this format, McHale said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, cable companies have wired an estimated 85,000 schools  
across the country for TV service, said Megan Hookey, managing 
director of Cable in the Classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 500 hours of programming cable networks offer  
to the schools, Cable in the Classroom also offers teacher training 
in how best to incorporate this video into the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest barrier we have,'' Hookey said, ``is that not  
enough teachers know that it is available.''

<HEADLINE> Scientists Pack Research Into Movie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the Smithsonian Institution and the IMAX  
Corp. decided to make a movie about the Galapagos Islands the 
result went beyond the giant screen -- scientists squeezed in enough 
research to discover more than a dozen marine species. 
</P>
<P>
	``Galapagos,'' the new 3-D film focusing on the unusual wildlife  
on and around the Pacific island group west of Ecuador, will have 
its world premiere Oct. 27 at the Smithsonian's National Museum of 
Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
	It follows explorations of marine biologist Carole Baldwin in  
the sea surrounding the 19 islands and also visits the rare and 
unusual land animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I was chosen because I had never been there, and they  
wanted a scientist with fresh eyes, someone the audience could 
follow. It was fantastic,'' she said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	She pronounced the resulting three-dimensional film, displayed  
on a giant screen, as great. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing missing in the theater is the cold and wet,''  
she said. ``Otherwise, you're there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Baldwin didn't settle for just making a movie.  
</P>
<P>
	``My goal was science. The filmmaker's goal was certainly to  
make a film. The film was being funded by the Smithsonian 
Institution and IMAX, so the idea was to make the film about 
research,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	So, research she did.  
</P>
<P>
	``We still don't know exactly how many new species we have,''  
she said. The scientists, now back at the museum, must take each of 
the new finds and compare it with thousands of others in the 
Smithsonian collection to verify it was not previously known. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say its like dozens'' of new finds, she added.  
</P>
<P>
	The researchers used a submersible vessel to study the largely  
unexplored waters between 200 feet and 1,000 feet deep. The area is 
too deep for scuba diving, and previous studies using submersibles 
concentrated on deeper waters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finding a dozen new vertebrate species in that length of time  
is almost unheard of,'' she said. ``But the deep sea is so 
unexplored its not uncommon to find new things every time you go 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers and film crews stayed 14 weeks in the Galapagos with  
the only two IMAX 3-D cameras in the world. They visited more than 
80 locations, including dives in the four-person submersible. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Baldwin's discoveries: anthiine bass, a new type of sea  
bass; an unusual wrasse, a small striped fish that cleans larger 
fish, from about 400 feet down; a new cat shark; and several new 
scorpion fish. 
</P>
<P>
	Baldwin concentrates on fish, but other researchers turned up  
new types of sponges, urchins and gastropod mollusks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new species will be added to the Natural History Museum's 8  
million-specimen collection of preserved fish as well as to the 
collections of the Charles Darwin Research Station in the 
Galapagos, the California Academy of Sciences and the Ecuadorian 
Navy Oceanographic Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Located on the equator 600 miles west of South America, the  
Galapagos have been called the laboratory of evolution, its strange 
plants and animals the inspiration for Charles Darwin's theories 
that became known as Darwinism. 
</P>
<P>
	The new film is to run four times daily on the giant IMAX screen  
at the National Museum of Natural History. It will be the first 
regular giant-screen 3-D film shown at the museum. Later it will 
tour other IMAX theaters around the world.

<HEADLINE> Suspected NYC Encephalitis Cases Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thousands of acres in New York City have been  
sprayed with insecticide after more people were suspected of being 
infected with St. Louis Encephalitis, a virus spread by mosquitos. 
</P>
<P>
	Helicopters were used Monday to spray the pesticide malathion in  
parts of the Bronx and Queens. Since the outbreak was reported last 
week, two elderly people in Queens have died from the disease and 
three other cases have been confirmed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those three victims were in serious condition but showed signs  
of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 37 people are now suspected of having the viral  
infection, which had not been found in the New York metropolitan 
area before the current outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	The infection is transmitted into the bloodstream via mosquito  
bites. Symptoms usually show up five to 15 days after a bite from a 
carrier mosquito and range from a slight fever or headache to high 
fevers and convulsions. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the more serious Eastern Equine encephalitis, most people  
recover from the St. Louis strain if infection is caught in time, 
but the disease can be fatal to those with compromised immune 
systems, such as the elderly.

<HEADLINE> Resendiz Asks To Represent Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Alleged railroad killer Angel Maturino Resendiz  
told a judge Tuesday that he wants to represent himself at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendiz made the request to state District Judge Bill  
Harmon during an unscheduled appearance, which was hastily brought 
together after the judge received a pair of letters from the 
suspect asking permission to represent himself. 
</P>
<P>
	But the request will not make a difference, at least for now,  
Harris County prosecutor Devon Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just expressed a desire to represent himself,'' Ms.  
Anderson said. ``It's by no means settled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said he will give Maturino Resendiz a proper hearing  
on the issue after a formal motion on the matter is filed, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys Allen Tanner and Rudy Duarte did not return  
phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendiz, 40, has been held since his surrender in El  
Paso on July 13. He awaits a Feb. 14 capital murder trial in one of 
nine killings nationwide to which police say he is linked.

<HEADLINE> First Union Faces 401(k) Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Eighteen former and current employees of  
First Union Corp., have filed a $300 million lawsuit against the 
nation's sixth-largest bank, claiming it put profits ahead of its 
employees' best interests in managing their in-house 401(k) 
retirement plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed Tuesday claims First Union employees have lost  
$100 million by being forced to invest in poorly performing, 
high-fee First Union mutual funds. The suit could draw in 100,000 
current and former members of First Union's 401(k) plan if it is 
certified as a class-action, according to the court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the lawsuit has been filed under federal antitrust and  
anti-racketeering statutes, plaintiffs could receive triple 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed Tuesday was the second in about four months  
challenging First Union's handling of employee 401(k) plans. A 
similar, $150 million lawsuit was filed in May on behalf of 5,000 
former employees of Signet, a Richmond-based bank that First Union 
bought in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued from First Union's Charlotte, N.C.,  
headquarters Tuesday, the company said it would vigorously defend 
itself against the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have and will administer our plan for the benefit of the  
participants. Our plan provides participants with a broad range of 
investment options, which are prudently and appropriately 
selected,'' said company spokeswoman Donna Smart. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Lieder, attorney for the plaintiffs, said it is legal  
for employers to limit investors to in-house funds, but the law 
requires the bank to manage the funds in the best interests of 
beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are obligated by law to act solely in the interest of the  
beneficiaries of the plan and to act as a prudent person, with the 
knowledge First Union would have, would act,'' Lieder said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the lawsuit said, the company has engaged in  
``self-dealing, pure and simple.'' The bank often charged employees 
``full-freight'' for financial services while outside investors 
received waivers and discounts, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit also alleged that First Union piled the 401(k)  
investments into its own mutual funds to boost its funds' assets, 
hoping to make them more attractive to outside investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan contains about $3 billion in retirement savings,  
according to the court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking company has assets of $230 billion and operates  
primarily along the East Coast from Florida to Connecticut.

	Strong Earthquake Shakes Athens

	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A strong earthquake shook Athens for five  
to 10 seconds this afternoon, causing buildings to sway and sending 
tens of thousands of frightened people into the streets. Chunks of 
concrete fell from buildings onto cars, but no major damage was 
immediately apparent, although cracks appeared in some buildings 
and police said one house apparently collapsed. The power was out 
in some places. According to the Athens Seismological Institute, 
the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 5.9, and was centered 
about 12 miles north of Athens. Numerous aftershocks could be felt.

terror-ridden province. East Timor's spiritual leader, Roman 
Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, fled the territory on an evacuation

Negotiations with Israel on a final peace settlement are to begin

than western Turkey, where shoddy construction was blamed for the 
near total destruction of some places after the 7.4-magnitude quake 
on Aug. 17. Most of the Greek damage and casualties were 
concentrated in working-class and immigrant areas north of Athens, 
where construction standards were apparently lower, some officials

Boris Yeltsin criticized Russian security forces Tuesday for 
``sloppiness,'' and said their main task now was to cut off the 
militants' support from abroad. Fighting raged on two fronts 
Tuesday, with Russian troops trying to turn back a weekend invasion 
into western Dagestan from the breakaway Chechnya region, and root 
out militants from a stronghold in central Dagestan.

	More Violence in India Elections  
</P>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- A governing party candidate on his way  
to address a campaign rally died in a land mine explosion Tuesday, 
the most serious election-related violence in the troubled northern 
state of Kashmir. Ghulam Haider Noorani, the Bharatiya Janata Party 
president in Kashmir, was traveling in a jeep when separatist 
rebels triggered the mine and fired at the vehicle, police said. 
More than 25,000 people have died over the past decade as dozens of 
separatist groups fight for independence or for merger with 
neighboring Pakistan. The Muslim militants had earlier called for a 
boycott of the Indian parliamentary elections.

	HOUSTON (AP) -- Tiny water droplets that could be billions of  
years old were found in a meteorite, the second found with water, a 
NASA researcher said. Droplets about one-tenth the width of a human 
hair were found in the so-called Zag meteorite, a 300-pound rock 
that broke into pieces when it struck a remote area of Morocco. The 
water may date to the beginnings of the universe. The discovery 
allows a close look at water not originating on Earth.

<HEADLINE> Iowa House Explosion Is Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHLAND, Iowa (AP) -- Propane gas may have fueled the explosion  
that killed seven people and destroyed the dream house a man built 
for his wife and two daughters in this small farming community, 
authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends said Jerry Usovsky had carefully landscaped the  
ranch-style home and put several custom touches in the kitchen -- 
including glass shelves suspended from the ceiling and a gas grill. 
</P>
<P>
	Usovsky survived Monday's blast, as did his 8-year-old daughter  
and two 10-year-old boys who also were thrown up to 30 feet away. 
Before he was taken to a hospital burn unit, Usovsky kept saying: 
``The grill. The grill,'' according to Maria Reif, one of the first 
people on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire Chief Mike Hadley said tests had detected a break in the  
line leading into the house from a 500-gallon tank of liquid 
propane gas behind the home. The tank was not damaged by the 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was raw LP (liquid propane) coming out of the line,''  
Hadley said. ``We can't tell you that is the cause, but that's 
where the investigation is centered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Fire Marshal Roy Marshall said the gas may have seeped  
somehow into the home's basement, ``but we're not 100 percent 
sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The seven victims, who had gathered at the house for a birthday  
party, were identified by relatives as Usovsky's wife, Juanita 
Usovsky, 38, and daughter, Ashley Usovsky, 6, along with Mrs. 
Usovsky's parents, two of her sisters and a brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	Usovsky and his other daughter, Marlena, 8, and four others were  
being treated at the burn unit at University Hospitals in Iowa 
City. He was in serious condition; his daughter was in good 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Two others were in critical condition, one was serious and one  
in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The house was demolished, but the basketball hoop beside it was  
untouched by the blast, as were several lamp posts and bulbs, a 
swing set in the back yard, a bird feeder and Usovsky's gold-tan 
Chrysler LeBaron convertible parked out front. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were a nice family, a good family. They were always  
together,'' said Jeff Eeling, the elementary school principal for 
the Pekin School District, where Marlena was a third-grader and 
Ashley a first-grader. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marlena liked to play basketball with her dad and Ashley, she  
was always bouncing around the playground,'' Eeling said. 
</P>
<P>
	A few of Usovsky's prized evergreens were charred by flames.  
</P>
<P>
	``One of his hobbies was landscaping,'' said Mayor Byron Kimble,  
``and he loved flowers and those evergreens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Usovsky, a property manager who rented apartments, did the  
framing of the house about 10 to 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took a lot of pride in everything he did,'' said Joyce  
Countryman, a relative. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the family was gathered for a birthday party for one of  
the Usovsky girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the Lord just decided to take them, but it's an awful  
way to go,'' she said. ``We're sure going to miss them.''

<HEADLINE> England, France May Miss Euro 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The field for soccer's 2000 European Championship should become  
clearer Wednesday -- and World Cup champion France and England are 
in danger of not qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech Republic and hosts Belgium and the Netherlands are  
already assured spots in the 16-nation tournament next summer. 
Italy, Spain, Sweden, Norway and Romania will join them with 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	But if England and France lose, the English definitely will be  
out and the French will have only a mathematical chance of 
survival. That means stars such as David Beckham, Michael Owen, 
Zinedine Zidane and Didier Deschamps could be idle when the 
European title is decided. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech Republic -- runner-up to Germany in the last European  
Championship -- qualified three months ago and will be aiming for a 
record ninth straight win. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine group winners and the best of the runners-up qualify  
while the other eight second-place finishers enter a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	France is home against Iceland, and Poland is home against  
England. England and Poland are even on points but the Poles have a 
game in hand so Kevin Keegan's team has to win to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Keegan hopes Beckham will have recovered from the hamstring  
injury in Saturday's 6-0 rout of Luxembourg in which Alan Shearer 
scored three times. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy, which has a three-point lead, can afford to lose 1-0 at  
home to Denmark and still take first in Group 1. Italy is unbeaten 
in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our biggest defect has been to take everything for granted,''  
coach Dino Zoff said. ``We shouldn't ruin everything now, when 
we're so close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Group 3 is a two-team race between defending champion Germany  
and Turkey. Both won Saturday and are tied with 15 points from six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Germans are expected to beat Northern Ireland. The Turks  
should win in Moldova, setting up a crucial game in Munich on Oct. 
9. The Germans would have to win that game, having lost to Turkey 
11 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Group 4 is the closest, with four teams in contention. Ukarine  
leads Russia, Iceland and France by one point and plays at 
Reykjavik. Russia should win at Andorra, and the French can't 
afford to lose at Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden is almost certain to beat Luxembourg to finish first in  
Group 5. Spain leads Group 6 by three points while Cyprus, which 
has never qualified for a major international championship, jumped 
into second by beating Israel 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Romania and Portugal, first and second, are the only contenders  
in Group 7. Group 8 leader Croatia sits out Saturday's games and 
could wind up in third place after Yugoslavia visits Macedonia and 
Ireland plays at Malta. 
</P>
<P>
	Having beaten neighbor Macedonia 3-1 on Saturday, the Yugoslavs  
are confident of a repeat in Skopje. The Irish, beaten 1-0 by 
Croatia, should bounce back against Malta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czechs rule Group 9, with the race for second among  
Scotland, Estonia and Lithuania.

<HEADLINE> Son of Phil Simms Adjusts to Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- So far, the most difficult adjustment for  
Chris Simms, the New Jersey high school star quarterback turned 
Texas freshman, has been the language. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many Yankees, Simms has no concept of that mainstay of  
Southern dialects -- fixin'. 
</P>
<P>
	``I say I'm going to the movies. They say they're fixin' to go  
to the movies,'' Simms said, laughing. ``I just do not understand 
what that word means. What are you fixin' to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simms, the son of former New York Giants quarterback Phil Simms,  
got to play for the first time last week in Texas' 69-17 romp over 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	After throwing for 27 yards and a touchdown in mop-up duty, he  
could play again when Texas (1-1) faces Rutgers (0-1) Saturday in 
Piscataway, N.J., just 40 miles from his home in Franklin Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Texas rules, freshmen can't talk to the media until they  
have played in a game. Finally allowed to speak, Simms' rolled off 
stories about how an Easterner with NFL pedigree and a rocket of a 
left arm had adjusted to life in the Lone Star State. 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, he loves barbecue, his teammates tease him about  
his clothes and he digs watching his old man sweat it out in the 
stands in the Texas heat. 
</P>
<P>
	His most embarrassing moment was his first on campus. After  
spending the night at the posh Four Seasons hotel, he was ready to 
move on campus when freshmen were due. 
</P>
<P>
	Having no car in town, he asked the hotel for help. It sent the  
hotel limousine service, a garish white van with leather seats and 
a wet bar. The van, and the two women attendants dressed in black 
suits and ties, left Simms feeling a bit sheepish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told my mom I'm not riding in that. I knew I was never going  
to live it down,'' Simms said. 
</P>
<P>
	Longhorns players took one look at that on the evening news and  
dubbed Simms ``Limo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as the varsity got here, they had seen it on TV, they  
were like, `What are you doing?' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Simms loves the Italian food back home but is enamored of Texas  
barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't recall one barbecue joint (in New Jersey),'' Simms  
said. ``I love barbecue. They make fun of me because I go out to 
dinner a lot and I eat barbecue almost every night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crawfish are another story.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've got like tentacles ... I'll never eat the stuff.''  
</P>
<P>
	His New Jersey accent and clothes -- lots of blacks and grays and  
jeans slung low on his hips -- sometimes prompts jokes from 
teammates who have never been east of the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of my friends call me the Italian Stallion,'' said  
Simms, who with a shock of blond hair and blue eyes looks about as 
Italian as Boomer Esiason. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're used to more happier colors here.''  
</P>
<P>
	The trip home will mean another chance for his dad to watch him  
play. ABC cut away to Phil Simms watching from the stands during 
the Stanford game, looking very hot in the 94-degree weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun watching him sit in the stands and suffer in the heat  
having to watch me,'' Simms said. ``I had to do it for him the for 
first 13 years of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simms was 3 of 7 passing in the fourth quarter when the game was  
all but over. After the touchdown, he spread his arms and ran 
around as if he were flying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was like a kid in a candy store the first time,'' he said.  
``I couldn't get the smile off my face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The debut wasn't perfect. His first two passes were batted down  
at the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 6-foot-5 and couldn't get it over the line. I couldn't  
believe that,'' Simms said. 
</P>
<P>
	Simms' toughest challenge may be living up to the expectations.  
Even with the return of quarterback Major Applewhite, the 1998 Big 
12 freshman of the year, some fans speculated he could contend for 
the starting role. 
</P>
<P>
	Although coach Mack Brown has never indicated that's even a  
possibility, Applewhite has seemed to respond to Simms' presence. 
He's thrown for 669 yards and four touchdowns in two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Applewhite, one of the first to congratulate Simms on his  
touchdown pass, says the two have worked well together. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't bother me,'' Applewhite said. ``The backup QB is  
probably the most popular guy on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel a push from Chris. I need to help him or whoever  
it might be become a good backup,'' Applewhite said. 
</P>
<P>
	Simms wants no part of a quarterback controversy but can thank  
himself for fueling one. 
</P>
<P>
	He initially committed to Tennessee, where he could have fought  
to replace senior Tee Martin next year. He then chose Texas, where 
Applewhite is only a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone knows Major is the starter,'' Simms said. ``I  
haven't done anything yet.''

<HEADLINE> 49ers Cut Veteran Merton Hanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Nine-year free safety Merton Hanks, a  
former Pro Bowl player known for his neck-shaking chicken dance 
after big plays, was surprisingly cut by the San Francisco 49ers 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The release of the popular veteran and team leader was primarily  
dictated by salary cap constraints in the aftermath of a trade 
earlier Tuesday with Green Bay for cornerback Craig Newsome. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers saved more than $1 million in cap room by releasing  
Hanks, who was the NFC's starter in four of the past five Pro 
Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	He was coming off his worst season, however, and barely survived  
an offseason salary cap purge during which general manager Bill 
Walsh lopped off $28 million in player payroll to get the 49ers 
under the cap. 
</P>
<P>
	``Merton Hanks has been a terrific player for us for nine  
years,'' Walsh said in a statement. ``He has been a Pro Bowl 
performer and a dynamic personality on this team. It's truly one of 
the most difficult decisions we had to make. He's one of those guys 
who will never completely be replaced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh also said the 49ers would be happy to take Hanks back if  
he was willing to take a pay cut and accept a non-starting role. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very hopeful that Merton will return to the team with a  
somewhat different role,'' Walsh said. ``But he'll have his 
options. At this point in his career, it's our feeling that Merton 
would be best suited as a third-down nickel back rather than as a 
starting free safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a player's off day at the team's headquarters in Santa  
Clara and Hanks wasn't immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as a ball-hawking playmaker, Hanks established himself as  
one of the game's best free safeties. Hanks has 31 career 
interceptions, including 29 since he became a fulltime starter in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He often celebrated his picks by breaking into a dance,  
punctuating the celebration with a wild wagging of his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season was a tough one for Hanks, though. He was beaten on  
several deep pass plays, including one in which Green Bay's Antonio 
Freeman zipped past him and Marquez Pope for an 80-yard touchdown 
on the first play of a 36-22 loss to the Packers last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanks also was involved in the play epitomizing the end of San  
Francisco's season last year when Jamal Anderson bowled him over en 
route to a touchdown in Atlanta's 20-18 playoff victory over the 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh, who traded such veterans as two-time Pro Bowl guard Kevin  
Gogan in the cap purge, openly suggested he would deal or release 
Hanks because of the team's economic concerns before the sides 
restructured his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	But the continued strong play of Bronson and a poor preseason by  
Hanks made his release more palatable to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers acquired Newsome for an undisclosed future draft pick.  
Newsome, who earns $800,000, became expendable in Green Bay when 
rookies Antuan Edwards and Mike McKenzie played well in the 
preseason and moved ahead of him in the Packers' lineup.

<HEADLINE> Gators' Running Game Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- When things got tough last weekend,  
No. 4 Florida did something different. The Gators ran. 
</P>
<P>
	In its most impressive ground attack since September 1997,  
Florida piled up 289 yards rushing against Western Michigan, a 
stark turnaround for a rushing attack that ranked 95th in the 
nation last year. 
</P>
<P>
	For a time in the second half, it was hard to believe this was  
the Fun 'N Gun offense. It looked more like a scene from the 
Southeastern Conference of the 1960s, '70s or '80s, when Bear 
Bryant, Vince Dooley and Pat Dye roamed the sidelines and Bobby 
Humphrey, Herschel Walker and Bo Jackson worked on the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Redshirt freshman Earnest Graham and junior Bo Carroll took  
turns moving the sticks and crushing the other team's spirit, 
helping turn a five-point lead into a 55-26 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people don't want to see that,'' quarterback Doug  
Johnson said of the rushing attack. ``But in order to be successful 
in this conference, you've got to run the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As impressive as the way the Gators ran was the time they chose  
to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Western Michigan used turnovers and a strong passing game to  
pull within 31-26 early in the third quarter. Normally at Florida, 
that's a time to unleash the passing attack. Instead, the Gators 
ran on 20 of their next 28 plays, producing 131 rushing yards, 
three touchdowns and another drive for a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one play in the entire sequence, a 47-yard touchdown pass  
from Johnson to Alex Willis, netted more than 18 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just kept handing the ball off and running the same play and  
we'd get 10, 11, 15 yards a pop,'' Johnson said. ``If that's going 
to keep working, we might as well keep handing the ball off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, teams dared Florida to run. The whole thing came to  
a head against Florida State, when 30 rushing attempts netted 
minus-13 yards in a 23-12 loss. Many of those runs came against a 
stretched out, soft zone defense and a three-man line, but even 
then, the Gators couldn't make any yardage. 
</P>
<P>
	They spent the offseason working on their running game. Even  
though the opener came against Western Michigan, the success surely 
instilled some confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something different,'' offensive lineman Kenyatta  
Walker said. ``Instead of things getting close and then throwing it 
a lot, we could stay on the ground and let the clock run. I hope it 
gets better Saturday and the next Saturday and the Saturday after 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will take some willpower from coach Steve Spurrier to make  
that happen. But last year's statistics may have changed the coach 
ever so slightly. In Florida's two losses last season, to Tennessee 
and Florida State, the Gators gained a total of 4 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	With a game against a much inferior opponent suddenly in limbo,  
he wanted to show he had confidence in a revamped ground game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes if you throw incomplete three straight times, that  
clock doesn't move too much,'' Spurrier said. ``We felt like we 
didn't want to put the defense out there the whole second half.''

<HEADLINE> Detroit Teachers To Vote on Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit's striking teachers vote Wednesday on  
whether to return to work after blocking two major proposals put 
forth by the reform-minded administration -- merit pay and a longer 
school day. 
</P>
<P>
	The school board and negotiators for the 11,500-member teachers  
union agreed on a tentative contract Monday. A ratification vote on 
the contract will be conducted by mail in the next week to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the teachers will vote on whether to return to  
school in the meantime. Classes for the district's 180,000 students 
were supposed to have started Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The union had been unhappy with proposals for a longer school  
day, merit pay, class size and other reforms administrators sought 
after the Legislature voted in March to replace Detroit's elected 
school board with one appointed by the mayor. Similar school 
takeovers have been enacted in Chicago and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools in Detroit, the nation's 10th-largest city, have been  
beset by mismanagement and chronically low test scores, attendance 
and graduation rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agreement would give all teachers a 2 percent pay raise  
during each of its three years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the settlement does not include a merit pay plan, which had  
been a priority of the administration, or a longer school day. 
</P>
<P>
	The district proposed a plan under which teachers would receive  
merit raises only in those schools whose test scores improved. The 
union said that would be unfair to top teachers in lower-performing 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The district's top administrator, David Adamany, insisted that  
merit pay could still be imposed without union approval. He said 
the Michigan Employment Relations Commission would be asked to 
decide the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor experts said that could lead teachers to reject the new  
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they plan to get around their collective bargaining  
agreement by imposing merit pay after the contract is signed, 
that's a good way to ensure the contract does not pass,'' said 
Michael Belzer, a labor relations professor at the University of 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of whether it's technically legal under state law,  
the school district would certainly be poisoning its relationship 
with the schoolteachers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new agreement would partly grant teachers' demand for  
smaller classes, but only in kindergarten to third grade. It also 
would impose more restrictions on unexcused absences of teachers, a 
board priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Union president John Elliott said in announcing the settlement  
Monday that the union is open to school reform and willing to work 
with Adamany. 
</P>
<P>
	Some teachers complained that Elliott was not tough enough with  
the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-grade teacher Mark O'Keefe said he was disappointed that  
the class-size limits didn't apply more broadly. ``I want to go 
back to work, but I don't want this contract,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Showdown Set for Browns, Steelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Orlando Brown sees red when he thinks about  
playing against the gold and black. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate Pittsburgh,'' said Cleveland's mammoth offensive  
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	It's Steelers Week here. Traditionally, that meant Browns fans  
began warming up for Sunday's game about the time they rolled out 
of bed on Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's players were no different, as everything they did  
was focused upon beating the dreaded team from Pittsburgh. The 
Browns' front office and coaching staff would ask former players 
like Jim Brown, Ozzie Newsome and Hanford Dixon to visit practice 
during Steelers Week. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would bring in guys to give us a pep talk,'' said Brown.  
``They kind of groomed me to hate Pittsburgh. That's how they 
brought me up. To hit anything in yellow and black.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Browns home opener is still five days away, and  
already Brown has his game face on for the Steelers. During a 
rushing drill on Tuesday, he and defensive end Derrick Alexander 
got tangled up and Brown took a shot to the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Brown, who prefers to be called ``Zeus'' instead of  
Orlando, flung his helmet about 20 feet into the air and shot a 
menacing look at 6-foot-8, 330-pound offensive guard Scott Rehberg 
as he wiped blood off his lower lip. 
</P>
<P>
	When told of the incident later, Browns coach Chris Palmer said  
simply, ``The season is here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so is Steelers Week.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday night, the new Browns will begin a new football era in  
Cleveland against their old nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland-Pittsburgh is the NFL's version of Army vs. Navy,  
Yankees vs. Red Sox and Hatfield vs. McCoys. Few rivalries in 
sports can match it for intensity. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is city on city here,'' said Palmer.  
</P>
<P>
	Because the steel towns are roughly 120 miles apart, it wasn't  
uncommon for thousands of Steelers fans to make the trip across the 
Ohio border and help pack the old Cleveland Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes the fighting in the stands was more entertaining than  
the action on the field, and Brown said as a young player he often 
found himself watching as security and police tried to keep the 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the young guys here don't know the feeling of coming  
on the field and seeing all that yellow and black and orange,'' he 
said. ``I don't like that yellow and black. I can't stand that 
yellow and black.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, along with defensive tackle Jerry Ball and cornerback  
Antonio Langham are the only current Cleveland players who know 
what it's like to play in a Browns-Steelers game. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown and Langham were on the last Cleveland team to play  
against Pittsburgh before owner Art Modell took the franchise to 
Baltimore in 1996. The Ravens attempted to stir up a rivalry with 
the Steelers, Brown said, but it never got started. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to carry it over,'' he said. ``But it didn't work. It  
just wasn't the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown did find that although he was wearing purple and black,  
some of the Steelers still saw him in brown and orange. 
</P>
<P>
	During one Pittsburgh-Baltimore game, Brown was making a pancake  
block on Steelers defensive end Kevin Henry when he was grabbed in 
a very sensitive area. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never experienced that,'' said Brown. ``I've been playing  
ball since high school and I never grabbed a guy (there). That's 
the worst thing that ever happened to me in football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like most of the new Browns, quarterback Ty Detmer has only been  
told stories about the Cleveland-Pittsburgh rivalry. He's heard 
about the time Browns defensive end ``Turkey Joe'' Jones tried to 
plant Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw in the turf at Cleveland 
Stadium, and of the day Eric Metcalf ran back two punts for TDs to 
beat Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer can't wait to be a part of the rivalry's next chapter.  
</P>
<P>
	``You know the fans are fired up,'' he said. ``As players, we  
haven't developed that rivalry yet, but I don't think it will take 
more than a couple of plays to.''

<HEADLINE> Front Office Mixup Costs Rams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A front office mixup cost the St. Louis Rams a  
backup defensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams lost Corey Sears because they were late notifying the  
NFL on Sunday about two players who were waived with injury 
settlements. The league made the Rams waive two other players and 
keep running back June Henley and offensive lineman Jeremy McKinney 
on the active roster for another day. 
</P>
<P>
	So, the Rams waived Sears and cornerback Clifton Crosby with the  
idea of re-claiming them once the 24-hour claiming period ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams filled Sears' spot by signing defensive tackle Paul  
Grasmanis. Grasmanis spent three season with the Chicago Bears. He 
had 20 tackles and one sack in 15 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Crosby cleared waivers, but Sears, who started two preseason  
games, was claimed by the Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an emotional roller coaster, but that's business,'' Sears  
said. ``You can't have hard feelings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dick Vermeil was furious at the NFL office, not his  
personnel department. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what anyone gains by getting it in 10 minutes  
later or 11 minutes later,'' Vermeil said. ``The E-mail was in. The 
decisions were made two hours earlier.''

<HEADLINE> First Union Faces 401(k) Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Employees of First Union Corp. filed a $300  
million lawsuit Tuesday against the banking giant alleging that the 
company put its profits ahead of its employees' best interests in 
managing their in-house 401(k) retirement plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is the second in about four months challenging First  
Union's handling of employee 401(k) plans. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar, $150 million lawsuit was filed in May on behalf of  
5,000 former employees of Signet, a Richmond-based bank that First 
Union bought in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed Tuesday could draw in 100,000 current and  
former members of First Union's 401(k) plan if it is certified as a 
class-action, according to the court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the eighteen named plaintiffs say that First Union  
employees have lost $100 million by being forced to invest in 
poorly performing, high-fee First Union mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the lawsuit has been filed under federal antitrust and  
anti-racketeering statutes, plaintiffs could receive triple 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued from First Union's Charlotte, N.C.,  
headquarters Tuesday, the company said it would vigorously defend 
itself against the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have and will administer our plan for the benefit of the  
participants. Our plan provides participants with a broad range of 
investment options, which are prudently and appropriately 
selected,'' said company spokeswoman Donna Smart. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Lieder, attorney for the plaintiffs, said it is legal  
for employers to limit investors to in-house funds, but the law 
requires the bank to manage the funds in the best interests of 
beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are obligated by law to act solely in the interest of the  
beneficiaries of the plan and to act as a prudent person, with the 
knowledge First Union would have, would act,'' Lieder said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the lawsuit said, the company has engaged in  
``self-dealing, pure and simple.'' The bank often charged employees 
``full-freight'' for financial services while outside investors 
received waivers and discounts, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit also alleged that First Union piled the 401(k)  
investments into its own mutual funds to boost its funds' assets, 
hoping to make them more attractive to outside investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan contains about $3 billion in retirement savings,  
according to the court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking company has assets of $230 billion and operates  
primarily along the East Coast from Florida to Connecticut.

<HEADLINE> Clinton the Most Traveled President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, once a reluctant foreign  
traveler, has slipped quietly into the history books as the most 
widely traveled president ever. 
</P>
<P>
	His journeys over nearly seven years have taken him to 58  
countries and territories, from Australia to Venezuela, from 
Argentina to Uganda, visiting some more than once. Next stop: New 
Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	George Bush, by comparison, visited 36 countries and territories  
over four years, while Ronald Reagan stopped in 26 over eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	White House aides are just beginning to discuss possible foreign  
destinations for Clinton in 2000, the final full year of his 
presidency. The hottest speculation is that he will visit Vietnam, 
a place he struggled to avoid when he was draft-age. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, aides note that the president told the Chinese women's  
soccer team he would like to go to China again -- even though 
relations were soured by the accidental U.S. bombing of the Chinese 
embassy in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	A return to Africa -- following up on last year's tour -- is  
another possibility, perhaps to celebrate Nigeria's turn to 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton probably will visit India and Pakistan in 2000 after  
postponing a visit this year because of their nuclear tests, aides 
say. He also will attend two international summits in Asia, the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) in Brunei, and the 
annual summit of industrialized nations, in Okinawa, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will return to Europe next year for a U.S.-European  
Union summit and perhaps visit Russia again. He would go back to 
Ireland and to the Middle East if peacemaking efforts warranted a 
presidential visit, aides say. Morocco, in particular, is being 
considered for another visit after a brief stop in July for the 
funeral of King Hassan II. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton would like to visit Kosovo, liberated from Serb  
occupation by U.S.-led bombing attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	There even have been discussions about stopping in Antarctica to  
highlight the problems of global warming. However, aides say that 
idea has been put aside because of logistical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a guy that has never met an idea that he doesn't like,  
never met a person who's not interesting and never found a place in 
the world he wouldn't want to go,'' said presidential counselor 
Doug Sosnik. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House will gather recommendations from the State  
Department and other agencies at the end of the year and present a 
list to the president for his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule of thumb (for presidents) is, the longer they're in  
office, the more they travel ... the more they are interested in 
their historical legacy,'' said Stephen Hess, presidential analyst 
at the Brookings Institution. ``As they come to the end of their 
regime, they tend to get more adulation and cheering crowds when 
the go abroad. Politicians, particularly presidents, like that sort 
of stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winding up 1999, the president will add New Zealand to his  
travel list when he attends the annual APEC meeting, opening this 
weekend in Auckland. In October, he will make an overnight trip to 
Canada -- the fifth visit there of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	The last scheduled excursion of the year is a four-nation swing  
just before Thanksgiving to Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip's centerpiece is a summit of the 55-nation Organization  
for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The meeting is to be held 
in Istanbul despite the devastating earthquake that killed more 
than 14,000 and left hundreds of thousands homeless in Turkey. 
Administration officials say Turkey wants to show it's still on its 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	At the outset of his administration, Clinton was not interested  
in foreign travel. Instead, he focused on reviving the economy, 
promoting universal health insurance and other domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	He took only two foreign trips during his first year in office --  
an overnight visit to Canada and a six-day trip to Japan and South 
Korea. He was reluctant to go to Asia but was finally persuaded he 
could not pass up the annual summit of industrialized nations, held 
that year in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The first visit abroad by any president was by Theodore  
Roosevelt. His one and only foreign trip was to Panama in 1906 to 
inspect the construction of the Panama Canal, according to records 
kept by the State Department's Office of the Historian.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Heirs Buy NHL's Blues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Heirs to the Wal-Mart fortune found a big  
bargain -- a price of $100 million to buy the St. Louis Blues and 
Kiel Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill and Nancy Laurie bought the NHL team and the 5-year-old  
arena from Clark Enterprises, a group of 19 prominent local 
businessmen who were tired of pumping money into the enterprise. 
The team had been for sale for nearly a year and Clark walks away 
with almost nothing, since the deal also includes $96 million in 
debt on Kiel Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been searching for the right professional sports program  
for a number of months,'' Bill Laurie said Tuesday. ``It's 
incredible that the opportunity was literally in our back yard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sale awaits approval by the NHL Board of Governors and is  
expected to be completed by the end of September. No problems are 
anticipated, since the Lauries had been tentatively approved for a 
previous purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's a slam dunk,'' said Jerry Ritter, Clark  
Enterprises chairman of the board. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues are the third NHL team to change hands this year,  
following the Avalanche and Pittsburgh Penguins. Deals for two or 
three more are pending or in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries, who live in Columbia and raise quarter horses and  
Appaloosas, had been prepared to spend a lot more money. In March, 
they unsuccessfully bid $400 million for the NHL's Colorado 
Avalanche, the NBA's Denver Nuggets, and their new home, the Pepsi 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver deal fell through when shareholders of Ascent  
Entertainment Group, which owned the sports properties, filed suit, 
claiming the sale price was as much as $150 million too low. A 
settlement resulted in an auction. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Blues' price tag, the 20,000-seat Kiel Center alone  
cost $135 million, and the team's worth has been estimated at more 
than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But owners were saddled by debt service on Kiel Center, which  
was privately financed. They also had to pay for ill-advised 
signings and other excesses of the expensive 2 1/2-year reign of 
former coach and general manager Mike Keenan from 1994-1996. Owners 
said they had spent nearly $70 million the past four years to cover 
shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, the Lauries take on $96 million in debt on  
Kiel Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Laurie is lot more familiar with basketball than hockey. He  
was a guard at Memphis State and is a front-row fixture at Missouri 
basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, he knows next to nothing about hockey. He's never  
attended an NHL game and can't skate. 
</P>
<P>
	``At my age, it's not something I don't think I'm going to try  
anytime soon,'' the 47-year-old Laurie said. ``Although I am new to 
the hockey world, I enjoy all kinds of sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie wasn't ruling out pursuing an NBA franchise for the city.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let's go one thing at a time,'' he said. ``I guess if an NBA  
possibility came along, we would take a look at it. But I can 
honestly tell you today our focus is on hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sale coincided with the opening of the Blues' training camp  
on Monday. Bill Laurie met with the team Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm like everybody else,'' general manager Larry Pleau said.  
``We're all excited about this and we're ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries are the second Columbia entry into the St. Louis  
sports market in recent years; Stan Kroenke is a minority owner of 
the NFL's St. Louis Rams. The Lauries and Kroenkes are in-laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``These kinds of discussions, quite honestly, don't come up as  
much as you might think,'' Laurie said. ``Stan does his thing and I 
do mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Walton Laurie is the daughter of the late Bud Walton, who  
with his late brother Sam co-founded Wal-Mart. The Lauries own 
Crown Center Farms in Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple made the largest single donation to the University of  
Missouri in its history in 1996, offering $10 million toward the 
construction of a basketball arena. The donation was withdrawn a 
year later after the Lauries felt the university wasn't making 
enough progress toward construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark Enterprises announced Dec. 30 that it had hired an  
investment bank to explore the team's financial options. They 
included selling the Blues and Kiel Center, bringing an NBA team to 
the city or overhauling Kiel Center's capital structure.

<HEADLINE> Capriati Wants To Leave Past Behind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If her tennis racket was a wand, Jennifer  
Capriati would wave it to make her past disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	She found out Monday that there's no such magic, and life isn't  
so simple. 
</P>
<P>
	Desperate to banish the past and avoid comparisons to her youth,  
Capriati spoke of her teen-age rebellion and confusion in an 
emotional news conference an hour after losing to Monica Seles 6-4, 
6-3 in the fourth round of the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Capriati struck a note of maturity in her mea culpa, yet she  
revealed how fragile she remains, leaving the tournament once again 
in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	She began the news conference by reading a statement she said  
she wrote before the tournament and saved until she was finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there is much mystery, much question to what happened,  
and, I must also say, many lies,'' the 23-year-old player said of 
the collapse of her career in 1993, her subsequent arrests on 
shoplifting and drug possession charges, and her rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I made mistakes by rebelling, by acting out in confused  
ways,'' she said, taking deep breaths as she read. ``But it was all 
due to the fact I was very young and I was experiencing my 
adolescence. Most of you know how hard that can be. When you do it 
in front of the world, it is even harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She spoke of taking a different path than other players,  
learning a lot about herself and life along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I knew there would be so much pain in learning life's  
lessons,'' she said, ``I would have been hesitant to take the path 
that I took. It's the only thing I do regret. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me say that the path I did take for a brief period of my  
life was not of reckless drug use, hurting others, but it was a 
path of quiet rebellion, of a little experimentation of a darker 
side of my confusion in a confusing world, lost in the midst of 
finding my identity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made mistakes, and yes, I am to blame, and no one else. I am  
sorry to my loved ones that I humiliated and embarrassed. And I'm 
sorry to my fans who feel I let them down. I'm sorry to myself for 
causing such pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capriati said she has put much of her past behind her and feels  
she's moving in the right direction as she starts a new chapter in 
her life. She added that this would be the last time she speaks 
about the past, and asked the media to respect her wishes to stay 
away from the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the statement was something she wanted to write for a  
long time, and that this felt like the right moment. She had told 
her father about it -- Stefano Capriati sat in the interview room 
listening to her -- but hadn't told her mother, who is divorced from 
her father. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in response to questions about her statement, Capriati said  
she wrote it because she was ``tired of all the questions'' about 
her past, ``all the mystery. Just once and for all, I wanted to get 
it over with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Capriati never really clarified the events that led to her  
arrests or what happened to her afterward. The ``mystery'' remains 
untold, and Capriati said she's still not ready to talk about it 
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	Told that other athletes have experienced a sense of relief  
sometimes after talking openly about their problems, Capriati said 
she thought that's what reading her statement would do for her and 
that she wanted to make sure she explained herself the right way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just really didn't know how to handle it, just how to go  
about saying it, afraid I was going to say something wrong,'' she 
said. ``I didn't know really what to say that was just going to be 
right or I wasn't going to get in trouble. ... Maybe that's why 
I've played with a lot of anxiety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until that point in the long news conference, Capriati kept her  
composure, talking about her statement, her ``self-inflicted'' 
problems, the match with Seles. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she was asked, ``Do you still see the media as your  
adversary?'' Capriati hesitated. She has been the subject of mostly 
sympathetic stories her entire career, despite her troubles, yet 
she remains wary of the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to start crying. It's nothing bad, it's just ...''  
</P>
<P>
	Capriati broke off and began sobbing uncontrollably.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a little overwhelming, that's all,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	A WTA Tour representative, Jim Fuhse, asked her if she wanted to  
stop. Capriati shook her head. 
</P>
<P>
	``It needs to be done,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can stop if you want to,'' Fuhse said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just wish I didn't have to talk about this stuff all the  
time,'' Capriati said, sobbing more heavily. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuhse led her away, and her father came over to put his arms  
around her. Outside the interview room, a reporter who has long 
known her also tried comforting Capriati as she kept crying. 
Finally, after a few minutes, Capriati made her way down the hall 
to the locker room and away from the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	She had left tournaments in tears before -- the U.S. Open in 1992  
after losing in the third round, the Australian Open in 1993 after 
losing in the quarters, among others. She spoke now of being 
stronger than in those days, being able to keep things in 
perspective, yet she remains in some ways as fragile as ever.

<HEADLINE> Judge Denies Ford Internet Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A federal judge Tuesday denied Ford Motor Co.'s  
request to block a man from putting Ford's internal documents on 
his Internet site, saying such an order would violate the First 
Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds did ban Robert Lane, a  
32-year-old nursing student and Ford enthusiast, from destroying 
any Ford documents he might have. She also ordered Lane not to 
violate Ford copyrights and ordered him not to solicit information 
from Ford employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford claimed publishing the documents violated laws against  
disclosing trade secrets. But Edmunds said while Ford had a strong 
case, blocking Lane from putting the documents on the Internet 
would be an illegal prior restraint of speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``The courts have steadfastly held that the First Amendment does  
not permit the prior restraint of speech by way of injunction, even 
in circumstances where the disclosure threatens vital economic 
interests,'' Edmunds wrote in her opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane and his site, www.BlueOvalNews.com, had been under a  
temporary restraining order issued Aug. 25 ordering him to remove 
the documents and any material copyrighted by Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	``This once again demonstrates that average Americans CAN do  
remarkable things when it comes to our freedoms ... even when faced 
by huge corporations such as the Ford Motor Company!'' said a 
message posted on the site Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Ford said it was pleased with the ruling because  
it kept Lane from duplicating Ford documents protected by 
copyright. Ford spokesman Terry Bresnihan said the company has not 
decided whether to pursue any further actions against Lane. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane has testified he has received 112 Ford documents from  
anonymous sources, including blueprints and production schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the documents is an internal memo detailing problems with  
the 1999 Mustang SVT Cobra. Ford announced recently that all 5,300 
models sold had been recalled to fix exhaust problems that cut as 
much as 50 horsepower from the 320 horsepower the car is supposed 
to have. 
</P>
<P>
	In a court filing, Ford claimed Lane has ``inflicted irreparable  
harm'' by posting blueprints for new engines, schedules for new 
vehicles and product planning memos.

<HEADLINE> Comets Remain WNBA's Only Champion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Comets found a rallying cry for their  
third WNBA title: three for 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Comets completed a tragedy-marred season Sunday with a 59-47  
victory over the New York Liberty, giving Houston its third 
straight WNBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory in Game 3, which came after a buzzer-beating loss on  
a 52-foot 3-pointer by the Liberty, was dedicated to guard Kim 
Perrot, who wore No. 10 and died Aug. 19 after a seven-month battle 
with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``These players of ours, they stayed tough. They won it after  
the most heart-breaking loss I've ever been involved in,'' Comets 
coach Van Chancellor said, referring to Saturday's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has proven to be one of the great teams in the history of  
sports. And this trophy is for Kim, whose heart and determination 
will never be forgotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor will they forget the season filled with emotion. Cooper lost  
her mother to cancer before losing her best friend, Perrot. 
All-Star teammate Sheryl Swoopes got a divorce before the season 
began. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's especially sweet with everything that this team  
has gone through, emotionally, mentally, all the personal things 
that we have all gone through, all the sacrifices we have had to 
make,'' Swoopes said. ``Obviously, Kim not being here, that was 
very emotional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everything finally came together in the closing seconds of  
Sunday's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	From the free-throw line, Cooper raised her hands, showing the  
index finger with her right hand and a fist with the other -- a 
referee's signal for No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Tears welled in the players' eyes, and the sellout crowd of  
16,285 began chanting ``three for Kim, three for Kim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This championship was the hard one because of everything going  
on,'' forward Janeth Arcain said. ``It's been a very emotional 
season watching Kim fight her battle. We won this championship for 
her, and we know she was watching us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper had one of her worst shooting games Saturday. She went  
1-for-10 from the field and watched in disbelief as New York's 
Teresa Weatherspoon hit a 52-foot shot at the buzzer to give the 
Liberty a 68-67 victory and force Sunday's deciding game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Comets and Cooper came back Sunday even more determined.  
Cooper and Swoopes scored 20 of Houston's first 22 points, and the 
Comets rolled to a 33-25 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper finished with 24 points in a ruggedly played game that  
included 43 combined fouls. Cooper hit 13 of 15 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not going to go down 1-for-10. I was going to go down  
fighting for my team to win a third championship,'' Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	When New York narrowed Houston's lead to 38-31, the Comets  
pulled away with a 10-0 spurt. Tina Thompson had seven of the 10 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have overcome the obstacles and all the things we were  
faced with all year,'' Thompson said. ``So maybe this one will be a 
little more special because we won it for Kim. All the desire and 
passion and strength and toughness she brought to this team, we 
used it today (Sunday).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Comets plan to share the championship with the city of  
Houston during a downtown parade and rally Wednesday. Houston Mayor 
Lee Brown will be the host.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Presses Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -The World Bank today urged Indonesia to restore  
order in East Timor and respect its international commitments on 
the territory's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia is dependent on billions of dollars of international  
aid from the bank, the International Monetary Fund and other donors 
to rescue it from a devastating economic crisis. For weeks the 
Jakarta government has promised to take action against violence in 
East Timor but it has done little. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Bank said in a statement it was ``deeply concerned''  
by the violence that followed last week's overwhelming vote for 
independence from Indonesia by East Timor's 800,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank said those who voted ``took a brave step in going to  
the polls and deserve to see the results of the ballot 
implemented'' peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
	The 182-nation Washington-based lending organization said the  
situation in East Timor is of ``paramount importance to our 
shareholders, who constitute Indonesia's key international 
partners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We join with the IMF and our other partners in supporting a  
rapid response to the deteriorating security situation, in order 
that initiatives for economic recovery and poverty reduction may 
proceed in both Indonesia and East Timor,'' the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF, which is heading a $43 billion rescue program for  
Indonesia, said in a statement Monday it was closely watching 
developments in East Timor and ``notes with concern the violence 
that continues to mar the (transition) process. '' 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF portion of the rescue package is $12.2 billion with $9.7  
billion already disbursed. The next $460 million installment is 
scheduled for November, which means the fund has little chance to 
exert immediate leverage by threatening to postpone payment.

<HEADLINE>  Viacom To Buy CBS for $36.75B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Viacom Inc. is buying CBS Corp. in the richest  
media merger in history -- a $35.89 billion deal that combines the 
owner of hip properties like MTV and VH1 with the venerable network 
that brought you ``60 Minutes'' and ``Murder, She Wrote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The merger announced Tuesday vaults Viacom into the major  
leagues of media conglomerates alongside Time Warner Inc. and the 
Walt Disney Co. with a major stable of properties across TV, 
movies, radio and outdoor advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will be called Viacom, but the CBS name -- long  
associated with broadcast veterans like Walter Cronkite and Edward 
R. Murrow -- will continue to identify the TV network. 
</P>
<P>
	In a way, the deal was not so much a merger as a reunion. Viacom  
was originally split off from CBS in the early 1970s by federal 
rules, now repealed, that prohibited networks from owning their own 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone, who will lead the new company  
as its chairman and CEO, called CBS and Viacom ``siblings,'' saying 
at a New York news conference that the merger ``seems almost 
dictated by destiny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts and shareholders agreed with the upbeat assessment.  
Chris Dixon, a media analyst at PaineWebber Inc., called the merger 
a ``good deal for everybody. You need to be big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of both companies, which have been run up over the past  
week on speculation that a deal was in the works, shot up even more 
after the announcement of the merger Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS shares rose $1.75 or 3.6 percent to $50.68 3/4 as the most  
active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, where Viacom's Class B 
shares rose $1.87 1/2, or 4.2 percent, to $46.93 3/4 in heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal, CBS shareholders will receive 1.085  
shares of Viacom's Class B stock, which values CBS at $50.93 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Viacom is buying CBS's shares, CBS management will  
have a major role in the new company. CBS president Mel Karmazin, 
56, will be president and chief operating officer, becoming heir 
apparent to Redstone, who is 76. 
</P>
<P>
	All operations in the new company will report to Karmazin, and  
Redstone's top two lieutenants, deputy chairmen Tom Dooley and 
Philippe Dauman, will leave the company once the merger is 
completed, though they will continue to serve on the board. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Viacom will own the CBS network, which was the top-rated  
network last season, as well as the Paramount movie and TV studio, 
MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon, and the Simon &AMP; Schuster publishing house. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom is gaining major advertising outlets with CBS that it can  
use to promote its movies, cable programming and TV shows. CBS, 
through its Infinity subsidiary, is one of the largest radio 
companies in the nation, and it also has a huge array of outdoor 
advertising properties. 
</P>
<P>
	For CBS, the deal provides access to top TV studios for  
programming and international exposure through Viacom's overseas 
cable operations. Paramount's TV studio produces eight shows that 
will air this fall, all but one of them already on CBS or UPN, in 
which Viacom owns a half-interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger also joins together two of the media world's  
scrappiest entrepeneurs and deal-makers, Redstone and Karmazin. 
Redstone bought Viacom in 1987 and has since reshaped it into a 
major player with a series of acquisitions in cable and 
entertainment, the most spectacular being his victory in the 1994 
battle to take over Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
	Karmazin came from a humble background in the New York City  
borough of Queens and battled his way to the top of Infinity 
Broadcasting, which CBS bought three years ago. He took over as 
head of CBS two years after joining the company and has since 
orchestrated a string of ambitious deals, including the acquisition 
of the leading TV syndicator King World Productions Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Redstone, who has long rebuffed suggestions that Viacom might be  
involved in a major merger, was asked at the news conference what 
changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seduced us,'' a beaming Redstone said. ``This guy is the  
master salesman,'' he said, looking over at Karmazin. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal faces some regulatory hurdles, but analysts did not  
predict them to hold up the deal. The company may have to sell off 
some TV stations to satisfy federal ownership rules, and Viacom's 
half-interest in UPN may have to be sold off or folded into CBS in 
order to comply with a rule that forbids a company from owning more 
than one TV network. 
</P>
<P>
	Karmazin and Redstone plan to go to Washington on Wednesday to  
press their case to regulators, but they said they would dispose of 
properties if need be. ``At the end of the day, all we can do is go 
to Washington and make our case,'' Karmazin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would be the latest transformation of CBS, which was  
founded in 1927 and became known as the ``Tiffany Network'' under 
the leadership of William Paley. Paley's successor, Laurence Tisch, 
sold CBS to Westinghouse Electric Corp. in 1995. Westinghouse then 
shed its industrial businesses and took the CBS name. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal had its roots in talks between the two companies about  
combining their TV stations. Many media companies have been talking 
about such deals since a ruling last month by the Federal 
Communications Commission to allow companies to own more than one 
TV station in the same city. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS-Viacom merger would be the biggest in the media business  
since Disney's purchase of Capital Cities/ABC for a then-record $19 
billion in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Softball Hall of Famer Rice Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WENATCHEE, Wash. (AP) -- Little more than an hour after being  
inducted into the Central Washington men's fastpitch softball Hall 
of Fame, Rich Rice collapsed during an all-star game and died. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Rice was pitching his second inning in the  
exhibition game Sunday when he fell to the grass. Cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation was started immediately, but Rice died at the 
emergency room at Central Washington Hospital. The rest of the game 
was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Rice and 27 others were inducted into the  
local softball Hall of Fame. Rice's father, Harrel, also has a 
place in the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pretty big honor,'' Rice said before the game. ``It's  
always nice to be in there with my dad. I played with him a little 
bit and against him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrel Rice had a heart attack during a softball game in Yakima  
in 1973 but survived. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some reason, God let me live,'' Harrell Rice said Monday,  
``but not Rich.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Rice is survived by his wife, Donna, and two daughters.  
Funeral arrangements were pending.

<HEADLINE> Packers See Preseason As Harbinger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Ray Rhodes was overseeing practice on a  
normal day at training camp when he saw something he liked very 
much. 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis, while running the Green Bay  
Packers through the nether reaches of his playbook, pulled out a 
passing play that has been used sparingly, but to great effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a play I hadn't seen since we used it in the Super  
Bowl,'' said Rhodes, who was an assistant coach in San Francisco 
along with Lewis during the 49ers' glory days. ``John Taylor caught 
the game-winning touchdown pass on that play from Joe Montana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everything old is new this season in Green Bay, where the  
Packers are delicately trying to maintain their franchise rebirth 
without Mike Holmgren and Reggie White, the player and coach who 
personified the team and started it all. 
</P>
<P>
	Early returns -- a 4-0 preseason, an improved attitude in the  
locker room -- indicate GM Ron Wolf was correct in thinking Rhodes' 
fiery mentality was just the shot of adrenalin the Packers needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes, Lewis and defensive coordinator Emmitt Thomas are in  
control of a team with six straight playoff appearances, two Super 
Bowl trips and one title in the 1990s. With the emergence of the 
Minnesota Vikings and the remarkable run of the Atlanta Falcons 
last year, Green Bay was pushed out of the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not used to being the team nobody's talking about,''  
defensive tackle Santana Dotson said. ``It's kind of different, and 
it's nice because we know we're essentially the same team that went 
to two Super Bowls. That core is still here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf navigated cleanly through the offseason without any  
irreplaceable losses -- except White, of course. He also signed 
All-Pro receiver Antonio Freeman to a long-term deal, making him 
the NFL's highest-paid receiver and anchoring the Packers' key 
components through the middle of the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	As always, Brett Favre, the NFL's Most Valuable Player from  
1995-97, is the key. He threw for 4,212 yards and 31 touchdowns 
last season, but his career-high 23 interceptions were the only 
statistic anyone seemed to notice as he surrendered the MVP award 
to Denver's Terrell Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre reported to camp 20 pounds lighter, the better to avoid  
some of the 38 sacks he sustained last season and add to his 
remarkable reputation for durability. With eight starts to open the 
season, he can pass Ron Jaworski's record of 116 consecutive starts 
by a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't changed as much as everyone seems to think,'' Favre  
said. ``We're still a team that's going to throw the ball and hurt 
you a lot if you leave guys open. Our offense is still a force, I 
believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman, who missed the first two weeks of training camp in an  
amicable holdout, and Bill Schroeder will be Favre's primary 
targets. The Packers' experience at receiver is a concern after 
Green Bay traded Derrick Mayes to Seattle and lost Robert Brooks to 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Running back Dorsey Levens is healthy and happy after  
essentially losing last season with a contract holdout and an ankle 
injury that kept him out for nine games. Versatile William 
Henderson, the Packers' third-leading receiver with 37 catches in 
'98, returns at fullback. 
</P>
<P>
	Tight end Mark Chmura will miss the opener against Oakland while  
recovering from disc trouble in his back. His agent and his wife 
have urged him to retire, but Chmura remains confident he will 
return. Tyrone Davis will take his place. 
</P>
<P>
	The offensive line remains a concern. Outside of center Frank  
Winters and right tackle Earl Dotson, there are no standout 
starters, and the Miami Dolphins dominated the line of scrimmage in 
the final preseason game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need somebody to assert themselves on the line and just  
take control,'' Rhodes said. ``It hasn't happened yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After struggling early in the preseason, the defensive line has  
played well recently. Santana Dotson and Gilbert Brown return to 
anchor the middle, while second-year end Vonnie Holliday continues 
to look like White's replacement, both on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's becoming a leader on this team,'' safety Leroy Butler  
said. ``His play is at the point where guys listen to what he has 
to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The linebacking corps is unspectacular, with Brian Williams,  
Bernardo Harris and George Koonce returning as starters. Anthony 
Davis, Kansas City's leading tackler last season, impressed during 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers' run to consecutive conference titles ended when the  
San Francisco 49ers won a first-round playoff game by exploiting 
the weakness that killed Green Bay all year: inconsistent pass 
defense. Some said Wolf overcompensated by drafting defensive backs 
with his first three picks last April. 
</P>
<P>
	But cornerback Mike McKenzie, the third-round pick, bumped  
veteran Craig Newsome off the team. First-round pick Antuan Edwards 
also impressed, while cornerback Tyrone Williams' play has improved 
with the added competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning at safety are Darren Sharper and Butler, who sees many  
similarities between the current Packers and the team that captured 
the attention of the nation in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's that same sense of excitement around here,'' Butler  
said. ``We know it's going to be a tough task, but we feel like we 
can accomplish it. We're going to sneak up on some people.''

<HEADLINE>  Viacom To Buy CBS for $36.75B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Viacom Inc. is buying CBS Corp. in the richest  
media merger in history -- a $35.89 billion deal that combines the 
owner of hip properties like MTV and VH1 with the venerable network 
that brought you ``60 Minutes'' and ``Murder, She Wrote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The merger announced Tuesday vaults Viacom into the major  
leagues of media conglomerates alongside Time Warner Inc. and the 
Walt Disney Co. with a major stable of properties across TV, 
movies, radio and outdoor advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will be called Viacom, but the CBS name -- long  
associated with broadcast veterans like Walter Cronkite and Edward 
R. Murrow -- will continue to identify the TV network. 
</P>
<P>
	In a way, the deal was not so much a merger as a reunion. Viacom  
was originally split off from CBS in the early 1970s by federal 
rules, now repealed, that prohibited networks from owning their own 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone, who will lead the new company  
as its chairman and CEO, called CBS and Viacom ``siblings,'' saying 
at a New York news conference that the merger ``seems almost 
dictated by destiny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts and shareholders agreed with the upbeat assessment.  
Chris Dixon, a media analyst at PaineWebber Inc., called the merger 
a ``good deal for everybody. You need to be big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of both companies, which have been run up over the past  
week on speculation that a deal was in the works, shot up even more 
after the announcement of the merger Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS shares rose $1.75 or 3.6 percent to $50.68 3/4 as the most  
active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, where Viacom's Class B 
shares rose $1.87 1/2, or 4.2 percent, to $46.93 3/4 in heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal, CBS shareholders will receive 1.085  
shares of Viacom's Class B stock, which values CBS at $50.93 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Viacom is buying CBS's shares, CBS management will  
have a major role in the new company. CBS president Mel Karmazin, 
56, will be president and chief operating officer, becoming heir 
apparent to Redstone, who is 76. 
</P>
<P>
	All operations in the new company will report to Karmazin, and  
Redstone's top two lieutenants, deputy chairmen Tom Dooley and 
Philippe Dauman, will leave the company once the merger is 
completed, though they will continue to serve on the board. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Viacom will own the CBS network, which was the top-rated  
network last season, as well as the Paramount movie and TV studio, 
MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon, and the Simon &AMP; Schuster publishing house. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom is gaining major advertising outlets with CBS that it can  
use to promote its movies, cable programming and TV shows. CBS, 
through its Infinity subsidiary, is one of the largest radio 
companies in the nation, and it also has a huge array of outdoor 
advertising properties. 
</P>
<P>
	For CBS, the deal provides access to top TV studios for  
programming and international exposure through Viacom's overseas 
cable operations. Paramount's TV studio produces eight shows that 
will air this fall, all but one of them already on CBS or UPN, in 
which Viacom owns a half-interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger also joins together two of the media world's  
scrappiest entrepeneurs and deal-makers, Redstone and Karmazin. 
Redstone bought Viacom in 1987 and has since reshaped it into a 
major player with a series of acquisitions in cable and 
entertainment, the most spectacular being his victory in the 1994 
battle to take over Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
	Karmazin came from a humble background in the New York City  
borough of Queens and battled his way to the top of Infinity 
Broadcasting, which CBS bought three years ago. He took over as 
head of CBS two years after joining the company and has since 
orchestrated a string of ambitious deals, including the acquisition 
of the leading TV syndicator King World Productions Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Redstone, who has long rebuffed suggestions that Viacom might be  
involved in a major merger, was asked at the news conference what 
changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seduced us,'' a beaming Redstone said. ``This guy is the  
master salesman,'' he said, looking over at Karmazin. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal faces some regulatory hurdles, but analysts did not  
predict them to hold up the deal. The company may have to sell off 
some TV stations to satisfy federal ownership rules, and Viacom's 
half-interest in UPN may have to be sold off or folded into CBS in 
order to comply with a rule that forbids a company from owning more 
than one TV network. 
</P>
<P>
	Karmazin and Redstone plan to go to Washington on Wednesday to  
press their case to regulators, but they said they would dispose of 
properties if need be. ``At the end of the day, all we can do is go 
to Washington and make our case,'' Karmazin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would be the latest transformation of CBS, which was  
founded in 1927 and became known as the ``Tiffany Network'' under 
the leadership of William Paley. Paley's successor, Laurence Tisch, 
sold CBS to Westinghouse Electric Corp. in 1995. Westinghouse then 
shed its industrial businesses and took the CBS name. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal had its roots in talks between the two companies about  
combining their TV stations. Many media companies have been talking 
about such deals since a ruling last month by the Federal 
Communications Commission to allow companies to own more than one 
TV station in the same city. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS-Viacom merger would be the biggest in the media business  
since Disney's purchase of Capital Cities/ABC for a then-record $19 
billion in 1996.

<HEADLINE> French Farm Union Head Out of Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VILLENEUVE-LES-MAGUELONE, France (AP) -- The leader of a French  
farmers' union who was jailed for nearly three weeks after 
vandalizing McDonald's restaurant property was freed from prison 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Bove and four other members of the Farmers Confederation  
were jailed for damaging a McDonald's construction site on Aug. 12 
to protest the spread of American trade ``hegemony'' and general 
economic globalization. 
</P>
<P>
	Bove was freed after his supporters and Roquefort cheese  
producers posted his $17,000 bail. The four other farmers were 
freed earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Bove's imprisonment bolstered his protest movement, gaining  
media attention and bringing in funds from sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of McDonald's France, Denis Hennequin, has  
estimated damage at about $113,000, but said the company decided to 
forgo joining in court action to calm the increasingly tense 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bove and his comrades remain under examination for the incident  
-- a step short of being charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The Farmers' Confederation, which has less than 500 members, has  
made McDonald's the main target in a wave of sometimes violent 
protests, decrying the fast-food chain as a symbol of American 
trade dominance and economic globalization. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 people welcomed Bove as he left prison near  
Montpellier, in southern France. In front of the jail, they held a 
picnic featuring local products that Bove's supporters fear will 
become gastronomic relics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was impressed by the support movement that grew out of our  
imprisonment,'' Bove said. ``That shows it is not an individual in 
question in this affair, but a global problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters initially decried U.S. sanctions on a slew of  
products ranging from Roquefort cheese to foie gras in retaliation 
for the European Union's decision to ban imports of hormone-treated 
beef. 
</P>
<P>
	Bove said he wanted to work with French authorities to define a  
common position for World Trade Organization talks set for Nov. 30 
in Seattle, Washington. The WTO is committed to making new efforts 
to further open trade in services and agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Food Lion Shareholders OK New Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALISBURY, N.C. (AP) -- Food Lion Inc. shareholders voted Tuesday  
to form a holding company with a new name that reflects its Belgian 
majority owner and is designed to aid the grocery store company's 
expansion into new brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Food Lion shareholders, meeting in New York, voted for the  
creation of Delhaize America Inc., which will include the company's 
more than 1,250 Food Lion, Kash n' Karry and Save 'n Pack 
supermarket stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Also under the Delhaize umbrella will be 152-store Hannaford  
Bros. grocery chain, which Food Lion Inc. announced Aug. 18 it 
would buy in a $3.35 billion cash-and-stock purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	The new holding company reflects the influence of Delhaize SA,  
which owns 53.5 percent of Salisbury-based Food Lion Inc. Food Lion 
accounts for more than 70 percent of the Belgian company's sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the recently announced acquisition of Hannaford Bros. and  
a new corporate structure, we will be well positioned under these 
banners as a new premier food retailer for the 21st Century,'' 
Delhaize America president and chief executive officer Bill 
McCanless said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders Tuesday also approved a one-for-three reverse stock  
split of Food Lion's current outstanding Class A and Class B 
shares, which will be converted to Delhaize America shares. The 
decision, which is intended to increase institutional purchases, 
means that three Food Lion shares at $8 per share would now be 
converted into one Delhaize America share at $24. 
</P>
<P>
	Delhaize America, which will be listed on the New York Stock  
Exchange beginning Thursday, the same day that Food Lion shares 
will be removed from the Nasdaq stock market. The shares will trade 
under the symbols DZA and DZB. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders also authorized 500 million shares of a new class  
of preferred stock that could be issued with private offerings of 
shares for cash, dividends payable in company stock, acquisitions 
and other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders also voted to raise the maximum number of directors  
for the new company from 10 to 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Delhaize America's largest chain is Food Lion, with 1,120 stores  
in 11 southeastern states.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Puts Storm Damage at $43M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUXTON, N.C. (AP) -- As drenching downpours from the remnants of  
Dennis streamed northward today, North Carolina assessed the impact 
of the former hurricane on the state's fragile coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's some of the worst flooding that I've heard about from a  
hurricane. And I've been around a lot of them,'' Gov. Jim Hunt said 
Monday during a helicopter tour of coastal counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary damage estimates from Dennis, which weakened from a  
hurricane to a tropical depression, total more than $43 million in 
North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the saturated atmosphere left over from Dennis caused  
flooding in parts of Pennsylvania, where many areas were soaked by 
2 to 8 inches of rain, and schools were closed in several 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	About 175 people were evacuated from low-lying sections of  
Lycoming County, in north-central Pennsylvania, and several people 
were rescued from flooded campgrounds in nearby Snyder County. 
</P>
<P>
	Four people, including three children, were hospitalized in fair  
to serious condition after lightning struck a tree where they were 
standing at a park in Lancaster, Pa., late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rain really started coming down and, apparently, everyone  
was running for cover,'' said Lancaster police Sgt. Pete 
Glatfelter. ``They were fortunate in that the lightning hit the 
tree and not them directly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Virginia, Brunswick County on the North Carolina line  
postponed today's scheduled school year opening because of 
flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	During his helicopter tour, Hunt surveyed flattened sand dunes  
and washed-out roads on North Carolina's Outer Banks. Later, he 
promised help for flooded homeowners and respite from mosquitoes 
breeding in stagnant water. 
</P>
<P>
	On Hatteras Island, workers were already paving a new 3,000-foot  
section of N.C. 12 north of Buxton. Dennis washed away part of the 
road and covered the rest with a new sand dune. 
</P>
<P>
	As a hurricane, Dennis sideswiped the Outer Banks last week,  
then went out to sea and stalled. It backtracked and came ashore on 
Saturday, then slowly made its way inland, dumping up to 20 inches 
of rain on coastal North Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices closed lower today as  
speculators took profits after Monday's rise and ahead of the 
release of Japanese economic data. The dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 49.01 points,  
or 0.28 percent, to 17,707.50 at the end of the daily trading 
session. On Monday, the average closed up 126.52 points, or 0.72 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 110.80 yen late today, up 1.18 yen from late  
Monday's level of 109.62 yen in Tokyo and also above its late 
London level of 109.58 yen overnight. Financial markets in New York 
were closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock dealing, brokerage dealers sold to square positions  
ahead of the release of Japan's April-June economic data Thursday. 
The absence of foreign participation because of a three day weekend 
in the United States made trading lackluster amid few fresh 
incentives, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's trading showed that the local market is momentumless  
without foreign participation,'' said Masatoshi Sato, manager of 
investment information at Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's gross domestic product grew 2.0 percent during the first  
quarter of this year, emerging from a string of negative growth 
quarters amid its worst economic downturn in 50 years. Many market 
participants expect the figure to have fallen around 0.1 percent in 
the April-June quarter from the preceding quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 487.07 million shares, up from 450.52 million shares 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Retreating issues outnumbered advancers 789 to 398 on the Tokyo  
Stock Exchange First Section, while 152 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 7.46 points, or 0.49 percent, to 1,504.62. 
The TOPIX closed up 15.08 points, or 1.00 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar stayed in a narrow range ahead  
of the release of Japan's economic data. The dollar traded from 
109.42 yen to 111.00 yen in Tokyo trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 116.82 yen, up from  
116.15 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 215 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.8000 percent from Monday's finish of 1.7900 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.84 yen from 100.93 yen.

<HEADLINE> Finance Minister: France Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said  
Tuesday that France's economic slowdown is over, citing 
second-quarter data showing robust growth in consumer spending and 
investment by industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures for the April-June quarter ``confirm the end of the  
slowdown in the French economy,'' a ministry statement quoted him 
as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that ``employment and purchasing power are the main  
beneficiaries'' of the renewed growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The national statistics office INSEE said Tuesday that gross  
domestic product expanded 0.6 percent in the second quarter, 
bettering economists' forecasts by 0.1 of a percentage point. 
First-quarter expansion was measured at 0.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer spending rose 0.6 percent in the second quarter.  
</P>
<P>
	Imports and exports, which had performed poorly in the first  
quarter, showed a sharp turnaround. Exports were up 1.8 percent 
after falling 1.2 percent in the first quarter, and imports rose 
1.6 percent after retreating 1.3 percent in the first three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The French economy is ... on a rising trajectory,''  
Strauss-Kahn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since June 1997, when the Socialist-led government of Prime  
Minister Lionel Jospin took office, France's gross domestic 
product, or the value of goods and services produced by the 
economy, has grown 5.5 percent. Business investment has increased 
13 percent ``after a long period of sluggishness in previous 
years,'' Strauss-Kahn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jospin has also managed to grind away at France's high  
unemployment rate, which was his stated priority. The unemployment 
rate now stands at 11.2 percent. It was more than 12 percent when 
Jospin took up his post.

<HEADLINE> Stake in Program Ownership Critical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Viacom's purchase of CBS knits another  
broadcaster with a well-known studio, a fresh sign of the 
importance for television networks to own a stake in the shows they 
air, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly $36 billion stock deal announced Tuesday is the  
biggest media merger ever and puts the veteran network in the same 
stable as such newer, hipper TV outlets as Viacom's MTV and VH1. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger also puts CBS and Paramount Studios under the same  
ownership and leaves NBC as the only one of the six main networks 
not affiliated with a top studio. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC is owned by Walt Disney, the WB network by Time-Warner and  
the Fox Broadcasting Network by 20th Century Fox parent News Corp., 
while Viacom owns half of UPN. 
</P>
<P>
	While not aligned with a studio, NBC has its own internal  
production arm that owns a piece of half a dozen shows in its fall 
primetime lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	With rising program costs and viewership eroded by cable TV,  
broadcast networks have taken on a share of ownership and 
production of many shows that historically would have been made by 
outside producers. That gives networks a chance to control costs 
and gain long-term profits from syndication rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a reason for this growing alignment between networks  
and the production side,'' said Jill Krutick, an analyst with 
Salomon Smith Barney. ``With costs continuing to escalate, that 
profit participation becomes essential to the economic value of 
programming to the networks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Viacom buyout offers CBS a chance to consolidate production  
and distribution of programming and firm up its in-house 
development of TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal includes an informal agreement for Paramount to give  
CBS the first look at shows the studio is developing, said Leslie 
Moonves, CBS Television president. 
</P>
<P>
	The percentage of programming owned outright or partly  
controlled by the networks actually has dropped to 44 percent for 
the upcoming season, down from 53 percent last year, said Derek 
Baine, an entertainment analyst for Paul Kagan Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, with most first-run series operating at deficits or at  
best a break-even point, networks will continue to insist on 
whatever cut they can get of a show's long-term syndication 
potential, Baine said. 
</P>
<P>
	The exceptions are such marquee producers as David E. Kelley or  
Steven Bochco, whose track records allow them more leeway to 
dictate their terms, Baine said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were to produce a pilot myself and bring it to a network,  
there's no way I'd get it on the air without giving them a 
significant stake in the show,'' Baine said. ``If you're not 
somebody, you're not going to sell a show without giving something 
up.''

	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Two white state troopers were indicted on  
attempted murder charges Tuesday for shooting three black and 
Hispanic men on the New Jersey Turnpike -- one of a series of cases 
that have stirred a nationwide debate over racial profiling by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hogan, 29, and James Kenna, 28, could get up to 40 years in  
prison if convicted on the state charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The troopers are accused of firing 11 shots into a van  
containing four young men on their way to a basketball tryout in 
North Carolina in 1998. Two black men and a Hispanic man were 
wounded, and they have filed civil rights and injury lawsuits 
against the troopers and the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan and Kenna have said that they stopped the van because the  
driver was speeding, and that they opened fire because the van was 
backing up to hit them. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogan's lawyer, Robert L. Galantucci, said Hogan was struck by  
the van on a dark stretch of highway and only had seconds to 
respond. He called the indictment ``politically motivated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A message left for Kenna's lawyer was not returned.  
</P>
<P>
	The shooting triggered protests and internal investigations that  
embroiled the New Jersey State Police in the controversy over 
racial profiling, or the practice of stopping motorists on the 
basis of race. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Gov. Christie Whitman fired the State Police  
superintendent after he said minorities were responsible for most 
of the state's cocaine and marijuana traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, President Clinton issued an executive order calling on  
federal law enforcement agencies to collect race and gender data in 
all stops and arrests. Police in several places, including North 
Carolina, Houston, San Diego and San Jose, Calif., have taken 
similar measures. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Hogan and Kenna were indicted on charges of falsifying  
traffic-stop reports to conceal the fact they were stopping a lot 
of black drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	The following day, the attorney general's office issued a report  
confirming that traffic stop-and-search patterns provided evidence 
of racially discriminatory practices by the State Police. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Hogan and Kenna claimed then that the charges were  
paperwork mistakes and that the troopers were being used as 
scapegoats in the debate over racial profiling. The troopers, who 
are suspended from the force, have pleaded innocent to the 
misconduct charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The union representing New Jersey's state troopers issued a  
statement calling Tuesday's indictment ``outrageous and beyond 
belief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Today a stake was driven through the hearts of many men and  
women troopers who put their lives on the line every day to protect 
the citizens of this state,'' said Ed Lennon, president of the 
State Troopers Fraternal Association of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnnie Cochran, an attorney representing the men who were shot,  
said he was ``ecstatic'' about the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident that this is the first step on the road to  
justice,'' he said. ``I hope that this indictment will be a 
deterrent for future injustices.''

<HEADLINE> Skull May Aid Human Evolution Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As he cleaned the dust and encrusted dirt from  
the bone in a box of fossils, Henry Galiano thought it might have 
come from an elephant or even a mastodon. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out to be an important fossil -- a human skull and one  
that may possibly be an important step in the evolution of man. An 
acquaintance walking by Galiano's shop from the nearby American 
Museum of Natural History helped identify it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This, if anything, has missing-link qualities, something in  
common with us,'' Galiano, 48, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Paleoanthropologists have concluded that the skull is a genuine  
specimen from Indonesia up to 1 million years old, and offers clues 
to a possible connection between Homo erectus, the ancient race 
that spread from Africa into Asia up to 2 million years ago, and 
Homo sapiens, or modern man. 
</P>
<P>
	What sets it apart is the shape of the skull -- a high forehead  
and a brain cavity suggestive of speech or advanced mental 
capabilities, not previously seen in a human skull from that period 
and location. 
</P>
<P>
	The dark gray skull -- an almost complete cranium but missing the  
upper and lower jaws -- was delivered in March by a mysterious man 
who claimed to represent the estate of a collector, Galiano said. 
His shop sells leached bones, mounted insects and animal 
sculptures, among other natural-history curiosities. 
</P>
<P>
	It came to the scientists' attention after Dr. Eric Delson,  
walking past the shop a block from his museum office, was invited 
in by Galiano to ``look at something really cool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, `Wow! This is Homo erectus, that doesn't belong  
here in New York City.' It was not like any I'd ever seen,'' said 
Delson, who also teaches at City University of New York's Lehman 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	The skull, anywhere from 100,000 to 1 million years old,  
probably belonged to a male in his 20s, scientists said. The 
individual's brain was about half the size of that of Homo sapiens 
but within the range for Homo erectus. He had a humanlike high 
forehead. 
</P>
<P>
	Delson leads a team of experts studying the artifact. The skull  
may come from a unique individual, a previously unknown Indonesian 
Homo erectus that looked and acted more modern than others, or a 
Homo erectus ``going somewhere in the direction of modern humans,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The latter theory, while perhaps most intriguing, was also least  
likely, Delson said. Most anthropologists believe Homo sapiens 
evolved directly from ancestors in Africa, and Asian branches of 
Homo erectus are evolutionary dead ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Galiano has presented the skull, which was traced to the Poloyo  
village on the Solo River in Central Java, to an Indonesian 
paleoanthropologist for its return home. Experts estimate it might 
have commanded $500,000 on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	Galiano said he had no hesitation in giving the skull back to  
science for free. ``The proper thing is to give it a home so people 
can study it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Supports Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush spared the life of a  
man who once confessed to 600 murders. He denied a reprieve for a 
repentant, born-again Christian woman. 
</P>
<P>
	While the cases may seem like a contradiction, Bush's decisions  
on one-eyed drifter Henry Lee Lucas and pickax killer Karla Faye 
Tucker illustrate the Republican presidential front-runner's views 
on the death penalty, which he supports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took an oath of office to uphold the laws of our state,  
including the death penalty,'' Bush says. ``My responsibility is to 
ensure our laws are enforced fairly and evenly without preference 
or special treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1982, when Texas resumed carrying out the death penalty,  
185 men and one woman have been executed in the state. Last week's 
execution of Raymond James Jones was the 100th since Bush became 
governor in 1995. A third of the nation's executions are carried 
out in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was spared making a decision in the case of Larry Keith  
Robison, who was scheduled to be executed last month for a rampage 
in which five people were slain near Fort Worth 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Only hours before Robison was to receive a lethal injection, the  
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals sent the case back to the trial 
court for a review of his mental competence. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bush drew criticism.  
</P>
<P>
	``As he seeks the U.S. presidency under the ruse of  
'compassionate conservatism,' Bush must not just talk the talk, he 
must also walk the walk and show compassion,'' civil rights 
advocate Jesse Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Political analysts suggest the issue isn't a major factor in  
presidential races. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't seem to have been a pivotal issue in very many  
state or local races, let alone a national race,'' said Bruce 
Buchanan, political scientist at the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Drake University political scientist Dennis Goldford said a  
presidential candidate's stand on the death penalty is viewed as 
symbolic of whether the candidate is considered tough on crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it helps or hurts a candidate has to do with whether  
it's something a single-issue voter is going to seize on -- will 
they vote solely on that basis? And the bulk of the criminal 
justice is in state hands; the federal government has very few 
death penalty cases,'' Goldford said. 
</P>
<P>
	As each execution approaches, Bush says he asks two questions:  
``Is there any question about the guilt of the individual? Have the 
courts had adequate opportunity to review all the legal issues 
involved?'' 
</P>
<P>
	If there's no doubt about guilt and if the courts have spoken,  
Bush says, an execution must proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, Lucas lived. And Ms. Tucker became the first woman put to  
death in Texas since the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither case was simple.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tucker, 38, was on death row for the grisly killings of two  
people in 1983. In a tape recording played in court, she bragged to 
friends that she got sexual thrills out of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said she'd become a Christian in prison and was  
rehabilitated. Her cause was championed by an international cast of 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles unanimously rejected her  
request for clemency. Without such a recommendation, Bush was left 
only with the power to grant a one-time, 30-day reprieve, which he 
denied. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have concluded judgments about the heart and soul of an  
individual on death row are best left to a higher authority,'' Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas' case was another story.  
</P>
<P>
	One of his 600 murder confessions nationwide -- all later  
recanted -- helped land him on Texas' death row. It came in the 1979 
slaying of an unidentified woman, referred to as ``Orange Socks'' 
for the only clothing on her body when found in a roadside ditch. 
</P>
<P>
	A prosecutor in the case, Ken Anderson, said jurors carefully  
weighed the evidence. He noted that 23 judges had reviewed the case 
and let their verdict stand. 
</P>
<P>
	But news reports and an investigation by a former Texas attorney  
general pointed to work records and a cashed paycheck to indicate 
that Lucas might have been in Florida when the woman was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The parole board voted to recommend clemency. Bush commuted  
Lucas' sentence to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was the first case that he had reviewed as governor  
in which there was some doubt about the individual's guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley Sharp, of the Houston-based victims' rights group Justice  
for All, said Bush's standards for such decisions ``are probably 
the best ones he can use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that both the Tucker and Lucas cases were  
``exceptional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But he considered them just like he does all of the others,''  
Sharp said.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Unrest Boosts Crude  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures prices hit a 23-month high in trading Tuesday  
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, boosted by concerns over labor 
unrest and management problems at the Venezuelan state oil company. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, soybean and grain futures prices were higher,  
and copper futures prices showed strong gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Two unions are threatening to strike Petroleos de Venezuela if  
the government refuses to enter into talks on a collective 
bargaining agreement. The leaders of Fedepetrol, the leading oil 
union, and Fetra-Hidrocarburos say a strike vote is scheduled for 
Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Management and the unions are in a fight over appropriate wage  
adjustments for inflation, according to analyst Tim Evans of 
Pegasus Econometric Group. The current contract expires Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	A short strike will not immediately affect the availability of  
crude because oil production is not a labor intensive industry, 
Evans said. Venezuela produces 2.8 million barrels a day and is a 
major exporter to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaos in the management ranks at Petroleos de Venezuela also was  
a factor in the market. Roberto Mandini resigned last week, 
apparently in a dispute over production policies at the world's 
third largest oil company. Since then, six other high-level 
executives have exited the company, according to Evans. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez appointed Hector Ciavaldini, a  
political ally, the company's new president. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to market strength was concern about the effects of the  
production reduction voted earlier this year by members of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, OPEC producers are pumping 26.2 million barrels of  
crude per day. The peak output was in February 1998, when OPEC was 
producing 28.9 million barrels per day. 
</P>
<P>
	Supply concerns have entered the market because the upcoming  
fourth and first quarters are the times when crude oil demand is at 
its highest, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC Secretary General Rilwanu Lukman on Tuesday said the  
production cuts agreed to in March would stay in effect until next 
March because the organization was happy with current prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Light sweet crude for October delivery was 61 cents higher at  
$22.61 a barrel, the highest level since October 1997 when it 
reached $22.74 a barrel. October heating oil was 1.62 cents higher 
at 59.09 cents a gallon; October unleaded gasoline was 1.74 cents 
higher at 66.50 cents a gallon; October natural gas was 1.16 cents 
higher at $2.667 per 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices were sharply higher in trading on the  
Chicago Board of Trade as the market reacted to the lack of rain in 
the Midwest and Delta regions over the holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Also giving a boost to prices were fears the U.S. Agriculture  
Department later this week will again reduce its rating of the 
crop. The soybean crop's good to excellent rating has dropped for 
seven consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices were higher in league with soybean futures.  
The possibility that the USDA will reduce its estimate of the size 
of the U.S. corn crop also gave a boost to prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The continued wet weather in the northern Plains helped lift  
wheat futures prices. It is feared the rain will further erode the 
quality of the spring wheat and durum crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports that Pakistan may enter the market for a major purchase  
of wheat also gave a boost to futures prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for September delivery was 4 1/4 cents higher at $2.77 a  
bushel; September corn was 2 1/4 cents higher at $2.11 1/2 a bushel; 
September oats were 1 1/2 cents higher at $1.09 a bushel; September 
soybeans were 22 cents higher at $5.15 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of copper futures prices jumped 2.3 percent in trading  
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was boosted by the perception that demand in Asia is  
improving and by a drop in stocks at London Metal Exchange 
warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
	September copper was 1.95 cents higher at 81.40 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Divorced Men Claim Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Six divorced men sued the state Tuesday, claiming  
the court system discriminates against men by issuing restraining 
orders without giving the accused a proper hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal lawsuit claims that state judges routinely subject  
men involved in marital and custody disputes to unconstitutional 
denials of due process and equal protection rights, as well as the 
right to bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't looking for money. We're looking for relief,'' said  
attorney David Grossack, who filed the suit on behalf of six men 
and the Fatherhood Coalition -- a Massachusetts-based fathers 
advocacy group that claims several hundred members. 
</P>
<P>
	But advocates for battered woman say the lawsuit is a disturbing  
attempt by angry men to reassert control they lost after the 
state's anti-abuse laws grew tougher in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they have a very weak claim,'' said Cheryl Garrity,  
president of the Massachusetts chapter of the National Organization 
for Women. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Garrity and Grossack said they believed the lawsuit was the  
first of its kind to be filed against a state's trial court system. 
</P>
<P>
	Subjects of the orders are typically ordered from their homes,  
often prohibited from contacting their children and denied a 
``meaningful'' hearing to defend themselves, the suit alleges. 
Federal and state laws unfairly deprive them of their right to own 
weapons during that time, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrity said laws requiring the subjects of restraining orders  
to relinquish their firearms and leave their homes are crucial to 
protecting victims of battering. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is clearly an attempt to undo the protections that  
battered women have gained over the past 10 years,'' she said. 
``These laws were put in to stop upfront offenses. We can't wait 
until the woman is almost dead to start protecting her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Nollet, 49, said he joined the lawsuit after his ex-wife  
accused him of abuse and took out several restraining orders 
against him in the mid-1990s. Although he was acquitted, a judge 
continued to allow successive restraining orders, and ordered him 
to pay $1,000 per month for spousal and child support, a sum he 
could not afford, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People believe the government brings good and honest  
accusations, but that is not always so,'' Nollet said. ``It's a 
sword hanging over your head. You're one unsupported accusation 
away from being arrested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte Whiting, a spokeswoman for the state courts, and  
Marcia Cohen, a spokeswoman for the state attorney general's 
office, declined to comment on the case.

<HEADLINE> Marlins Eye Downtowns for Ballpark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida Marlins owner John Henry says downtown  
sites in Miami and Fort Lauderdale have emerged as the 
front-runners for a new ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	The sites are among six being considered by the Marlins in Dade  
and Broward counties. The team will settle on two finalists by 
December, then begin discussions with public officials about 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry said he'll choose the site where the most public money is  
available. He hopes to build a 42,000-seat ballpark with a 
retractable roof, using taxpayer money to finance 75 percent of the 
estimated $400 million cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Without taxpayer support, Henry said, he'll build a ``minor  
league stadium'' that would seat only 25,000 and cost about $100 
million, The Miami Herald reported in Tuesday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would not allow us to be competitive,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Henry said he would prefer to build the ballpark in suburban  
Miramar, near Pro Player Stadium, but only if both counties share 
construction costs. Such an arrangement is unlikely, making the 
downtown sites the probable finalists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Miami and Fort Lauderdale think that's where you can make  
more of a difference economically,'' Henry said. ``You would help 
to develop cities, and they would become vibrant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami Mayor Joe Carollo said he's not surprised the Marlins are  
focusing on downtown sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not reinventing the wheel,'' he said. ``They're going  
with the formula that will make baseball work. It's best to go to 
urban core areas. The formula is proven all over the country. It's 
too far for people to go to the suburbs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since their first season in 1993, the Marlins have played at Pro  
Player Stadium, which was built for the Miami Dolphins.

<HEADLINE> Car Rental Agencies Can Be Fickle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: I recently tried to reserve a rental car using my debit card,  
but I was turned down. How can this happen? 

</P>
<P>
	A: Although most rental agencies will accept debit cards as  
payment, some won't accept them to guarantee a reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Debit cards are basically ATM cards with MasterCard or Visa  
logos. When a debit card is used for a purchase, money is 
immediately subtracted from a bank or brokerage account. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit cards, on the other hand, let you charge purchases and  
pay for them later -- with interest, of course, if the balance is 
not paid in full each month. The card issuer guarantees payment 
based on the borrower's credit limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``A debit card just shows that you have a checking account. A  
credit card is different in that it shows you have met credit 
worthiness standards of the issuer,'' said Frances Smith, executive 
director of Consumer Alert, a nonprofit consumer information group 
in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Some car rental companies feel more comfortable with a credit  
card. They want to know the car they lend out will be returned in 
good condition or that they'll be reimbursed if it's not, and a 
credit card provides that extra insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the major rental companies, Alamo will accept debit cards  
for reservation and payment. Budget will only accept debit cards at 
select locations. 
</P>
<P>
	Enterprise and Hertz don't require a credit card to hold a  
reservation unless you request a luxury car, van or sports utility 
vehicle. However, at Hertz you must supply a credit card before you 
drive away with any vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Avis and National require a credit card to secure a rental. Many  
Dollar locations will accept debit cards for reservations and 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Some companies will settle for a hefty cash deposit, usually

<HEADLINE> One Death Row Inmate Kills Another </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Convicted cop killer Robert ``Mudman''  
Simon was killed in prison in a fight with another death row 
inmate, a spokeswoman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon, a motorcycle gang member who was one of the state's most  
notorious prisoners, was pronounced dead after being involved in 
the fight with Ambrose Harris, corrections spokeswoman Mary Ellen 
Bolton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolton had no further details, including precisely when the  
fight happened or how the 48-year-old Simon died. The two were 
housed in the death row section of the New Jersey State Prison in 
Trenton. 
</P>
<P>
	Both inmates remained on death row pending appeals.  
</P>
<P>
	Harris was convicted in February 1996 for the 1992 carjacking,  
rape and murder of Kristin Huggins, 22, of Lower Makefield, Pa. 
Huggins disappeared while driving to paint a mural in downtown 
Trenton on Dec. 17, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon was sentenced to death after he pleaded guilty to killing  
Franklin Township police officer Ippolito Gonzalez. He later 
recanted the guilty plea, saying he had made it to protect a fellow 
member of his Warlocks motorcycle gang. The state Supreme Court, 
however, upheld Simon's death sentence last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon was paroled from a Pennsylvania prison 11 weeks before  
Gonzalez was killed. He had served 12 1/2 years of a 10- to 20-year 
sentence for killing his 19-year-old girlfriend, Beth Smith 
Dusenberg, after she refused to have sex with fellow gang members. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warlocks terrorized people in the '70s with hundreds of  
members, and Simon was particularly feared, former Pennsylvania 
trooper William Davis said in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a sociopath. He showed no remorse,'' Davis said at the  
time. ``He didn't care. He was unpredictable. He had a sick sense 
of humor. He looked like he belonged in the Viking days. You 
plunder and kill, and everything's OK, and the strong survive. He 
was ill-tempered and dangerous. You didn't know what he'd do from 
one day to the next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge who handled the trial in the death of Ms. Dusenberg,  
John Lavelle, said in 1995 that dozens of Warlocks circled the 
courthouse on their motorcycles each day and frightened the jurors, 
possibly leading to the conviction of only second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the only case where I ever wore a bulletproof vest,''  
Lavelle said. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey has not executed anyone since restoring the death  
penalty in 1982. The last time the state used the death penalty was 
in 1963.

<HEADLINE> Energy Dept.: Heat Bills May Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After several years of modest prices, heating  
bills could jump as much as 30 percent this winter because of 
higher oil and natural gas prices and increased demand, the Energy 
Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers have gotten used to unusually low heating costs during  
the last two winters because of depressed oil prices and mild 
weather during both the 1997 and 1998 seasons. This year is 
expected to be different, government energy experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Residential heating oil prices, like all petroleum product  
prices, are expected to increase by a hefty amount this winter,'' 
the Energy Information Administration said in its latest short-term 
energy outlook report released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency projected that residential heating oil on average  
could be 30 percent higher than last winter. Meanwhile, residential 
natural gas prices are expected to rise about 17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	David Costello, an economist at the EIA, said the higher heating  
oil prices stem mostly from the fact that crude oil prices have 
increased $7 to $8 a barrel since last winter and are expected to 
average above $20 a barrel throughout the upcoming winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas prices at the producer level, also have increased  
and likely will be about 43 percent higher at the wellhead this 
winter, although they may ease a bit in the second half of the 
winter as supplies increase, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's bargain energy prices were helped by unusually mild  
weather which kept down demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only are we projecting higher crude oil prices this  
winter, but we are also assuming 'normal' weather, which would be 
colder than the relatively mild weather of last winter,'' said the 
EIA report. This will create more demand for heating oil and 
natural gas and push up prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was one of the cheapest winters ... for heating oil  
that's been around for a while,'' said Costello. ``After last year 
there was a pretty good bet that prices were going to go higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Concern about the Year 2000 computer glitch also may add upward  
pressure on heating prices as customers -- both residential and 
industrial -- may seek to stock up to avoid possible shortages in 
case of a computer problem in the supply system, energy analyst 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last winter, retail residential heating oil prices averaged 80  
cents a gallon. The EIA projects the average for the upcoming 
winter (October through March) at $1.04 per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail residential natural gas prices averaged $6.09 per  
thousand cubic feet last winter and are expected to rise more than 
$1 to $7.10 per thousand cubic feet, according to the EIA report. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil prices were at a depressed $10.86 a barrel as last  
winter began. Since then the prices have increased to an average of 
$19.13 a barrel in August and are projected to reach $21 a barrel 
by the first quarter of next year, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend toward higher natural gas prices has been attributed  
to a combination of factors including higher demand this past 
summer that led to lower stockpiles, and lower than expected 
production especially in the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Supplies of natural gas are expected pick up later this year,  
prompting an easing of wellhead, or producer, prices in the first 
quarter of 2000, the EIA report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG BEAR LAKE, Calif. (AP) -- Work to encircle wildfires in  
Oregon and Washington continued today, while firefighters mopped up 
California's largest blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	In mountains 80 miles northeast of Los Angeles, crews were  
finishing off the so-called Willow fire, which singed 63,486 acres 
after beginning Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze near Big Bear Lake and other popular resorts destroyed  
19 structures and 52 homes before it was contained Saturday night. 
Final control of the blaze, which cost $10 million to suppress, was 
predicted for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Northern California, a cluster of three lightning-sparked  
blazes in the Plumas National Forest were reported 10 percent 
contained. The fires have consumed nearly 24,000 acres since 
beginning Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, crews worked against 30 mph winds to gain control  
Monday of a 2,500-acre blaze that began the day before along the 
Columbia River gorge. Ten homes were evacuated briefly. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire in central Oregon burned nearly 2,600 acres and  
threatened at least one home on the Warm Springs Indian 
Reservation. The blaze, which began Sunday, was about 65 percent 
contained late Monday after spreading quickly through mixed grass 
and timber land. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is definitely human caused,'' said fire management officer  
Gary Cooke. ``We haven't had any lightning here for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, firefighters in Nevada were fighting several blazes  
that have burned 82,010 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Causes of both the Southern California and Washington blazes  
remained under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Blazes in Montana, Utah and Idaho were contained last week.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Gold Mining Being Revived </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUKKARI, Egypt (AP) -- A little skepticism is in order when  
someone tries to sell you the pharaoh's gold mine. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with gold prices down, an Australian-Egyptian team is  
bent on reviving Egyptian gold mining, which had it heyday in the 
time of the pharaohs. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospectors have a treasure map -- a copy of an ancient  
cutaway drawing of mine tunnels used during the reign of King Seti 
I in 1350-1205 B.C. The original, on papyrus, is kept in an Italian 
museum while geologists and engineers for Pharaoh Gold Mines use 
diamond-tipped drills to probe the area the map shows, a stretch of 
southeastern desert near the Red Sea coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharaoh Gold Mines combines the undeniable allure of gold with  
the romance of Egypt's ancient, glorious past, and three years of 
test drilling have impressed some investment planners. What it 
doesn't have yet is much gold -- full-scale mining is at least a 
year away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting Egypt back in the forefront of mining is imminent,''  
says an optimistic Sami El-Raghy, an Egyptian geologist who worked 
in Australian mines for 32 years before returning home to help 
start up Pharaoh Gold Mines, a wholly owned subsidiary of the 
Australian-based Centamin exploration company. 
</P>
<P>
	Kris Knauer of Australia's BNP Equities, an analyst with a  
special interest in emerging companies, has been following the 
project and likes what he's seen. But he says he would have kept an 
even closer eye ``if gold hadn't done what it's done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prices plummeted after Britain's central bank announced in May  
that it planned to sell off much of its gold holdings and acquire 
higher-yielding assets. Just below $300 an ounce before the 
announcement, gold now sells for around $250. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an exploration and mining company, we're concerned,''  
El-Raghy said. ``But we should make money at the current gold 
price, and we think the current gold price won't stay that way very 
long. We think it will go up very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sukkari, the company's mining concession 500 miles southeast of  
Cairo, is littered with ancient mining tools. Gracefully curved 
mortars and crushers of gray stone were used to pound ore into 
powder, which was then washed with water in shallow pans to rinse 
out gold flecks. The gold was used for the glittering ornaments 
archeologists have found in Egyptian tombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharaoh Gold plans to dispense with the costly tunneling of the  
old days in favor of an open-pit approach. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's Australian executive director, Mike Kriewaldt,  
estimates extraction costs at about $120 an ounce, comparable to 
mines in the United States where removal costs are among the 
cheapest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	A drop in a gold prices strangled mining all over the world at  
mid-century. Mines elsewhere recovered in the 1970s, but by then 
socialist policies in Egypt scared off investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt began to open its economy in 1991, but the major mining  
companies continue to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of a 1994 concession agreement with Egypt's  
government, Pharaoh Gold is free to export and sell gold and won't 
be subject to taxes for at least 15 years after the start of 
production. In exchange, the government is to get up to half the 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	To start, the Pharaoh Gold team is concentrating on the 560  
square miles of Sukkari. 
</P>
<P>
	It's possible to drive across the concession for miles without  
running out of fingers to count the scraggly trees. The desolation 
is a welcome sight for Kriewaldt, who is a geologist. There is 
nothing to hide the red in the rocks that he says indicate 
oxidation, a sign they bear gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Kriewaldt looks at Sukkari Hill, a dragon's tail of jagged peaks  
stretched out across the desert. He envisions most of it -- some 150 
million tons -- pulverized in a mill and treated with cyanide to 
leach out the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	An outside expert's assessment of chunks of Sukkari Hill drilled  
out by Pharaoh Gold indicated one section could hold just over 2 
million ounces of gold, company executives say. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has already spent $14.7 million, and expects  
infrastructure costs to reach $400 million in the next few years, 
said Kriewaldt, who spent five decades mining in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't finance out of income because we don't have it yet,''  
he said. ``So we have to turn to investors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That hasn't been easy.  
</P>
<P>
	Red tape has so far kept the company off the Egyptian stock  
market. Aand Australian investors, known for being cautious about 
any project far from home, have stayed away from Pharaoh Gold's 
parent company, Centamin. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Australian Financial Review has called the Egyptian  
concession a ``potentially world class gold project,'' low demand 
has kept Centamin's shares in the 10-cent range, compared to 
hundreds of times that for more established Australian mining 
companies.

<HEADLINE> CBS, Viacom Merge Young With Old </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Imagine the choices at the next Viacom corporate  
party: a line dance with The Nashville Network, or a beach jam with 
MTV? Chatting with Mike Wallace? Or picking up some cute 
``Rugrats'' toys? 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's announced purchase of CBS by Viacom creates a huge new  
media company -- one that offers either a culture clash or a 
seamless fit of complementary parts, depending on your point of 
view. 
</P>
<P>
	No company knows young television viewers better than Viacom,  
the owner of MTV and Nickelodeon. And no company knows their 
parents -- or, more precisely, their grandparents -- better than CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have them from the time they're two years old until the  
time they're 80,'' said Leslie Moonves, CBS Television president. 
</P>
<P>
	The median age of the CBS viewer during the last television  
season was 53, or 10 years older than any other broadcast network. 
CBS has long been the network of greatest appeal among older 
Americans, and has veered between accepting this reality or trying 
to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, CBS executives have accepted it, and tried to subtly  
introduce young characters and shows with appeal to all ages 
without alienating the core audience. It worked to the extent that 
CBS was the No. 1 network in the ratings this past season. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the profitable Nickelodeon cable network has  
established itself as the dominant viewing choice for children, 
with a median age of 9. The typical MTV viewer is 20, and the music 
channel has reinvigorated itself recently with a heavy emphasis on 
teen-aged pop music. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't a lot of overlap'' between MTV and CBS, said Tom  
Freston, chairman and CEO of the MTV Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Where viewers are most likely to see effects of the merger is in  
promotions -- ads for ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' on VH1, for 
instance. The cable networks may also more frequently show repeats 
of musical specials aired on CBS, or vice versa, Freston said. VH1 
recently showed a Shania Twain special that had first run on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	There's little need to change the networks if they're doing well  
on their own, said Gene Jankowski, a retired CBS president who owns 
a regional television network in New England. That's what makes the 
merger a good fit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger experiences of ABC and Disney, as well as Time Warner  
with Ted Turner's television networks show that it isn't always 
easy, said Cynthia Littleton, television editor of Variety. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will inevitably be culture clashes,'' Littleton said.  
</P>
<P>
	Executives indicated that consolidations wouldn't be forced. Mel  
Karmazin, the CBS Corp. chief executive who would be president of 
the new Viacom, noted that competing all-news radio stations in New 
York City were kept operating even after they both came under the 
CBS umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
	``To try to marry CBS and MTV overnight ... would be a disaster,  
internally and externally, on the air and behind the scenes,'' 
Littleton said. ``I'm sure they know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal could also make CBS a corporate partner of UPN, the  
sixth-rated broadcast network that just suffered through a 
disastrous year in the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom owns half of UPN, which would seem an unlikely merger  
partner with CBS. It has recently changed directions to target a 
young, male audience with such fare as the prime-time ``WWF 
Smackdown'' wrestling show. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current FCC regulations, the new company could own no more  
than 33 percent of UPN. Even though UPN loses money and has been 
the constant subject of rumors it will close, executives indicated 
Tuesday they would try to change rules to get more control of the 
network before considering shutting it down or merging assets with 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important that the UPN network survive and be  
financially healthy ... It's serving a market,'' Karmazin said.

<HEADLINE> Warren Beatty May Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At Mann's Chinese Theatre, a Hollywood  
landmark where generations of stars have left their hand prints in 
wet cement, Aziz Khezam stood on Warren Beatty's palm impressions, 
smoking a cigarette and considering the prospect of a Beatty White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, the leading Democratic presidential  
contender, is tainted by the scandals that have plagued President 
Clinton, he said. Beatty, said Khezam, is ``an intellectual who 
could be understood by the masses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll take my time to see what Beatty stands for,'' said the  
pastry shop owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Beatty -- movie actor, producer, director, writer -- and now  
presidential candidate? 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview last month with The Washington Post, Beatty  
acknowledged that he was thinking about a possible candidacy, but 
said it was too early to say more. ``I'm careful,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Interviews with members of his likely base -- disaffected  
Democrats and other left-of-center activists around the nation -- 
suggest deep suspicion about his motives and credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Marchioro, a longtime Democratic activist in Seattle,  
believes her liberal politics are akin to Beatty's, but dismissed 
his potential White House bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take my politics seriously, but I don't take this at all  
seriously, because he's never run for anything,'' she said. Ronald 
Reagan was an actor who made it to the White House, she allowed. 
``But he was a governor first, and not a very good one, I might 
add.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet tourists from across the country visiting the heart of  
Hollywood last week were intrigued, even though most of those 
interviewed had no idea about Beatty's views -- except that he was a 
liberal. All, however, had seen ``Bulworth,'' Beatty's movie 
manifesto on campaign finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know his credentials, but I'd certainly give him  
consideration once I was aware of what he stands for,'' said Pat 
Patterson, a legal assistant from Charleston, S.C. ``Right now, I 
know nothing about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polls suggest that if Beatty ran for president as a Democrat he  
would draw support, but he wouldn't dramatically alter the race. In 
a mid-August ABC poll of 452 Democrats and Democratic-leaning 
voters, Gore was supported by 61 percent, while 24 percent backed 
former Sen. Bill Bradley and 9 percent endorsed Beatty. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 1 percent of likely Democratic voters in a recent  
California Field poll said Beatty was their first choice for their 
party's nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	In an essay published last month in The New York Times, Beatty  
said he wanted to ``help persuade the slightly more liberal one of 
the two accounting firms we call our major parties to return to the 
principles of the Democratic Party of my youth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beatty said he was interested in providing universal health care  
and lifting up the poor, protecting the environment and improving 
public schools. To do that, he wrote, ``We must have complete 
public financing of all federal campaigns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined an interview request with The Associated Press.  
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. Tom Hayden of Los Angeles, an anti-Vietnam War  
activist who disrupted the Democratic Party's 1968 convention and 
remains a dyed-in-the-wool liberal, said a Beatty candidacy would 
``spice up the debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hayden said his friend Beatty knows the difficulties he would  
encounter in running for the White House. ``Trying to go from the 
world of entertainment to the world of politics is not like 
catching a first-class flight from L.A. to Washington,'' Hayden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside this Mecca for the star-struck, there are signs of  
resentment against actors who seek high political office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think liberal Democrats would tend toward liberal Democratic  
candidates with experience, not just good-looking actors,'' said 
Caroline Gelb, an Internet producer and New York liberal. 
</P>
<P>
	In liberal Madison, Wis., Democratic state Rep. Spencer Black  
called the possibility of a Beatty candidacy ``humorous.'' 
``Essentially, the president is leader of the free world, if not 
all of it, and I don't know that Beatty has any credentials 
whatsoever to undertake this kind of job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While everyone seems to have an opinion, Beatty is leaving  
people guessing. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the disparity of our prosperity, someone must rise to honor  
the historic mission of the Democratic Party,'' he wrote in the 
Times. ``Why not Bradley? Why not Gore? Why not now? 
</P>
<P>
	``Stay tuned. We'll be back after this message.''  
</P>
<P>
	Beatty is likely to shed more light on his intentions at a Sept.  
29 address to the Southern California branch of the liberal 
Americans for Democratic Action, which plans to honor Beatty with 
its Eleanor Roosevelt Award.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Teachers To Vote on Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- With a tentative contract hammered out between  
teachers and leaders of the city's struggling school system, 
parents were waiting to see if their children would be called to 
classrooms this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit teachers were to vote today on whether to temporarily  
extend their old contract, which would allow them and the 
district's 180,000 students to return to school as soon as 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers went on strike Aug. 30, one day before classes were to  
begin, after rejecting their union's proposal for a 10-day contract 
extension while talks over the new contract continued. 
</P>
<P>
	The school board and negotiators for the 11,500-member teachers  
union agreed on a tentative contract Monday. A ratification vote on 
the contract will be conducted by mail over the next week to 10 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools in Detroit, the nation's 10th-largest city, have been  
beset by mismanagement and chronically low test scores, attendance 
and graduation rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Gov. John Engler called for changes in the district's  
education system, citing poor test scores, high dropout rates and 
neglected buildings. The Legislature voted to remove the elected 
school board, replacing it with a board appointed by Mayor Dennis 
Archer. 
</P>
<P>
	The district's dropout rate for high school students was 26.4  
percent in 1997 and the four-year graduation rate was 29.7 percent 
-- much worse than any other large district in the state. As many as 
108,000 children in the district live in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	A Detroit job training program, Focus:HOPE, has said that two  
out of three graduates of Detroit high schools who took an entrance 
exam for one program could not read or do math at an eighth-grade 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	The new school board proposed reforms including a longer school  
day, merit pay, and reduced class sizes. Detroit teachers, unhappy 
with some of the proposals, voted to strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The new three-year contract dropped the district's merit pay  
plan, which proposed that teachers receive raises only in those 
schools whose test scores improved. The union argued such a plan 
would be unfair to top teachers in lower-performing schools. 
</P>
<P>
	David Adamany, who was hired as head of the district to help  
advance the reforms, insisted that merit pay still could be imposed 
without union approval. He said the Michigan Employment Relations 
Commission would be asked to decide the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The district also dropped its proposal to lengthen the school  
day from 6 hours to 8 1/2 hours. Teachers had said making classes 
smaller was a more important reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The tentative agreement calls for smaller classes -- the goal is  
a maximum of 17 -- in kindergarten to third grade. It also would 
impose more restrictions on unexcused absences of teachers, a board 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract would give all teachers a 2 percent pay raise each  
year for the next three years. Teachers with more seniority and 
education would receive higher raises pegged to keep up with wages 
in suburban districts. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Whitty, a labor professor at the University of Detroit  
Mercy, said Tuesday the union and administration appeared to be 
``banking on the pay raise'' to ensure ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's close enough for it to go either way,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The teachers walked out in defiance of a 1994 Michigan law that  
bars teacher strikes and fines them one day's pay for each day they 
strike. Legislative leaders have said they may move to seek 
sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Killer of Friend Waives Arraignment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- A man charged with fatally stabbing his  
friend during a hiking trip in southeastern New Mexico waived his 
arraignment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Raffi Kodikian, 25, had been scheduled to appear in state  
district court on an open count of murder in the death of David 
Coughlin, 26, but did not appear. Court officials said no other 
hearing or trial dates were set. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodikian, of Massachusetts, is free on a $50,000 bond and living  
with his parents in a suburban Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	He has told investigators Coughlin pleaded with him to end his  
pain after the two men got lost and ran out of water last month 
while camping in Carlsbad Caverns National Park. Kodikian said they 
believed they would die. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they don't believe Kodikian's story, but have  
not offered another motive for Coughlin's slaying. Sheriff M.A. 
``Chunky'' Click and Gary McCandless, chief of detectives, were 
unavailable for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Mitchell, Kodikian's lawyer, has said Kodikian and Coughlin  
agreed to help one another die. He has described the killing as an 
act of mercy. Mitchell did not return phone calls seeking comment 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Panthers Sign Eric Metcalf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The Carolina Panthers on Tuesday released  
punt returner Winslow Oliver after three years with the club and 
signed veteran triple-threat Eric Metcalf in an attempt to address 
the team's lack of depth at wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Metcalf, who is the NFL record-holder for regular-season  
touchdown returns with 11, also has 2,635 career rushing yards and 
5,420 receiving yards. Metcalf, who has 43 non-return touchdowns 
for his career, was released Sunday by Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric is obviously an outstanding special teams player and can  
also help add depth at wide receiver,'' Carolina coach George 
Seifert said. ``We felt that with four receivers, this was 
something we needed to do to balance our roster out, and we had 
depth at the running back position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver, a third-round draft choice by the Panthers in 1996,  
holds several team punt-return records, including longest return 
(84 yards) and most yardage for a career (1,173) and in a season 
(598 in 1996). He averaged 10.7 yards on 110 punt returns in three 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver returned punts and kickoffs in exhibition games and also  
saw some time in the backfield, scoring the game-winner on a 
21-yard run in Carolina's 20-13 victory over Pittsburgh. It 
appeared his spot was secure after returner-wide receiver Iheanyi 
Uwaezuoke was released. 
</P>
<P>
	Metcalf, a first-round draft choice out of Texas in 1989, has  
played with Cleveland, Atlanta, San Diego and Arizona, amassing 
16,280 career total yards, seventh on the career list. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers also placed five players on the practice squad,  
including Texas rookie wide receiver Sirr Parker, who was cut from 
the San Diego Chargers last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Also cut Sunday were tackle Dan Best, a rookie from Western  
Carolina; wide receiver Dialleo Burks; defensive tackle Harry 
Deligianis and quarterback Matt Lytle, a rookie from Pitt.

	22 Die in Earthquake in Greece  
</P>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- The strongest earthquake to hit Athens in  
nearly a century toppled buildings this afternoon, sending hundreds 
of thousands of terrified people into debris-littered streets. At 
least 22 people died and nearly 100 were reported missing. Dozens 
of people were injured by falling glass, concrete and marble slabs 
shaken loose by the 10-second quake, which had a preliminary 
magnitude of 5.9. State television reported at least 22 people 
dead, including several children. Most of the victims were crushed 
and a few suffered fatal heart attacks.

	Women, Men Differ on Gun Control  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fight over gun control reflects a battle  
of the sexes as American women say stricter weapon laws would curb 
violence while men want better enforcement of existing laws, an 
Associated Press poll finds. The telephone survey by ICR of Media, 
Pa., found 56 percent of American adults favored stricter gun laws 
and 39 percent opposed. Sixty-six percent of women favored the 
tougher laws, compared with 45 percent of men. Thirty percent of 
women and 49 percent of men were opposed. The poll notes some 
erosion of overall support for tougher gun laws since the days 
immediately following the deadly school shootings last April in 
Colorado.

this one left Magnus Norman with an ailing back and Gustavo Kuerten 
in the quarterfinals. Norman had to quit during the fourth round 
against the fifth-seeded Kuerten, becoming the seventh player to 
retire from a men's singles match in nine days. Norman raced to the 
net for a drop shot and flicked the ball crosscourt for the winner, 
breaking Kuerten. After the changeover, the Swede was to serve for 
the set. But when he went to get up from his chair and return to 
the court, Norman grabbed his back on the right side. He called for 
a trainer, who rubbed liniment on the right side of his back.

<HEADLINE> Mir's Computer To Be Switched Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's Mission Control prepared Tuesday to  
switch off the Mir space station's central computer and other 
systems to save energy during a planned six months of unmanned 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The ground controllers waited for a week after the station's  
last permanent crew returned to Earth to let Mir's interiors dry 
before switching the temperature control to the minimum on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Wednesday, they will switch off the Mir's computer, its  
orientation system and other equipment, letting the station rotate 
freely in orbit, said Valery Lyndin, a Mission Control spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Mission Control will help adjust the station's position in orbit  
if it sees that the station's energy supply is dropping below the 
level needed. The temperature control system will be running on low 
to protect vital systems from freezing, Lyndin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Switching off the computer and other systems will allow energy  
and the computer's resources to be conserved for the docking of a 
final crew in February or March. The cleanup crew is expected to 
spend about a month aboard the station, gradually lowering its 
orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after the cosmonauts leave, ground controllers will  
lower the 140-ton station to burn it up in the atmosphere, guiding 
its remnants into the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	The cash-strapped Russian government has said it can no longer  
pay for the 13-year-old Mir's operation. However, instead of 
bringing the station down right after the recent crew's departure, 
it decided to leave it in orbit in hopes of finding private funds 
to keep it aloft. 
</P>
<P>
	All previous such fund-raising attempts have failed, and  
</P>
<P>
	Few believe that money will be found.

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Goaltender Hextall Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VOORHEES, N.J. (AP) -- For Ron Hextall, all the signs pointed to  
the end of his hockey career. Finally, he made it official. 
</P>
<P>
	The goalie largely responsible for leading the Philadelphia  
Flyers to the 1987 Stanley Cup finals retired Monday and will 
become a scout for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a million things in a bowl that I kind of grinded  
together, and it all came out pointing to the fact that it was time 
to move on,'' Hextall said at the Flyers' training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought about it all summer. In the end, I felt the right  
thing to do was call it a career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hextall, 35, said he was offered a deal to play with Calgary,  
but chose the scouting job with the Flyers. He cited ongoing hip 
problems and family concerns for not wanting to leave Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just told them upstairs that I wanted to play this year. But  
you know with my body aging and all the (other) factors, most 
things pointed to the fact that it was time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hextall was released by the Flyers this summer after playing  
backup all season. He was not claimed in the expansion draft, and 
his retirement was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to be a guy who kind of hung on,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bob Clarke credited Hextall with strong passing  
skills that paved the way for such outstanding goalies as 
Colorado's Patrick Roy and New Jersey's Martin Brodeur. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron probably changed the position of goaltending in the  
National Hockey League. He was the first one that came in and 
handled the puck better than most of our defensemen,'' Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Team chairman Ed Snider recalled that Hextall was the first NHL  
goalie to score a goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``A tremendous feat,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The team waived Hextall on July 1, and since no team claimed  
him, the Flyers must buy out the final year of his contract. He 
will be paid $475,000 this year and next year as part of the 
negotiated buyout, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 10-7-4 with a 2.53 goals-against average last season and  
had a 296-214-69 career record. The Atlanta Thrashers, wanting 
younger and less expensive players, did not select him in the 
expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	A 13-year veteran, Hextall backed up John Vanbiesbrouck last  
year, overtaking Bernie Parent for the team lead with 240 
victories. Hextall also is No. 1 on the Flyers' career lists for 
games, playoff games and playoff victories. He was the starting 
goalie for the Wales Conference in the 1988 All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	Hextall was drafted by the Flyers in 1982.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the highlights of his career was the 1987 Stanley Cup  
finals against the Wayne Gretzky-led Edmonton Oilers. Even though 
the Flyers lost the series in seven games, the 23-year-old Hextall 
won the Conn Smythe trophy as the playoff MVP. He also captured the 
league's Vezina Trophy that season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hextall was traded to Quebec in the seven-player Eric Lindros  
deal in June 1992. He was later traded to the New York Islanders, 
playing one season before being dealt back to the Flyers in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers made it back to the Stanley Cup finals against the  
Detroit Red Wings in 1997, but Hextall was benched after allowing 
two soft goals in the opening game. 
</P>
<P>
	His last start for the Flyers was April 5 against the New York  
Rangers. He allowed five goals on 27 shots.

<HEADLINE> Bush Supports Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush spared the life of a  
man who once confessed to 600 murders. He denied a reprieve for a 
repentant, born-again Christian woman. 
</P>
<P>
	While the cases may seem like a contradiction, Bush's decisions  
on one-eyed drifter Henry Lee Lucas and pickax killer Karla Faye 
Tucker illustrate the Republican presidential front-runner's views 
on the death penalty, which he supports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took an oath of office to uphold the laws of our state,  
including the death penalty,'' Bush says. ``My responsibility is to 
ensure our laws are enforced fairly and evenly without preference 
or special treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1982, when Texas resumed carrying out the death penalty,  
185 men and one woman have been executed in the state. Last week's 
execution of Raymond James Jones was the 100th since Bush became 
governor in 1995. A third of the nation's executions are carried 
out in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was spared making a decision in the case of Larry Keith  
Robison, who was scheduled to be executed last month for a rampage 
in which five people were slain near Fort Worth 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Only hours before Robison was to receive a lethal injection, the  
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals sent the case back to the trial 
court for a review of his mental competence. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bush drew criticism.  
</P>
<P>
	``As he seeks the U.S. presidency under the ruse of  
'compassionate conservatism,' Bush must not just talk the talk, he 
must also walk the walk and show compassion,'' civil rights 
advocate Jesse Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Political analysts suggest the issue isn't a major factor in  
presidential races. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't seem to have been a pivotal issue in very many  
state or local races, let alone a national race,'' said Bruce 
Buchanan, political scientist at the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Drake University political scientist Dennis Goldford said a  
presidential candidate's stand on the death penalty is viewed as 
symbolic of whether the candidate is considered tough on crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it helps or hurts a candidate has to do with whether  
it's something a single-issue voter is going to seize on -- will 
they vote solely on that basis? And the bulk of the criminal 
justice is in state hands; the federal government has very few 
death penalty cases,'' Goldford said. 
</P>
<P>
	As each execution approaches, Bush says he asks two questions:  
``Is there any question about the guilt of the individual? Have the 
courts had adequate opportunity to review all the legal issues 
involved?'' 
</P>
<P>
	If there's no doubt about guilt and if the courts have spoken,  
Bush says, an execution must proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, Lucas lived. And Ms. Tucker became the first woman put to  
death in Texas since the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither case was simple.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tucker, 38, was on death row for the grisly killings of two  
people in 1983. In a tape recording played in court, she bragged to 
friends that she got sexual thrills out of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said she'd become a Christian in prison and was  
rehabilitated. Her cause was championed by an international cast of 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles unanimously rejected her  
request for clemency. Without such a recommendation, Bush was left 
only with the power to grant a one-time, 30-day reprieve, which he 
denied. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have concluded judgments about the heart and soul of an  
individual on death row are best left to a higher authority,'' Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas' case was another story.  
</P>
<P>
	One of his 600 murder confessions nationwide -- all later  
recanted -- helped land him on Texas' death row. It came in the 1979 
slaying of an unidentified woman, referred to as ``Orange Socks'' 
for the only clothing on her body when found in a roadside ditch. 
</P>
<P>
	A prosecutor in the case, Ken Anderson, said jurors carefully  
weighed the evidence. He noted that 23 judges had reviewed the case 
and let their verdict stand. 
</P>
<P>
	But news reports and an investigation by a former Texas attorney  
general pointed to work records and a cashed paycheck to indicate 
that Lucas might have been in Florida when the woman was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The parole board voted to recommend clemency. Bush commuted  
Lucas' sentence to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was the first case that he had reviewed as governor  
in which there was some doubt about the individual's guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley Sharp, of the Houston-based victims' rights group Justice  
for All, said Bush's standards for such decisions ``are probably 
the best ones he can use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that both the Tucker and Lucas cases were  
``exceptional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But he considered them just like he does all of the others,''  
Sharp said.

<HEADLINE> Lucent Introduces New DSL Product </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MURRAY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- Telecommunications giant Lucent  
Technologies Inc. is making its first push into the high-speed 
phone line market with a product that offers high-quality voice 
calls and fast data transmission on the same phone line. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent's digital subscriber line, or DSL, product allows phone  
companies to offer customers as many as 16 voice lines, plus 
high-speed data via a single copper phone line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lucent's Stinger solution for the first time offers DSL  
without the tradeoffs,'' said Curt Sanford, president of the 
InterNetworking Systems unit of Lucent Technologies. ``One copper 
wire will now deliver the highest quality voice plus high-speed 
Internet and data services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent says Stinger is better than other DSL products because it  
prioritizes voice data, solving the problem of voice dropouts and 
disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stinger system will be sold to phone companies and Internet  
service providers, allowing them to serve different segments of the 
market -- large corporations, small businesses and consumers -- using 
one system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Murray Hill, N.J.-based Lucent is a leading maker of  
telecommunications equipment.

<HEADLINE> Study Links TV, Sleepy Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Children who watch a lot of television --  
especially at bedtime or on a TV set in their bedroom -- are more 
likely to resist going to bed, have trouble sleeping or wake up 
more, a study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of parents don't make the connection,'' said Dr. Judith  
Owens, who led the study. ``They think if TV is sedating for 
adults, it is for kids, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she said, TV-watching seems to be a stimulant to some  
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens, a professor of pediatrics at Brown University and  
director of the pediatric sleep disorders clinic at Hasbro 
Children's Hospital in Providence, R.I., said parents need to ease 
their children into bedtime, instead of relying on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't advocate completely turning it off in the evening, but  
there needs to be a clear demarcation,'' she said. ``I would like 
to see kids being read to, or reading to parents or themselves. TV 
viewing has substituted for a lot of that. Kids need more of a 
calm-down, wind-down time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study adds to a growing amount of research on television's  
harmful effects on children. Previous studies have shown that heavy 
TV viewing may be linked to depression, anxiety and violent 
behavior, as well as obesity. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that  
children under 2 not watch television at all, saying it interferes 
with the one-on-one interaction with others needed for healthy 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens and Dr. Rolanda Maxim, a pediatrician at the Knights of  
Columbus Developmental Center in St. Louis, examined the sleep and 
TV habits of 495 youngsters in kindergarten through fourth grade. 
The research included the time spent watching videos, but not using 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The study appears in the Internet version of Pediatrics, a  
journal published by the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 76 percent of parents reported TV viewing was part of  
their child's usual bedtime routine, and 15.6 percent of children 
fell asleep in front of the TV at least two nights a week. 
Researchers also found that 26 percent of the children studied had 
a television in their bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 percent of parents said their children had at least one  
sleep problem, such as struggles over going to bed or difficulty 
falling asleep. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the parents said they believed that TV had nothing to do  
with their children's sleep problems. But the researchers said the 
evidence strongly suggests otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Stephen Sheldon, an expert on children's sleep disorders who  
was not involved in the study, said he has seen similar problems 
among young patients. He said one problem is that some children 
become dependent on television to fall asleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trying to fall asleep without it can be like trying to fall  
asleep without a pillow,'' said Sheldon, director of the Sleep 
Medicine Center at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago and a 
professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University.

<HEADLINE> School Security Raises Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As schools reopen with greatly increased  
security, civil libertarians say concern for students' safety is 
overwhelming students' rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable, on an unprecedented scale,'' said Nadine  
Strossen, national president of the American Civil Liberties Union. 
``We're seeing the equivalent of Fortress America, and students' 
privacy rights and freedom of speech are under attack from 
within.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bloody tragedies, especially the April incident in which two  
students at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., gunned down 
a dozen classmates and a teacher before killing themselves, left an 
indelible mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officers, metal detectors, student ID cards and  
surveillance cameras are new to schools across the nation. So are 
routine backpack searches, increased use of drug tests, stricter 
dress codes and less tolerance for schoolyard taunts or threats. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU, aggressively challenging policies in many public  
school districts, may be fighting an uphill battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the wake of increasing violence, courts seem to have become  
more deferential to school districts' genuine concern for student 
safety and security,'' said Cynthia Prettyman, general counsel for 
Palm Beach County, Fla., schools. ``Students still have rights and 
I'm sure the ACLU will stay on top of this, but any legal challenge 
will face a high hurdle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some students have won.  
</P>
<P>
	In Allen, Texas, senior Jennifer Boccia is back in school after  
having last spring's suspension expunged from her record. 
</P>
<P>
	She and nine other students wore black armbands to class to  
mourn the Columbine victims and to protest new rules imposed in 
their school as a result. Jennifer, an honors student, was 
suspended after defying an order to remove the armband. 
</P>
<P>
	``The school district just would not acknowledge that the First  
Amendment applies to students,'' said Diana Philip, an ACLU 
regional director in Dallas. ``We had to take them to court before 
an agreement could be reached.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Vasvari, legal director of the Ohio ACLU, cited two  
``invasions of student rights'' that were challenged successfully. 
In one, a Stow boy was suspended from classes for a personal Web 
site titled ``Stow High School Sucks.'' In another, a Youngstown 
area high school sought to administer drug tests for all students 
participating in extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The post-Columbine reaction is regrettable,'' Vasvari said.  
``When rights are whittled away, they tend not to return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Mississippi, the Harrison County School Board rescinded a  
policy that barred a Jewish boy from wearing his Star of David 
pendant after the ACLU sued on his behalf. School officials had 
considered it a gang symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Underwood, general counsel of the National School Boards  
Association, says school districts are well-served by programs 
emphasizing ``culture and climate -- how people treat each other; 
whether a respectful learning environment exists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We routinely get called for advice after a problem arises,  
after some policy is challenged,'' she said. ``We would like to 
field such calls earlier on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here, in question and answer form, is a look at what rights  
students have: 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Students are just kids. Why do they have any rights?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Children, like adults, have legal rights. The Supreme Court,  
dating back to a landmark 1969 decision, has said students who 
attend public schools do not surrender all constitutional rights at 
the schoolhouse door. For example, the court has said school 
officials cannot squelch students' freedom of speech based on ``a 
mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always 
accompany an unpopular viewpoint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What about students' privacy rights?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which protects against  
unreasonable searches and seizures, applies in public schools, but 
school officials get more leeway than police. And school searches 
of lockers and backpacks, even the use of metal detectors, are much 
easier to justify when the target is illegal drugs or weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, courts generally require ``individualized suspicion'' in  
certain circumstances, barring school officials from searching all 
students in a room just because one of them may have stolen some 
money or smuggled in a pack of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What about drug tests?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The law is still evolving on this issue. The Supreme Court  
ruled in 1995 that student athletes could be subjected to random 
drug tests because athletic programs are voluntary and student 
athletes are role models. Since then, some lower courts have 
allowed drug testing of students engaged in other extracurricular 
activities. But some courts have struck down drug-testing policies. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, two Pottawatomie County high school students are  
challenging a policy requiring drug tests for students involved in 
extracurricular activities, such as choir or marching band, for 
which they receive academic credit. No court anywhere has ruled 
that all students can be subjected to random drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Is there somewhere students and teachers nationwide can find  
out the answers to specific questions? 
</P>
<P>
	A: No, the law on students' rights can vary from state to state,  
depending on state laws and court rulings.

<HEADLINE>  El Guerrouj Breaks 2,000 Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN, Germany (AP) -- Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj broke his  
third world record of the season Tuesday night, shattering the 
2,000-meter mark by more than three seconds at the ISTAF meet. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj, running alone over the final two laps, was timed in  
4 minutes, 44.79 seconds before a cheering crowd of about 30,000 at 
Olympic Stadium. The previous record of 4:47.88 was set by 
Noureddine Morceli of Algeria at Paris in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy because I promised the people in Berlin a world  
record,'' El Guerrouj said. ``The most important thing is for me to 
break all the world records between the 1,500 and the 5,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, El Guerrouj set world records in the mile and  
1,500 meters. His 2,000 record was the highlight of a meet in which 
Wilson Kipketer and Gabriela Szabo split $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer, the Kenyan-born Dane, and Szabo, the diminutive  
Romanian, each won at all seven Golden League meets this year to 
qualify for the big prize. 
</P>
<P>
	With the crowd cheering him loudly, Kipketer took control of the  
men's 800 meters midway through the race, then coasted to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The first person to greet and hug him at the finish line was  
Szabo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was definitely a fight with nerves,'' Kipketer said. ``I  
didn't sleep well at all, but after the starting gun went off 
everything was OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer's time of 1:44.04 was nearly three seconds off his  
world record of 1:41.11, one of three world marks he set before 
malaria wiped out most of his 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Szabo, also supported strongly by the crowd, broke away from a  
pack of four around the final curve and won the women's 5,000 in a 
year's best of 14:40.61. 
</P>
<P>
	Szabo, who had said she wanted to break her European record of  
14:31.28 set last year at ISTAF, had the crowd cheering and 
whistling as she pulled away from Morocco's Zahra Quaziz to win 
easily on a warm, windless night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great race,'' said Szabo, who said she was tired  
after winning at the World Championships two weeks ago at Seville, 
Spain. ``I felt how much the fantastic audience pulled me to the 
win. That was the secret. It was purely psychological,'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meet included 18 gold medalists from the worlds.  
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Greene capitalized on the absence of injured Frankie  
Fredericks of Namibia, the Olympic silver medalist, and won the 200 
in 20.22, duplicating his triumph at Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time wasn't important,'' said Greene, the 100-meter world  
record-holder, ``I'm just preparing to win the 100 and 200 next 
year at the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco's Ali Ezzine, the bronze medalist at the worlds,  
outkicked Bernard Barmasai of Kenya after the final hurdle to win 
the 3,000 steeplechase. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the first loss for Barmasai in the Golden League  
series. Barmasai was disqualified from the jackpot after allegedly 
colluding to win a race at Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Bruny Surin took advantage of Greene's absence in the  
100, and won in 10.07, far off his season's best of 9.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Wade beat American teammate Mark Crear in the 110 hurdles,  
leading all the way and winning by .03 seconds in 13.27.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Governor Won't Run for Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman, delivering a  
blow to Republican prospects in 2000, said today that she would not 
seek election to the Senate despite months of preparation for a 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced that a statewide campaign would be a  
distraction from finishing the work New Jersey voters have asked me 
to complete,'' she said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman's decision leaves a vacuum in the GOP field, providing  
an unexpected break for Democrats who had feared the loss of the 
seat after veteran Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg decided not to 
seek re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Whitman  
was disturbed about the prospect of having to raise millions of 
dollars to compete against millionaire businessman Jon Corzine, a 
Democrat who is likely to seek the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two other Democrats -- former Gov. Jim Florio and former  
state party chairman Tom Byrne -- plan to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman, barred by law from seeking a third term as governor,  
started raising money for the campaign in April but never 
officially entered the race. She raised more than $1.25 million in 
the half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey seat is important to both parties, as Republican  
try to maintain their Senate majority in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate, meaning that  
Democrats need to pick up six seats in the 2000 elections to gain 
power. Unexpected retirements in Nevada, New York and New Jersey 
have complicated their task, although there are 19 Republican-held 
seats on the ballot and only 14 Democratic seats. In addition, many 
of the GOP seats are held by freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are still hoping to entice strong challengers into the  
race against veteran GOP incumbents in Vermont and Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Tom Carper is giving strong consideration to a challenge to  
Delaware Sen. William Roth, and an announcement of his plans may be 
forthcoming in a few weeks. In Vermont, Rep. Bernie Sanders, the 
House's only independent, is pondering whether to seek re-election 
or to challenge Sen. James Jeffords. He would have Democratic 
backing if he did. 
</P>
<P>
	Until today, New Jersey's first female governor seemed certain  
to attempt to become the state's first female senator. Whitman, 52, 
would have had to cut short by one year her second term as 
governor, which runs through January 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman ran for the Senate in 1990, her first statewide race.  
She nearly beat heavily financed Democratic incumbent Bill Bradley 
in a campaign that targeted Democratic Gov. Jim Florio's tax 
increases. Three years later, Whitman used that argument to defeat 
Florio. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman gained national prominence for her tax cuts, and fended  
off persistent speculation that she was on vice presidential short 
lists during her first term. She then had to survive a surprisingly 
close race for re-election in 1997, when Democrat Jim McGreevey 
targeted the state's high auto insurance rates and property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	She is a social moderate who supports abortion rights, something  
that may hurt her on the national stage but is considered an asset 
in a Senate run in New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Mirage Resorts Executive Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Dan Lee has resigned as chief financial officer  
of Mirage Resorts Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee is the former Wall Street wunderkind who parlayed an  
incisive mind for numbers and an acid-tongued demeanor into one of 
the most coveted jobs in the gambling industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee met Friday with Mirage Resorts Chairman Steve Wynn, who  
accepted the resignation and tapped Bobby Baldwin, president of 
Mirage's Bellagio hotel-casino, to take over Lee's financial duties 
temporarily, a Mirage spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, a former gaming analyst with the former First Boston  
securities firm, caught Wynn's eye nearly a decade ago. The Mirage 
chairman, himself a flamboyant figure, appreciated Lee's 
willingness to question conventional wisdom and offered an 
employment contract that provided stock options as well as a 
six-figure salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Las Vegas-based Mirage had 1998 profits of $81.7 million on  
sales of $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Mirage hit a new 52-week low Tuesday, closing down  
68 3/4, at $12.06 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> British Working Families Get Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Striving to make work more attractive than  
welfare, Prime Minister Tony Blair launched a subsidies program 
Tuesday aimed at guaranteeing Britain's working families a minimum 
income of $320 a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Working Families Tax Credit will replace Britain's  
Family Credit, which also covers only working residents with 
children, when it goes into effect Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The government estimates 1.5 million working families will be  
eligible for the credit, which will be added directly to wage 
earners' paychecks and will constitute an average $38.40 more a 
week than the old subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
	Income tax will not be deducted until earnings reach $375 a  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The average income of individuals in Britain is about $640 per  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The subsidy will cost the government $8 billion a year, $2.9  
billion more than the family credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Party ministers have defended the decision to dispense the  
subsidy through workers' paychecks, saying it will emphasize the 
link to work and tempt more people back into the job market. 
</P>
<P>
	But the opposition Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats  
attacked the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conservatives' social security secretary, David Willetts,  
said it will increase red tape for businesses to the point where 
some will be unwilling to take people on ``for fear they might be 
eligible for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Liberal Democrats' social security spokesman, Steve Webb, said  
the credit will do nothing for parents who stay at home to look 
after their children.

<HEADLINE> Judge Denies Ford Internet Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A federal judge has denied Ford Motor Co's  
request to stop a Mustang enthusiast from putting some of the 
company's internal documents on the Internet, saying such an order 
would violate the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds ruled on Tuesday that Robert  
Lane, a 32-year-old nursing student, may not destroy any Ford 
documents. She also told Lane not to violate Ford copyrights and 
banned him from soliciting information from company employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really expected to win,'' Lane said. ``I was a little  
saddened that it had to be against the Ford Motor Co. I really 
didn't want that to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford claimed that when Lane posted the documents on his Internet  
site, he violated laws against disclosing trade secrets. But 
Edmunds said blocking Lane from putting the documents on the 
Internet would be an illegal restraint of speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was ``a clash between our commitment to the freedom of  
speech and the press, and our dedication to the protection of 
commercial innovation and intellectual property,'' Edmunds said in 
her ruling. ``In this case, the battle is won by the First 
Amendment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lane and his site, www.BlueOvalNews.com, had been under a  
temporary restraining order issued Aug. 25 ordering him to remove 
the documents and any material copyrighted by Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford spokesman Terry Bresnihan said the company has not decided  
whether to pursue further legal action against Lane. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane testified he has 112 Ford documents received from anonymous  
sources. Ford claimed Lane ``inflicted irreparable harm'' by 
posting blueprints for new engines, schedules for new vehicles and 
product planning memos. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lane has used his Web site ... and the celebrity status it has  
gained in a guerrilla campaign of threats, innuendoes, dissembling 
and illegal actions,'' Ford said in a court filing.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hilton Hotels Corp. is buying Promus Hotel  
Corp. for $3.1 billion in a cash-and-stock deal that expands 
Hilton's market reach to include nearly 1,700 establishments, 
ranging from New York's luxurious Waldorf-Astoria to the mid-priced 
Hampton Inn chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition announced Tuesday also gives Hilton a large  
stake in the all-suites segment of the lodging market, geared 
toward business travelers who stay for extended periods. Promus 
brands include the Embassy Suites Guest Suites, Homewood Suites, 
Red Lion, Doubletree and Club Hotel by Doubletree chains. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies have been talking about a combination since July,  
said Stephen F. Bollenbach, president and chief executive of 
Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more we worked on it, the clearer it became the economics  
of consolidation were so compelling and so good for our 
shareholders and their shareholders that it was a transaction we 
had to pursue,'' Bollenbach said in a conference call with 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to provide $55 million in cost savings the  
first year of operation for the combined companies, and $90 million 
in following years. Promus had $1.1 billion in revenues in 1998, 
with Hilton taking in $1.8 billion for the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton will pay $38.50 per share for 55 percent of Promus  
shares. The rest of Promus' stock will be exchanged for Hilton 
common stock equivalent to $38.50 per share. Hilton will also 
assume $900 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Promus shares rose $3.43 3/4 to $34.81 1/4 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange. Hilton shares dropped 62 1/2 cents to $11.18 3/4 on news 
that the cost of the acquisition would hurt Hilton's earnings in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal puts Hilton in a better position to compete with rivals  
including Marriott International Inc. and Starwood Hotels and 
Resorts, analysts said. However, it will take several years for 
Hilton shareholders to realize any gain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does add scale, which I think is required. I think there  
are some intermediate-term question marks about the transaction. 
... In my view, they overpaid,'' said Harry Curtis, an analyst with 
BancBoston Robert Stevens. ``This is manna from heaven for Promus 
shareholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BancBoston had estimated before the announcement that the price  
would be in a range of $33 to $35 per share, while Bear Stearns 
analyst Jason Ader had valued the deal at $37 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strategically we think it makes sense for them. The problem is  
the hotel industry is in the doldrums right now, so it's going to 
take several years for (Hilton) shareholders to benefit,'' Ader 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger will result in some layoffs to eliminate duplication,  
but Bollenbach said the company has not determined how many jobs 
will be eliminated. Some Promus properties may be switched to the 
Hilton brand, but there are no plans to close hotels because Promus 
and Hilton hotels appeal to different clientele. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the great things about these transactions -- take Hilton  
and Doubletree, they can sit side by side. They really complement 
each other,'' Bollenbach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another benefit, he said, is that the acquisition will boost  
Hilton's percentage of revenue from franchise fees from 13 percent 
to 30 percent, providing more income stability during down cycles 
in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies' boards of directors have approved the agreement  
and completion of the merger is expected by the end of the year. 
Shareholders of both companies still must approve the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton has about 275 owned, managed or franchised hotels in  
North America, including its newer mid-priced Hilton Garden Inn 
hotels and Hilton Residential Suites extended-stay hotels. The 
lodging company also has Hilton grand vacation timeshare 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Promus has more than 1,400 properties throughout the United  
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporate headquarters will be in Beverly Hills, Calif.,  
where Hilton is located. The new company will maintain an 
operational presence in Memphis.

<HEADLINE> Vikings Want To Leave Past Behind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Dennis Green swears he'll never get a  
crick in his neck looking back on the Minnesota Vikings' 1998 magic 
carpet ride and its colossal crash in the NFC championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're always looking forward. We don't operate in the past,''  
the Vikings coach insisted. ``Everything that we want is ahead of 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, the Vikings have the most-feared passing attack in  
the league, led by Randall Cunningham, who threw 34 touchdown 
passes, and receivers Randy Moss and Cris Carter, who combined for 
29 TD catches. Running backs Robert Smith and Leroy Hoard combined 
for 18 more scores. 
</P>
<P>
	And Jake Reed, a four-time 1,000-yard receiver, is back from  
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense is less flashy, and the line is being reworked  
around All-Pro John Randle, who is moving from back to tackle full 
time. Linebackers Ed McDaniel (knee) and Dwayne Rudd (shoulder), 
who combined for 221 tackles, are less than 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings are coming off a mystifying season in which they  
recorded just the third 15-1 record ever. But unlike San Francisco 
in 1984 and Chicago in 1985, Minnesota didn't cap it off with a 
Super Bowl title. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind Moss, the Vikings scorched opponents for a league record  
556 points, then watched it all ruined on one wholly unexpected bad 
afternoon against the Atlanta Falcons. Gary Anderson, perfect all 
season, missed a field goal that would have sealed the trip to the 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``That game's history, and I'm terrible at history,'' said  
McDaniel, who sustained a major knee injury in that 30-27 overtime 
loss. ``So, there's no need for looking back. This is a totally 
different team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Minnesota returns all 11 offensive starters and the new  
backup quarterback is none other than Jeff George, the Vikings lost 
eight free agents, including run-stuffer Jerry Ball, cornerback 
Corey Fuller and defensive end Derrick Alexander to the Cleveland 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Brad Johnson, a Pro Bowl selection in 1997 whose  
injuries last year paved the way for Cunningham's comeback, was 
traded to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Billick, the architect of the most prolific offense in  
league history, got the head coaching job in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Green had two first-round picks in the draft, but selected a  
project in quarterback Daunte Culpepper and an enigma in Dimitrius 
Underwood, who stuck around for more meals (three) than workouts 
(one). 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who expects to run the ball more often under new  
offensive coordinator Ray Sherman, said he still feels empty over 
the Vikings' playoff failure. He isn't sure whether to forget it or 
use it as inspiration for another Super Bowl push, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't look ahead, beyond the first game. You don't look  
back at what you screwed up last year, either,'' Smith said. ``It's 
impossible not to do either. But you don't want to really 
concentrate too much on one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moss, whose 10 touchdowns of 40-plus yards tied an NFL record  
set by Elroy Hirsch in 1951, uses another game for his inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't use the Atlanta game as motivation. I think what I saw  
in the Super Bowl is motivation to me, to see them get there and 
get demolished by Denver,'' Moss said. ``I think we could have 
given Denver a better game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moss set a rookie record last year with 17 TD catches, but he  
revealed this offseason that he did it on a bum ankle, which he 
sprained last summer, so he's completely healthy for the first time 
since college. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said many times I think he'll have a better year this  
year than he did last year,'' Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a scary thought for defensive coordinators such as Emmitt  
Thomas in Green Bay, where the Packers spent their first three 
draft picks on defensive backs with Moss in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though they aren't reigning Super Bowl or even NFC  
champions, the Vikings know they'll be targeted this season as 
though they were. And it's a role they relish. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I'm with that,'' Moss said. ``I like competition,  
because I'm a competitor. If you're going to come at us, we're 
going to come at you, simple as that.''

<HEADLINE>  El Guerrouj Breaks 2,000 Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN, Germany (AP) -- Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj broke his  
third world record of the season Tuesday night, shattering the 
2,000-meter mark by more than three seconds at the ISTAF meet. 
</P>
<P>
	El Guerrouj, running alone over the final two laps, was timed in  
4 minutes, 44.79 seconds before a cheering crowd of about 30,000 at 
Olympic Stadium. The previous record of 4:47.88 was set by 
Noureddine Morceli of Algeria at Paris in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, El Guerrouj set world records in the mile and  
1,500 meters. His 2,000 record was the highlight of a meet in which 
Wilson Kipketer and Gabriela Szabo split $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer, the Kenyan-born Dane, and Szabo, the diminutive  
Romanian, each won at all seven Golden League meets this year to 
qualify for the big prize. 
</P>
<P>
	With the crowd cheering him loudly, Kipketer took control of the  
men's 800 meters midway through the race, then coasted to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The first person to greet and hug him at the finish line was  
Szabo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was definitely a fight with nerves,'' Kipketer said. ``I  
didn't sleep well at all, but after the starting gun went off 
everything was OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kipketer's time of 1:44.04 was nearly three seconds off his  
world record of 1:41.11, one of three world marks he set before 
malaria wiped out most of his 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Szabo, also supported strongly by the crowd, broke away from a  
pack of four around the final curve and won the women's 3,000 in a 
year's best of 14:40.61. 
</P>
<P>
	Szabo, who had said she wanted to break her European record of  
14:31.28 set last year at ISTAF, had the crowd cheering and 
whistling as she pulled away from Morocco's Zahra Quaziz to win 
easily on a warm, windless night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great race,'' said Szabo, who said she was tired  
after winning at the World Championships two weeks ago at Seville, 
Spain. ``I felt how much the fantastic audience pulled me to the 
win. That was the secret. It was purely psychological,'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meet included 18 gold medalists from the worlds.  
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Greene capitalized on the absence of injured Frankie  
Fredericks of Namibia, the Olympic silver medalist, and won the 200 
in 20.22, duplicating his triumph at Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time wasn't important,'' said Greene, the 100-meter world  
record-holder, ``I'm just preparing to win the 100 and 200 next 
year at the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco's Ali Ezzine, the bronze medalist at the worlds,  
outkicked Bernard Barmasai of Kenya after the final hurdle to win 
the 3,000 steeplechase. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the first loss for Barmasai in the Golden League  
series. Barmasai was disqualified from the jackpot after allegedly 
colluding to win a race at Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Bruny Surin took advantage of Greene's absence in the  
100, and won in 10.07, far off his season's best of 9.84. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Wade beat American teammate Mark Crear in the 110 hurdles,  
leading all the way and winning by .03 seconds in 13.27.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Down in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the yen early Wednesday  
in light trading as dealers await the release of key economic data. 
Japanese share prices fell slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 110.78 yen, down 0.02 yen from late Tuesday in  
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 110.81 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 36.68 points,  
or 0.21 percent, to 17,670.82 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Tuesday, the average closed down 40.01 points, or 0.28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, traders said the dollar was expected to  
remain in a narrow range during the Asian session ahead of the 
release of Japan's April-June gross domestic product data, due out 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Following the dollar's bullish moves Tuesday, many will take  
the dollar-long positions,'' said Takeo Okabe, a senior foreign 
exchange trader at Daiwa Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 117.84 yen, up from  
116.82 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices started slightly lower after the  
release of a corporate spending survey Tuesday indicating that 
Japan's economy may have grown more slowly in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Capital spending dropped 13.4 percent in the April-June quarter,  
more than the 10-percent decline economists in Tokyo had estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Some investors turned bearish after a decline on Wall Street. In  
New York on Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 
44.32 points, or 0.4 percent, at 11,034.13. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 4.34 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,500.28 
points. The TOPIX closed down 7.46 points, or 0.49 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.8200 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.8150 percent, driving 
its price down to 100.67 yen from 100.71 yen.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Office in E. Timor Attacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesian police opened fire at a  
regional U.N. office in East Timor today, reportedly sending 
occupants ducking to the floor hours after the government imposed 
martial law and promised to return normalcy to the terror-ridden 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor's spiritual leader, Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos  
Belo, a winner of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, fled the territory on 
an evacuation flight from the town of Baucau to Darwin, Australia, 
U.N. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bishop, whose home in Dili was torched Monday by  
pro-Indonesian mobs, was one of tens of thousands of people fleeing 
the vicious backlash of burning, shooting and killings unleashed by 
opponents of last week's landslide referendum for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indonesian government declared martial law today as momentum  
built among world powers for sending an international peacekeeping 
force to the territory. Australia offered to contribute 2,000 
peacekeepers, and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
demanded the Indonesians bring calm to East Timor or ``allow the 
international community to come in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attack on the U.N. mission in Baucau before Belo's flight  
left highlighted skepticism that martial law -- which includes the 
provision for soldiers to shoot curfew violators on sight -- would 
calm a bloodletting where the security forces are among the 
perpetrators. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not say the declaration of martial law has done  
anything to secure the situation,'' an information officer said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity from the U.N. compound in the 
provincial capital, Dili, which has also been besieged in the past 
few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 18 hours after the order supposedly took effect, heavy  
machine-gun fire could be heard outside the Dili compound. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. refugee agency said today at least 30,000 have been  
displaced by violence in Dili. ``God only knows how many people are 
displaced'' on the entire island, said Kris Janowski, spokesman for 
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	In Baucau, Indonesian police fired directly at the U.N. mission  
building sporadically over two hours, forcing hundreds of people 
inside to lie on their stomachs, said British Army Maj. John 
Petrie, who came out on the evacuation flight from the town. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. spokeswoman Jenny Grant said Indonesian troops turned back  
local U.N. staff who had tried to get on the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear if Belo had been inside the U.N. mission when  
it was fired upon. 
</P>
<P>
	Belo would not immediately speak to reporters in Darwin.  
</P>
<P>
	The declaration of a martial law in East Timor gives the  
military full control over the territory -- including the authority 
for searches without warrants, curfews and ``the shooting on sight 
of people who go against the curfew,'' said Foreign Minister Ali 
Alatas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Martial law is intended to safeguard security and stability in  
East Timor province so that any further steps for the transfer of 
government from Indonesia to the United Nations can proceed 
peacefully,'' Faisal Tanjung, minister of public security, said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came after senior Indonesian officials acknowledged for  
the first time they had lost control of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Prime Minister John Howard said he had told U.N.  
Secretary-General Kofi Annan his country would contribute up to 
2,000 people and accept a leadership role in an international 
peacekeeping force. Portugal, France, Australia, and Britain have 
said they support sending a U.N. force. 
</P>
<P>
	But Defense Minister Gen. Wiranto rejected a force, saying ``we  
have all the capability to handle the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Indonesian government freed East Timorese rebel  
leader Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao from house arrest today, 
after serving seven years of a 20-year sentence, amid hope he can 
help calm the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I promise as a free man I will do everything to bring peace to  
East Timor and its people,'' said Gusmao, who is expected to become 
the first president. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the forces in the current violence are under Gusmao's  
control. But the 53-year-old rebel leader is massively popular 
among the pro-independence majority and commands the respect even 
of his pro-Indonesian enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dili, the city's commercial section and some residential  
suburbs were looted and trashed overnight, U.N. spokesman Brian 
Kelly said today. He said houses where U.N. staff stayed appeared 
to be targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,500 refugees were still in the U.N. compound,  
seeking a safe haven from the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials said fresh army troops under the command of a  
newly assigned general were guarding the compound, replacing 
Indonesian police. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 10,000 people crowded the Dili dock today, waiting for  
ferries out of the city, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, pro-Indonesian militiamen set houses ablaze, fired  
rocket-propelled grenades and bazookas, and shouted through 
megaphones for those remaining in the city to get out. Witnesses 
said both militiamen and Indonesian troops loaded people onto 
trucks and sent them to West Timor, an Indonesian province that 
shares the island with East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is very clear evidence of collusion between elements of  
the (Indonesian) security forces and the militias to deport East 
Timorese forcibly to West Timor and elsewhere,'' said Mary 
Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony of East Timor in  
1975 and has held it in an iron grip ever since. It is estimated 
that 200,000 or more civilians were killed in the last 25 years.

	Greece Earthquake Kills Thirty-Six  
</P>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Stunned residents joined rescue teams  
Wednesday in digging for those pinned under wreckage from an 
earthquake a day earlier -- the strongest to hit Athens in nearly a 
century. The 10-second shudder that claimed at least 36 lives and 
left close to 100 missing. Engineering crews began fanning out 
through Athens' hard-struck northern suburbs. State media said 
rescue crews were working to free 84 people trapped in 28 flattened 
apartment buildings or factories.

	Puerto Rican Nationalists Accept Clemency Deal  
</P>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Puerto Ricans are hailing the  
imminent release of 12 nationalists imprisoned for weapons 
possession and sedition -- but their freedom isn't expected to 
bolster the cause of Puerto Rican independence. The nationalists, 
members of pro-independence guerrilla groups that carried out a 
wave of bombings in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s, on 
Tuesday accepted a clemency deal offered by President Clinton. Part 
of the deal, however, requires the jailed Puerto Ricans to renounce 
violence and refrain from associating with convicted felons, a 
stipulation that would technically bar two prisoners -- sisters 
Alicia and Ida Luz Rodriguez -- from seeing each other.

	U.N. Launching Poverty Web Site  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A new Internet site from the United Nations aims  
to fight hunger and poverty worldwide by making it easier for 
donors to contribute their time or money. President Clinton, former 
South African President Nelson Mandela and British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair were to launch the NetAid site through satellite 
appearances Wednesday. Three rock concerts on Oct. 9 in London, 
Geneva and East Rutherford, N.J., will boost the U.N. fund-raising 
effort. Unlike the 1985 Live Aid concert to fight famine in 
Ethiopia, organizers say, the Web site will encourage giving long 
after microphones go silent.

	Calm Appears To Return to East Timor  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- A relative calm appeared to return to  
East Timor's capital early Wednesday, as U.N. officials said staff 
members were able to leave their besieged compound and drive around 
the city to assess damage for the first time since Sunday. An 
estimated 30,000 East Timorese were driven out by fear, killings 
and army gunfire. The streets of the city were empty save for 
looters and smoldering fires. ``We are not intending any more 
evacuations. We plan to keep our people there,'' U.N. spokesman 
David Wimhurst said from Darwin, Australia, where many staff 
members have evacuated. Violence was sparked last week when East 
Timorese voted to break away from Indonesia.

	Cisneros Pleads Guilty to Misdemeanor  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros  
pleaded guilty Tuesday to a misdemeanor charge of lying to the FBI 
about payments to an ex-mistress, reaching agreement in the 
four-year, $9 million-plus investigation just as his trial on 18 
felony counts was to begin. The former Clinton Cabinet member, once 
considered a rising Democratic Party star, must pay a $10,000 fine 
but will face no jail time or probation under the agreement.

	Heating Bills Expected To Soar  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Heating bills are expected to take a jump this  
winter after several years of modest costs because of higher oil 
and natural gas prices and increased demand, the Energy Department 
said Tuesday. ``Residential heating oil prices, like all petroleum 
product prices, are expected to increase by a hefty amount this 
winter,'' the Energy Information Administration said.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's financial markets are fully  
prepared for the Year 2000 date change, the government's top 
securities regulator and Wall Street officials are assuring 
investors. ``The first trading day of the new millennium will be 
business as usual,'' Richard Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock 
Exchange, said Tuesday at a news conference. Grasso and the other 
officials said the securities industry had tested and retested all 
its computer systems, ensuring a trouble-free transition to the 
21st century.

victory. Houston increased its NL Central lead to three games over 
second-place Cincinnati, which split a doubleheader at the Chicago

<HEADLINE> Ford Settles Sexual Harassment Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Hundreds of female Ford Motor Co. employees who  
claimed they were groped and sexually harassed at two of the 
company's plants will share $7.75 million in a settlement reached 
by Ford and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The award was announced Tuesday by Ford and the Equal Employment  
Opportunity Commission. It is the fourth-largest sexual-harassment 
settlement in the history of the EEOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's chairwoman, Ida Castro, said the agreement  
``demonstrates the EEOC's commitment to eradicate harassment from 
the workplaces of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It comes on the heels of a record $34 million settlement between  
the EEOC and Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing of America in June in 
a similar sexual harassment case involving the Japanese automaker's 
plant in Normal, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's agreement calls for sensitivity training by outside  
consultants at Ford plants across the nation at a cost estimated by 
the EEOC at $10 million. Ford said it did not know what the cost 
would be. 
</P>
<P>
	The terms specify that $7.5 million in damages will be split  
between approximately 700 to 900 women who can show sexual 
harassment or gender discrimination at Ford plants in Chicago and 
suburban Chicago Heights. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount that each claimant receives will be decided by a  
three-member independent board to be set up under the settlement. 
It will consist of one member named by the EEOC, one named by Ford 
and a chairman appointed by those members. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts within the plants to root out sexual harassment and  
gender discrimination will also be supervised by the board. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement provides for more women in management positions.  
Supervisors who see sexual harassment but do nothing will be 
ineligible for promotions and bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	James Padilla, Ford group vice president for manufacturing,  
praised what he described as ``a partnership with the EEOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement further strengthens Ford's long-standing policy  
of zero tolerance and will help move us toward our goal of zero 
occurrence of harassment of any kind at our facilities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen women who have filed their own lawsuit against Ford  
will not share in the damages. The EEOC did not sue Ford but 
instead negotiated a settlement without going to court. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's second-largest automaker won't be strained by the  
$7.75 million cost. Ford reported operating earnings for the three 
months that ended in June of $2.48 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement Tuesday was interrupted briefly by Suzette  
Wright, 29, a worker at Ford's assembly plant on Chicago's South 
Side. She said she had been subjected to crude comments from 
co-workers and that her breasts and buttocks had been groped. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright asked Padilla for an apology. Padilla responded that if  
any Ford employees had been deprived of their dignity, ``we 
apologize.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Sheds 44.32 to 11,034.13 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed lower Tuesday as lingering fears  
about rising interest rates prompted investors to collect profits 
from Friday's big rally. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 44.32 to close at  
11,034.13. The blue chips stayed in a narrow range throughout the 
session, bobbing briefly into positive territory before giving up 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators ended with slim losses. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 fell 6.79 to 1,350.45, and the Nasdaq composite index 
fell 5.85 to 2,837.26. 
</P>
<P>
	While merger activity stimulated trading in selected stocks, the  
overall market was quiet. Analysts said investors might be 
reluctant to drive prices much higher following Friday's massive 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow soared 235.24 points Friday, and the Nasdaq gained  
108.87, its largest single-day point gain ever, as a 
weaker-than-expected employment report raised hopes that the 
economy is not growing too rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the initial euphoria, many strategists dissected the  
report over the Labor Day weekend, and returned to trading 
convinced that inflation may be escalating, said Hugh Johnson, 
chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although there are some signs the economy may be slowing,  
there are not many signs,'' he said. ``There are still reasons to 
worry about inflation and Fed rate policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates twice this year in  
an effort to contain inflation and slow economic growth. Investors 
are now carefully watching for indications of whether the Fed will 
raise rates a third time. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan will give a speech in  
Michigan to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Gerald Ford's 
inauguration as president. Later in the week, several regional Fed 
officials will speak, and analysts say all will be closely watched 
for signs of the Fed's latest sentiment on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc.,  
said the stock market may remain locked in a narrow range, with 
some big price swings, until the interest rate question is put to 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thereafter, we expect a very solid rally,'' he said, citing  
strong corporate earnings and stable Fed policy as cornerstones of 
market strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Optimism about corporate profits helped contain market losses as  
Wall Street investment banks raised their ratings or earnings 
estimates on some widely held shares. General Electric rose 3 13/32 
to 119 13/16 after Salomon Smith Barney raised its rating on the 
stock. A Salomon analyst said he expects the share price to hit 135 
within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola shot up 4 7/8 to 100 following an upgrade from Lehman  
Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's financial services companies fell amid the uneasiness  
over interest rates. J.P. Morgan, down 4 3/4 to 129 1/16, was the 
worst performer in the Dow. Its shares weakened amid a drop in bond 
prices, which pushed the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.07 
percent, compared with 6.01 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two major mergers sparked some trading activity. Viacom's Class  
B rose 1 7/8 to 46 15/16 after the company said it will buy CBS for 
$34.45 billion in stock in the biggest media deal ever. Shares of 
CBS ended up 1 3/4 at 50 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	And Hilton Hotels agreed to buy Promus Hotel in a $4 billion  
stock and cash deal. Hilton shares slipped 5/8 to 11 3/16, and Promus 
rose 3 7/16 to 34 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. NYSE volume totaled 863.50 million shares, 
compared with 801.02 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.27 to 438.24.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.28 percent.  
Germany's DAX index fell 0.2 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 lost 1.0 
percent, and France's CAC-40 lost 0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Dow Widens Losses in Late Trading / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials widened their losses  
today as lingering fears about rising interest rates prompted 
investors to collect profits from Friday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow was down 40.21  
at 11,038.24 after having been modestly higher earlier in the

<HEADLINE> Germans Won't Prosecute Frankel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- German prosecutors said Tuesday they  
won't press charges against Martin Frankel, clearing the way for 
the alleged rogue financier's extradition to the United States as 
soon as next week if it goes uncontested. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruediger Bagger, the Hamburg prosecutor handling the case, said  
he expected to file extradition papers this week and could receive 
a ruling by the middle of next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, 44, was arrested Saturday in Hamburg after a four-month  
international manhunt, and is being held in investigative custody 
on German charges of falsifying a British passport. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, officials want to bring him to trial on  
charges of money laundering and wire fraud, alleging he embezzled 
more than $218 million from investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no great interest to have a trial against him on  
account of the passport charge,'' Bagger said. ``It is very little 
in comparison with what he has done in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel's lawyer, Thomas Piplak, has said his client may decide  
to contest extradition, citing concerns that people he allegedly 
swindled might seek retribution. 
</P>
<P>
	An extradition challenge could delay the process by months.  
</P>
<P>
	Part of the reason the decision on fighting extradition may take  
longer is that Hugh Keefe, Frankel's U.S. lawyer, said he has been 
barred by German law from talking with his client by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Keefe said Tuesday that he had been in touch with Frankel during  
the four months he was on the run, but declined to elaborate on the 
details of his travels. 
</P>
<P>
	German prosecutors are waiting for more precise details from  
U.S. officials on Frankel's alleged illegal activities -- including 
dates and dollar figures -- to proceed with the extradition process. 
</P>
<P>
	Bagger said information received from U.S. officials so far has  
been general. 
</P>
<P>
	Expediting extradition could speed the way for insurance  
companies to get information from Frankel that will help recover 
the millions authorities say the Connecticut-based money manager 
siphoned away. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators already have seized $57.5 million, and have  
connected a $26.5 million frozen Swiss bank account to Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	Those amounts still pale in comparison to the $218 million he  
allegedly embezzled from several insurance companies; a lawsuit 
from the companies places the figure much higher at $915 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel also is thought to have allegedly stolen as much as  
$1.98 billion from the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation, which 
investigators say he established last year in the British Virgin 
Islands. But it's unsure if that money actually existed or Frankel 
just claimed it was there. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel also met Tuesday with a representative of the U.S.  
Consulate in Hamburg, routine for Americans being held outside of 
the United States. Officials declined to discuss details.

<HEADLINE> GOP Candidates Parade Through N.H. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILFORD, N.H. (AP) -- The other Republicans vying for the GOP's  
presidential nomination couldn't escape the shadow of the 
front-running Texas Gov. George W. Bush -- even though he was 
outside the state while they were busy pressing the flesh. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush won the best float award in a Labor Day parade that they  
attended but he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer, Elizabeth Dole, Steve Forbes and Dan Quayle turned  
on the charm during the holiday weekend as they paraded and greeted 
voters at a state fair and at barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bush, who arrived in Manchester late Monday afternoon  
from South Carolina, had a look-alike on his float, which also 
featured a look-alike Theodore Roosevelt and photos of every 
Republican president this century. 
</P>
<P>
	``The judging had nothing to do with popularity, but I would say  
Bush is very popular here in Milford,'' said Robert Philbrick, 
Labor Day parade organizer for the past 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates didn't have much chance to talk about the issues  
along the parade route but they got opportunities to talk up their 
positions before and after the parade. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said average families can relate better to him than the  
other candidates. He proclaimed himself the candidate of ``Main 
Street'' who is running against ``Wall Street'' candidates Bush and 
Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, former president of the American Red Cross, appealed for  
tax relief during a Salem GOP picnic, where she arrived on a 
Harley-Davidson motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes dismissed Bush's popularity -- a recent New Hampshire poll  
put Bush nearly 40 percentage points ahead of the runners-up -- and 
said voters are only just starting to focus on presidential 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have more substance based on principle -- whether its taxes,  
health care, education, Social Security, the military, the life 
issue -- than all the other candidates put together,'' he said at 
the picnic. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle spoke about the need for discipline in schools and term  
limits in Congress, the importance of having a president 
experienced in foreign policy, and his desire to reform the health 
care and tax systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters will reward candidates who ``stick to the issues,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican Party, they're talking a lot about a  
coronation, they're talking about the inevitability, they're 
talking about that this is over,'' Quayle said. ``And I just refuse 
to believe that. If I believe that, if it were over, then I 
wouldn't be here campaigning my heart out.''

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Futures Surge / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices settled higher  
in trading Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as weather concerns 
and fears about crop conditions controlled the market. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybean futures prices were sharply higher as the market reacted  
to the lack of rain in the Midwest and Delta regions over the holiday 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
        Also giving a boost to prices were fears the U.S. Agriculture  
Department later this week will again reduce its rating of the crop. 
The soybean crop's good to excellent rating has dropped for seven consecutive 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
        Corn futures prices were higher in league with soybean futures.  
The possibility that the USDA will reduce its estimate of the size 
of the U.S. corn crop also gave a boost to prices. 
</P>
<P>
        The continued wet weather in the northern Plains helped lift  
wheat futures prices. It is feared the rain will further erode the 
quality of the spring wheat and durum crops. 
</P>
<P>
        Reports that Pakistan may enter the market for a major purchase  
of wheat also gave a boost to futures prices. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for September delivery was 4 1/4 cents higher at $2.77  
a bushel; September corn was 2 1/4 cents higher at $2.11 1/2 a bushel; 
September oats were 1 1/2 cents higher at $1.09 a bushel; September 
soybeans were 22 cents higher at $5.15 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Cattle and pork futures prices settled higher in trading on  
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, with the market responding to expectations 
that retail sales were strong over the holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
        October live cattle were .62 cent higher at 67.72 cents a pound;  
September feeder cattle were .27 cent higher at 78.82 cents a pound; 
October lean hogs were .30 cent higher at 46.15 cents a pound; February 
pork bellies were .98 cent higher at 55.55 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Fetes Spurs for NBA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton welcomed the NBA champion  
San Antonio Spurs to the White House on Tuesday, telling the team 
that politics is like basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get ahead, you get behind,'' said Clinton, a  
self-described ``basketball fanatic.'' ``Normally, you don't know 
whether you are going to win until it's right before the end the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the Spurs won their first NBA title, beating the New  
York Knicks in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton extended a special welcome to forward Sean Elliott, who  
underwent a kidney transplant last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott ``is an inspiration to a lot of people who have kidney  
transplants, especially if he can come back for training camp,'' 
Spurs captain Avery Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs took a 35-minute tour of the White House before the  
event in the East Room, which was attended by some of their friends 
and family, the president and four members of the Texas 
congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the team he hoped he could learn a lesson from NBA  
MVP Tim Duncan: He wanted to develop his ``killer look'' for budget 
negotiations this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs said they wanted to learn some lessons from Clinton.  
</P>
<P>
	``Out of all the great things about you, we want to copy one  
thing from you, and that's to repeat,'' Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads Guilty to Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Months after he confessed on videotape to two  
killings that kept another man on death row for almost 17 years, a 
Milwaukee man on Tuesday pleaded guilty to the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Alstory Simon agreed to a plea bargain in which he was sentenced  
to 37 years in prison for the 1982 murder of Marilyn Green. He also 
pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the death of Jerry 
Hillard, 18, and was given a 15-year sentence to be served 
concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths of Green, 19, and Hillard, 18, had left Anthony  
Porter convicted of murder and on death row. He was released in 
February after Simon confessed the killings to a private 
investigator, who was working for a Northwestern University 
journalism professor and his investigative reporting class. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigator elicited the confession from Simon by using a  
phony eyewitness account. In the confession, Simon said he acted in 
self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon, a 49-year-old laborer who has lived in Milwaukee since  
1982, had no connection to Porter. They were simply at the same 
pool in Washington Park on the night of the fatal shootings, said 
Thomas V. Gainer, an assistant Cook County state's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter was released from prison and is living in Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Fires Claim 4.4 Million Acres in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- How did Tom Kelly spend his summer? In the past  
four months, the U.S. Forest Service firefighter has been 
dispatched to 12 blazes in four states, and he doesn't anticipate a 
vacation anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``There do come times when you wish for not only a little rain  
but a lot of rain,'' Kelly, of Dolores, Colo., said during a rare 
break from battling a 63,000-acre fire in California's San 
Bernardino Mountains last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until there's a weather change,'' he added, ``the potential  
for continued fires is very great. There's no reason why it 
couldn't get worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For some states in the wildfire-plagued West, it's already been  
bad enough. More than 4.4 million acres have been consumed this 
year in nearly 71,000 fires nationwide, with more than half of the 
scorched land in Alaska and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the most land lost to wildfires since the record 1996  
fire season, in which 6.7 million acres were scorched in 115,025 
blazes, surpassing a 1952 record for acres burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Blazes continued to rage Tuesday in California, Nevada, Oregon,  
Texas and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news is that cooler weather in the Pacific Northwest  
and an active monsoon season in the Southwest have reduced the risk 
of fire in those regions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad news is that as hot, dry weather persists in other parts  
of the country, including Texas and California, the fire season 
could stay active well into the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Southern California we sometimes find ourselves fighting  
fires on Christmas Day,'' Forest Service spokesman Matt Mathes 
said. ``Things are really getting dry, the wind is picking up and 
it's still warm. We're in it for the foreseeable future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The past two years proved to be relatively mild fire seasons  
thanks to cooler, wetter conditions produced by El Nino. But the 
wet weather also allowed fuels such as sagebrush and grass to build 
up just as El Nino's counterpart, La Nina, arrived with drier, 
warmer weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``That kind of set the stage for an active season,'' said Rick  
Ochoa, a fire weather forecaster at the National Interagency Fire 
Center in Boise, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 4 a front of dry thunderstorms -- consisting of little  
rain and lots of lightning -- moved into Nevada, sparking dozens of 
wildfires. In just four days, more than 1 million acres were 
scorched. 
</P>
<P>
	To date more than 1.4 million acres have been burned in 917  
fires this year in Nevada -- ``the largest number of acres that have 
burned as far back as we can find records for,'' said Bureau of 
Land Management spokeswoman Jo Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
	While losses to homes and other buildings were minimal,  
officials estimate it will cost $50 million and take up to six 
years to restore scorched rangeland and wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	``These fires have really hurt,'' said Buster Dufurrena, a  
cattle rancher who lost several thousand acres near Denio, Nev. 
``One of my neighbors lost 50 percent of his allotment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California had been experiencing a light fire season until Aug.  
23, when more than 3,000 lightning strikes hit the northern slice 
of the state in just 12 hours, scorching about 150,000 acres of 
grazing and timber land, as well as some campgrounds and wildlife 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Terrill of the California Department of Forestry and Fire  
Protection called it the state's worst lightning siege since 1987, 
when 12,000 strikes sparked 1,200 fires and burned more than 
800,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Within days of the Northern California fires, several blazes  
erupted in Southern California -- among them the giant blaze in the 
San Bernardino Mountains, started by an illegal campfire. 
</P>
<P>
	So far about 360,000 acres have been scorched in some 7,400  
fires, just above the state's annual average of about 320,000 
acres. The blazes claimed the lives of a firefighter and a Northern 
California woman, and destroyed dozens of homes. 
</P>
<P>
	In Alaska more than 1 million acres burned in 475 wildfires this  
year, surpassing the annual average of 600,000 acres. Some cabins 
and sheds have been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah have experienced  
relatively mild fire seasons thanks to rainy weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really been a mixed bag of a fire season,'' said Don  
Smurthwaite, a spokesman for the National Interagency Fire Center. 
But one thing is sure, he added: ``The potential for more fires is 
definitely there.''

<HEADLINE> Niners Acquire Packers' Newsome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Cornerback Craig Newsome, a four-year  
starter in Green Bay before his demotion this week, was traded 
today to the San Francisco 49ers for an undisclosed draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome is expected to join the 49ers in time for practice  
Wednesday as San Francisco prepares for Sunday's opener at 
Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of the 6-foot Newsome gives the 49ers a bigger  
presence in the secondary. San Francisco had concerns facing some 
of the league's taller, physical receivers with its three top 
cornerbacks all 5-9 or under. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome had 178 tackles and four interceptions in four seasons  
in Green Bay. He's remembered in San Francisco as the player who 
returned fullback Adam Walker's first-play fumble for a touchdown 
in a 1996 playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome, who earns $800,000, became expendable in Green Bay when  
rookies Antuan Edwards and Mike McKenzie played well in the 
preseason and moved ahead of him in the Packers' lineup.

<HEADLINE> 12 Puerto Rico Dissidents OK Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Twelve of 14 jailed Puerto Rican nationalists  
agreed Tuesday to a politically sensitive clemency deal offered by 
President Clinton but opposed by his wife, prospective Senate 
candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Puerto Ricans, jailed on weapons and sedition convictions,  
are members of pro-independence guerrilla groups that carried out a 
wave of bombings in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly month-old offer is conditioned on statements from  
each independence activist pledging not to engage in violence if 
released. The activists had until Friday to take or leave the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Two imprisoned activists are expected to reject the clemency  
offer, the White House said. Two others, who are not in jail, have 
another week to respond. If they agree to the White House terms, 
their fines will be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president expects all those who accept the conditional  
clemency grant to abide fully by its terms, including refraining 
from the use of advocacy of the use of violence for any purpose and 
obeying all the statutory conditions of parole,'' White House press 
secretary Joe Lockhart said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in San Juan, activist leader Luis Nieves  
Falcon confirmed that 11 members of the Armed Forces of National 
Liberation and one leader of the Macheteros separatist group had 
accepted the three-week-old offer even though it required them to 
formally renounce violence and agree not to associate with felons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conditions are terrible,'' said Deadina Ortiz, mother of  
New York City art teacher Elizam Escobar, who has been in jail in 
Oklahoma for 19 years. ``Clinton's crazy. How can somebody say, for 
example, that two sisters can't see each other just because of 
their beliefs? However, I think it's enough. ... And it's time for 
him to come home to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zenaida Lopez, whose brother, Oscar Lopez Rivera, is serving a  
55-year sentence and is one of the two prisoners who didn't sign 
the agreement, said: ``He feels that renouncing violence, accepting 
what they are offering, is like a prison without a prison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Armed Forces of National Liberation, known by its Spanish  
initials FALN, carried out more than 100 bombings in the United 
States between 1974 and 1983. The bombings killed six and wounded 
dozens. The imprisoned nationalists were not convicted in any of 
the bombings but were found guilty of seditious conspiracy and 
possession of weapons and explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	The clemency offer has divided the first family and brought  
criticism from both Republicans and Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there have been many who have sought to inject  
politics, and many who have thought to inject a motive here, and 
all I can say is that they're wrong,'' Lockhart said at his daily 
briefing for reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, a potential candidate for a Senate seat from New  
York, has urged the president to rescind the proposal. ``It's been 
three weeks and their silence speaks volumes,'' the first lady said 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican critics and some law enforcement officials asserted  
the president's clemency offer was originally designed to help his 
wife win votes among New York's 1.3 million Puerto Ricans. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart sidestepped a question about whether White House  
strategy had backfired, and noted that a clemency deal was under 
discussion long before Mrs. Clinton began considering the 2000 
Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats, including the senator Mrs. Clinton would  
replace, Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan, have called the clemency 
deal a bad idea. Now that Mrs. Clinton has spoken out, Democrats 
who cheered the clemency deal are calling her a turncoat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am disappointed. I am angry,'' said Rep. Jose Serrano,  
D-N.Y., said. ``And frankly, I view her and her candidacy 
differently after reading reports of her comments and actions. I 
would be a hypocrite if I did not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Wolfson, spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's exploratory  
campaign, said the first lady ``understands that her friends feel 
very strongly about this issue, but she stands by her statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., complained that the attention paid  
to Mrs. Clinton's statement distracted attention from serious 
discussion of the prisoners' cases and their cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is on a listening tour, isn't she?'' Velazquez asked at a  
Manhattan news conference. ``I would advise her strongly to 
continue, and to come to our community to see what the issues 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton called a summer of campaign-style visits to New  
York cities and towns a listening tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Velazquez said she got a call from the White House attempting to  
further explain Mrs. Clinton's position. Velazquez was asked if the 
call was an attempt to apologize, explain or clarify Mrs. Clinton's 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the above,'' she replied.

<HEADLINE> Philip Morris Jumps Tariff Hurdle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Philip Morris said Tuesday it would  
begin shipping Marlboro cigarettes to Colombia from neighboring 
Venezuela, circumventing what it called excessive tariffs on 
U.S.-made cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate response from the Colombian government,  
which has been embroiled in a lengthy dispute with the U.S. 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaining that high tariffs were making its products too  
expensive in Colombia, Philip Morris in June stopped shipping to 
the country where it held a 6 percent share of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a statement Tuesday, the company's subsidiary in Colombia  
said it would resume sales to Colombia -- only now of Marlboros 
produced at a tobacco plant in Maracay, Venezuela. It did not say 
when the shipments would resume. 
</P>
<P>
	As members of the Andean Community, Venezuela and Colombia  
generally charge lower import tariffs to one another than they do 
to countries laying outside the economic trading bloc that also 
includes Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since they come from the Andean pact, the (Venezuelan-made  
cigarettes) will not be subject to any import duties,'' a company 
spokeswoman told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colombian government tariff rates which prompted the dispute  
with Philip Morris applied only to cigarettes produced in the 
United States, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Philip Morris would continue to seek a reduction on  
those rates, and could even take its case to an international trade 
tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombian officials charge the company is declaring customs  
values well below the cigarettes' true value and U.S. prices.

<HEADLINE> Gore Basks in New Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Flanked by top Democrats and key labor  
leaders, Vice President Al Gore headed up a Labor Day Parade 
representing virtually all of the Democratic Party's establishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor leaders said they put aside differences with Gore, even as  
top Democratic officials weighed in with new endorsements in a 
hectic union-oriented campaign tour through Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade policies have brought tensions between union leaders and  
the White House, and Gore made it clear there would be no change in 
those policies. That seemed to make little difference on a 
sun-splashed Labor Day celebration in a key political state. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore collected the endorsement of U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin, and then  
strode side-by-side with AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer Richard 
Trumka, who spoke approvingly of Gore's bid for the Democratic 
presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud to be with the vice president as he helps us  
celebrate Labor Day,'' said Trumka, who added that the labor 
federation is likely to endorse a candidate at its October 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the heads-on favorite is the vice president,'' Trumka  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has clashed with labor leaders in pushing for  
free trade proposals that unions say amount to exporting jobs. Gore 
said that tension will continue if he's elected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the same general philosophy on trade,'' Gore said. ``I  
think part of our success in the economy has been to open new 
markets for our products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former U.S Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey formally announces  
his campaign for the Democratic nomination this week, and 
immediately heads to Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Day swing by Gore underscores the difficulty Bradley  
will have in prying the Democratic Party's establishment away from 
a candidate with the full backing of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin has close ties to organized labor and is a leading Senate  
liberal, but he handed a warm endorsement to the centrist Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't take this step lightly,'' Harkin said. ``Al Gore is  
right for Iowa, he is right for America and he's right for our 
working families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was the grand marshal of the state's Labor Day Parade, and  
leading the gathering of labor leaders through the city's east side 
was a highly symbolic gesture. He was flanked by Trumka, Harkin and 
three other statewide elected Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The parade wound for three miles through a solid working-class  
neighborhood street lined with thousands of cheering spectators. 
Dressed in khaki slacks and a polo shirt, Gore dashed from side to 
side, passing out candy to children and shaking hands with their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor leaders say proposals like the North American Free Trade  
Agreement give businesses incentives to ship jobs to Third World 
countries with poor labor and environmental standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he will push those issues, while seeking to include  
provisions forcing trading partners to boost labor laws and 
environmental standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no secret that President Clinton and I have worked and  
we've tried to integrate labor and environmental concerns into the 
fabric of trade negotiations,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most polls have shown Gore with a solid early lead over Bradley  
in Iowa, though others have suggested a tight battle in New 
Hampshire, home of the first primary election. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore dismissed polls showing him doing well, and those showing  
him faring poorly. 
</P>

	``The polls aren't going to decide this election and don't mean  
anything at this stage,'' Gore said.

Iowa next weekend to kick off a drive featuring organizational 
meetings in each of the state's 99 counties.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Whitman Rules Out Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New Jersey's moderate Republican Gov. Christie  
Whitman walked away Tuesday from a promising campaign for the 
Senate, surprising officials in her party and cheering Democrats 
eager to cut into the GOP majority in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced that a statewide campaign would be a  
distraction from finishing the work New Jersey voters have asked me 
to complete,'' the two-term governor said in a statement. Until her 
announcement, she had been considered a strong contender to succeed 
retiring Democrat Frank Lautenberg and become the first New Jersey 
Republican elected to the Senate since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible Democratic candidates for the seat include Jon Corzine,  
wealthy former chairman of Goldman Sachs and a target of a 
courtship by Democratic campaign officials in Washington; former 
Gov. James Florio; and Tommy Byrne, former state party chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Republicans, Rep. Bob Franks, State Sen. Bill Gormley and  
Essex County Executive James Treffinger expressed interest, and the 
names of Rep. Frank LoBiondo and Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler 
also surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The only declared GOP candidate is college professor Murray  
Sabrin, who ran against Whitman in the 1997 gubernatorial election 
as candidate of the Libertarian party. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans command a 54-45 majority in the current Senate, with  
one independent who normally votes with the GOP, which means 
Democrats must gain six seats in next year's elections to gain 
power. Republicans must defend 19 of the 33 seats on the ballot, 
many held by freshmen who could face difficult re-election 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats had been stung in recent months by unexpected  
retirements of Lautenberg and two other veterans, Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan in New York and Richard Bryan in Nevada. Their decisions 
suddenly gave Republicans strong opportunities to take away seats 
held by Democrats rather than merely try to fend off Democratic 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	With elections 14 months away, Democrats still are awaiting word  
from high-profile potential candidates in at least two states. 
</P>
<P>
	In Delaware, Democratic officials are increasingly optimistic  
outgoing Gov. Tom Carper will decide to challenge Sen. William V. 
Roth. Roth is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, but he is 
78 years old and off to a slow start in raising campaign money. 
</P>
<P>
	Carper's office said Tuesday the governor hopes to make an  
announcement about his future in a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In Vermont, Democrats hope an independent, Rep. Bernie Sanders,  
will run against Sen. James Jeffords. Sanders earlier pledged to 
decide by summer, but that self-imposed timetable has slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	In public comments and private conversations Tuesday, Whitman  
repeated that her decision was based strictly on a desire to focus 
on her gubernatorial duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Her spokesman, Peter McDonough, said that since forming an  
exploratory committee several months ago, the governor has raised 
$2.23 million for the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a matter of health, heart, politics or finances. It  
was simply a matter of trying to balance the needs of being a 
governor with the needs of running the kind of campaign that the 
governor would like to run,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman's decision leaves the 53-year-old governor without an  
obvious next political step after she leaves office in January 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	A moderate in a party that has become increasingly conservative  
on social matters, she rode into office as a tax-cutter but also 
outlined a strong position in favor of abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
	None of that stopped the party from trying to elevate her  
stature nationally. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, leader of a 
conservative majority, personally tapped Whitman to deliver the 
nationally televised GOP response to President Clinton's State of 
the Union address in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's decision took officials in Washington by  
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	She telephoned Sen. Mitch McConnell, chairman of the Republican  
Senatorial Campaign Committee, hours after word of her decision had 
leaked. McConnell had eagerly recruited her to run for the seat in 
the days after Lautenberg's retirement announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we will miss her as a candidate, this announcement won't  
change the importance of the race or our ability to pick up this 
seat,'' the committee said in a statement. ``We have tremendous 
candidate strength in New Jersey, while the Democrats are 
irreversibly locked in a bitter primary fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats saw the decision as a break.  
</P>
<P>
	``Essentially the Republicans have 12 months to find a candidate  
and mount a $12 million dollar campaign with someone who is 
essentially unknown,'' said Sen. Bob Torricelli, D-N.J., head of 
the Democratic campaign committee. ``They're in trouble.''

<HEADLINE> Hilton Hotels Acquires Promus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hilton Hotels Corp. is buying Promus Hotel  
Corp. for $3.1 billion in a cash-and-stock deal that expands 
Hilton's market reach to include nearly 1,700 establishments, 
ranging from New York's luxurious Waldorf-Astoria to the mid-priced 
Hampton Inn chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition announced Tuesday also gives Hilton a large  
stake in the all-suites segment of the lodging market, geared 
toward business travelers who stay for extended periods. Promus 
brands include the Embassy Suites Guest Suites, Homewood Suites, 
Red Lion, Doubletree and Club Hotel by Doubletree chains. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies have been talking about a combination since July,  
said Stephen F. Bollenbach, president and chief executive of 
Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more we worked on it, the clearer it became the economics  
of consolidation were so compelling and so good for our 
shareholders and their shareholders that it was a transaction we 
had to pursue,'' Bollenbach said in a conference call with 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to provide $55 million in cost savings the  
first year of operation for the combined companies, and $90 million 
in following years. Promus had $1.1 billion in revenues in 1998, 
with Hilton taking in $1.8 billion for the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton will pay $38.50 per share for 55 percent of Promus  
shares. The rest of Promus' stock will be exchanged for Hilton 
common stock equivalent to $38.50 per share. Hilton will also 
assume $900 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Promus shares rose $3.43 3/4 to $34.81 1/4 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange. Hilton shares dropped 62 1/2 cents to $11.18 3/4 on news 
that the cost of the acquisition would hurt Hilton's earnings in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal puts Hilton in a better position to compete with rivals  
including Marriott International Inc. and Starwood Hotels and 
Resorts, analysts said. However, it will take several years for 
Hilton shareholders to realize any gain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does add scale, which I think is required. I think there  
are some intermediate-term question marks about the transaction. 
... In my view, they overpaid,'' said Harry Curtis, an analyst with 
BancBoston Robert Stevens. ``This is manna from heaven for Promus 
shareholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BancBoston had estimated before the announcement that the price  
would be in a range of $33 to $35 per share, while Bear Stearns 
analyst Jason Ader had valued the deal at $37 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strategically we think it makes sense for them. The problem is  
the hotel industry is in the doldrums right now, so it's going to 
take several years for (Hilton) shareholders to benefit,'' Ader 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger will result in some layoffs to eliminate duplication,  
but Bollenbach said the company has not determined how many jobs 
will be eliminated. Some Promus properties may be switched to the 
Hilton brand, but there are no plans to close hotels because Promus 
and Hilton hotels appeal to different clientele. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the great things about these transactions -- take Hilton  
and Doubletree, they can sit side by side. They really complement 
each other,'' Bollenbach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another benefit, he said, is that the acquisition will boost  
Hilton's percentage of revenue from franchise fees from 13 percent 
to 30 percent, providing more income stability during down cycles 
in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies' boards of directors have approved the agreement  
and completion of the merger is expected by the end of the year. 
Shareholders of both companies still must approve the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton has about 275 owned, managed or franchised hotels in  
North America, including its newer mid-priced Hilton Garden Inn 
hotels and Hilton Residential Suites extended-stay hotels. The 
lodging company also has Hilton grand vacation timeshare 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Promus has more than 1,400 properties throughout the United  
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporate headquarters will be in Beverly Hills, Calif.,  
where Hilton is located. The new company will maintain an 
operational presence in Memphis.

<HEADLINE> 9-9-99 Could Cause Computer Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- The Year 2000 computer bug isn't the only  
date-related problem that could trip up computers across the 
country in coming months. Just ask Phil White Hawk, a member of a 
Unity town committee that is preparing for a glitch that could 
strike on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The date 9-9-99 resembles the ``9999'' that many programmers  
used as a signal to quit, which means some computers could read the 
date as a signal to stop running a program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that 9-9-99 ... is going to be the start of things,''  
said White Hawk, a member of the Unity Year 2000 Preparedness 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	It's one of many potential date-related problems in addition to  
the Year 2000 bug, which could disrupt some computers that 
misinterpret the digits ``00'' as the year 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Others include the once-in-a-millennium leap year on Feb. 29,  
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are all caused by the same thing,'' said George  
Markowsky, chairman of the computer science department at the 
University of Maine: programmers who used shorthand dates like 
``99'' to save computer memory, putting off a problem that is now 
coming home to roost. 
</P>
<P>
	``They made a trade-off and figured that 20 or 30 years from  
now, they'd deal with it,'' Markowsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Unity group has dealt with it by mailing out a list to alert  
residents about key dates. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's several of those that have gone by without much  
happening,'' such as the start of Maine's fiscal year on July 1, 
White Hawk conceded. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's really a good sign because it means that business and  
industry have gone a long way toward rectifying the software part 
of this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's date might not present much of a problem, according  
to a worker with a Portland company that has been doing Year 2000 
remediation. 
</P>
<P>
	Six nines, rather than four, have predominantly been used to  
signal the end of a program, said Rao Addanki, consulting director 
for CST 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Four nines is a little less used, but it is a potential  
problem that people should look at,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Grain Futures Climb / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures soared early today on  
the Chicago Board of Trade in response to dry weather in the 
Midwest that is expected to affect the soybean crop adversely. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans led the rally, jumping sharply higher after a rainless  
Labor Day weekend through most of the growing region and with 
forecasts calling for more of the same all this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also were anticipating a drop in the the weekly  
soybean crop condition report to be issued later today by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures also gained amid similar expectations of a slight  
decline in crop conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat, meanwhile, rode higher on momentum from the soybeans gain  
as well as wet conditions in the spring wheat belt. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 5 cents to $2.94 a bushel;  
December corn rose 2 3/4 cents to $2.25 1/4 a bushel; December oats rose 
1 cent to $1.17 1/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 14 3/4 cents to 
$5.13 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose .02 cent to 67.12 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle fell .03 cent to 79.12 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs fell .30 cent to 45.55 cents a pound; February pork 
bellies rose .03 cent to 54.60 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympics Tickets Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Sydney Olympic organizers were warned  
repeatedly not to release track and field tickets but they did so 
to help balance their finances, a spokesman for the International 
Amateur Athletics Federation said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sydney Morning Herald reported that IAAF official Georgio  
Ranieri said it was made clear to the Sydney Organizing Committee 
for the Olympic Games ``many times'' -- and again just before the 
ticket release -- that it needed the IAAF's authorization for the 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, SOCOG officials said there could be revisions to the  
track and field schedule for next year's Games because of changes 
demanded by the IAAF, most due to rest days needed between 
semifinals and finals in many events. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ranieri said SOCOG knew the IAAF had to appoint another  
technical delegate -- to replace Charles Mukora, an IOC member who 
resigned after the Salt Lake City scandal -- and that would delay 
the final signing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We acted correctly and said to SOCOG that you cannot prepare  
the schedule and release the tickets without our authorization,'' 
Ranieri said. 
</P>
<P>
	``From our point of view, their priority was for the money and  
cash before agreeing to the schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jacques Rogge, the IOC coordination commission chairman,  
confirmed the IAAF sent letters to SOCOG warning it that approval 
was still to be given. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said SOCOG was not to blame because it followed  
proper procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``SOCOG did their best, it is just regrettable that the IAAF did  
not respond by the due times,'' Rogge said. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG says approval had been received twice from the IOC to  
release the schedule and tickets without any conditions about IAAF 
authorization.

	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Alvin Lee, a former Alabama guard who as a  
junior college player in 1987 led the nation in scoring, was killed 
in a car accident. He was 33. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee was killed Sunday when he lost control of his car and it  
overturned on U.S. 301 in Hanover County, Va., around 3:30 p.m.,

	Lee led Jefferson-Huguenot-Wythe High School to the Group AAA

<HEADLINE> South Korean Chaebol Figure Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Lee Ik-chi once drew praise as the  
patriotic savior of South Korea's depressed stock market. Today, 
the chairman of the nation's largest conglomerate is under scrutiny 
in a stock price-manipulation scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, the 55-year-old chairman of Hyundai Securities Co., a unit  
of the Hyundai group, was questioned by prosecutors Tuesday amid 
allegations he boosted the price of the stock in another Hyundai 
unit through illegal trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee has not been charged with any crime, and Hyundai Securities  
has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Many say Lee's fate personifies the uncertain future of the  
nation's family-owned conglomerates, or chaebol. President Kim 
Dae-jung is pushing them to restructure by shedding money-losing 
subsidiaries and lowering debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate reforms also were a condition for the $58 billion  
bailout package set up by the International Monetary Fund to help 
South Korea at the height of the Asian currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee was hailed as the man who spurred the revival of South  
Korea's shaken economy with his successful launch of a ``Buy 
Korea'' fund in March that has drawn 11 trillion won ($9.2 
billion). His efforts helped boost stock prices more than 40 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund's TV advertisement repeatedly reminded potential  
investors that the entire South Korean stock value was lower than 
that for Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. It appealed 
emotionally to investors whose pride was pummeled when South 
Korea's economy tumbled in late 1997, forcing the government to 
turn to the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed ``Bulldozer'' by friends and colleagues, Lee learned  
his aggressive management style from Chung Ju-yung, founder and 
honorary chairman of the Hyundai group, while working as his chief 
secretary for years. He names Chung as the person he respects most. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Lee's leadership, Hyundai Securities grabbed the  
securities industry's top rank in sales this year. Lee's seminars 
and lectures were flooded by home makers and other investors. 
</P>
<P>
	But last week, prosecutors alleged Lee masterminded a scheme in  
which he used 220 billion won ($183 million) in funds from two 
Hyundai subsidiaries -- Hyundai Heavy Industry Co. and Hyundai 
Merchant Marine Co. -- to boost Hyundai Electronics Industries Co. 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee and other Hyundai officials allegedly used several bank  
accounts opened under fake or borrowed names to place false orders 
to buy Hyundai Electronics Industries stocks at inflated prices, 
thereby attracting innocent investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Between May and November last year, the stock price of Hyundai  
Electronics Industries Co. more than doubled to 32,000 won 
($26.70). 
</P>
<P>
	Conviction of stock price manipulation is punishable by a prison  
term of up to 10 years and a heavy fine.

	CBS and Viacom To Merge  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. today announced an  
agreement to merge in the biggest media deal ever. The union will 
create a media and entertainment conglomerate with a top TV 
network, movie studio and several cable channels. Viacom chairman 
Sumner Redstone will be chairman and chief executive of the new 
company, which will keep the Viacom name. CBS president Mel 
Karmazin will be president and chief operating officer. The deal, 
which the companies described as a merger of equals and not an 
acquisition, will create an enterprise with a market capitalization 
of $80 billion. The new Viacom will be a media powerhouse owning 
the CBS network, several major cable networks -- including MTV, VH1 
and Nickelodeon -- along with film studio Paramount Pictures.

	East Timor Rebel Leader Freed  
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia freed an East Timorese rebel leader today after seven  
years of detention, It is hoped that the move may help calm the 
desperate situation in his native half-island territory after it 
voted for independence. However, with pro-Indonesian militias on a 
killing and burning rampage in East Timor, it may be too dangerous 
for Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao -- sometimes called the Nelson 
Mandela of East Timor and widely expected to become its first 
president -- to even set foot in his homeland for now. Gusmao will 
take up residence in the British Embassy in Jakarta until he 
decides on his next move, said British Ambassador Robin 
Christopher.

<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Two weeks before the Kosovo  
Liberation Army is to demilitarize, international officials and 
leaders of the former rebel army have agreed on the broad outlines 
of an armed force to replace it. But the plan could derail at the 
United Nations, where the Russians and others object to giving such 
a prominent role to the former guerrillas, in part because of fears 
for the safety of non-Albanian minorities. There also are concerns 
that KLA commanders are looking to use a small, approved security 
force as the basis for an army for the independent state they seek.

	BUXTON, N.C. (AP) -- It didn't take long for Gov. Jim Hunt to  
assess the impact of Dennis on North Carolina's coast: Preliminary 
damage estimates are more than $43 million. Dennis weakened from a 
hurricane to a tropical depression, but its remnants continued to 
cause severe weather, soaking parts of Virginia yesterday with more 
than an inch of rain per hour. Severe flooding was reported in some 
areas; Brunswick County on the North Carolina line postponed

Lebanon today, hitting an area on the northeastern corner of the 
country near the Syrian border, security officials said. The jets 
fired two air-to-surface missiles on a hill near the village of 
Chouwaghir about four miles from the Syrian border, the officials

was not clear what prompted the attack or what its target was. 
Local residents said the area used to be a guerrilla camp but had

allowing Islamic militants to advance into the southern republic of 
Dagestan. The militants, seeking an independent Islamic state, have 
battled Russian troops since crossing from breakaway Chechnya and 
seizing several villages in Dagestan on Aug. 7. Government troops 
managed to drive them back to Chechnya after more than two weeks of 
heavy fighting, but rebels have struck back in other regions.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Hires Delta Exec As CFO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com Inc. named a top Delta Air Lines  
executive as its new chief financial officer, the Internet 
merchant's second big hire in a week as it aggressively builds its 
management ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren Jenson, who had been executive vice president and CFO at  
Atlanta-based Delta, succeeds Joy Covey, who is now serving as 
Amazon.com's chief strategy officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenson's appointment, which was announced Tuesday, comes just  
days after Amazon.com named Allied Signal executive Jeffrey Wilke 
as its head of logistics. He will oversee the Seattle-based 
company's ambitious plan to expand its shipping and distribution 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Amazon.com wooed former Black &AMP; Decker executive Joe  
Galli to be its president. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of those rare opportunities -- once in a generation  
-- to play in a field where history will be made,'' Jenson said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to joining Delta, Jenson was CFO at NBC, a division of  
General Electric. He also was a manager of mergers and acquisitions 
and director of investor relations at GE. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com is the biggest seller of books, videos and music on  
the Internet. It also offers auctions, toys and electronics on its 
Web site.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Columbia/HCA Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a  
shareholders lawsuit filed against current and former Columbia/HCA 
Healthcare Corp. executives on behalf of New York's $90 billion 
pension fund. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen other plaintiffs, including California's $120  
billion pension fund, had been added to the August 1997 lawsuit 
alleging that mismanagement by Columbia executives devalued their 
stock holdings in the nation's largest hospital company. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1997, U.S. District Judge Thomas Higgins ordered all  
the shareholder lawsuits consolidated into one. Twelve were filed 
by retirement funds that managed more than $380 billion and owned 
about 15.3 million Columbia shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a magistrate judge recommended dismissing the  
consolidated lawsuit because plaintiffs had made no demands on the 
corporation before filing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Higgins agreed Tuesday, saying ``there was an unseemly rush to  
the courthouse to litigate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York Comptroller H. Carl McCall will decide later whether to  
appeal, said his spokeswoman Theresa Bourgeois. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously he's disappointed in the decision for the nearly 1  
million members of the common retirement fund, as well as the other 
plaintiffs and shareholders,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia officials were pleased with Higgins' decision. Senior  
Vice President Vic Campbell said in an internal memo it ``moves the 
process of resolving these issues forward and is very positive for 
the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nashville-based company has been the target of a federal  
billing fraud investigation for more than two years.

<HEADLINE> Jim Brown's Defense Rests in Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jim Brown's defense rested its case Tuesday  
without calling the football Hall of Famer to the stand in his 
domestic violence prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown told reporters outside the courtroom that he saw no need  
to add his voice to the many who have testified about the dispute 
between him and his wife, Monique, which led to his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time, I don't think there's anything I could say,''  
Brown commented. ``The prosecution hasn't been able to prove 
anything and this case doesn't really involve me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Brown, 63, on June 15 after his 25-year-old wife  
called 911 following an argument with her husband at their 
Hollywood Hills home. She later denied she was ever in danger or 
threatened by her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	The city attorney's domestic violence unit decided to go ahead  
and prosecute Brown. Brown is on trial in Hollywood Municipal Court 
on one count of making terrorist threats and one count of 
vandalism, both misdemeanors. He could face 18 months in jail if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The final defense witness was a psychiatrist who reiterated her  
findings that Monique Brown suffered from fears of abandonment and 
``a borderline personality disorder,'' which might have prompted 
her to lie about Brown's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final moments of her testimony, Dr. Helene McDonald came  
under fierce questioning by two prosecutors who suggested she had 
never fully evaluated Monique Brown's credibility and accepted 
everything she said on its face. 
</P>
<P>
	She acknowledged that she did not consult others about Monique  
Brown's story nor did she talk to officers who interviewed her on 
the night of the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said she believed Monique Brown, who told her during  
their interviews that she had lied to police about her husband's 
alleged threats to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Monique Brown might have lied to the doctor and on the  
witness stand because she feared the consequences of her actions, 
the doctor replied, ``It's possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And isn't it possible she didn't want to tell the truth  
because she still lives with her husband?'' asked the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's possible,'' McDonald said.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked if she was trying to figure out at any point if Monique  
Brown was telling the truth, the witness replied, ```I was not 
there to be a human lie detector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On rebuttal, the prosecution recalled police Detective Dennis  
O'Neal who recounted his interview with Brown's 17-year-old 
daughter, Kimberly, who was at home during the altercation. 
</P>
<P>
	``She observed Mr. Brown breaking the windows of the car in the  
garage,'' O'Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said she also said that she saw another person standing in  
the garage with Brown and believed it was his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments before, the detective said Kimberly told of hearing an  
argument between the couple about whether each was having an 
extramarital affair. He said that at some point, Brown told his 
wife to leave the house, according to the daughter, and then went 
to the garage and began breaking the car windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides said they would offer no further evidence and jurors  
were told to return Wednesday to hear closing arguments and hear 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, Brown berated the city attorney's office for  
pursuing the case saying they had a vendetta against him and were 
``trying to bring this Jim Brown person to his knees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how his wife felt about having her personal life dissected  
in the news media, he said, ``She's strong and we're strong and 
we're together and I feel great about her.''

<HEADLINE> Iowa House Explosion Is Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHLAND, Iowa (AP) -- Jerry Usovsky spent years building and  
refurbishing his dream home, a one-story brick structure he shared 
with his wife and two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	He carefully landscaped the yard with evergreens. There was a  
swing set in the backyard. And inside, the kitchen featured glass 
shelves suspended from the ceiling and a Jenn-Air gas grill with an 
open flame. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities now suspect that the liquid propane gas line that  
led into the house may have caused the explosion that killed 
Usovsky's wife, a daughter, and five other people who gathered at 
the home for a party. 
</P>
<P>
	Usovsky, another daughter and four others were injured in the  
blast. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't tell you that is the cause, but that's where the  
investigation is centered,'' Fire Chief Mike Hadley said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The line, buried 4 inches or less beneath the ground, ran from a  
500-gallon tank behind the house. 
</P>
<P>
	The soft copper tubing, about 3/8-inch thick, was punctured by a  
metal post when Usovsky recently built a new pen for the family's 
dog, the fire chief said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was raw LP (liquid propane) coming out of the line,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The break was about 8 1/2 feet from the house. The tank, which  
Hadley said had ``very little fuel'' in it, was not damaged by the 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	State Fire Marshal Roy Marshall said the gas may have leaked  
into the house. 
</P>
<P>
	``It most likely pooled up in the basement, but we're not 100  
percent sure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dog survived the blast and was found huddled near Usovsky,  
Hadley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Reif, one of the first people on the scene after the blast  
Monday afternoon, said Usovsky kept saying, ``The grill. The 
grill,'' before being taken to the burn unit at University 
Hospitals in Iowa City, about 50 miles northeast of Richland. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said it would take several days to identify the  
victims, but family members said Juanita Usovsky, 38, Jerry's wife, 
and their daughter, Ashley Usovsky, 6, were killed, along with Mrs. 
Usovsky's parents, two of her sisters and a brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	Usovsky, his other daughter, Marlena, 8, and four others were  
being treated at the burn unit at University Hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	A community vigil was scheduled for tonight at a downtown park,  
Mayor Byron Kimble said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would certainly help the healing for the community,''  
Kimble said. ``It has just stunned the community. It just 
devastated everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the victims were found in the basement and a seventh was  
found outside the structure, Sheriff Ron George said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the survivors, Usovsky was in serious condition; his  
daughter was in good condition; and the conditions of the other 
four ranged from critical to good.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Belgian Farmer Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union Commission on  
Tuesday approved a Belgian government plan to provide discounted 
loans to farmers and food companies that suffered from the recent 
dioxin food crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgian banks will lend up to 620 million euros ($650 million)  
and the debt will be guaranteed by the government and the banks. 
The banks are also offering the loans at very favorable rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eligibility is restricted to undertakings that are basically  
sound and viable but have experienced large declines in sales in 
June and July,'' the Commission said. The Commission said that 
companies must have seen a drop in sales of 25 percent over the two 
months, or 40 percent in a single month, to qualify for the loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium was hit by dioxin pollution fears in May when the  
government announced that excessive levels of the cancer-causing 
chemical had been discovered in eggs, meat and dairy products. 
</P>
<P>
	The crisis led to a wide range of products being pulled from  
supermarket shelves, causing the biggest food safety scandal in 
Europe since the 1996 British ``mad cow'' disease crisis. Belgian 
food products were taken off the shelves around the world and 
Belgian products continue to suffer from an image problem.

<HEADLINE>  Nebraska's Crouch Is Not a Quitter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Eric Crouch heard the rumors that he was  
quitting Nebraska's football team because he wasn't named the 
starting quarterback. He heard he would transfer to play at another 
school, or maybe stop playing altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	They were all wrong, Crouch said Tuesday. Crouch said he never  
went to or called coach Frank Solich to say he was leaving the 
team, but did admit to being disappointed at losing the starting 
job to Bobby Newcombe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very emotional time,'' Crouch said.  
</P>
<P>
	There was no list of transfer possibilities, he said. He was  
staying in Lincoln, but did have to work through his disappointment 
over being a backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Crouch, who capped off a tumultuous week with three touchdowns  
in the No. 5 Cornhuskers' 42-7 victory over Iowa on Saturday, said 
he went home to southwest Omaha after Solich told him Newcombe was 
the starter. But it's only a 45-mile trip, Crouch said, and it's 
one he makes often. He wasn't going home to consider his options. 
</P>
<P>
	Crouch said he was ready to clear the air on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``When rumors get started, people tend to start believing what  
was said,'' Crouch said. ``It was just a bigger case this time. You 
have to acquire a thick skin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crouch and Newcombe were both effective on Saturday and Solich  
said fans can expect to see more of the same Saturday when Nebraska 
plays its home opener against California (1-0). Solich won't set a 
schedule for how many series each will play, but said Newcombe and 
Crouch will continue to see time in each half. 
</P>
<P>
	Having a fresh Newcombe or Crouch was effective against Iowa.  
Crouch scored the first touchdown on a 28-yard run and added two 
more in the second half. Newcombe rushed for two and threw for one, 
leaving Solich perfectly content with a tag-team quarterback 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``For him to run for those touchdowns really lifted a lot of  
pressure off of me and our team,'' Newcombe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their teammates also aren't concerned about which one of them is  
taking the snaps. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were times during the game when I would be split out and  
wouldn't know who was in at quarterback,'' split end Matt Davison 
said. ``We all have confidence in both of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of us,'' Crouch said, ``are very encouraging to each  
other. In this system, both quarterbacks are going to see a lot of 
time.''

have to acquire a thick skin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crouch and Newcombe were both effective on Saturday and Solich  
said fans can expect to see more of the same Saturday when Nebraska 
plays its home opener against California (1-0). Solich won't set a 
schedule for how many series each will play, but said Newcombe and 
Crouch will continue to see time in each half. 
</P>
<P>
	Having a fresh Newcombe or Crouch was effective against Iowa.  
Crouch scored the first touchdown on a 28-yard run and added two 
more in the second half. Newcombe rushed for two and threw for one, 
leaving Solich perfectly content with a tag-team quarterback 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``For him to run for those touchdowns really lifted a lot of  
pressure off of me and our team,'' Newcombe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their teammates also aren't concerned about which one of them is  
taking the snaps. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were times during the game when I would be split out and  
wouldn't know who was in at quarterback,'' split end Matt Davison 
said. ``We all have confidence in both of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of us,'' Crouch said, ``are very encouraging to each  
other. In this system, both quarterbacks are going to see a lot of 
time.''

<HEADLINE> Discount Tags on Shoppers Key Rings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- If a new trend in shopper discount cards  
continues, wallets could get thinner while key chains get fatter. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers from supermarkets like Malvern, Pa.-based Acme Markets  
Inc. to San Diego's PETCO Animal Supplies Inc., have shrunk their 
frequent-shopper discount cards this year to tags that fit on a key 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the cards, the tags have bar codes that are scanned when  
purchases are rung up. Frequent shoppers get discounts and special 
promotions tailored to their tastes, while stores get an up-to-date 
computer record of who buys what, when, and in what quantities. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoppers are lining their key rings with the bar code tags, not  
only showing their frequent buyer status at various stores but also 
their video-store and fitness-center memberships, National Retail 
Federation spokesman Scott Krugman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very easy to get to, it's convenient to use, there is no  
coupon-cutting,'' Krugman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Acme introduced the key-chain tags earlier this year, spokesman  
Walt Rubel said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are very popular,'' Rubel said, though he said the  
company would not reveal the number of tags in use. ``The feedback 
from the stores is that the customers like them. My wife thinks 
they are the best thing we've ever done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Pittsburgh-based Giant Eagle supermarket chain  
have test-marketed the key-chain tags in Ohio and in the Erie and 
Pittsburgh areas in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Faccenda, the chain's senior vice president, said  
customers like the tags and more than 1 million have been 
distributed to Giant Eagle's most frequent shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
	The tags are equally popular with customers of smaller  
retailers, said Bob Tate, owner of the 23,000-square-foot Tate's 
grocery near Drake University in Des Moines. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Tate said he already knew fraternity houses in the  
area were good customers, but the popularity of his ``Preferred 
Perks'' program, using the key-chain tags, helps him track other 
key shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
	The tags are just the latest advance in the use of scanning  
technology that allows a computer to read bars and numbers and add 
up a bill, while tracking inventory and the buying habits of 
customers to provide instant marketing information, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``About 30 percent of my customer base represents about 70  
percent of my sales. Without a loyalty marketing program you 
wouldn't really know who these people were,'' Tate said. ``What we 
are doing is taking the technology of scanning and instead of 
tracking product movement we are tracking customer movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tate said he has built up an active database of 12,000 to 13,000  
customers carrying the Preferred Perks tags. 
</P>
<P>
	At the other end of the scale, the 480-store PETCO Animal  
Supplies Inc. chain has more than 5 million participants in its 
PALS program, which stands for PETCO Animal Lovers Save, spokesman 
Don Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The system enables PETCO to track inventory and target  
promotions. For example, the company would not waste money sending 
cat food promotions to customers who primarily buy dog food week in 
and week out. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers of the pet food and supply stores like the tags that  
go on their key chains because ``they usually have that, where they 
may not carry all the cards they have,'' Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have one from PETCO, two from the grocery store and one from  
the video store,'' Cowan said. ``It beats carrying the cards. Most 
people have their keys with them.''

<HEADLINE> Colts Start Political Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts have become the first  
NFL team to start its own political-action committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last couple of years have made us sensitive to the need to  
become politically involved at all levels,'' lobbyist-lawyer Daniel 
Seitz said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indy Colts PAC registered with the Federal Election  
Commission in August as well as with Indiana officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to be a PAC of significance,'' Seitz said.  
``We became organized because we felt certain needs to be 
politically involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee was formed after the team found itself  
unexpectedly fending off a bill in the state legislature that 
defined as a public subsidy playing in a state-funded sports 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``That one serious battle in the Indiana legislature educated  
the management of the Colts that politics can affect our 
business,'' team lawyer Dan Luther said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been focused at the local level, and felt the need to  
follow what was happening on the state level. The NFL has been 
watching out for the league's interests in Washington,'' Seitz 
said. ``We've been organized as a grass-roots group to keep our 
hand in what is pending in Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seitz said he had no idea Indianapolis was the first NFL team to  
organize a federal PAC and has no goal of becoming a major new 
source of campaign contributions for congressional candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Luther said the Colts are concerned with several matters pending  
before Congress, including workers compensation laws and an 
antitrust bill sponsored by Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Orrin 
Hatch, R-Utah, and strongly opposed by the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd much rather be first in our division than be the first to  
create a PAC,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts haven't led their division since 1987 and had a  
league-worst 3-13 record the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no political aspiration personally,'' owner Jim Isray  
said in The Indianapolis Star on Tuesday. ``What I want to do is to 
promote responsible and responsive government by getting the best 
individuals elected.''

<HEADLINE> Floyd, Lee Rejoin Marlins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Outfielder Cliff Floyd and first baseman Derrek Lee  
rejoined the Florida Marlins on Tuesday and will try to finish 
disappointing seasons on a positive note. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was recalled from a rehabilitation assignment at Triple-A  
Calgary. He had been on the disabled list since June 21 -- his 
second stint on the DL this year -- because of knee and Achilles' 
tendon injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee was recalled from Calgary, where he was demoted May 29. At  
the time, Lee's .190 batting average was the lowest of any regular 
in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins also recalled left-handed reliever Brent Billingsley  
from Calgary. They purchased the contracts of catcher John Roskos 
and right-hander Reid Cornelius from Calgary 
</P>
<P>
	Florida recalled the options of left-hander Michael Tejera and  
right-hander Hector Almonte from Double-A Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitchers Alex Fernandez and Joe Fontenot were placed on the  
60-day disabled list. Fernandez agreed Saturday to skip his final 
four starts and avoid an injury that would tarnish his comeback 
from shoulder surgery.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Offer Elderly Free Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney Cheryl Chapman says she does some of  
her most rewarding work for free. She helps old people write wills, 
get government benefits and avoid losing their homes over financial 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapman is one of many Washington lawyers who donate their  
services to low-income older people through a nonprofit group 
called Legal Counsel for the Elderly. An affiliate of the AARP 
Foundation, the organization refers about 400 cases a year to 
volunteer lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a need ... for counsel willing to negotiate people  
through the maze of life,'' Chapman said. ``I get a reward in 
knowing a client feels they have put their affairs in order, that 
somebody is going to receive what they have spent a lifetime 
working for, even if it is very modest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers help low-income old people resolve landlord-tenant  
problems, work out disputes over government benefits or appoint 
someone to make health-care decisions if they become incapacitated. 
Rarely does a case wind up in a court trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not talking about class-action discrimination cases,  
we're talking about Mrs. Jones' Social Security,'' said lawyer 
Steven Schneebaum. 
</P>
<P>
	He told of helping a retired hot dog vendor resolve a classic  
Catch-22. The man wanted to go back to work, but the government 
wouldn't reinstate his vending license because he owed back sales 
taxes. The man could only pay off the taxes by going back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took one or two letters and one or two phone calls, and we  
got him his license with an agreement that he would pay back his 
tax deficit over time,'' said Schneebaum. ``An elderly citizen who 
doesn't have the vocabulary down is going to have a harder time 
than I am'' in resolving such problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Converse, who was honored in June by the District of  
Columbia Bar Association for his volunteer legal work, helped a 
woman who got into financial trouble after lenders talked her into 
an expensive home mortgage and four refinancings over a two-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was so unsophisticated she could not explain to me why she  
had done what she did,'' Converse said. ``If you don't have a 
lawyer, what happens is they foreclose on you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He took her case against two lenders to trial and won a  
generally favorable ruling, which now is being appealed by the 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal Counsel for the Elderly has what executive director Wayne  
Moore calls a ``low pressure'' method of lining up volunteer 
lawyers. Staffers write brief descriptions of about a dozen cases a 
week and fax them to hundreds of attorneys who have signed up for 
the program, as well as many who have not. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they see a case they like, they call us,'' Moore said. The  
program, which began as a demonstration project in the late 1970s, 
also monitors how cases are handled. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the volunteers are retired lawyers, said Richard B.  
Treanor, chairman of the group's executive committee. ``It's sort 
of a natural fit for older lawyers to get involved,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The program helps people over 60 whose income is no more than  
150 percent above poverty level. The program has a hotline and 
receives referrals from government and social service agencies. 
Much of the legal work also is done by attorneys on the 
organization's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always ask, 'Do you have a will?''' said Annie Ponds, a  
volunteer paralegal assistant who is a community representative on 
the organization's board. ``Many people do not have wills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others are confronted by eviction notices and worry about having  
to move. ``That is a real fear for these elderly people,'' Ponds 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	People are routinely asked about government benefits they may be  
eligible to receive, such as disability payments and food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is extremely important for them to know there is someone at  
Legal Counsel for the Elderly who will speak for them and see that 
they get the services they need,'' Pond said. If not, ``they just 
go from bad to worse.''

<HEADLINE> Yashin Upset Over Contract Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Alexei Yashin says he will fly to  
Switzerland on Wednesday because he is disillusioned over his 
contract dispute with the Ottawa Senators. 
</P>
<P>
	The club captain complains that the Senators' management has  
turned the dispute into a personal issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone just doesn't want me to play in Ottawa,'' Yashin told  
the Ottawa Citizen. ``Now, it's not just a business decision. I 
guess I'll be (in Switzerland) until they make a decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin was suspended over the weekend by general manager  
Marshall Johnston. Suspending players under contract who fail to 
appear at training camp is a normal course of action, but the team 
went one step further by outlining the 25-year-old Russian star's 
obligations, as the club sees them. The club also threatened to sue 
the center for losses incurred if he misses the season. 
</P>
<P>
	No NHL team has ever taken legal action against a player for  
breach of contract and no player has ever sat out the entire season 
before he was scheduled to become a restricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alexei is basically retiring, and it's because of the whim of  
one person,'' said agent Mark Gandler. 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin has one year at $3.6 million left on his contract, but  
Gandler asked for an extension at $11 million for next season and 
$12 million for 2001-02. 
</P>
<P>
	Training camp opened on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Hilton Hotels To Buy Promus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hilton Hotels Corp. is buying Promus Hotel  
Corp. in a $4 billion stock and cash deal that will create one of 
the nation's biggest lodging chains with more than 1,700 hotels and 
290,000 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced today, gives Hilton a large stake in the  
fast-growing limited-service and all-suites segments of the travel 
market. Promus' interests include Embassy Suites, Doubletree, 
Homewood Suites and Hampton Inn. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies had said last week that they were holding merger  
talks. Hilton had shown interest in buying Promus, but had 
indicated it was too expensive. Promus had $1.1 billion in revenues 
in 1998, with Hilton showing $1.8 billion for the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Hilton will pay $38.50 per share in cash for 55  
percent of the Promus shares. The remaining 45 percent of Promus 
shares will be exchanged for Hilton common stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton estimates that the merger will result in annual operating  
and cost savings of roughly $55 million for the first year, with 
savings estimates of $99 million in following years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton, however, said that costs associated with the deal will  
reduce its earnings in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Directors for both companies have approved the  
agreement and completion of the merger is expected by year-end 
1999. Shareholders of both companies still have to approve the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a transaction that immediately accomplishes our  
longstanding objectives of acquiring outstanding hotel assets, 
leveraging our brands and growing our franchising, management and 
timeshare businesses,'' said Stephen Bollenbach, Hilton president 
and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton has about 275 owned, managed or franchised hotels in  
North America, including its newer mid-priced Hilton Garden Inn 
hotels and Hilton Residential Suites extended-stay hotels. The 
lodging company also has Hilton grand vacation timeshare 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The new corporate headquarters will be in Beverly Hills, Calif.,  
where Hilton is located. The new company will maintain an 
operational presence in Memphis, Tenn., the site of Promus' 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Promus surged nearly 12 percent on the news, jumping  
$3.62 1/2 to $35 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Hilton stock was down 43 3/4 cents, or 4 percent, at $11.37 1/2, also on 
the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> US Delays Decision on E.Timor Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States will not decide whether to  
send forces to East Timor until a United Nations mission returns 
from the island, where anti-independence militia gangs went on a 
weekend rampage, the White House said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.N. team will report back within the next couple of days  
and make an assessment on any potential international peacekeeping 
force, and we'll take a look at that recommendation,'' White House 
spokesman Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once they've made a judgment on that ... we will, as will many  
countries, take a look at whether we participate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Security Council would have to approve a peacekeeping  
force, as would the Indonesian government, which claims East Timor. 
A ``peacekeeping'' force, if sent now, would actually be trying to 
restore order as opposed to keeping it. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the World Bank urged Indonesia to respect its  
commitments to the international community regarding the 
territory's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia is dependent on billions of dollars of international  
aid from the bank, the International Monetary Fund and other donors 
to rescue it from a devastating economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Bank said in a statement that it was ``deeply  
concerned'' by the violence that followed last week's overwhelming 
vote for independence from Indonesia by East Timor's 800,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the Clinton administration said the Indonesian  
government must be prepared to accept an international peacekeeping 
force if it cannot stop the violence by its military and police 
forces in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Either Indonesia has to take care of the situation itself or  
allow the international community to come in,'' Secretary of State 
Madeleine Albright said during a visit to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a weekend of escalating violence against civilians,  
Indonesia imposed martial law in East Timor early today as 
thousands of refugees fled the provincial capital, Dili, and 
anti-independence militias torched homes and reportedly slaughtered 
hundreds of civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said that ``Indonesian military and police forces are allowing, and 
in some cases participating in ... abuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From his Camp David presidential retreat, President Clinton  
discussed the situation Monday morning with Australian Prime 
Minister John Howard, who has offered to send troops as part of a 
peacekeeping contingent. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Clinton spoke with United Nations  
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Annan ``discussed the situation and the president  
expressed support for the secretary-general's helpful engagement on 
this issue,'' presidential spokesman Barry Toiv said. ``They 
discussed ways to encourage Indonesia to do what is required to 
bring security to East Timor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department official added that the maintenance of  
normal relations between Indonesia and the United States ``depends 
on Indonesia adopting a constructive approach toward ending the 
humanitarian disaster in East Timor and supporting the 
U.N.-administered process by which East Timor will become 
independent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What is key now is that the Indonesian government act quickly  
to provide a secure environment in East Timor and meet its 
commitment to carry out the results of the referendum,'' Toiv said. 
``We will continue discussions in the Security Council and with our 
friends in the region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toiv also said the U.N. Security Council was sending a mission  
to the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard, the Australian prime minister, said ``I rang President  
Clinton ... to brief him on my assessment of the present 
situation'' in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I asked him whether the Americans would be willing to  
contribute to any international force. I said there would be a 
strong expectation in Australia that that should be the case. He 
said he would consider that,'' Howard said in an interview with 
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about soldiers participating in the violence against  
people in East Timor, Toiv said that ``the first priority of course 
is to provide a secure environment, and we are still looking to the 
Indonesian government to do that.''

<HEADLINE> Second Amendment Debated in Texas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- A judge's landmark ruling that the Second  
Amendment gives individuals, and not just militias, the right to 
bear arms has touched off a furious debate among constitutional 
scholars that could go all the way to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate began unfolding after Dr. Timothy Joe Emerson of San  
Angelo was arrested and accused of brandishing a handgun in front 
of his wife and her daughter. He was charged with violating a 1994 
federal law that prohibits someone under a restraining order from 
owning a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Sam Cummings dismissed the charges in April,  
declaring the law unconstitutional based on a ``historical 
examination of the right to bear arms, from English antecedents to 
the drafting of the Second Amendment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cummings said the right to bear arms is a protected individual  
right -- and not just a right belonging to a militia, as federal 
prosecutors had argued. 
</P>
<P>
	It is believed to the first decision in which a judge  
specifically called a law unconstitutional because it infringed on 
an individual's Second Amendment rights. The law was part of the 
Violence Against Women Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the ruling came down, gun-control opponents inundated the  
judge with scholarly treatises encouraging him to strike down the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, 52 legal scholars who support gun control filed a  
brief denouncing Cummings' interpretation of the Second Amendment, 
which reads: ``A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the 
security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear 
arms, shall not be infringed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That decision and the opinion were a major shot across the  
bow,'' said Bruce Hay, a Harvard law professor who signed the 
brief. ``For the most part, federal courts have taken a hands-off 
approach to federal statutes regulating use of guns. This is the 
first decision to say the Second Amendment prohibits Congress from 
imposing special laws concerning gun ownership. That is why his 
decision is so worrisome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scholars say the decision sets the stage for the challenge of  
almost any law abridging an individual's right to possess a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are appealing to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ``glossed over case law and relied primarily on  
historical analysis, and it's important for courts to follow the 
decisions made by courts before them,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney 
Bill Mateja said. 
</P>
<P>
	The stakes are high.  
</P>
<P>
	``Growing public sentiment for a final decision on the issue is  
high because of school shootings and office shootings,'' said David 
Yassky, a Brooklyn Law School professor who wrote the brief. ``The 
time is right for a serious decision to be made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brief accuses the judge of misinterpreting the Second  
Amendment, which Yassky writes was meant to ``preserve organized, 
state-based militias,'' and not intended to ``empower individuals 
or small groups of disaffected citizens to take up arms against the 
established order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yassky said the vast majority of legal scholars believe the  
Second Amendment was intended to protect states' militias from the 
new central government created by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Powe, a constitutional law professor at the University of  
Texas, disputed Yassky's position, and charged that only three of 
the co-signers of the brief were ``serious'' constitutional law 
scholars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The brief is seeking to suck the meaning out of the words `the  
right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be 
infringed,''' Powe said. ``The meaning is clear. It couldn't be 
more clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Manown, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association, said  
most Americans support the ``traditional understanding'' of the 
Second Amendment as guaranteeing the individual's right to bear 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The road to the Supreme Court is a long one, but the interest  
this has generated and the fact that it is being appealed will only 
mean the importance of this case will be heightened,'' Manown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Hwa, a spokeswoman for the Center to Prevent Handgun  
Violence, denounced the judge's ruling as ``a renegade decision 
that the gun lobby is trying to hide behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But this time, the gun lobby won't be able to hide. Scholars  
are stepping forward to make sure the reality of the Second 
Amendment is clear,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	One expert who does not fit easily into either camp is Laurence  
Tribe, the liberal Harvard law professor. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribe's recently published text, ``American Constitutional  
Law,'' concludes that the Second Amendment assures that ``the 
federal government may not disarm individual citizens without some 
unusually strong justification.'' His position has provoked 
gun-control advocates, and he says he has received ``an avalanche 
of angry mail from apparent liberals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he also does not agree with Cummings' ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	``Judge Cummings went too far with his decision, saying that  
Congress cannot define categories of people to whom it would be 
dangerous to allow to bear arms,'' he said. ``The Second Amendment 
provides individual right, but not an unbounded right.''

<HEADLINE> Art Schlichter Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANDERSON, Ind. (AP) -- Former NFL quarterback Art Schlichter's  
gambling addiction could send him back to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Released last week after serving less than half of a four-year  
sentence, Schlichter pleaded innocent Tuesday to new charges that 
he used prison pay phones to bet on football and hockey games 
through a Las Vegas bookmaker last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter was incarcerated at the time at the Correctional  
Industrial Facility in Pendleton. He was transferred to another 
state prison in Plainfield after prosecutor Rodney Cummings issued 
warrants on four misdemeanor counts of illegal gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was an additional count of check deception from an  
incident in 1995 that had been pending,'' Cummings said Tuesday 
after the initial hearing in Anderson City Court. ``I suspect it 
was because he was incarcerated, so there are five counts, not just 
the four for unlawful gambling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A trial date of Nov. 17 was set.  
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter admitted to an Indiana State police investigator that  
he ``had a relapse and needed help,'' according to a report 
published Aug. 26 in the Herald Bulletin of Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter, who won early release by earning two college degrees  
behind bars through Ball State University, avoided transfer to the 
Madison County Jail by posting $5,000 bond, Cummings said. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge of check deception carries a maximum sentence of one  
year. Each of the four gambling charges could add 180 days. If 
convicted, Schlichter could be ordered to serve consecutive 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Schlichter was sentenced to four years in prison on  
charges of theft, forgery and fraud in connection with the theft of 
$800,000 to support his gambling habit. Before beginning his 
Indiana prison term, Schlichter served a federal sentence in 
Kentucky for a probation violation. He surrendered to Indiana 
authorities Jan. 26, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter, a first-round draft pick out of Ohio State by the  
then-Baltimore Colts in 1981, was suspended by the NFL in 1983 when 
it was learned that bookies had threatened him over $150,000 in 
gambling debts. Schlichter returned in 1984 to the Colts, who by 
then had relocated to Indianapolis, and was released following the 
1985 season.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Pack Research Into Movie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the Smithsonian Institution and the IMAX  
Corp. got together to make a movie about the Galapagos Islands, 
they decided to use real scientists on screen. It turns out you 
just can't plunk down scientists on exotic islands and expect them 
to concentrate on filmmaking. 
</P>
<P>
	They squeezed in enough research to discover more than a dozen  
new marine species during the 14 weeks of filming. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to get funding to do a lot of general  
biological exploration, so taking advantage of these film 
opportunities when they come along is a great way to get that,'' 
explained marine biologist Carole Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Galapagos,'' the new 3-D film focusing on the unusual wildlife  
on and around the Pacific island group west of Ecuador, will have 
its world premiere Oct. 27 at the Smithsonian's National Museum of 
Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
	The film follows Baldwin's explorations in the sea surrounding  
the 19 islands and also visits the rare and unusual land animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I was chosen because I had never been there, and they  
wanted a scientist with fresh eyes, someone the audience could 
follow. It was fantastic,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She called the three-dimensional result shown on a giant screen  
great. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing missing in the theater is the cold and wet,''  
she said. ``Otherwise, you're there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Baldwin didn't settle for just making a movie.  
</P>
<P>
	``My goal was science. The filmmaker's goal was certainly to  
make a film. The film was being funded by the Smithsonian 
Institution and IMAX, so the idea was to make the film about 
research,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	So, research she did.  
</P>
<P>
	``We still don't know exactly how many new species we have,''  
she said. The scientists, now back at the museum, must take each of 
the new finds and compare it with thousands of others in the 
Smithsonian collection to verify it was not previously known. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say its like dozens'' of new finds, she added.  
</P>
<P>
	The researchers used a submersible vessel to study the largely  
unexplored waters between 200 feet and 1,000 feet deep. The area is 
too deep for scuba diving, and previous studies using submersibles 
concentrated on deeper waters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finding a dozen new vertebrate species in that length of time  
is almost unheard of,'' she said. ``But the deep sea is so 
unexplored its not uncommon to find new things every time you go 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers and film crews stayed 14 weeks in the Galapagos with  
the only two IMAX 3-D cameras in the world. They visited more than 
80 locations, including dives in the four-person submersible. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Baldwin's discoveries: anthiine bass, a new type of sea  
bass; an unusual wrasse, a small striped fish that cleans larger 
fish, from about 400 feet down; a new cat shark; and several new 
scorpion fish. 
</P>
<P>
	Baldwin concentrates on fish, but other researchers turned up  
new types of sponges, urchins and gastropod mollusks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new species will be added to the Natural History Museum's 8  
million-specimen collection of preserved fish as well as to the 
collections of the Charles Darwin Research Station in the 
Galapagos, the California Academy of Sciences and the Ecuadorian 
Navy Oceanographic Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Located on the equator 600 miles west of South America, the  
Galapagos have been called the laboratory of evolution, its strange 
plants and animals the inspiration for Charles Darwin's theories 
that became known as Darwinism. 
</P>
<P>
	The new film is to run four times daily on the giant IMAX screen  
at the National Museum of Natural History. It will be the first 
regular giant-screen 3-D film shown at the museum. Later it will 
tour other IMAX theaters around the world.

<HEADLINE> Again, Reno Didn't Get Word </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno is frustrated --  
not to say angry -- at what she wasn't told, again. This time the 
problem is what she didn't know, and the FBI didn't tell, about the 
raid on the Branch Davidian cult compound near Waco six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to say angry because she avoids the word, even though people  
keep not telling her things about troublesome cases. 
</P>
<P>
	And Congressional Republicans keep telling her to resign, over  
Waco, over the handling of the nuclear spying investigation and, 
repeatedly, over her refusal to seek an outside prosecutor on 
Democratic, and White House, fund raising for the 1996 presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	She has ordered an independent investigation into the use of  
potentially flammable, military tear gas canisters by the FBI 
before agents moved in to end the 51-day standoff with the Branch 
Davidians in April 1993. The assault ended with the wooden compound 
ablaze, and more than 80 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI says the blaze was not set by the military tear gas  
canisters, and that the cult leaders set the fire themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	But there always have been questions, and conspiracy theories,  
about Waco, and the FBI always has said no potentially incendiary 
devices were used. On their say so, the attorney general said so 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the discovery that the FBI had used flammable  
cartridges tarnished her credibility, that she was upset and 
frustrated. Then she learned that the FBI had discovered tapes of 
an agent getting permission to use the devices, and didn't tell her 
about that for four days. She sent U.S. marshals across the street 
to impound the tapes as evidence in reopened investigations of 
Waco, an extraordinary errand she said later was with FBI 
concurrence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has commented on whether I'm angry or not,'' she  
said Friday. ``I don't think this is a matter of anger -- this is a 
matter of getting to the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A White House spokesman said President Clinton was concerned  
that Reno ``appears to have been misled and may have been lied to'' 
about Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said even if she was, she should  
resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not knowing is not an excuse,'' he said. Gramm said the  
attorney general always seems to be the last to know. Two 
Republican presidential candidates, Steve Forbes and Sen. Orrin 
Hatch of Utah, said they would have fired her by now. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the truth shows that I've done something wrong, then I will  
accept the consequences,'' the attorney general said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls for her resignation date back to the days after the Waco  
episode on April 19, 1993, only five weeks after she became the 
first female attorney general. She said she took complete 
responsibility for the decision to send in federal agents and use 
tear gas to end the siege. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton backed her handling of the case.  
</P>
<P>
	Later, after she'd had four independent counsels appointed to  
investigate top administration officials, there were reports that 
some people in the White House -- never identified -- wanted her out 
of Clinton's second-term Cabinet. She said she'd be honored to 
stay, and Clinton kept her. 
</P>
<P>
	In those days, the independence that irked some of her  
administration colleagues made her a Republican favorite. But not 
when she repeatedly refused to seek independent counsels to 
investigate Democratic fund raising for the 1996 presidential 
campaign. She said the allegations involved did not meet the terms 
of the independent counsel law, which has since expired. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans demanded that she name one or resign.  
</P>
<P>
	In that controversy, in 1997, videotapes of 44 White House  
coffees for Democratic campaign donors turned up, but the Justice 
Department wasn't told until it leaked into print. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was mad,'' Reno said then. But she also said there was  
nothing on the tapes to warrant a special prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI Director Louis Freeh sent her a memo saying he favored an  
independent counsel on campaign fund raising, advice that became 
public just as she was being questioned by Congress about her 
decision to say no. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the  
Senate Intelligence Committee, said she should resign because of 
mishandling of the investigation into alleged Chinese spying at 
U.S. nuclear laboratories. She acknowledged delays, and said she 
had not been told of an internal decision in 1997 against FBI 
electronic surveillance of a man suspected of nuclear spying. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Waco, and again, FBI information she didn't get. For all of  
it, she insists that she and Freeh, who came to his job after Waco, 
are not at odds. 
</P>
<P>
	She said they have one of the best relationships anyone could  
have in law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	If theirs is among the best, bad ones must really be ugly.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rabbi Pleads Guilty to Fraud Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A rabbi charged with smuggling drugs into a  
federal prison where he was chaplain to Jewish inmates pleaded 
guilty Tuesday to a lesser charge that could put him behind bars 
for less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Eli Gottesman, 74, could have gotten up to 20 years and a  
$250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the  
government by bringing into the prison items such as Stars of 
David, clothing, watches and food. Sentencing was set for Jan. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Gottesman was accused of trying to smuggle a shampoo bottle  
filled with cocaine and marijuana encased in balloons into the 
prison at Ray Brook, in the Adirondack Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rapid-fire but rambling 20-minute explanation in court,  
Gottesman said the bottle was sent to him and he knew nothing about 
drugs inside it. 
</P>
<P>
	``God's ways are very mysterious,'' he told reporters, peppering  
his statement with references to Moses. ``Why did this happen? I 
don't know why this happened. Things have happened to greater 
people than me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gottesman provided religious services to Jewish inmates, and  
also worked as a chaplain at five state prisons in New York.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Brushes Mexican Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico (AP) -- Hurricane Greg weakened to a  
tropical storm as it brushed the tip of Mexico's Baja California 
Tuesday, causing heavy rain, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of 
residents and stranding frustrated American tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	Flood waters rose thigh-deep at crossroads outside of Cabo San  
Lucas, flooding some buildings. Army jeeps carried local residents 
across the flooded area to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	But tourist cafes reopened their doors and residents began to  
return to their rain-soaked homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hurricane? What hurricane? I didn't know about it,'' said Lisa  
Enger, a sales representative from Phoenix, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 p.m. EDT, Greg's center was located just off the Baja coast  
northwest of Cabo San Lucas, creeping slowly northwestward. The 
U.S. Hurricane Center in Miami said Greg's sustained winds had 
fallen to about 55 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mainland states of Jalisco, Nayarit, Colima and Sinaloa,  
floods caused by storms associated with Greg over the weekend began 
to recede Tuesday. In Jalisco, hundreds of people who evacuated 
their homes began returning Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Though tropical storm warnings remained in effect in the area,  
local officials were relieved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the greatest danger has already passed,'' said  
Jorge Maraver, an official with the Cabo San Lucas Civil Protection 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Merchants had taped their store windows to strengthen them  
against winds, and people have stocked up on bottled water and 
gasoline in case flooding cut pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
	As the center of the storm approached, the only damage reported  
was in the poor neighborhoods tucked in the sandy folds of the 
desert a few miles from the ritzy hotels of this popular fishing 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,000 people took refuge overnight in Cabo San Lucas and  
nearby San Jose del Cabo, civil defense agencies reported. 
</P>
<P>
	But nearly all of the people went home in the morning.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes I'm worried, but I stayed here last night and the water  
didn't reach my house,'' said Gloria Nava, whose tiny cinderblock 
home is only 10 yards from a stream. Local officials had put a 
sticker on the house declaring it a ``high-risk site.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers urged Nava and her two children to go to a shelter, but  
Nava said she would stay put. ``We have our things here, and we 
don't want to go,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the nearby San Jose del Cabo airport, frustrated American  
tourists, many wearing shorts and carrying beach bags, cursed the 
airlines after most flights were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Hauser, a saleswoman from Oklahoma City, was clearly  
disappointed. Asked what she planned to do, she said: ``Sulk in my 
room.''

	FROM THE HELP WANTED WARS: When Inc. magazine held its annual  
small business conference recently, a common complaint among 
participants was how hard it is to find employees. During one 
discussion, one CEO said he had to turn business away because he

another company said he had 50 jobs open at one time and couldn't

	IS THE FREE INTERNET RIDE NEARING AN END?: The Internet has been  
for the most part a smorgasbord of free facts and figures for 
consumers, but they are likely to find themselves paying in the 
future for stock quotes, movie reviews, airline fares and other 
information, according to a study by professors at the University 
of Rochester's William E. Simon Graduate School of Business 
Administration. And Web sites that are now charging for information 
are likely to raise their fees. One of the professors, Rajiv Dewan, 
was quoted by the school's magazine, SimonBusiness, as saying the 
Internet is like an amusement park that charges not only for 
admission, but for tickets to individual rides. Internet access is 
becoming cheaper, but ``more Internet attractions will charge 
higher fees,'' he said.

	LEADERSHIP LACK: Nearly three-quarters of the nation's companies  
are having a difficult time finding qualified leaders, according to 
a survey of managers and employees conducted by the employment 
consultant Development Dimensions International. In the survey 
taken at 52 big U.S. companies, respondents found qualities such as 
innovation, communication, vision and strategic decision-making 
lacking among leaders. The managers themselves said they lacked 
strength in many skills needed for leadership positions. One 
possible reason for the deficit is that many of the executives, 
while thinking about personal and professional development, said 
they're often trying to make themselves more marketable for other 
companies rather than more valuable to their current employers.

<HEADLINE>  Veteran Umpire Rippley May Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- National League umpire Steve Rippley, who is  
contemplating retirement, wasn't at County Stadium on Tuesday night 
as his crew worked a game between the Milwaukee Brewers and the 
Arizona Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley, a 16-year veteran, said Friday he may retire in  
frustration over the dispute between baseball and umpires. He spent 
Tuesday at Graham, N.C., for the funeral of the wife of umpire Drew 
Coble. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Winters, who worked the Brewers' series against the  
Cardinals over the weekend, went to Chicago for the Cubs' series 
with the Reds but was called back to Milwaukee to replace Rippley. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I understand it, he's still contemplating,'' Winters said  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley's crew includes Wally Bell, Hunter Wendelstedt and Jerry  
Meals, who worked home plate Tuesday. Bell, in his seventh season, 
was one of three NL umpires who broke with the union leadership, 
while Meals is in his third NL season and Wendelstedt is among the 
25 newly hired umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley was among the 21 NL umps who resigned and then withdrew  
their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Winters expects to be in Milwaukee for all three games of the  
Brewers' series with the Diamondbacks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rippley called NL senior vice president Katy Feeney on Thursday  
and said he wanted to retire. She told him to think it over, 
Rippley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Rippley spoke with Paul Runge, the league's  
executive director of umpires, who said he should take the weekend 
off, think about his decision and get back to him Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just gets to the point where the whole thing gets to be  
mind-boggling,'' Rippley said then. ``The money is not the issue 
here. It's what they've done and the principle, to see how they 
have been so ruthless, with how they treated the families, just for 
whatever reasons. It's not humane what they've done.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Football Player Steve Little Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Steve Little, who kicked an NCAA  
record-tying 67-yard field goal for Arkansas against rival Texas in 
1977, has died at 43. 
</P>
<P>
	Little, who later played for the St. Louis Cardinals in the NFL,  
was paralyzed from the neck down in a car accident in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	He died around 6:30 a.m. Monday at his home in Little Rock,  
according to his brother, Gene. The cause of death has not been 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it could have been related'' to the accident, Gene  
Little said. ``It probably would have helped if he could have moved 
around. ... It took us all by surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Little came to Arkansas in 1974 from Shawnee Mission South  
High School in Overland Park, Kan., where he was an all-state 
quarterback and defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was an outstanding athlete,'' recalled Arkansas athletic  
director Frank Broyles, who was coach of the Razorbacks at the 
time. ``He could have played quarterback for us, but he had such 
great speed with that (kicking) leg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broyles said Little had been an inspiration to others since his  
accident left him a quadriplegic, displaying a courageous ability 
to cope with adversity. 
</P>
<P>
	Little played for the Razorbacks from 1974 to 1977, lettering in  
each of his four seasons at Fayetteville. He holds the Arkansas 
record for most points kicking in a career with 280. He made 
53-of-89 field goals during his four years and was 7-of-13 on field 
goals of 50 yards or longer. He also made 121 of 131 extra points. 
</P>
<P>
	The 89 field goal attempts is a school record.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1976, he played for the Razorback team that defeated Georgia  
31-10 in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, and in 1978, he was a member of 
the team that beat Oklahoma 31-6 at the Orange Bowl in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	In both of those games, he kicked four PATs, an Arkansas team  
record for bowl games that has since been tied by three others. 
</P>
<P>
	Little was an All-American in 1976 and 1977 and was picked by  
the Razorbacks as a member of the team's all-century squad. 
</P>
<P>
	The 67-yard field goal he kicked against Texas in 1977, in a  
game won by Texas, 13-9 -- matched the NCAA record set by Russell 
Erxleben of the Longhorns.

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads Guilty to Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- For 17 years, Alstory Simon enjoyed his freedom  
while Anthony Porter lived on death row. Now, Simon is finally 
going to prison after admitting it was he, not Porter, who 
committed the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	In a plea bargain reached Tuesday, Simon was sentenced to 37  
years for the 1982 murder of Marilyn Green. He also pleaded guilty 
to voluntary manslaughter in the death of Jerry Hillard and was 
given a 15-year sentence to be served concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter had been convicted and sentenced to death for the  
slayings of Green, 19, and Hillard, 18. However, he was released in 
February after Simon confessed the shootings to a private 
investigator working for a Northwestern University journalism 
class. 
</P>
<P>
	Key witnesses recanted their testimony against Porter during the  
investigation. The private investigator elicited the confession 
from Simon, 49, by using a phony eyewitness account. In the 
confession, Simon said he acted in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
	In court Tuesday, Simon apologized to Green's mother and said he  
had not meant to hurt her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon, a laborer who has lived in Milwaukee since 1982, had no  
connection to Porter. They were simply at the same pool in 
Washington Park on the night of the shootings, said prosecutor 
Thomas Gainer. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon lived in Chicago prior to the shootings and had three  
previous robbery convictions, Gainer said.

<HEADLINE> Manila To Name Those Not Y2K-Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The Philippine government will  
release a list of thousands of companies and agencies that have 
failed to document their readiness for the ``Y2K'' millennium 
computer glitch, a top official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Those that do not provide the information are considered  
unprepared and their names will be published at the end of this 
month, said Amable Aguiluz V, head of the Presidential Commission 
on Year 2000 Compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will publish a category of those offices falling under  
mission-critical sectors that have not given us their Y2K compliant 
status,'' Aguiluz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K commission has already given them warnings, Aguiluz said  
in a radio interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K bug could cause computers set to read only the last two  
digits of a year to malfunction when the calendar changes to 2000. 
If not solved, the problem could cause breakdowns in computers in 
government and private companies. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, fewer than 1,000 of 18,000 companies required to be Y2K  
compliant have disclosed their level of readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to disclose their state of preparations would make  
private and government offices liable for prosecution and 
administrative sanctions, Aguiluz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippine government's Y2K initiative began in June, when  
President Joseph Estrada signed into law the Y2K Readiness Act 
under which mission-critical sectors are required to disclose their 
preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has told employees of Philippine banks, airports,  
power companies and other key industries to stay at work from Dec. 
31 to Jan. 2 to deal with any problems caused by the millennium 
bug.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Recall Two From Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals recalled infielder  
Placido Polanco and right-hander Jose Jimenez from Triple-A Memphis 
on Tuesday and activated right-hander Alan Benes from the 15-day 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Polanco hit .275 with 10 RBIs at Memphis in 29 games. He hit  
.271 with 14 RBIs in 71 games with the Cardinals earlier in the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez was 2-2 with a 3.04 ERA at Memphis and 5-12 with a 5.81  
with the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Benes, who hasn't pitched in the majors since July, 1997 due to  
several shoulder operations, pitched 15 innings in the minors with 
three different teams this season.

<HEADLINE> PBS Explores the U.S.-Mexico Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The scene is familiar to most television  
viewers: Border Patrol agents in their military-green uniforms 
rounding up illegal immigrants trying to enter the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A new PBS documentary, ``The Border,'' focuses on other,  
lesser-known stories of life along the U.S.-Mexico frontier ``to 
present an alternative view of the region,'' according to Paul 
Espinosa, the film's Emmy award-winning executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, because of the sort of the daily grind of news that  
you're all too familiar with, the region tends to get covered in a 
negative way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-hour documentary, which begins airing Wednesday on PBS  
stations (check local listings), examines the area's culture 
through six vignettes of people living in towns along the border. 
</P>
<P>
	With ``20/20'' correspondent John Quinones as host, the  
documentary is a collaboration of five producers working in 
different spots, drawing on each filmmaker's in-depth knowledge. 
Each segment presents a rarely seen slice of life, packing all the 
drama and conflict of a feature film into short, powerful scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	The documentary's strength is in the people featured in each  
story -- their daily struggles captured in their simple but 
heartfelt words and memorable images. 
</P>
<P>
	A segment titled ``Not a Drop to Drink,'' focuses on a Mexican  
family's attempt to make ends meet in a parched area where there is 
no running water. 
</P>
<P>
	Another, ``Winter Texans,'' explores the intertwined lives of  
two very different groups of people -- retirees and migrant farm 
workers -- who migrate south to the Rio Grande Valley of Texas for 
the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the stories in the documentary are about the haves and  
the have-nots, but ultimately, they are stories of people on both 
sides of the border whose faith in the importance of culture and 
heritage helps them bridge the gap. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not meant for scholars. It's meant for people who enjoy a  
good story,'' said Hector Gonzalez of KUAT-TV in Tucson, Ariz., who 
produced one of the segments. 
</P>
<P>
	Espinosa, who has won seven Emmys, has spent much of his career  
focusing on the untold stories of Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in 
documentaries such as ``The U.S.-Mexican War: 1846-1848'' and ``... 
and the earth did not swallow him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I became aware of stories that I thought were untold,  
unrecognized. They were also stories that had a lot to do with 
where I see the future of both the U.S. and Mexico going,'' said 
Espinosa, who grew up in New Mexico and has lived in San Diego for 
about 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	His documentaries are used in universities and high schools  
throughout the United States, and also have been shown in Mexico, 
said Richard Griswold del Castillo, a professor at San Diego State 
University's Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably the most productive and well-known Hispanic  
documentary filmmaker in the United States. I can't think of anyone 
who matches his stature making documentaries about the heritage of 
Mexican-Americans,'' del Castillo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who are in the border region every day believe people  
throughout the United States need to be aware of events there that 
have an impact on the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Border Patrol has long battled a negative image and is  
waging a campaign to inform people on both sides of the border 
about their lesser-known work, such as the hundreds of rescues they 
undertake each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The border is an interesting place both from law enforcement  
perspective and a social perspective,'' said Border Patrol 
spokesman Roy Villareal. ``You could sit at the border and find a 
million different stories to tell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The producers hope the documentary goes beyond simply educating  
the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this doesn't change you or affect you in some way, then we  
really haven't done our job,'' Gonzalez said. ``We need to go out 
there and try harder. That's really what it gets down to.''

<HEADLINE> NASA Makes Water Droplets Findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Tiny water droplets that could be billions of  
years old were found in a meteorite, the second found with water, a 
NASA researcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Droplets about one-tenth the width of a human hair were found in  
the so-called Zag meteorite, a 300-pound rock that broke into 
pieces when it struck a remote area of Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
	The water may date to the beginnings of the universe.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Zolensky, the space agency researcher who found water in  
both the Zag and another meteorite that fell in West Texas last 
year, said the discoveries suggest water may be trapped in many 
space rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bet you that it's going to be found to be a fairly common  
kind of phenomenon,'' Zolensky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zolensky and other scientists from NASA's Johnson Space Center  
in Houston announced last month they had discovered tiny pockets of 
briny water in a 4.5 billion-year-old meteorite found last year in 
West Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	It provided the first close look at water not originating on  
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Zolensky's latest discovery came after he took a closer look at  
a small chunk of another meteorite, found in Morocco in 1998. The 
water was found in crystals of sodium chloride that the Zag and 
West Texas rocks both contained, Zolensky said.

-- a $36.75 billion deal. The combination creates a powerhouse of 
TV, radio, and movies to rival leading conglomerates Time Warner 
Inc. and Walt Disney Co. The new company will be called Viacom, but 
the CBS name will continue to identify the TV network as well as 
other properties. Shares in Viacom closed up 2 5/8 at 47 15/16. CBS

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. tapped a savvy marketer

its prolonged slump and get Americans -- especially today's youth -- 
interested in wearing its jeans again. Philip Marineau, who has 
been credited with broadening Pepsi's appeal, was named president

quiet. Analysts said investors might be reluctant to drive the

	LONDON (AP) -- Vodafone AirTouch PLC is wooing one-time rival  
Bell Atlantic Corp. in an effort to expand its U.S. mobile phone 
business. Vodafone AirTouch, the world's largest cellular phone 
company, confirmed today that it wants to form a trans-Atlantic 
alliance with Bell Atlantic, a venture that could pose a stiff 
challenge to U.S. competitors Sprint Corp. and AT&AMP;T Corp. An 
alliance would bring together Vodafone AirTouch's business in the 
southwestern United States with Bell Atlantic's operations along 
the East Coast, creating a nationwide mobile-phone network.

<HEADLINE> Vitamin Firms Negotiating Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vitamin giant F. Hoffman La Roche &AMP; Co. said  
Tuesday negotiations to settle price-fixing claims in an antitrust 
suit are progressing but declined to comment on a published report 
that broad terms of a settlement have been reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturer is one of six defendants in a civil suit  
brought by corporate buyers of bulk vitamins. The suit alleges the 
six companies oversaw a nine-year conspiracy that caused hundreds 
of food and beverage companies to pay artificially high prices, 
which in turn were passed on to consumers of products ranging from 
breakfast cereal to peanut butter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported in Tuesday's editions that the six  
companies have agreed to pay more than $1.1 billion to settle 
price-fixing claims, the largest ever paid in such a case. 
</P>
<P>
	A tentative settlement of the civil suit will be presented to  
U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan in about two weeks, the 
newspaper said. The judge would then hold a hearing to determine 
the settlement's fairness. 
</P>
<P>
	Last May, the Justice Department obtained $725 million in  
criminal fines from two vitamin manufacturers -- Roche of 
Switzerland and BASF AG of Germany -- on charges they colluded to 
divide up markets and set wholesale prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Roland Haefeli, a spokesman for Roche, acknowledged that  
negotiations in the civil suit are ``well advanced,'' but declined 
to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	A BASF spokesman, John Gilardi, at the headquarters in  
Ludwigshafen, would only say, as in the past, ``We are seeking a 
settlement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Post said that Roche and BASF plus Rhone-Poulenc SA of  
France and three Japanese firms -- Eisai Co., Daiichi Pharmaceutical 
Co. and Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd. -- are part of the tentative 
civil settlement. Together, the six companies account for about 80 
percent of bulk sales of the most popular vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, nearly 1,000 corporate buyers of bulk  
vitamins would receive more than $1 billion reflecting overcharges 
during the nine years. The newspaper said 50 law firms would divide 
another $125 million.

<HEADLINE> Bills Ready Runing Game for Colts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Thurman Thomas says there's nothing  
wrong with the Buffalo Bills' running game, and he should know. 
Thomas helped carry the Bills to four straight Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	But Antowain Smith went nowhere in the preseason after  
complaining of a groin injury in training camp, and the team waived 
its most productive back of the preseason when it cut Anthony Gray. 
</P>
<P>
	All of which inspired one big shrug Tuesday from Thomas, who has  
never seen a season opener that didn't have a list of worries 
attached. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year it was the offensive line that took the heat,''  
Thomas said. ``Now it's the running game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Take away Gray's 176 yards and two touchdowns in the preseason,  
and the Buffalo running game sags to 302 yards without a score. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who came to camp 12 pounds lighter than he was last year  
when he led with team with 1,124 yards and averaged 3.8 yards, was 
running with a vengeance when he reinjured a torn groin muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith produced little in limited playing time, finishing with 48  
yards on 21 carries, a 2.3 average. Against Pittsburgh on Saturday 
night, he carried eight times for 8 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't take a math whiz to figure out that at that rate  
Smith would never find the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bills play the Colts in their season opener. The Colts  
last season were dead last in the AFC in defense and gave up the 
second-most yards rushing in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	In his four career games against the Colts, Smith rushed for 408  
yards and scored seven touchdowns on 81 carries. That includes last 
year's 237 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The groin injury still bothers Smith, who says he's about 95  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to use the injury as an excuse,'' Smith said.  
``It doesn't bother me running the ball; it's more so afterwards. 
But as long as I stay on top of it and continue to rehab and 
continue to treat the injury I don't think it will be a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reason the running game has been lagging is more a matter of  
preseason strategy than missed blocks, blown assignments and aching 
muscles, according to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't opened up the whole offensive package because we  
don't want to show teams what we're going to be doing in the 
games,'' he said. ``We're limited to three or four runs that we're 
trying to execute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas points to last year.  
</P>
<P>
	``You have to remember that we were third in the league in  
rushing last year,'' said Thomas, whose team's 2,175 yards included 
Doug Flutie's 245 yards scrambling and Rob Johnson's 137. ``These 
guys are good runners, and defenses have to prepare for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The line has been taking some heat as well, although nothing  
like last year when media relations became so strained that linemen 
refused to talk to reporters early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of injured right guard Joe Panos, for this weekend at  
least, and insertion of recently demoted center Dusty Zeigler has 
raised concerns -- outside the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the nine millionth time this season, no, I don't have any  
concerns, to be perfectly honest,'' center Jerry Ostroski said. ``I 
have no problems with Dusty; he's doing a great job. It's falling 
into place and everything's going to be fine. We've just got to go 
out and get things done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be there when the season comes,'' said right  
tackle Robert Hicks. ``Nobody's even worrying yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That includes the quarterback. ``We've got to have a decent  
average per carry, pick up those first downs on third-and-1, be 
able to hammer it in from inside the 5,'' Flutie said. ``Being able 
to run the clock out, those type of things. It doesn't mean that 
you have to run the ball for 200 yards per game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No panic button,'' Thomas said. ``Preseason and regular season  
are two different things.''

<HEADLINE> LA Bans Gun Sales on County Grounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The nation's largest gun show suffered a  
potentially critical blow Tuesday when the county Board of 
Supervisors gave final approval to an ordinance banning the sale of 
guns and ammunition on county-owned property. 
</P>
<P>
	The ordinance, approved in a 3-2 vote, will be challenged in  
court by the Great Western Gun Show on numerous fronts, including 
breach of contract and constitutional violations, said Chad Seger, 
the show's manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ordinance is putting the Great Western as it exists today  
out of business,'' Seger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine-based Great Western also will seek a temporary  
restraining order to allow shows planned for October and December. 
</P>
<P>
	County supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who sponsored the measure,  
said it should hold up against any court challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	The county tentatively approved the ordinance Aug. 24, two weeks  
after five people were wounded in a shooting rampage at the North 
Valley Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills and the related 
slaying of a letter carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities claim that gun shows have been the source  
for weapons used in notorious Southern California shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100,000 people attend the four Great Western shows  
each year at the fairgrounds.

<HEADLINE> Officials Allay Y2K Stock Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Financial markets won't be derailed by the  
Year 2000 date change, the government's top securities regulator 
and Wall Street officials assured investors Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst that we have to fear right now is public  
misperception, public fear,'' Arthur Levitt, chairman of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange,  
promised: ``The first trading day of the new millennium will be 
business as usual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grasso and the other officials said the securities industry had  
tested and retested all its computer systems, ensuring a 
trouble-free transition to the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, said John Koskinen, who heads the White House  
Council on Year 2000 Conversion, electricity and other basic 
services needed for securities trading should be working normally. 
``We are increasingly confident that the basic infrastructure will 
hold,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said investors ``can rest assured that their trades  
(will) be processed as efficiently as on any other day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC has charged 13 money management firms, 15 securities  
transfer agents and 37 brokerage firms, all relatively small 
companies, with failing to meet deadlines for fully disclosing 
their computer systems' readiness for the Year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency has said it would go to federal court starting Dec. 1  
to shut down brokerage firms and transfer agents that aren't ready 
for the date change. The SEC estimates that only 1 percent or so of 
the 3,900 brokerage firms and 600 securities transfer agents aren't 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC also requires mutual fund companies and publicly traded  
corporations to disclose their Year 2000 readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 problem -- also called Y2K and the millennium bug --  
occurs because some computer programs, especially older ones, might 
fail when the date changes to 2000. Because the programs were 
written to recognize only the last two digits of a year, such 
programs could read the digits ``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC has these tips for investors:  
</P>
<P>
	--Keep good records, including bank and investment account  
statements and bill payments. 
</P>
<P>
	--Stay informed by finding out what your bank, brokerage firm,  
mutual fund, investment adviser and other financial service 
providers have done to become Y2K compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	--Remember that many companies post Year 2000 information on  
their Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	--Continue to invest for the long term.  
</P>
<P>
	--Don't worry about obtaining your stock certificates, since  
brokerage firms keep records and can answer your questions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Check your personal computer to make sure that it and your  
software are Year 2000 ready. 
</P>
<P>
	A Year 2000 investor kit with information on checking personal  
computers and other topics is available through the National 
Association of Securities Dealers' Web site at 
www.nasdr.com/3600--inv--kit.htm. Printed copies can be obtained by 
calling 1-888-227-1330 or sending an e-mail to y2k(at)nasd.com.

<HEADLINE> NASA Makes Water Droplets Findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Tiny water droplets that could be billions of  
years old were found in a meteorite, the second found with water, a 
NASA researcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Droplets about one-tenth the width of a human hair were found in  
the so-called Zag meteorite, a 300-pound rock that broke into 
pieces when it struck a remote area of Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
	The water may date to the beginnings of the universe.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Zolensky, the space agency researcher who found water in  
both the Zag and another meteorite that fell in West Texas last 
year, said the discoveries suggest water may be trapped in many 
space rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bet you that it's going to be found to be a fairly common  
kind of phenomenon,'' Zolensky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zolensky and other scientists from NASA's Johnson Space Center  
in Houston announced last month they had discovered tiny pockets of 
briny water in a 4.5 billion-year-old meteorite found last year in 
West Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	It provided the first close look at water not originating on  
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Zolensky's latest discovery came after he took a closer look at  
a small chunk of another meteorite, found in Morocco in 1998. The 
water was found in crystals of sodium chloride that the Zag and 
West Texas rocks both contained, Zolensky said.

<HEADLINE> Levi Strauss Hires Pepsi Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The savvy marketer credited with broadening  
Pepsi's appeal through the launch of Pepsi One and the eye-catching 
``Joy of Cola'' campaign was tapped by Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. to 
recapture teen-age jeans wearers. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Marineau was named president and chief executive officer  
of Levi Strauss on Tuesday. He succeeds Peter Jacobi, who stepped 
down in January after nearly three decades with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The approach that Philip will bring with him is that Levi's  
needs to connect with more than a handful of trendsetters,'' said 
Irma Zandl of the New York-based consulting firm Zandl Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Marineau's appointment is effective Sept. 27. Bob Haas, Levi's  
former CEO, is continuing as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1853 by a Bavarian entrepreneur who made sturdy,  
riveted work pants for Gold Rush miners, Levi Strauss has watched 
its business falter in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been particularly hurt by waning interest from teens, who  
have shunned its stodgy five-pocket jeans in favor of trendier 
offerings from the likes of Old Navy, the Gap, Tommy Hilfiger and 
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining sales and profits forced Levi to cut more than 13,000  
jobs and close 24 plants in the last two years in an effort to cut 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the San Francisco-based company is hoping that Marineau,  
52, can breathe some new life into its ailing business. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is not just a soft-drinks man. He is a marketer. He is what  
Levi's needs for the revitalization of its brand,'' said Kurt 
Barnard, a retail consultant and president of Barnard's Retail 
Trend Report in Upper Montclair, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Over his 20-month tenure as president and chief executive of  
Pepsi-Cola North America, Marineau was credited with widening 
Pepsi's marketing to a broader audience beyond teens -- with the new 
diet drink Pepsi One and a new ad campaign featuring a young girl 
who takes on the voices of Marlon Brando and Aretha Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
	At Levi Strauss, analysts said he will be charged to do just the  
opposite as the jeans maker aggressively targets the youth market. 
</P>
<P>
	Marineau was widely regarded as the likely successor to Pepsi  
chairman and CEO Roger Enrico. Steven Reinemund, named Tuesday as 
PepsiCo's chief operating officer, now appears to be the top 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jacobi resigned, Haas said the company would look for  
``somebody with a fresh set of eyes and different experience'' to 
challenge conventional thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was time for Levi's to recognize that its tired old ideas  
had simply played out,'' Barnard said. ``New ideas are necessary to 
bring this company back and they need someone that can think 
outside of the box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Pepsi, Marineau worked at Dean Foods Co. and  
Quaker Oats Co.

	Outline of Vice President Gore's health care reform proposal  
Tuesday in Los Angeles:

(CHIP) to include families with incomes up to 250 percent of the 
poverty line. The current eligibility ceiling for the program is 
200 percent of the poverty line. The program also would allow 
families with incomes above $41,000 to ``buy into'' federally 
subsidized health care coverage. 
</P>
<P>

coverage. 
</P>

refundable tax credit for health care insurance premiums if they 
lack access to employer-based coverage.

they return to the workplace.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally mixed  
Tuesday with many investors awaiting direction from Wall Street 
following the U.S. Labor Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 49.01  
points, or 0.28 percent, to 17,707.50 at the end of the daily 
trading session. On Monday, the average closed up 126.52 points, or 
0.72 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculators such as brokerage dealers sold to take profits after  
Monday's gain, and to square positions ahead of the release of 
Japan's April-June Gross Domestic Product data Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of active foreign participation after a three-day  
weekend in the United States made trading lackluster amid few fresh 
trading incentives, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 110.80 yen,  
up 1.18 yen from late Monday's level of 109.62 yen in Tokyo and 
also above its late London level of 109.58 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taiwan, share prices closed sharply lower as investors  
retreated to the sidelines amid political uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are concerned that the ruling Nationalist Party's  
candidate, Lien Chan, may lose Taiwan's presidential elections in 
March as he continues to slip in opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 184.52  
points, or 2.3 percent, to 7,945.76.

<HEADLINE> Catfish Hunter Leaves Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Hall of Famer Catfish Hunter is back at  
his Perquimans County farm following his release from a hospital, 
four weeks after a fall on concrete steps. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old Hunter, who has Lou Gehrig's disease, was  
released Saturday from Pitt County Memorial Hospital in Greenville 
after he recovered faster than doctors anticipated, said the Rev. 
Keith Vaughan, a family spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter hit his head on the steps at his home on Aug. 8. Hunter  
was unconscious for several days at the hospital and gradually 
improved from critical condition to fair, which was his condition 
when he was released. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about the same as when he was in the hospital,'' Vaughn  
said Tuesday. ``We're very glad to have him home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, who pitched for 15 years in the major leagues, was  
diagnosed last year with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a gradual 
irreversible deterioration of the muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter retired to his native northeastern North Carolina in 1979  
after winning 224 games, including a perfect game. He won five 
World Series rings while playing for the Oakland Athletics and New 
York Yankees.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Bounces Back for Second Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar showed signs of a recovery Tuesday,  
gaining ground against the euro and the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0591, down  
from $1.0612 late Friday. The dollar also was quoted at 110.81 
Japanese yen, up from 110.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said it remains unclear whether the dollar is in a  
genuine recovery, or whether the resurgence is temporary. The 
dollar hovered near seven-month lows against the yen for much of 
last week, and fared almost as badly against the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	But poor economic news out Japan on Tuesday helped infuse some  
strength back into the U.S. currency. Japan's capital expenditure 
rate, a measure of corporate investing, fell 13.4 percent in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad news lowered traders' confidence -- at least temporarily  
-- in Japan's economic recovery, said Tim Fox, a currency analyst at 
Standard Chartered Bank in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors spent most of last week pulling money out of United  
States stocks and bonds and moving the money into Japanese assets, 
which served to strengthen the Japanese currency against the 
dollar. That trend reversed itself a bit Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also gained slightly against the euro, despite  
stronger-than-expected growth in the French economy. The French 
data may have been offset, however, by poor German unemployment 
figures and political uncertainties arising from the ruling Social 
Democratic Party's defeat in German regional elections Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's position against the yen has been and remains tied  
directly to news related to Japan's economy, Fox said. But the 
dollar's position versus the euro is more complicated, he said, 
because many different factors are driving Europe's fledgling 
single economy. ``It's still very unclear whether the dollar will 
continue to recover, or whether this is short-lived,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5094 Swiss francs, up from  
1.5067, and 1.4917 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4921. The British 
pound rose to $1.6048 from $1.6026. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8467 German 
marks, up from 1.8433; 6.1935 French francs, up from 6.1819; and 
1,828 Italian lire, up from 1,825.

	Reno Asks Danforth To Probe Waco  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno has offered former  
Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., the job of heading an independent 
inquiry into the Waco, Texas, case, government sources said today. 
He would probe the use of deadly federal force to end the Branch 
Davidian standoff. Congress officials who spoke with the Justice 
Department said they understood Danforth was willing to take the 
job but the agency was considering appointing a second person -- 
possibly a Democrat -- to share the leadership and give it 
bipartisan balance. Danforth, 63, is a former attorney general of

everything from cranes to garden tools Tuesday to dig for those 
pinned under wreckage from the strongest earthquake to hit Athens 
in nearly a century -- a 10-second shudder that claimed at least 30 
lives and left close to 100 missing. The quake had a magnitude of 
5.9 and was centered about 12 miles north of Athens. Most of the 
damage and casualties were concentrated in working-class and 
immigrant areas. There was no apparent damage to ancient sites, 
including the Acropolis.

coverage for those already in it. The Democratic presidential 
hopeful's plan would be a guarantee that by 2005, every child would

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads Guilty to Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Months after he confessed on videotape to two  
killings that kept another man on death row for almost 17 years, a 
Milwaukee man on Tuesday pleaded guilty to the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Alstory Simon was sentenced to 37 years in prison for the 1982  
murder of Marilyn Green. He also pleaded guilty to voluntary 
manslaughter in the death of Jerry Hillard, 18, and was given a 
15-year sentence to be served concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths of Green, 19, and Hillard, 18, had left Anthony  
Porter convicted of murder and on death row. He was released in 
February after Simon confessed the killings to a private 
investigator, who was working for a Northwestern University 
journalism professor and his investigative reporting class. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigator elicited the confession from Simon by using a  
phony eyewitness account. In the confession, Simon said he acted in 
self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon, a 49-year-old laborer who has lived in Milwaukee since  
1982, had no connection to Porter. They were simply at the same 
pool in Washington Park on the night of the fatal shootings, said 
Thomas V. Gainer, an assistant Cook County state's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter was released from prison and is living in Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Heirs Buy NHL's Blues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Heirs to the Wal-Mart fortune found a big  
bargain -- a price of $100 million to buy the St. Louis Blues and 
Kiel Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill and Nancy Laurie bought the NHL team and the 5-year-old  
arena from Clark Enterprises, a group of 19 prominent local 
businessmen who were tired of pumping money into the enterprise. 
The team had been for sale for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been searching for the right professional sports program  
for a number of months,'' Bill Laurie said Tuesday. ``It's 
incredible that the opportunity was literally in our back yard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sale awaits approval by the NHL Board of Governors and is  
expected to be completed by the end of September. No problems are 
anticipated, since the Lauries had been tentatively approved for a 
previous purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's a slam dunk,'' said Jerry Ritter, Clark  
Enterprises chairman of the board. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues are the third NHL team to change hands this year,  
following the Avalanche and Pittsburgh Penguins. Deals for two or 
three more are pending or in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries, who live in Columbia and raise quarter horses and  
Appaloosas, had been prepared to spend a lot more money. In March, 
they unsuccessfully bid $400 million for the NHL's Colorado 
Avalanche, the NBA's Denver Nuggets, and their new home, the Pepsi 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver deal fell through when shareholders of Ascent  
Entertainment Group, which owned the sports properties, filed suit, 
claiming the sale price was as much as $150 million too low. A 
settlement resulted in an auction. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Blues' price tag, the 20,000-seat Kiel Center alone  
cost $135 million, and the team's worth has been estimated at more 
than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But owners were saddled by debt service on Kiel Center, which  
was privately financed. They also had to pay for ill-advised 
signings and other excesses of the expensive 2 1/2-year reign of 
former coach and general manager Mike Keenan from 1994-1996. Owners 
said they had spent nearly $70 million the past four years to cover 
shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, the Lauries take on $96 million in debt on  
Kiel Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Laurie is lot more familiar with basketball than hockey. He  
was a guard at Memphis State and is a front-row fixture at Missouri 
basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, he knows next to nothing about hockey. He's never  
attended an NHL game and can't skate. 
</P>
<P>
	``At my age, it's not something I don't think I'm going to try  
anytime soon,'' the 47-year-old Laurie said. ``Although I am new to 
the hockey world, I enjoy all kinds of sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie wasn't ruling out pursuing an NBA franchise for the city.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let's go one thing at a time,'' he said. ``I guess if an NBA  
possibility came along, we would take a look at it. But I can 
honestly tell you today our focus is on hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sale coincided with the opening of the Blues' training camp  
on Monday. Bill Laurie met with the team Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm like everybody else,'' general manager Larry Pleau said.  
``We're all excited about this and we're ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries are the second Columbia entry into the St. Louis  
sports market in recent years; Stan Kroenke is a minority owner of 
the NFL's St. Louis Rams. The Lauries and Kroenkes are in-laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``These kinds of discussions, quite honestly, don't come up as  
much as you might think,'' Laurie said. ``Stan does his thing and I 
do mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Walton Laurie is the daughter of the late Bud Walton, who  
with his late brother Sam co-founded Wal-Mart. The Lauries own 
Crown Center Farms in Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple made the largest single donation to the University of  
Missouri in its history in 1996, offering $10 million toward the 
construction of a basketball arena. The donation was withdrawn a 
year later after the Lauries felt the university wasn't making 
enough progress toward construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiel Partners, a consortium of local businessmen that owns the  
Blues, announced Dec. 30 that it had hired an investment bank to 
explore the team's financial options. They included selling the 
Blues and Kiel Center, bringing an NBA team to the city or 
overhauling Kiel Center's capital structure.

<HEADLINE> CBS, Viacom Merge Young With Old </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- No company knows young television viewers better  
than Viacom, the owner of MTV and Nickelodeon. And no company knows 
their parents -- or, more precisely, their grandparents -- better 
than CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the networks that brought you Kid Rock music videos, and  
``Touched By an Angel,'' ``Rugrats'' and ``Diagnosis: Murder'' will 
all be together in one big family. 
</P>
<P>
	The giant media company created by Viacom's purchase of CBS  
offers either a culture clash or a seamless fit of complementary 
parts, depending on your point of view. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have them from the time they're two years old until the  
time they're 80,'' said Leslie Moonves, CBS Television president. 
</P>
<P>
	The median age of the CBS viewer during the last television  
season was 53, or 10 years older than any other broadcast network. 
CBS has long been the network of greatest appeal among older 
Americans, and has veered between accepting this reality or trying 
to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, CBS executives have accepted it, and tried to subtly  
introduce young characters and shows with appeal to all ages 
without alienating the core audience. It worked to the extent that 
CBS was the No. 1 network in the ratings this past season. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the profitable Nickelodeon cable network has  
established itself as the dominant viewing choice for children, 
with a median age of 9. The typical MTV viewer is 20, and the music 
channel has reinvigorated itself recently with a heavy emphasis on 
teen-aged pop music. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't a lot of overlap'' between MTV and CBS, said Tom  
Freston, chairman and CEO of the MTV Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Where viewers are most likely to see effects of the merger is in  
promotions -- ads for ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' on VH1, for 
instance. The cable networks may also more frequently show repeats 
of musical specials aired on CBS, or vice versa, Freston said. VH1 
recently showed a Shania Twain special that had first run on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	There's little need to change the networks if they're doing well  
on their own, said Gene Jankowski, a retired CBS president who owns 
a regional television network in New England. That's what makes the 
merger a good fit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger experiences of ABC and Disney, as well as Time Warner  
with Ted Turner's television networks show that it isn't always 
easy, said Cynthia Littleton, television editor of Variety. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will inevitably be culture clashes,'' Littleton said.  
</P>
<P>
	Executives indicated that consolidations wouldn't be forced. Mel  
Karmazin, the CBS Corp. chief executive who would be president of 
the new Viacom, noted that competing all-news radio stations in New 
York City were kept operating even after they both came under the 
CBS umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
	``To try to marry CBS and MTV overnight ... would be a disaster,  
internally and externally, on the air and behind the scenes,'' 
Littleton said. ``I'm sure they know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal could also make CBS a corporate partner of UPN, the  
sixth-rated broadcast network that just suffered through a 
disastrous year in the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom owns half of UPN, which would seem an unlikely merger  
partner with CBS. It has recently changed directions to target a 
young, male audience with such fare as the prime-time ``WWF 
Smackdown'' wrestling show. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current FCC regulations, the new company could own no more  
than 33 percent of UPN. Even though UPN loses money and has been 
the constant subject of rumors it will close, executives indicated 
Tuesday they would try to change rules to get more control of the 
network before considering shutting it down or merging assets with 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important that the UPN network survive and be  
financially healthy ... It's serving a market,'' Karmazin said.

<HEADLINE> Bucs' Coach Has High Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Tony Dungy, the soft-spoken coach of the  
Tampa Bay Buccaneers, doesn't mince words when he talks about his 
team's potential. 
</P>
<P>
	He has high expectations and is adamant about the Bucs having  
the talent to meet them if they can eliminate the inconsistency 
that undermined a promising season in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget all the talk about how Tampa Bay was the second-youngest  
team in the league and struggled to live up to what may have been 
unrealistic projections as Super Bowl contenders. Dungy doesn't buy 
the argument that his players were in over their heads or that an 
8-8 finish left them doubting themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we need confidence. Our big thing is, can we do  
it week in and week out?'' the fourth-year coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we've got to do to become a contender. We've got  
to play consistently to our level. When we do, we're a pretty good 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Victories over Minnesota, which lost just once during the  
regular season, and Green Bay, which had beaten Tampa Bay six 
straight times under Dungy, support the coach's contention. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the team's 13-14 record since winning its first five  
games in 1997 also illustrates Dungy's point about inconsistency. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Warren Sapp said part of the  
problem a year ago was an inability to handle being a team 
opponents measured themselves against. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us going from the surprise of the NFL to being one of the  
hunted, I don't think any of us were ready for that,'' said Sapp, 
who anchored the league's second-ranked defense. ``When you're 
considered one of the teams that can go to the Super Bowl, people 
come in to knock you off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No player is under more pressure to atone for last season than  
quarterback Trent Dilfer, who struggled after taking a step forward 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucs must decide after the season whether to exercise an  
option on Dilfer's contract, and they have taken steps to help him 
be more successful. For the first time in four seasons under Dungy, 
Dilfer is working with a quarterbacks coach. The shotgun formation 
also has been added to give him more time to set up in the pocket 
and read defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also upgraded the position, trading for backup Eric  
Zeier and drafting rookie Shaun King in the second round. The Bucs 
insist the moves don't signal a lack of confidence in Dilfer, a 54 
percent career passer who's thrown 10 more interceptions than 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a guy who is always going to be under scrutiny until he  
gets over these barriers, which really for a quarterback means you 
almost have to go to the Super Bowl,'' general manager Rich McKay 
said. ``He understands that. I think he'd be the first to tell you 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dilfer, two years removed from being selected for the Pro Bowl  
and leading the Bucs to their first playoff berth in 15 seasons, 
acknowledged this could be the most important season of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	But he insists he's not looking over his shoulder at Zeier, who  
started 11 games in four seasons with the Baltimore Ravens and old 
Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stopped last year trying to figure things out. I'm happy  
Eric's here. He's been a good friend so far. He knows enough about 
the position where I can learn things from him,'' Dilfer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect him to go out and play the best he can and try to  
show off. That's what I would do if I was in his position. I push 
myself hard enough so I don't have to be pushed by another player. 
Our coaches know that. I know that. But that's not to say he 
shouldn't try to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The supporting cast around Dilfer is the best he's had in six  
seasons in Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Tailback Warrick Dunn and fullback Mike Alstott provide one of  
the best 1-2 running combinations. A receiving corps that includes 
Bert Emanuel, Reidel Anthony and Jacquez Green offers big-play 
capability the team lacked early in Dilfer's career. 
</P>
<P>
	As 1998 proved, though, the Bucs have anything but an offense  
where Dilfer simply has to stay out of the way of the playmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people say you just have to push the button, you just  
have to do the right things, you just have to not make mistakes. 
But I don't think that cuts it because there were a lot of games 
where I did that and we lost,'' Dilfer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could be wrong, and I'm sure there's people that would  
disagree with me, but I think you have to make an enormous amount 
of plays and a limited amount of mistakes.''

<HEADLINE> Greece Plans Olympic Baseball Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Plans to bring baseball to Greece before  
the 2004 Olympics moved forward Tuesday when Baltimore Orioles 
owner Peter Angelos met with Greek officials trying to put together 
a team in a nation without a baseball park. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to get it done, but it's going to be a  
challenge,'' Angelos said during a reception held by U.S. 
Ambassador Nicholas Burns and the Hellenic Amateur Baseball 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos, a Greek-American who is heading the group, is being  
helped by the commissioner's office and the Boston Red Sox -- Burn's 
favorite team. Angelos hopes to have a delegation, including 
players and player development personnel, in Greece later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	As host nation of the Olympics, Greece automatically qualifies  
to enter a team in every sport. Greek organizers hope to build 
their first baseball team from Greek-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Presently, the only regulation baseball diamond in Greece is on  
a closed U.S. military base outside Athens.

<HEADLINE> Nebraska's Crouch Is Not a Quitter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Eric Crouch heard the rumors that he was  
quitting Nebraska's football team because he wasn't named the 
starting quarterback. He heard he would transfer to play at another 
school, or maybe stop playing altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	They were all wrong, Crouch said Tuesday. Crouch said he never  
went to or called coach Frank Solich to say he was leaving the 
team, but did admit to being disappointed at losing the starting 
job to Bobby Newcombe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very emotional time,'' Crouch said.  
</P>
<P>
	There was no list of transfer possibilities, he said. He was  
staying in Lincoln, but did have to work through his disappointment 
over being a backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Crouch, who capped off a tumultuous week with three touchdowns  
in the No. 5 Cornhuskers' 42-7 victory over Iowa on Saturday, said 
he went home to southwest Omaha after Solich told him Newcombe was 
the starter. But it's only a 45-mile trip, Crouch said, and it's 
one he makes often. He wasn't going home to consider his options. 
</P>
<P>
	Crouch said he was ready to clear the air on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``When rumors get started, people tend to start believing what  
was said,'' Crouch said. ``It was just a bigger case this time. You 
have to acquire a thick skin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crouch and Newcombe were both effective on Saturday and Solich  
said fans can expect to see more of the same Saturday when Nebraska 
plays its home opener against California (1-0). Solich won't set a 
schedule for how many series each will play, but said Newcombe and 
Crouch will continue to see time in each half. 
</P>
<P>
	Having a fresh Newcombe or Crouch was effective against Iowa.  
Crouch scored the first touchdown on a 28-yard run and added two 
more in the second half. Newcombe rushed for two and threw for one, 
leaving Solich perfectly content with a tag-team quarterback 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``For him to run for those touchdowns really lifted a lot of  
pressure off of me and our team,'' Newcombe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their teammates also aren't concerned about which one of them is  
taking the snaps. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were times during the game when I would be split out and  
wouldn't know who was in at quarterback,'' split end Matt Davison 
said. ``We all have confidence in both of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of us,'' Crouch said, ``are very encouraging to each  
other. In this system, both quarterbacks are going to see a lot of 
time.''

<HEADLINE> CBS Evolved Into Merger Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS, the granddaddy of broadcast networks, has  
been working to reshape its image as a stodgy media company, an 
effort that made CBS a more attractive acquisition target for 
Viacom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The drive is being led by its no-nonsense chief executive, Mel  
Karmazin, who has guided the company's radio business to strong 
profits, launched new Internet investments and beefed up its 
outdoor advertising properties. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS had its start in 1927 when Arthur Judson founded the United  
Independent Broadcasters radio company. It was quickly bought by 
Columbia Phonograph, and cigar maker Sam Paley took a controlling 
interest in the company the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Paley installed his son, William, as president, who began  
transforming the business in a head-to-head rivalry with larger 
rival National Broadcasting Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Paley raided NBC stars, built an aggressive news  
organization and promoted the company's daytime programming, 
sealing CBS's reputation as the ``Tiffany Network'' with classier 
shows than those seen on rival networks. 
</P>
<P>
	By the mid-1930s, CBS had a major radio broadcasting network,  
and in 1938 the now-legendary Edward R. Murrow began his career at 
CBS as head of the network's European division. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS developed a colorful, sometimes controversial reputation in  
TV broadcasting. The company's news unit helped expose McCarthyism 
in the 1950s, even though it required employees to sign a ``loyalty 
oath'' stating they didn't sympathize with or belong to communist 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS show ``64,000 Question'' became embroiled in a 1958  
scandal showing it was rigged. The company's programming reputation 
was enhanced by the debut of ``60 Minutes'' in 1968, ``All in the 
Family'' in 1971 and ``M.A.S.H.'' in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Loew's Corp. chairman Laurence Tisch became CBS chief executive  
in 1987, but was criticized for selling valuable assets, including 
its leading record company. CBS also lost broadcasting rights to 
NFL games and several affiliates to the Fox network. 
</P>
<P>
	Westinghouse Electric bought CBS in 1995 and began selling its  
non-broadcasting holdings. It bought Infinity Broadcasting in 1996, 
which was headed by Karmazin, and expanded into cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Karmazin was named president of CBS in April of 1998, and was  
named to the additional post of CEO last fall. He has engineered 
several key mergers, including the purchase of King World 
Productions, the leading syndicator of television programming with 
shows like ``Wheel of Fortune,'' and Outdoor Systems, the nation's 
largest outdoor advertising company. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS also has stakes in several Internet companies, including CBS  
MarketWatch.com, SportsLine USA Inc., StoreRunner Inc., Office.com 
Inc. and hollywood.com.

<HEADLINE> Beluga Whale Dies at Conn. Aquarium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MYSTIC, Conn. (AP) -- For the second time in a year, a beluga  
whale on display at the Mystic Aquarium has died. 
</P>
<P>
	Aurora, an 18-year-old female, had been sick for almost a year  
with a mysterious ailment. She died Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply saddened by the loss of Aurora,'' said Neal  
Overstrom, the aquarium president. ``Our staff should take comfort 
in knowing that they have provided outstanding care for her, just 
as they do for all the animals at our aquarium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The death of Aurora comes less than a year after the death of  
another beluga at the aquarium. Winston, a 17-year-old male on loan 
from the New York Aquarium, died in October after contracting a 
bacterial infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after that death, aquarium officials discovered its  
three other belugas were sick. Officials determined the illness was 
not related to Winston's death, but could not determine its exact 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mystic Aquarium said its other two whales, Neku and Kela, no  
longer show any signs of the illness. 
</P>
<P>
	A necropsy was performed Monday night on Aurora's body. Tissue  
and blood samples will be sent to laboratories in an attempt to 
determine an exact cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
	The beluga whale, gregarious in nature, is a midsize member of  
the whale family typically found along the coasts and, sometimes, 
in the rivers, of the Arctic. There are between 50,000 to 70,000 of 
them worldwide. They are thought to live between 35 and 50 years in 
the wild. 
</P>
<P>
	Aurora, Neku and Kela came to Mystic in 1984 from Churchill,  
Manitoba.

<HEADLINE> GOP Hopes for Compromise on Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a monthlong blitz of publicity,  
Republicans' efforts to sell their 10-year, $792 billion tax bill 
have not triggered a groundswell of voter support. Nor have they 
failed to deter President Clinton from his veto promise. 
</P>
<P>
	The big question this fall is whether a tax cut compromise is  
possible between Clinton and the GOP-led Congress, which returns 
Wednesday from its annual August recess. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and his senior advisers have argued that the  
ambitious tax reduction proposed by Republicans would absorb so 
much of the projected budget surpluses that government programs 
from national parks to education could suffer deep cuts in the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	During an education speech Tuesday in Olney, Md., the president  
said he believes Americans first want to prepare Social Security 
and Medicare for baby boomer retirements, pay down public debt and 
ensure adequate government spending before cutting taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to first of all think about the long-term welfare of  
the country: Save Social Security and Medicare, get the country out 
of debt, invest what we have to do in education and other things, 
then give the rest in a tax cut,'' Clinton said. ``Don't put the 
cart before the horse and then figure out what in the wide world 
we're going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans contend the Clinton administration's sharp attacks  
demonstrate White House concern over the political potency of the 
tax cut. And they say Clinton's stated willingness to increase his 
overall tax cut number from $250 billion to $300 billion over 10 
years shows they are making headway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the rising popularity of our tax bill has shaken the  
Democrats,'' Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., said in a letter to GOP 
colleagues. ``They're using the same tired scare tactics they've 
used before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over 10 years, the bill would reduce all income tax rates by 1  
percentage point, ease the marriage penalty on many two-income 
couples, eliminate estate taxes and the alternative minimum income 
tax, reduce capital gains taxes, expand pension and 401(k) laws and 
provide numerous business tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls consistently show that tax cuts are important to voters,  
but less important than saving Social Security or strengthening 
Medicare. And many polls show that up to half of Americans believe 
the GOP tax cut would mainly benefit the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the tax issue, Congress this fall must solve some  
difficult spending problems caused by budget caps imposed as part 
of the 1997 balanced budget agreement. Some other high-profile 
issues are gun control, a patient's bill of rights, campaign 
finance reform and investigations into federal actions during the 
1993 standoff and fatal fire at the Branch Davidian compound 
outside Waco, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans plan to send the tax bill to the White  
House as early as Sept. 14. The GOP is divided over whether to 
pursue compromise with Clinton on taxes after the veto. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP congressional aides who spoke on condition of anonymity said  
one camp is led by House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois, who 
favors pushing a second, scaled-back tax package. Another group led 
by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi and House 
Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas wants to leave the rejected $792 
billion bill as the final word. 
</P>
<P>
	While not confirming any course of action on taxes, Hastert  
spokesman Pete Jefferies said the speaker's philosophy in Congress 
is to ``put points on the board'' by passing legislation that can 
be signed into law rather than walk away with little more than a 
political issue. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Lott-DeLay group also has strong support, including a  
likely majority of the 55 Republican senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats who favor a tax cut are reluctant to embrace any  
deal on taxes that might make the Republicans look good in next 
year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Some post-veto tax cut scenarios being discussed on Capitol  
Hill: 
</P>
<P>
	--Compromise fails or isn't attempted. Republicans move only a  
bare-bones tax measure that extends several expiring credits, such 
as the R&AMP;D credit, and exempts personal credits from dropping 
middle-class people into the alternative minimum tax. 
</P>
<P>
	--A compromise is reached on tax cuts of $300 billion to $500  
billion over 10 years using projected surpluses. Likely candidates 
for such a bipartisan bill include a permanent extension of the R&AMP;D 
credit, relief from the marriage penalty and estate tax and 
expanded pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	--A grand deal is struck on tax cuts, shoring up Social Security  
for future retirees and reforming Medicare including a new 
prescription drug benefit. This ``big bang theory,'' as some have 
called it, might appeal to Clinton's wish for a lasting legacy but 
has the least chance of success.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Victim Returns to School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Sean Graves, one of the most seriously  
wounded students in the Columbine High School shooting, returned to 
classes Tuesday for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Graves, 15, was shot four times when two of his fellow students  
opened fire in April, then killed themselves. He was released from 
the hospital July 7 after months of rehabilitation for a spinal 
chord injury that nearly paralyzed him from the waist down. 
</P>
<P>
	``On one hand, I want to move on with my life and I am excited  
about seeing my friends. On the other hand, I feel cheated about 
missing the summer,'' Graves said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have a long, hard road of work ahead of me, and with  
the support of my family and friends I will continue to make 
progress,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graves will continue his physical therapy as an outpatient. He  
has made slow but steady progress and can now walk about 300 feet 
at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve students and one teacher were killed by Eric Harris, 18,  
and Dylan Klebold, 17. Another 23 students were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine High was refurbished before classes began Aug. 16.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Fall for T-Bills / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities fell in Tuesday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $6.5 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.720 percent, down from 4.875 percent last 
week. An additional $7.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.950 percent, down from 4.990 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the lowest since Aug. 16 when the bills  
sold for 4.680 percent. The six-month rate also was the lowest Aug. 
16 when the rate was 4.900. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.856 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,880.70 and 5.161 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,749.80. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 5.29 
percent last week from 5.19 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Mass. School Bus Service Disrupted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Drivers of school buses for two Boston suburbs  
went on strike today and blocked a bus depot, leaving more than 
2,000 students in Newton and Brookline without service on their 
first day of class. 
</P>
<P>
	A tractor-trailer truck was parked in front of the gate of  
Laidlaw Transit's depot in Boston as about 45 Teamsters union 
strikers protested. The truck was moved later, but a circle of 
picketing bus drivers blocked the exit. The company had planned to 
use management employees to fill in for the strikers. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools in both communities remained open and parents were asked  
to drive their children to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that the first day of school should be  
disrupted in this way,'' said Newton school superintendent Jeffrey 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
	About a fifth of Newton's 11,000 students rely on buses, while  
in Brookline, only a relatively small percentage of the district's 
1,800 students travel by bus, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teamsters union president George Cashman said health benefits  
was the main sticking point. 
</P>
<P>
	Muoi Luu of Newton said her 15-year-old twins heard the news of  
the strike on television as they ate breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
	``They woke me up at 6:30 and said, `Mom, we have no bus because  
the bus drivers are on strike,''' she said.

<HEADLINE> Viacom, Orphaned by CBS, Buys It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Viacom Inc., jettisoned by the CBS broadcast  
company in 1970, grew rapidly over the next three decades to become 
one of the largest media conglomerates in the world -- powerful 
enough to take over its former parent. 
</P>
<P>
	Through a string of mergers and acquisitions over the years,  
Viacom today is a far-flung cable TV operator and entertainment 
provider, owning businesses stretching from the MTV and Nickelodeon 
cable stations to the Blockbuster chain of video-rental stores. Its 
aggressiveness was fueled in part by its risk-taking leader, Sumner 
Redstone, whose own remarkable rise from Depression-era poverty led 
to his purchase of Viacom in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS spun off its Viacom cable TV arm to comply with government  
broadcast rules barring TV networks from selling their own 
programming or owning cable TV systems. At the time, Viacom had 
sales of just $19.8 million and 90,000 cable subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Viacom quickly helped shape the cable industry's  
consolidation. In 1976, Viacom created the Showtime movie network 
to compete with Home Box Office to provide cable subscribers films 
recently released in theaters. It invested heavily in expanding its 
cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986 Viacom bought MTV Networks in a prescient move. The  
flashy graphics and fast pace became a favorite among young adults 
and advertisers. Viacom also revamped Nickelodeon, a 
children-geared channel included in the MTV purchase, and 
transformed it from the least popular cable channel to one of the 
most popular. 
</P>
<P>
	Weakened by a heavy debt load, Viacom became embroiled in a  
takeover battle in 1986 among Carl Icahn, a Viacom management team 
and Redstone, president of the National Amusements Inc. movie 
theater chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Redstone, who grew up in a tenement where the bathroom was down  
the hall, won out by buying Viacom for $3.4 billion. He led it on a 
spree of acquisitions, including the 1994 purchase of Blockbuster 
for about $8.4 billion and of Paramount Communications for $10 
billion, which brought Viacom the Simon &AMP; Schuster publishing 
empire. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom helped start fifth broadcast TV network in 1995, and the  
following year sold Viacom Cable Television, the 12th-largest cable 
TV system in the world, to TCI (now part of AT&AMP;T). 
</P>
<P>
	Redstone moved to quell turmoil in Viacom's upper ranks in the  
mid-1990s, and also acted to pare down the company's debt. Viacom 
sold its 10 radio stations in 1997, sold its share of USA networks 
to Universal Studios for $1.7 billion and divested other holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Viacom's Blockbuster chain of video-rental  
stores has suffered from weak management and concerns that 
pay-per-view channels and other new media will hurt the video 
rental business. 
</P>
<P>
	Blockbuster's fortunes have been improving recently thanks to  
several revenue-sharing agreements with movie studios that allow 
stores to stock more copies of popular films. However, 
Blockbuster's stock has generated only tepid investor interest 
since its IPO last month.

	BOSTON (AP) -- A painting by Claude Monet and two works by  
Camille Pissarro that were willed to the blue-collar city of 
Lawrence cannot be sold to raise money for the city's cultural 
programs, a state judge ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of the paintings, which includes pieces by several  
lesser-known artists, has sparked a dispute between leaders in 
Lawrence and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly 90 years, the paintings have been at the museum, and  
museum leaders have fought Lawrence's effort to sell the paintings. 
It is estimated the Monet and Pissarro works could bring in between 
$5.5 million and $7.5 million at auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Monet's ``Field of Poppies, near Giverny,'' the Pissarros and 14  
other works were the property of the Rev. William Wolcott, who in 
1911 willed the paintings to the private Daniel White Fund to 
``create and gratify a public taste for fine art, particularly 
among the people of Lawrence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolcott ordered the pictures housed at the MFA until a suitable  
gallery could be built in Lawrence, a city 35 miles north of Boston 
better known for industry than culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a century later, a gallery is still not in the city's  
plans and trustees of the art decided to reclaim the art and sell 
it at auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The MFA fought the move, saying the will stipulates that the  
trustees maintain ownership of the paintings ``permanently and 
inalienably,'' and may not sell them. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Margaret Hinkle agreed. ``The Trustees are  
to have permanent possession and control of the paintings. 
Therefore nothing in the will permits the Trustees to sell the 
paintings,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Griesinger, an attorney for the MFA, said the museum was  
``delighted that the court has decided that the most important 
paintings in the collection will definitely not be sold and will 
remain available to be seen by people in this region, including 
people from Lawrence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of the remaining 14 paintings -- which include much less  
valuable works by American artists Hugh Bolton Jones and Alexander 
Lawrie -- were to be decided separately. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Renehan, an attorney for the art's trustees, said he  
would appeal the decision, and said he would ask that a separate 
trial on the remaining works be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	Griesinger said that if Lawrence were to build a gallery the MFA  
would happily give the paintings back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't own them,'' he said, ``but the will requires us to  
have them under the current circumstances.''

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Stranded at Detroit Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROMULUS, Mich. (AP) -- A thunderstorm and flooding inside a  
concourse delayed flights at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, 
stranding several hundred passengers overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm poured 1.45 inches of rain on the airport Monday  
evening, soaking a Northwest Airlines concourse where the roof is 
being rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
	About an inch of water covered some areas of the floor in the  
concourse, airport spokesman Mike Conway said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a very interesting night,'' Conway said. ``Our fire  
station was hit by lightning, we had traffic lights out and the 
concourse was flooded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lightning caused no damage or injuries, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	However, the combination of the storm and the flooding, which  
closed the concourse for about half an hour, delayed 38 incoming 
Northwest flights and 38 departing flights, Conway said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 200 to 300 passengers were stranded because they missed  
connecting flights and spent the night in the airport or nearby 
hotels, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	By 10 a.m. today, most of those passengers had left or at least  
had booked new flights, Conway said. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest spokeswoman Kathy Peach said today the delays were all  
caused by the weather. ``We deal with the results of that,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline employees implemented procedures used to handle events  
such as inclement weather, including shuffling staff to manually 
carry luggage into the terminals, Ms. Peach said. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, a storm that dumped nearly 2 feet of snow at the  
airport stranded thousands of passengers on board Northwest 
airliners stuck on runways and taxiways. Some passengers were stuck 
on planes for up to eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Monday's airport problems, Detroit Edison said  
the lightning knocked out electrical service for about 10,000 
customers in southeast Michigan.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Scolds Russian Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin lashed out at  
the Russian military today, accusing it of ``sloppiness'' for 
allowing Islamic militants to advance into the southern republic of 
Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	The militants, seeking an independent Islamic state, have  
battled Russian troops since crossing from breakaway Chechnya and 
seizing several villages in Dagestan on Aug. 7. Government troops 
managed to drive them back to Chechnya after more than two weeks of 
heavy fighting, but rebels have struck back in other regions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest offensive, hundreds of militants poured into the  
Novolakskoye region in western Dagestan on the border with Chechnya 
on Sunday, quickly taking control of several villages. The rebels 
were trying to advance toward the town of Khasavyurt, which sits on 
a strategic highway leading to Makhachkala, Dagestan's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian military press center in Dagestan said today that  
federal forces had managed to stop the rebels' offensive three 
miles from Khasavyurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shall discuss in detail why we lost an entire region in  
Dagestan,'' Yeltsin told reporters before meeting Prime Minister 
Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin. ``All that can be only explained by 
the military sloppiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Putin was scheduled to serve as chairman of a meeting of the  
presidential Security Council on the fighting in Dagestan. He also 
spoke with Dagestan's leader, Magomedali Magomedov, and promised to 
send more government troops. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of parliament's lower house,  
said Yeltsin must account for his own inaction instead of blaming 
the military. ` 
</P>
<P>
	``Rebels got in Dagestan as a knife goes into butter,''  
Seleznyov said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the rebels attacked over the weekend, there were numerous  
reports warning that they were gathering on the Chechen side of the 
border. Russian military officials, however, said the frontier was 
tightly protected. 
</P>
<P>
	When the militants swept into Dagestan on Sunday, they were able  
to march on the town of Novolakskoye, apparently without facing any 
Russian troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels surrounded a police station and began firing at the  
officers. Russia said an armored column was sent to the town to 
rescue the policemen. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Muslim Dakhayev, the chief of Novolakskoye police,  
later told reporters that no government troops arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fought our way out alone. No one was helping us,'' Dakhayev  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Russian security forces, 24 men have been killed and  
48 wounded since Sunday. Three armored personnel carriers and one 
tank were destroyed and three military helicopters were damaged by 
ground fire, the military said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the death toll reached 64 from a Saturday night bomb  
attack that demolished a building housing military families in the 
town of Buinaksk in central Dagestan, the Emergency Situations 
Ministry said. Rescuers were still searching the rubble for more 
victims. At least 23 of the dead were children. 
</P>
<P>
	One suspect has been arrested in that attack, and authorities  
were searching for two more people, the Russian Federal Security 
Service said without giving details. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting over the past month has hit several different areas  
of Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	In another ongoing battle, the Russian troops moved in on an  
Islamic militant stronghold in Karamakhi in eastern Dagestan, where 
fighting still continued today. 
</P>
<P>
	Dagestan's secular politicians and moderate religious leaders,  
along with most of the population, oppose the rebels and have 
welcomed the military campaign against them. Also, thousands of 
Dagestani volunteers have already signed up to fight the rebels.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. were expected to  
announce they are combining the companies in what would be the 
biggest media merger ever, The Wall Street Journal reported today. 
The combination would create a media powerhouse owning the CBS 
network, several major cable networks -- including MTV, Nickelodeon, 
Country Music Television and the Nashville Network -- along with 
film studio Paramount Pictures. CBS's market valuation is about $37 
billion at Friday's closing stock price, while Viacom's market

Adm. Joseph W. Prueher as U.S. ambassador to Beijing, a government 
spokesman said today. Chinese endorsement of Prueher had been 
delayed by strains over the NATO bombing of China's embassy in 
Yugoslavia and his role in U.S. naval operations in the Taiwan 
Strait at a sensitive time in 1996, according to U.S. diplomatic 
sources. The ambassador's post has been vacant since James Sasser

singed 63,486 acres after beginning Aug. 28. The blaze near Big

to lead the new round of consultations, scheduled to begin today 
and run through Saturday. Hope for improved relations increased 
after a four-day visit to North Korea last month by Rep. Tony Hall,

<HEADLINE> Ford Settles Sexual Harassment Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. agreed to pay $7.75 million  
Tuesday to as many as 900 women to settle complaints that they were 
groped and subjected to crude comments and graffiti at two 
Chicago-area plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement also calls for sensitivity training by outside  
consultants at Ford plants across the nation at a cost estimated by 
the EEOC at $10 million. Ford said it did not know what the cost 
would be. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth-largest sexual-harassment settlement in the  
history of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	A record $34 million settlement involving almost identical  
allegations against Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing of America Inc. 
received final approval in June. The alleged harassment took place 
at a plant in Normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This settlement demonstrates the EEOC's commitment to  
eradicate harassment from the workplaces of America,'' the 
commission's chairwoman, Ida L. Castro, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, $7.5 million in damages would be split  
among an estimated 700 to 900 women who can show sexual harassment 
or sex discrimination at Ford plants in Chicago and suburban 
Chicago Heights. 
</P>
<P>
	How much each claimant receives will be decided by a  
three-member independent board to be set up under the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The board also will supervise efforts within the plants to root  
out sexual harassment and discrimination. It will consist of one 
member named by the EEOC, one named by Ford and a chairman 
appointed by those members. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, more women will get management positions  
and supervisors who see sexual harassment but do nothing will be 
ineligible for promotions and bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	James J. Padilla, Ford group vice president for manufacturing,  
praised what he described as ``a partnership with the EEOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement further strengthens Ford's long-standing policy  
of zero tolerance and will help move us toward our goal of zero 
occurrence of harassment of any kind at our facilities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $7.75 million cost of the damages won't strain the world's  
second-largest automaker, which reported operating earnings for the 
three months that ended in June of $2.48 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's news conference was interrupted briefly by Suzette  
Wright, 29, a worker at Ford's assembly plant on Chicago's South 
Side. She said she had been subjected to crude comments from 
co-workers and that her breasts and buttocks had been groped. 
</P>
<P>
	She asked Padilla for an apology. With TV cameras rolling,  
Padilla said that if any Ford employees had been deprived of their 
dignity, ``we apologize.''

<HEADLINE> Thrashers Name Goalie Consultant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Former NHL goalie Bob Mason, who spent the  
past three seasons as a volunteer coach at the University of 
Minnesota, was appointed goaltending consultant for the Atlanta 
Thrashers on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He replaces Andy Moog, who joined the Thrashers in December but  
left last month to take a similar position with the Vancouver 
Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mason played on the 1984 U.S. Olympic team and spent eight  
seasons in the NHL with Washington, Chicago, Quebec and Vancouver. 
He began his coaching career in 1995 at Shadduck High School in 
Fairbault, Minn., before moving to the Golden Gophers the following 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Don Waddell first met Mason in 1983, when both  
played for the U.S. national team. 
</P>
<P>
	``My fear was getting someone who would over-analyze a player  
and wind up creating problems. That's not the case with Bob at 
all,'' Waddell said. ``He's not going to change styles. He's going 
to reinforce a goalie's style and build confidence in stopping 
pucks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mason will continue to live in his native state, visiting  
Atlanta about once a month and also going on the road to work with 
the team's goaltending prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Thrashers coach Curt Fraser said it was important for the  
organization to have someone who can work exclusively with the 
goalies and relate to the nuances of their position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always had a good relationship with my goaltenders, but  
we need a consultant,'' Fraser said. ``Sometimes a matter of inches 
can make a huge difference. I can tell when a goalie is too deep in 
the crease, but sometimes it's where the stick is positioned that 
makes all the difference.''

	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners on Tuesday recalled  
right-hander Brett Hinchliffe, left-hander Steve Sinclair and 
outfielder Shane Monahan from class AAA Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinchliffe, 25, went 9-7 over 21 starts for the Rainiers, with a  
5.15 ERA. In two previous stints with Seattle this year he went 0-2 
with an 11.29 ERA in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair, 28, was acquired from Toronto on July 28, along with  
Tom Davey, for first baseman David Segui. He went 1-0 with a 4.50 
ERA in two games for Tacoma, and was 0-0 with a 5.19 ERA in 11 
games with Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Monahan, 25, hit .256, with seven home runs, 32 RBIs and 21  
doubles in 106 games for Tacoma. He was on the Mariners' roster 
from July 27-Aug. 8, appearing in two games and going 0-for-2.

<HEADLINE> Bank Is Tough on Olympic Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Olympic scandal has the Bank of  
America taking a tougher position on its line of credit with the 
Salt Lake Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank is insisting SLOC repay it first, before the state  
recovers $59 million for building Olympic venues. The money is 
expected to come from NBC television royalties for the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	State Olympic officer John Fowler said Tuesday the scandal  
``weighed heavily'' in the bank's demand. The new condition, he 
said, reverses a hard-won concession the state negotiated in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now they're really putting the squeeze on us,'' said Rep.  
Jordan Tanner. ``If (SLOC) runs into shortfalls, we may never get 
paid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bank says it won't renew SLOC's $130 million line of credit  
next July unless organizers agree to repay the full debt first 
before reimbursing the state, SLOC chief operating officer Fraser 
Bullock told the Olympic Coordination Committee, a legislative 
oversight panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're playing hardball,'' Tanner said.  
</P>
<P>
	``And they've got the checkbook,'' Bullock said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of America also is requiring SLOC to delay merchandise  
and ticket royalties to the United States Olympic Committee and 
International Olympic Committee, Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of America, he said, could have ``cut and run'' after  
the Salt Lake vote-buying scandal broke in December. In all, 10 IOC 
members were expelled or forced to resign for accepting cash or 
gifts while others received stern warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department launched an investigation in  
December, and criminal charges have been filed against a Salt Lake 
businessman who admitted creating a phony job and the son of an IOC 
member who was hired for that job in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of America ``became increasingly uncomfortable'' with  
SLOC's ability to raise enough money for the scandal-plagued games, 
Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America spokesman Richard Stilley didn't immediately  
return a call for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's new payback conditions mean the state won't get $59  
million as scheduled in January 2002. The state will have to wait 
until March of that year, after SLOC collects $230 million from 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll get paid a day after the bank gets paid,'' Fowler said.  
</P>
<P>
	By then, SLOC also will owe $40 million for a venue Legacy Fund.  
</P>
<P>
	Legislators on the oversight committee said they were willing to  
accept the tardy payment, but it will require a change in the law 
next legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to be the stumbling block,'' Sen. Al Mansell  
said. ``We also don't want to be the scapegoat.''

	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund  
expects the world economy to expand by 2.8 percent this year and by 
3.4 percent in 2000, according to preliminary IMF projections 
posted late Tuesday on the Dutch Finance Ministry's Internet site. 
</P>

	The document, placed for unknown reasons on the Finance

declined to give his name said the forecasts in the document were 
preliminary and could change before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The outlook for the expansion of the global economy as outlined  
in the document is an upward revision of the IMF's previous world 
economic outlook in May, when gross domestic product was seen to 
rise by 2.3 percent in 1999 and by 3.3 percent next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, IMF spokesman William Murray said that the IMF's  
executive board held discussions on a revised economic outlook last 
week but that ``final projections won't be ready until closer to 
the date of the scheduled publication.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF is scheduled to release its new ``World Economic  
Outlook'' on Sept. 22, in advance of the annual meetings of the 
182-nation IMF and its sister lending agency, the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finance Ministry said growth estimates for all ``Asian  
crisis countries'' have been revised upwards, and that the crises 
in Russia and Brazil are less problematic than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's 1999 GDP is expected to contract by only 1 percent,  
down from a previous 3.7 percent, and Russia's economy should 
shrink by 2 percent, down from an earlier forecast of 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Growth in Japan and Europe seems to be recovering and the  
expansion in the U.S. is continuing, almost without price or wage 
pressure,'' the document said. 
</P>
<P>
	It noted that the IMF now sees imbalances such as the highly  
valued stock market and the strong U.S. dollar as a danger for an 
overheating of the American economy, and said timely rate increases 
in the United States might be needed in order to prevent a ``hard 
landing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Japan, the preliminary economic outlook called for GDP  
growth of 0.2 percent in 1999 and a growth of 1 percent in 2000. 
``Several signals point to a limited recovery of the Japanese 
economy,'' the document read. 
</P>
<P>
	It said economic growth in the 11 countries committed to  
Europe's common currency should expand by 2.1 percent this year and 
by 2.8 percent in 2000. For the entire European Union, GDP was 
projected to increase by 1.9 percent in 1999 and by 2.7 percent 
next year.

<HEADLINE> Levi Strauss Hires Pepsi Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. tapped a savvy marketer  
from beverage giant PepsiCo to lead the struggling jeans maker from 
its prolonged slump and get Americans -- especially today's youth -- 
interested in wearing its jeans again. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Marineau, who has been credited with broadening Pepsi's  
appeal, was named president and chief executive officer on Tuesday. 
He succeeds Levi president Peter Jacobi, who stepped down in 
January after nearly three decades with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment is effective Sept. 27. Bob Haas, the former CEO,  
is continuing as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is not just a soft-drinks man. He is a marketer. He is what  
Levi's needs for the revitalization of its brand,'' said Kurt 
Barnard, a retail consultant and president of Barnard's Retail 
Trend Report in Upper Montclair, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1853 by a Bavarian entrepreneur who made sturdy,  
riveted work pants for Gold Rush miners, Levi's has watched its 
business falter in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been particularly hurt by waning interest from teens, who  
have shunned its stodgy five-pocket jeans in favor of trendier 
offerings from the likes of Old Navy, the Gap, Tommy Hilfiger and 
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining sales and profits forced Levi's to cut more than  
13,000 jobs and close 24 plants in the last two years in an effort 
to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the San Francisco-based company is hoping that Marineau,  
52, can breathe some new life into its ailing business. 
</P>
<P>
	Levi's, in a brief statement, said that Marineau was ``highly  
regarded as a talented brand builder and an innovative leader with 
a track record of expanding market share in competitive 
environments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Marineau's 20-month tenure as president and chief  
executive of Pepsi-Cola North America, the beverage company 
introduced its new Pepsi One diet drink and launched the very 
successful ``Joy of Cola'' campaign, featuring a cute girl who 
takes on the voices of Marlon Brando and Aretha Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, Marineau was also credited with helping improve  
Pepsi's marketing to a broader audience beyond teens. At Levi's, 
analysts said he will be charged to do just the opposite as the 
jeans maker aggressively targets the youth market. 
</P>
<P>
	Marineau was widely regarded as the likely successor to Pepsi  
chairman and CEO Roger Enrico. Steven Reinemund, named Tuesday as 
PepsiCo's chief operating officer, now appears to be the top 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jacobi resigned, Haas said the company would look for  
``somebody with a fresh set of eyes and different experience'' to 
challenge conventional thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was time for Levi's to recognize that its tired old ideas  
had simply played out,'' Barnard said. ``New ideas are necessary to 
bring this company back and they need someone that can think 
outside of the box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Pepsi, Marineau worked at Dean Foods Co. and  
Quaker Oats Co.

<HEADLINE> Seven Die in Iowa House Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHLAND, Iowa (AP) -- Propane gas might have fueled a powerful  
explosion that destroyed a house in this farming community, killing 
seven people and injuring six others, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just a hole in the ground,'' said Keokuk County  
Sheriff Ron George. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the survivors, the owner of the home, his 8-year-old  
daughter and two 10-year-old boys were thrown up to 30 feet away. 
Two women managed to crawl from the rubble at the rear of the 
house, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The three adults were dazed. The children, really, were in  
pretty good shape,'' said Renee Pfeifer, who was working at a 
convenience store when the house exploded Monday about 200 yards 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	George said today that it appeared that the victims were on the  
main floor of the one-story, ranch-style house when it blew up. 
</P>
<P>
	Six bodies were found in the basement and the seventh was found  
outside the house, the sheriff said. The remains were taken to Des 
Moines for identification. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff said the blast could have been fueled by liquid  
propane gas, which is widely used in areas not served by natural 
gas, but he wouldn't elaborate on whether it may have involved a 
line feeding into the house or whether appliances may have been 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Reif, who lived two blocks away, said she was one of the  
first people on the scene and helped care for the owner of the 
house, Jerry Usovsky. ``He kept saying, `The grill. The grill,''' 
she said, adding that there was a gas grill in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've known them forever,'' she said. ``They're wonderful  
people. He built that house himself and it was a beautiful home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Marian Dickinson said the blast jarred her house.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, what on earth did he just do,'' she said. ``I saw a  
flash and smoke. It was all-consuming. It was just terrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard crying and moaning,'' said Thomas Hoekstra, a  
convenience store employee. 
</P>
<P>
	The injured were taken to the burn unit at University Hospitals  
in Iowa City, about 50 miles northeast of Richland, a community of 
about 550 people. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Jerry Usovsky, they were identified as Barb Dyer  
of Richland; Bev Gartner of Iowa City; Trey Gartner, 10, of Iowa 
City; Josh Kleinmeyer, 10, of Iowa City; and Marlena Usovsky, 8, of 
Richland. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Usovsky, Dyer and Bev Gartner remained in critical  
condition today, hospital officials said. Trey Gartner was in 
serious condition, and Kleinmeyer and Marlena Usovsky were in fair 
condition.

<HEADLINE> Bergman Tells of Nazi Sympathies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Film director Ingmar Bergman says he  
was thrilled by Adolf Hitler as a young man but had a change of 
heart after seeing photos of concentration camps, according to a 
forthcoming book. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergman, 81, recounts his attraction to Nazism and its leader in  
a chapter of journalist Maria-Pia Boethius' ``Honor and 
Conscience,'' which discusses whether Sweden was genuinely neutral 
in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, made available Tuesday ahead of its release later this  
month, tells how Bergman, as an 18-year-old exchange student, spent 
the summer of 1936 in Germany with a Nazi family, who took him to 
hear Hitler speak. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hitler had incredible charisma,'' the book quotes him as  
saying. ``He electrified the crowd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back in Sweden, Bergman cheered for the Germans and didn't  
protest when his brother and friends painted a swastika on a house 
where a Jew lived, according to the book. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad was ultra-right. The big threat were the Bolsheviks,  
who were hated,'' the book quotes him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	When images from concentration camps were revealed, Bergman at  
first perceived them as Allied propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I realized the truth, the shock was incredible. Brutally  
and violently, my innocence was removed in one stroke,'' according 
to the book. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergman, whose films include ``Fanny and Alexander'' and ``Wild  
Strawberries,'' also has told of his Nazi sympathies in his 1987 
autobiography, ``The Magic Lantern.''

<HEADLINE> Black Leaders Criticize Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIMPSONVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Black leaders criticized Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush for trying to woo white South Carolina voters by 
dismissing an NAACP national tourism boycott of the state to force 
down the Confederate flag from the Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, while campaigning in the state Monday, declared that  
outsiders should ``butt out'' out of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	His stance shows he ``is wooing the white voters of South  
Carolina to support his candidacy,'' said the Rev. H.H. Singleton, 
president of the Conway branch of the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said the group's boycott plans were initiated by ``some  
people who don't live in South Carolina, evidently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if the civil rights group should back off, Bush said,  
``That's up to the NAACP.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate appearance later in the day, Bush said ``my advice  
is for people who don't live in South Carolina to butt out of the 
issue. The people of South Carolina can make that decision.'' That 
prompted cheers from holiday festival-goers in Simpsonville. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't particularly like it when people came in to tell me  
what to do in Texas,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and other candidates are courting South Carolinians for the  
Feb. 19 Republican primary, which is considered an important early 
barometer for how candidates will do in the conservative South. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag controversy has embroiled South Carolina for several  
years. The state is the only one to fly the Confederate flag over 
its Statehouse, although Georgia and Mississippi incorporate it 
into their state flags. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  
says the flag is a symbol of racism. But supporters say the flag 
represents Southern heritage and honors South Carolinians who died 
in the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic candidate Bill Bradley said in April that ``I  
wouldn't fly it. I think that it sometimes offends a large part of 
the population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walking in a Labor Day parade and attending another Labor Day  
festival in Simpsonville, Bush also said ``it's up to the people of 
South Carolina to figure out how best to fund their schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina residents will vote next year about whether they  
want a lottery to fund education improvements. South Carolina's 
schools lag behind others in Scholastic Assessment Test scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also countered criticism that he is anti-union.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm for job creation, and a person who's got a plan to make  
sure that our economy continues to produce high-paying, 
high-quality jobs is a friend of the working man,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also wouldn't join other Republicans in calling for the  
resignation of Attorney General Janet Reno over foul-ups in the 
Waco investigation. The FBI recently admitted it used combustible 
tear gas in the 1993 siege at the Branch Davidian compound in 
Texas. Bush avoided other issues controversial to South Carolina 
voters. The state will vote Nov. 2 if they want video gambling to 
remain legal. Bush would not take a stand, but said he always has 
been against gambling as governor of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has received $25,500 in gambling contributions for his  
presidential campaign, according to the Washington-based Center for 
Responsive Politics.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Criticizes GOP Tax-Cut Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLNEY, Md. (AP) -- Keeping up his criticism of the GOP tax-cut  
plan, President Clinton said Tuesday it would force cuts in 
education spending as classroom populations swell and schools 
across America need renewal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is basic arithmetic,'' Clinton told 400 students and  
parents outside Brooke Grove Elementary School. ``If we want the 
kind of America for our children that they deserve in the new 
century, we must invest more, not less, in education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said the Republican plan would force an education  
spending cut as deep as 20 percent in the fiscal starting Oct. 1 
and in the next 10 years slashes of as much as 50 percent in 
reading programs and in Head Start, which helps very young poor 
pupils prepare for school. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was joined by Rep. Connie Morella, a moderate Republican  
who represents Montgomery County, Md., where Brooke Grove school 
is. Clinton's remarks were designed to sharpen distinctions between 
his spending plans and the GOP's tax-cut program. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third time in four days that Clinton hit the  
education theme to criticize the GOP's $792 billion tax cut, which 
he says also would fail to shore up Social Security and Medicare or 
sufficiently pay down the federal debt. Clinton has vowed a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said Clinton would continue to press  
GOP leaders with a pair of health care events scheduled for 
Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., said the GOP plan respects limits set by the balanced 
budget agreement Clinton agreed to and includes provisions for 
school construction and to help parents save for education. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the president vetoes the tax bill, he vetoes tax relief  
that helps education,'' Feehery said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has acted on only two of 13 appropriation bills it  
needs to submit for Clinton's signature before the next fiscal year 
begins in October. Clinton noted that Washington often waits until 
the 11th hour to finish its work. ``It's now about 10:30,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Without openly taunting congressional leaders, he cast the issue  
of education spending as a lesson any grade-schooler should 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is basic arithmetic, the kind of things you learn in  
Brooke Grove,'' he said. ``It's basic arithmetic that if schools 
have record enrollments for four years in a row, and a third of the 
schools are in need of repair, you need more teachers and better 
schools.''

<HEADLINE> Reichel To Start Playing at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Robert Reichel has agreed to begin  
playing for a team in the Czech Republic, after failing to get a 
deal from the Phoenix Coyotes, Czech media reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Reichel will play for HC Litvinov at least until Oct. 1, when  
the NHL season begins, the daily newspaper Sport said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reichel, who earned $1.7 million last season, has been seeking a  
multiyear contract for more than $3 million a season. He said he 
would not return to the NHL if his expectations were not met. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have the right to get the salary I require.''  
Reichel told Sport, adding that he ``won't back down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Phoenix general manager Bobby Smith said Reichel  
wouldn't be playing for the Coyotes next season and that the team 
is open to ``reasonable trade offers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reichel, obtained in a March 20 trade with the New York  
Islanders for forward Brad Isbister, played 13 regular season and 
seven playoff games with the Coyotes before becoming a restricted 
free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	His 70 points last season (including 14 in 13 games with  
Phoenix) were two points behind Roenick, who led Phoenix. Reichel 
had 10 points in his first seven games with the team, then faltered 
during the playoffs against St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Reichel has complained that Czech players, winners at both the  
Nagano Winter Olympics and at the last world championships, were 
not being adequately paid in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Reichel -- who has 209 career goals -- has skipped an NHL season  
before. After back-to-back 40-goal seasons with Calgary, and 
scoring at a 40-goal pace in the strike-shortened 1994-95 season, 
he failed to reach a deal with the Flames. 
</P>
<P>
	The following season he played in the German Hockey League with  
the Frankfurt Lions. He returned to Calgary in 1996-97 and signed a 
three-year deal in Phoenix that expired at the end of the last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Reichel is not the only Czech player to start playing at home  
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaclav Varada of the Buffalo Sabres will play for his native HC  
Vitkovice; and Ottawa's Radek Bonk -- a member of the gold 
medal-winning Czech team at the 1996 World Championships -- will 
play for HC Pardubice. Both players have contract disagreements 
with their NHL clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman Hamrlik, one of the NHL's best defensemen, may play for HC  
Zlin if he doesn't reach an agreement with Edmonton Oilers. Hamrlik 
is seeking a deal for at least $2.5 million a year, while Oilers GM 
Glen Sather has reportedly only offered a $2 million salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Although getting only a fraction of the salary they would  
receive in the NHL, Czech players often decide to return home 
rather than being not paid adequately.

<HEADLINE> Lions Get by Without Sanders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- After having Barry Sanders to call their  
own, it's doubtful any running back will ever be revered by Detroit 
Lions fans again. Greg Hill, picked up in a trade just before the 
end of the preseason, seems to know that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the next Barry Sanders,'' Hill said. ``In fact, I  
won't even be the main G. Hill in this town. I believe that honor 
would go to that Grant Hill guy, plays some hoops for the 
Pistons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smart. Does his homework.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, it's not likely to help the Lions much. The club went  
5-11 last season with the most exciting running back in football in 
the lineup. That wasn't much fun, and Sanders retired despite 
needing only 1,458 yards to break Walter Payton's NFL career 
rushing record of 16,726 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	There is absolutely no reason to believe they'll do any better  
with Hill and backup Ron Rivers trying to pick up the slack left by 
Sanders' exit. 
</P>
<P>
	Even coach Bobby Ross admits that much. But the coach prefers to  
put a little spin on the woeful situation that could cost him his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way you're going to be able to replace somebody of  
Barry Sanders' talents and the unique things he can do on the 
field,'' Ross said. ``But we have the capability of having a more 
reliable ground game than what people may think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Sanders in the backfield, opponents would bring anywhere  
from seven to nine defenders near the line of scrimmage last 
season. The theory was that with rookie Charlie Batch playing 
quarterback, there wasn't much danger of getting burned through the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
	They would take Sanders out of the game and dare Batch to beat  
them. Obviously, he couldn't do it often. So, only if Batch can 
play beyond his age and experience this season do the Lions have 
much chance of improving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel as if we are moving forward,'' said Batch, who  
completed 57.1 percent of his passes last season. ``We just need to 
stop beating ourselves with penalties and stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no sign of improvement in that area during the  
exhibition season. The Lions went 1-3, wrapping it up with a 17-6 
loss to the St. Louis Rams in which Detroit drew nine penalties for 
74 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't do what we are capable of doing in training camp,  
and that's not a good thing,'' said Herman Moore, one of the 
league's best receivers. ``But I'm still very optimistic, because I 
know how good we can be once we get going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever it takes, Ross has to push the right buttons. He was so  
angry, he asked the NFL if he could fine players who commit dumb 
penalties. His request was denied, so he makes them run extra laps. 
</P>
<P>
	But he clearly is frustrated by the situation.  
</P>
<P>
	``To me, people have to be competitive,'' Ross said. ``You've  
got to have a fire for this game. You've got to have that and I 
don't care whether it's in checkers or tiddlywinks or whatever the 
case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the plus side, Batch has four good receivers to throw to in  
Moore, Johnnie Morton, Germane Crowell and Brian Stablein. Tight 
end David Sloan also can catch. 
</P>
<P>
	But not even Hall of Famer Bobby Layne, still the benchmark for  
Detroit quarterbacks, could throw from the seat of his pants. And 
that's going to be a challenge for Batch, especially with the 
offensive line riddled by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Aaron Gibson, expected to play one tackle, is out for the  
season with a shoulder injury. Center Mike Compton will miss a few 
more weeks with a knee injury. Ray Roberts will start at left 
tackle and Jeff Hartings at right guard. The rest of the line will 
be patchwork. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense is solid across the front with Robert Porcher, James  
Jones, Luther Elliss and Travis Kirschke, who replaces Tracy 
Scroggins (knee surgery). The linebacking corps is decent with top 
draft pick Chris Claiborne, Stephen Boyd and Allen Aldridge. 
</P>
<P>
	But the secondary, already suspect, has been further depleted by  
injuries. Kevin Abrams will start the season on the sidelines, 
Terry Fair -- who led the NFL in kickoff returns last season -- is 
playing on a gimpy knee, and Bryant Westbrook is wearing a soft 
cast to protect a broken bone in his hand that required surgery. 
Only safety Mark Carrier is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Placekicker Jason Hanson and punter John Jett both are solid.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every year since I've been here, we've talked about how  
important it is to get off to a good start,'' said Elliss, who 
missed most of camp with a broken cheekbone from a summer surfing 
accident. ``But we've never actually been able to do it. 
</P>
<P>

it doesn't work.''

<HEADLINE> How Gun Poll Was Compiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Associated Press poll on guns is based on telephone  
interviews with 1,026 randomly selected adults from all states 
except Alaska and Hawaii. The interviews were conducted Aug. 27-31 
by ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were weighted to represent the population by  
demographic factors such as age, sex, region and education. 
</P>
<P>
	No more than one time in 20 should chance variations in the  
sample cause the results to vary by more than 3 percentage points 
from the answers that would be obtained if all Americans were 
polled. 
</P>
<P>
	This margin of sampling error is larger for responses of  
subgroups, such as income categories. There are other sources of 
potential error in polls, including the wording and order of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll's questions:  
</P>
<P>
	1. Do you favor stricter gun control laws or do you oppose them?  
</P>
<P>
	--Favor, 56 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--Oppose, 39 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--Don't know/refused, 5 percent  

</P>
<P>
	2. Which of these do you think is more likely to decrease gun  
violence? 
</P>
<P>
	--Better enforcement of existing gun laws, 49 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--Tougher gun laws, 43 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--Neither, 5 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--Don't know/refused, 2 percent  

</P>
<P>
	3. The federal government requires background checks for most  
gun purchases. Do you think these background checks help reduce the 
number of crimes committed with guns, or not? 
</P>
<P>
	--Helps, 44 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--Doesn't help, 52 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--Don't know/refused, 4 percent  

</P>
<P>
	4. A number of violent incidents involving guns have been in the  
news recently. Which statement best describes your feelings about 
those incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	--The shootings make me worry more about my personal safety, 53  
percent 
</P>
<P>
	--The shootings are random acts of violence that don't affect me  
personally, 41 percent 
</P>
<P>
	--Neither, 4 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--Don't know/refused, 2 percent  

</P>
<P>
	5. Does anyone in your household own a gun?  
</P>
<P>
	--Yes, 41 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--No, 57 percent  
</P>
<P>
	--Don't know/refused, 2 percent

<HEADLINE> Funeral Held for Umpire Coble's Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Umpires' bitterness over their lost jobs was  
evident at Tuesday's funeral service for the wife of American 
League umpire Drew Coble. 
</P>
<P>
	``His family has been abandoned by major league baseball and his  
bosses,'' said AL umpire Richie Garcia, a pallbearer at Kim Coble's 
funeral. ``That's basically the sad part at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia and Coble were among the 22 members of the Major League  
Umpires Association whose resignations were accepted by baseball 
and let go last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Several umpires -- those let go and others who stayed -- and their  
wives attended Kim Coble's funeral in the Cobles' small hometown of 
Graham, about 20 miles southeast of Greensboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Coble, 44, was first treated in the spring with what doctors  
thought was pneumonia. In June, doctors said she had cancer and it 
had spread throughout her body. She died Sunday at her home, three 
days after Coble lost his job. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was very supportive of his profession and friends,'' said  
Don Denkinger, another pallbearer and a retired AL umpire. Coble 
was a rookie when he first worked with Denkinger, now an umpire 
evaluator for the AL. 
</P>
<P>
	Denkinger's wife came to Graham two weeks ago to help Coble's  
family. The Cobles, alumni of nearby Elon College, also took in 
Denkinger's daughter while she was attending Elon. 
</P>
<P>
	``All umpires are family,'' Denkinger said. ``This thing has  
torn affiliations and friendships apart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	National League umpire Steve Rippley, who said Friday he may  
retire, said Kim Coble attended umpire meetings and supported 
Coble's career. Rippley declined additional comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires voted in July to resign Sept. 2, saying they wanted to  
induce bargaining for a labor deal to replace the one that expires 
Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plan collapsed when many AL umpires either failed to  
resign or quickly withdrew their resignations. By the time all 
umpires withdrew the resignations, baseball hired 25 umpires from 
the minor leagues and accepted the resignations of 22 veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	Coble said he never signed a letter of resignation and will take  
his case to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe he will do everything in his power to get his job  
back,'' Denkinger said.

<HEADLINE> Cisneros Pleads Guilty to One Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros  
pleaded guilty Tuesday to a misdemeanor charge of lying to the FBI 
about payments to an ex-mistress, reaching agreement in the 
four-year, $9 million-plus investigation just as his trial on 18 
felony counts was to begin. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Clinton Cabinet member, once considered a rising  
Democratic Party star, must pay a $10,000 fine but will face no 
jail time or probation under the agreement. He had been charged by 
an independent counsel with conspiracy, obstruction of justice and 
lying to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the highest-ranking Clinton administration official to be  
convicted of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros admitted in court that he falsely told the FBI, while  
under consideration for a Cabinet post, that he had never paid his 
ex-mistress more than $2,500 monthly. He gave Linda Jones more than 
$250,000 between 1989 and 1994, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I accept responsibility for the conduct as outlined,''  
Cisneros told U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin. Cisneros' lawyer 
was at his side. His wife, Mary Alice, was not in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros, a former San Antonio mayor who is now president of the  
Spanish-language television network Univision in Los Angeles, left 
the courthouse without talking to reporters. But in a prepared 
statement, he said: ``I regret my lack of candor. ... I hope that 
all who follow me in public service learn the lesson that truth and 
candor are important in the process of selecting our leaders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In accepting the plea agreement, the judge said: ``I know there  
will be some second-guessing about this plea. There will be some 
who will say that the sanction is not tough enough and others who 
will say here is more evidence of the Independent Counsel Act as 
not serving the public interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sporkin's own bottom line: ``We cannot permit an individual to  
lie his way into high public office. ... The work of the 
independent counsel in this case reaffirms the importance of 
telling the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Independent Counsel David Barrett, whose investigation would  
appear to be winding to a close with Cisneros' plea, told 
reporters: ``We are just glad to have this over and done with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The independent counsel also had prosecuted Ms. Jones, whose  
earlier immunity deal was revoked after she was found to have lied 
to prosecutors. She was sentenced last year to 3 1/2 years in prison, 
pleading guilty to conspiracy, bank fraud, money laundering and 
obstruction of justice. In July, Barrett decided not to prosecute 
two Cisneros aides who were indicted with Cisneros and Ms. Jones in 
December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``This disposition should in no way be viewed as minimizing the  
serious ethical breach by Mr. Cisneros,'' Barrett said in a 
prepared statement on Tuesday's agreement. ``However, a just 
disposition of any prosecution must include an evaluation of the 
defendant's overall conduct. In this case, the conduct, while 
egregious, was committed by a person whose life has been otherwise 
dedicated to public service, and this fact must season the final 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The charges against Cisneros had said that while he was being  
considered for a Cabinet post he conspired with Ms. Jones and his 
two aides to conceal the scope of his payments. He had pleaded 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Tuesday they were dismissing two remaining  
felony counts pending against Ms. Jones under the 1997 indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones was to be the government's star witness. But she was a  
shaky witness at best during a pretrial appearance, with her 
credibility under constant attack from Cisneros' high-profile legal 
team. She had agreed to testify in a bid to gain a reduction in her 
prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent counsel had won a victory during the 13-day  
hearings in July, with Sporkin agreeing to allow into evidence 26 
tape recordings that she had secretly made of her conversations 
with Cisneros as their relationship soured. 
</P>
<P>
	The recordings, some of which the government acknowledges were  
edited, capture conversations in which she and Cisneros discussed 
their financial dealings. The tapes, most of which have yet to be 
heard publicly, also reflect Cisneros' characterizations of his 
discussions about the money with the Clinton transition team and 
the FBI agents conducting his Cabinet background check. 
</P>
<P>
	During that background check, Cisneros admitted giving Ms. Jones  
financial support after their affair burst into public view in 1988 
while he was San Antonio's mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros, who served as HUD secretary from 1993 through 1996,  
has said he offered financial support because he felt sorry for Ms. 
Jones after their affair became public. Tuesday, he said he 
understated the payments in part to protect Ms. Jones and his wife 
and also because he wasn't sure of how much he actually had paid 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Larry Scalise told the court: ``I just want to affirm  
again that Mr. Cisneros is pleading guilty because he is guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones filed a breach-of-contract suit against Cisneros in  
Texas in 1994, charging he had reneged on his promise to support 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	A few months later, she took her claims to the tabloid TV show  
``Inside Edition,'' where she accused Cisneros of lying to the FBI. 
Based on that accusation, Attorney General Janet Reno initiated a 
Justice Department inquiry and in 1995 requested the appointment of 
an independent counsel.

	Cisneros Pleads Guilty to One Count  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros agreed  
today to plead guilty to a single misdemeanor count of lying to the 
FBI, ending a four-year investigation by an independent counsel. 
Cisneros appeared before U.S. District Stanley Spoorkin to 
acknowledge that during his background checks for a post in the 
Clinton administration, he falsely told FBI investigators that he 
had paid his former lover no more than $2,500 monthly.

	11 Die in Earthquake in Greece  
</P>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- The strongest earthquake to hit Athens in  
nearly a century toppled buildings this afternoon, sending hundreds 
of thousands of terrified people into debris-littered streets. At 
least 11 people died and nearly 100 were reported missing. Dozens 
of people were injured by falling glass, concrete and marble slabs 
shaken loose by the 10-second quake, which had a preliminary 
magnitude of 5.9. State television reported at least 11 people dead 
-- most crushed and a few suffering fatal heart attacks. The exact 
number of missing was not known, but state media said about two 
dozen people were trapped in flattened apartment buildings and 
about 70 workers were unaccounted for at a collapsed foam products 
factory north of Athens.

	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia freed an East Timorese rebel  
leader today after seven years of detention, hoping he could help 
calm the desperate situation in his native half-island territory 
after it voted for independence. However, with pro-Indonesian 
militias killing and burning in a rampage on East Timor, it may be 
too dangerous for Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao -- widely 
expected to become its first president -- to even set foot in his 
homeland for now. At his first news conference, Gusmao predicted 
that he would inherit a country emptied by ``genocide,'' and blamed 
the upheaval on his longtime enemy: the Indonesian armed forces.

	RIVER ROUGE, Mich. (AP) -- About 600 people were evacuated from  
their suburban Detroit homes as a precaution today after the 
derailment of a railroad tanker that possibly contained a toxic 
chemical. Ecorse Police Chief Robert Royals said the tanker may 
contain ethylene oxide, which can cause severe burns and ``might 
even have the potential to be lethal if inhaled.'' There was no 
sign of leakage, but officials were monitoring the overturned 
tanker to make sure. The cause of the derailment, which happened 
about 8 a.m., wasn't known.

low-lying areas in the mainland states of Colima, Jalisco,

phones at the Correctional Industrial Facility to bet on football 
and hockey games with a Las Vegas bookmaker in November.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A car jumped the sidewalk Tuesday and plowed  
into a crowd of people waiting for a medical screening outside a 
welfare office, injuring 15 people, one critically. 
</P>
<P>
	Driver Christina Williams, 44, told investigators she  
accidentally hit the gas pedal instead of the brake and lost 
control of the car, California Highway Patrol Officer John Tye 
said. 
</P>

	Witnesses said the car was moving at 10 to 15 mph, Tye said. One  
person was in hospitalized in critical condition, and others, 
Williams included, suffered minor to moderate injuries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams declined to take a field sobriety test and was not  
arrested. Tye said investigators found what appeared to be a crack 
pipe in the car. Blood tests will be performed to determine whether 
Williams was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, he said.

<HEADLINE> MetroStars' Defender Eager To Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- Lothar Matthaeus is interested in  
becoming the coach of the New York-New Jersey MetroStars if Bora 
Milutinovic quits or is fired from the last-place team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be that Bora gives up -- then I could take over,'' the  
38-year-old defender said in an interview with the weekly magazine 
Sport Bild, which was released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthaeus, voted Germany's player of the year last season with  
Bayern Munich, will join the MetroStars after the German 
Bundesliga's midseason break. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars have lost a Major League Soccer-record 12  
consecutive games and are 5-22-3 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthaeus is said to be trying to convince former Italian stars  
Guiseppe Bergomi and Roberto Donadoni to help him turn around the 
MetroStars. Both are 35. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to put together a good team, one with the right mix of  
veterans and hungry players,'' Matthaeus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergomi retired last season at Internazionale of Milan after  
playing three World Cups for Italy. Donadoni played for the 
MetroStars in 1996-97 before rejoining AC Milan.

<HEADLINE> Farm Consolidation Said Dangerous / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) -- Sweeping changes in agriculture in  
recent years -- with rising numbers of mergers creating giant 
agribusiness conglomerates -- pose the greatest threat to farmers 
and consumers in this century, top farm experts warned. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa State University economist Neil Harl said not only do  
high-profile mergers cut into competition in the farm economy, they 
place keys to evolving technologies in the hands of fewer and fewer 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outcome would be a smaller share of the revenue from  
production going to the producer,'' Harl said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harl, contacted by telephone, was among those testifying at a  
special hearing called by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Sen. Charles 
Grassley, R-Iowa, to discuss a trend toward increasing 
concentration in many sectors of the farm economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers complain of being crushed by market-manipulating  
corporations. They argue that U.S. Agriculture and Justice 
Department officials give lip service to preventing monopolies but 
continue to approve mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Justice Department has been blowing a lot of smoke the  
last six or seven years,'' said farmer Larry Ginther of Marshall 
County in central Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's top antitrust attorney, Joel Klein,  
said his agency is trying to be responsive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your issues are front and center at the Department of  
Justice,'' said Klein, who spearheaded the government's antitrust 
case against Microsoft. ``You have to analyze each merger to see 
whether it is helpful or harmful. If we start to overreact, we are 
going to do more harm than good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Dunn, U.S. Department of Agriculture undersecretary for  
marketing and regulatory programs, said his agency is pushing 
Congress for laws forcing meat packers to disclose prices they are 
paying for animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has to be real teeth in the law,'' Dunn said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dunn argued that the USDA pushes hard to enforce the Packers and  
Stockyards Act, which oversees the meat industry but lacks the 
authority to regulate prices strictly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not have blanket authority to declare something  
unfair,'' Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin said he likely would favor toughening federal antitrust  
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to make some changes in the legislation,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The hearing comes at a time when producers face historic low  
prices for commodities and emotions are running high. The economic 
squeeze threatens to force thousands of farmers from their land. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of activists jammed a community college gymnasium for  
the hearing, cheering and leaping to their feet as one after 
another argued that big business is taking advantage of family 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a bipartisan tinge to the conference. Grassley, a  
conservative Republican, said all sides worry about rapidly 
consolidating agribusinesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously this is a difficult time for farmers,'' Grassley  
said. ``We agree on one thing -- that concentration is having a 
detrimental effect on farmers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., went a step further, saying there  
should be an end to mergers and consolidations among agribusinesses 
while lawmakers study revisions to antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm calling for a moratorium on mergers and acquisitions,''  
Wellstone said. ``On the present course, we're going to lose a 
whole generation of producers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drawing much attention at Tuesday's session was a merger  
announced last week in which Smithfield Foods Inc., of Smithfield, 
Va., a major meat processor, acquired Murphy Family Farms, a giant 
hog producer with many operations in Iowa.

<HEADLINE> Frankel May Fight Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- He surrounded himself with women and an  
opulent Connecticut mansion, and created as many as six or more 
different identities for himself. Now, alleged con artist Martin 
Frankel finds himself utterly alone, fearful of those who may be 
seeking revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel's German attorney said the man who eluded authorities  
for four months is nervous and depressed, worried about unspecified 
groups or people who may be after him because of the millions he 
allegedly bilked from investors and donors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thinks about what happened, about his past,'' said Thomas  
Piplak, the Hamburg attorney representing Frankel. ``He is 
frightened, uncomfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The overarching emotion that Frankel feels right now is fear,  
Piplak said. Although Frankel hasn't been specific, Piplak said he 
has reason to believe stories of possible danger in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	``He fears being attacked because he knows a lot of things,''  
his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason the alleged rogue financier was in Germany is  
unclear, but Piplak said he wanted to come to Europe. He is 
confused by being subjected to a legal system to which he's not 
accustomed, but the attorney said Frankel may still prolong his 
stay in Germany by fighting extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not afraid to go back to the United States. He's afraid  
he won't be secure,'' Piplak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, 44, was arrested Saturday night in Hamburg's Hotel  
Prem, ending a four-month international manhunt. Police say he 
siphoned at least $218 million from several insurance companies; a 
lawsuit by some of them puts the loss at $915 million. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as $1.98 billion may also be missing from the St.  
Francis of Assisi Foundation, which investigators say was 
established by Frankel in the British Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	When police used a spare key to open his hotel room door on  
Saturday, they say they found him with an unspecified sum of cash, 
diamonds, a computer and numerous fake passports. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was surprised by being arrested. He didn't expect it,''  
Piplak said. 
</P>
<P>
	When found, Frankel was accompanied by a woman who was  
identified by the FBI as 35-year-old Cynthia Allison. Allison, who 
was traveling under the alias Susan Kelly, flew economy class back 
to New York on Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported today. She 
was expecting to meet her lawyer after landing at John F. Kennedy 
International Airport, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Allison said she and Frankel were never romantically involved.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was just a friend,'' she told the newspaper, but declined to  
say why she joined Frankel in Germany. Allison started working for 
Frankel in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have not yet received extradition papers from the  
United States, and Frankel is being held on a German charge of 
possessing a fake British passport. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamburg's Holstenglacis prison, where Frankel can expect to pass  
the months before his extradition case is decided, has a reputation 
as a tough place filled with drug suspects awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, he wears his own clothes -- a blue shirt and khaki pants  
-- and has requested kosher meals for religious reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Unshaven and appearing morose during the hour-long meeting with  
his lawyer, Frankel didn't elaborate on who he thinks might be 
pursuing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Piplak said he suggested Frankel write out the reasons for his  
fears for a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lawyer said Frankel -- who has been described by other  
acquaintances as a pathological liar -- is worried people won't take 
his story seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doubtful whether anybody will believe him,'' Piplak said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Expected To Delay Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans will probably delay  
writing a bill financing health, education and other programs until 
at least next week, underlining their inability to decide how to 
pay for the year's biggest spending measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate appropriations committees both planned to  
write separate $300 billion measures this week financing the 
departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services for 
fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1. Congress returns from its August 
recess on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But GOP and Democratic aides in both chambers said the  
legislation would probably be written next week at the earliest. 
The chief problem is that Republicans are still struggling to 
decide how to finance the measure without using the Social Security 
surplus, money that both parties have repeatedly pledged not to 
spend. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans must find about $16 billion in savings if they are  
to avoid using Social Security funds to help pay for the measure. 
Among the options they have considered are cutting federal payments 
to the states for Medicaid, welfare and child support enforcement. 
The nation's governors have opposed those proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlighting the GOP's problem, an analysis by the nonpartisan  
Congressional Budget Office says that congressional spending 
proposals, if enacted, would already eat into Social Security's 
surplus -- even without the labor-health bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the CBO projected a fiscal 2000 surplus of $14 billion,  
excluding Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	But in an Aug. 26 letter to Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., CBO  
Director Dan Crippen said that based on assumptions adopted so far 
by lawmakers, that surplus would become a $13 billion deficit if 
House proposals became law and a $16 billion shortfall under Senate 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBO said expenditures eating away the surplus included $5  
billion Republicans would use next year for their 10-year, $792 
billion tax cut, and $7 billion for Senate-passed aid to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the House has ordered the CBO to boost its savings  
estimates by $17 billion, while the Senate has directed it to add 
$16 billion in savings, Crippen wrote.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Hermansen 0-3 in Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Chad Hermansen finally realized he was headed  
to the big leagues when he glanced at the lineup card before 
Triple-A Nashville's final game. 
</P>
<P>
	He looked once, then twice. It read ``Hermansen, RF'' not center  
field, the position he had played in 124 previous games. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, it hit him: the Pittsburgh Pirates have a center fielder  
named Brian Giles. He was going to Pittsburgh, and it was time to 
change positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw right field and I said, `Well, OK,''' said Hermansen,  
considered the Pirates' top outfield prospect since Barry Bonds. 
``I heard I might be playing a little bit of every outfield 
position here, and I hadn't played right field since high school. I 
said, `Wow, this is kind of weird.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Or, about the same feeling he got upon entering Three Rivers  
Stadium on Tuesday after hitting .270 with 32 homers and 97 RBIs at 
Nashville despite sitting out two weeks with pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium was bigger than expected. So was the buildup,  
following weeks of speculation concerning when Hermansen would 
arrive. The position was different, too: Left field, the first time 
he has played there this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've dreamed of this, just like every player,'' said  
Hermansen, who flew to Pittsburgh following Nashville's final game 
Monday. ``Now I'm here, and it's very overwhelming, with everyone 
asking me questions, coming into a stadium that's just gigantic. 
It's a feeling that's indescribable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hermansen went 0-for-3 in his big league debut, lining out to  
left field on a backhanded catch by Reggie Sanders in the second 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a hit, but it felt good just to put the ball  
in play,'' Hermansen said. ``I wasn't as nervous as I thought I 
would be. I tried not to think too much and just put the ball in 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interestingly, Bonds also made a defensive adjustment shortly  
after joining the Pirates in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	They initially put him in center, where he played in the minors,  
but switched him to left field early in the 1987 season after 
trading for Andy Van Slyke. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Hermansen isn't accustomed to change. He began his  
minor league career at shortstop but, a ton of throwing errors 
later, was tried at second base, then left field before settling 
into center field, which he considers his natural position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really never considered myself a good shortstop, but I was  
drafted for my bat,'' he said. ``I feel I'm a decent athlete and I 
can play a certain amount of positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll probably play all three outfield positions before the  
season ends in three weeks. He'll probably start in left for Al 
Martin against left-handers and in right field against 
right-handers. Giles hasn't had much time off, so Hermansen may 
make several starts in center, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermansen, who turns 22 on Friday, prefers to play center but is  
willing to play left or right to stay in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to make adjustments,'' he said. ``It's all part of  
the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hermansen got a loud ovation when he stepped into the batter's  
box against San Diego left-hander Sterling Hitchcock in the bottom 
of the second. He took a strike, then lashed a line drive to left 
field that Sanders speared with a nice catch. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans gave him an even louder ovation.  
</P>
<P>
	Pirates manager Gene Lamont has seen Hermansen play in winter  
ball and spring training, and expects to see the same live bat and 
power he saw there. He also expects to see a touch of nervousness 
and tentativeness. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big jump, a big jump, from Triple-A to the major  
leagues,'' Lamont said. ``But I want to see what he can do.''

<HEADLINE> Nurse on Trial for Hospital Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAZIL, Ind. (AP) -- A former nurse charged with killing seven  
elderly patients with drug injections went on trial Tuesday, with a 
prosecutor accusing him of exercising life-and-death power that 
``belongs in the hands of God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orville Lynn Majors Jr., 38, faces life in prison if convicted  
in the deaths, which took place at Vermillion County Hospital. He 
has said all of the patients died of natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence in this case will reveal the story of a man who  
took into his hands the kind of power we as a society have decided 
belongs in the hands of God,'' prosecutor Nina Alexander said in 
her opening statement. ``This man exercised this power on the sick 
and the elderly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said medical experts will testify that the death of  
each patient was consistent with injections of potassium chloride. 
Vials containing traces of the drug and syringes were found at 
Majors' home and in his van, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney I. Marshall Pinkus told the jury that the  
patients were in fragile health and that doctors for the seven 
patients will testify in Majors' defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know these people better than any of the other experts  
and doctors you will hear from in this case,'' Pinkus said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the patients had heart disease, prostate cancer and  
pneumonia when he was admitted, and his condition was so dire that 
an emergency room nurse provided grief counseling to the family, 
Pinkus said. The patient died the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	The case started when nursing supervisor Dawn Stirek grew  
alarmed at a rise in deaths at the hospital's intensive care unit. 
Stirek began checking employee time cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Stirek's study found that Majors was on duty for 130 of 147  
deaths in the ICU from May 1993 to March 1995. In each of the 
previous four years, no more than 31 ICU patients died. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a consultant found that ICU patients were 43 times  
more likely to die when Majors was on duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Stirek, the first of two witnesses called Tuesday, testified she  
reported her findings to hospital executives in March 1995. Majors 
was promptly suspended from his job, she told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was worried it was bad luck that one person could be present  
for so many deaths,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Majors' lawyers said authorities have made him a scapegoat after  
spending almost three years and $1.5 million looking into the 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The state nursing board suspended Majors' license in 1995 for  
providing medical care -- including giving injections -- that went 
beyond his authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of heavy publicity, jurors were picked last week from  
the Peru area, about 150 miles northeast of Brazil, and will be 
sequestered during the week for the duration of the trial.

<HEADLINE> Gore Offers Plan for Uninsured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore today will offer a  
wide-ranging package of proposals aimed at bringing millions of 
uninsured Americans into the health care system and improving 
coverage for those already in it. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore plans to make it clear that, if elected president, he  
would pursue the same incremental approach to changing managed care 
that President Clinton adopted after his attempt to revamp the 
system failed to win congressional approval in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have all learned that we cannot overhaul the system in one  
fell swoop,'' Gore said in remarks prepared for a speech at a 
hospital here today. ``Experience has taught us that there is a way 
to keep what is right, while fixing what is wrong with American 
health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the Democratic presidential candidate's plan  
would be a guarantee that by 2005, every child in the nation would 
have access to affordable health care. 
</P>
<P>
	The Children's Health Fund, an advocacy group for disadvantaged  
children, estimates some 11 million children have no health 
insurance and almost as many have inadequate plans or live in 
places without enough doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	To help insure more children, Gore would expand the Children's  
Health Insurance Program, which helps states provide coverage to 
children in working families. Currently, states can use the federal 
CHIP money to cover children in families that earn up to 200 
percent of the poverty level. Gore would raise that cap to 250 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore would also allow families that do not qualify for the  
program, and do not receive health benefits through their jobs, to 
buy into the program. He would give financial bonuses to states 
that meet enrollment targets for CHIP and Medicaid, programs he 
believes are not fully utilized. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the fastest-growing group of uninsured Americans are  
those between 55 and 65. Currently, Americans are eligible for 
Medicare at 65. Gore proposed allowing ``vulnerable Americans'' to 
buy into the program as early as age 55 and he promised a 25 
percent tax credit to help defray the cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Let people with disabilities keep Medicare or Medicaid when  
they returned to the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	--Encourage small businesses to band together to negotiate rates  
for their workers' coverage by providing a 25 percent tax credit to 
the firms. 
</P>
<P>
	--Press for a ``real, enforceable'' Patients' Bill of Rights,  
similar to legislation that Congress will consider when it returns 
this month from recess. Gore didn't explicitly say in his remarks 
whether he favors allowing patients to sue their health maintenance 
organizations and collect damages when care has been denied. But, 
he has promoted Democratic legislation this year that would do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's ``bill of rights'' would guarantee patients the right to  
see a specialist, and ensure doctors can tell patients all their 
medical options. It would guarantee that pregnant women and cancer 
patients wouldn't have to change doctors in the middle of 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that it also would require managed care companies  
to cover mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make sure that a patient with depression is given  
access to care on terms no different from a patient who has 
diabetes,'' he said. ``And I will begin by improving mental health 
services for those who receive Medicaid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore promised to establish new public-private partnerships to  
expand access to prevention and wellness programs and to promote 
such initiatives in the workplace. He didn't say what the 
government's role would be, however, nor did he say how he would 
finance the new initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's proposal staked out ground between that of his Democratic  
rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley, who has said he will propose 
something approaching universal coverage, and Republicans, who fear 
that imposing too many mandates on private health care firms will 
drive up costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Others will argue against reforming our health care system  
carefully, realistically, and step-by-step. Some of them will tell 
you that the only acceptable answer is a one-size-fits-all 
solution,'' Gore said, in an apparent reference to Bradley.

<HEADLINE> Indianapolis Star Columnist Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A TV columnist for The Indianapolis Star and  
News was fired Tuesday for allegedly plagiarizing material from 
other publications. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Hall, who recently was suspended for one apparent incident  
of plagiarism, was dismissed after a review turned up more 
examples, according to an announcement Tuesday on the newspaper's 
Web site by Executive Editor Frank Caperton. 
</P>
<P>
	``In these cases, stories published under Hall's byline were  
similar to stories that had appeared in other publications,'' 
Caperton wrote. ``Hall had been warned at the time of his 
suspension that he would be dismissed if further lapses came to 
light.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caperton declined further comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Hall did not return calls Tuesday from The Associated Press. He  
told WRTV, an Indianapolis TV station, that he wishes the newspaper 
had handled the situation differently. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's unfortunate that I'm being fired over  
similarities in a handful of stories considering that I wrote more 
than 5,200 stories during the 12 years I worked for the Star,'' 
Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 27, Hall was suspended for three weeks without pay after  
editors at the paper noticed a story he had submitted for 
publication was similar to one published in a different newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The apparently plagiarized story was never published.  
</P>
<P>
	Hall, who had been a TV writer at the newspaper for 13 years,  
apologized in a statement that was run on the front page of the 
newspaper the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of time pressures, I made a stupid mistake and  
violated a sacred law of our profession,'' he said in the 
statement. ``I apologize to our readers and my family, co-workers 
and friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newsroom staffs of the Star and News merged in 1995 and the  
News is due to close Oct. 1.

<HEADLINE> Guitar Wars Are Heating Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- To owners of small music shops, the recent  
arrival of a Guitar Center chain store was like an earsplitting 
Jimi Hendrix solo. It was impossible to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Craig, owner of Classic Axe in the nearby Washington  
suburb of Manassas, stopped by to see the new threat to his 
business. He did not like what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guitars are a passion for me,'' Craig said. ``Those big  
places, they would be selling nails if they thought they could make 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Craig is on the front lines of the Guitar Wars, where national  
``category killer'' retail chains -- of which The Guitar Center is 
the biggest -- are trying to use their buying power and massive 
selections to lure customers. Just as Home Depot or Circuit City 
have crowded out small hardware and electronics stores, The Guitar 
Center wants to use its muscle to outsell mom and pop instrument 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Washington area, The Guitar Center opened two stores this  
summer, and company executives have said they plan to open two more 
in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixty-two locations nationwide and more to come!'' blared a  
flier at the Fairfax store. The chain hopes to have nearly 70 
stores by the end of 1999. It has stores in nearly every major East 
Coast market, and is opening for the first time in New Orleans, Las 
Vegas and Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary, them being there,'' said Kevin Landes, manager at  
Foxes Music in Falls Church. ``They have a lot of money. We can't 
afford to advertise the way they do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based in Agoura Hills, Calif., The Guitar Center began as a  
single store on Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills in 1964 and 
expanded over the years until it went public in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides independent stores, it has competition from two other  
chains, second-largest Sam Ash Music and No. 3 Mars. Sam Ash has 29 
stores, and Mars, which added 10 stores in 1998, has 26. 
</P>
<P>
	While independent music store owners are concerned about the  
chains, it's unclear whether the so-called ``big box'' stores will 
kill the corner music shops or go bust themselves in their race to 
expand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wonder where they think all these guitar players are  
going to come from,'' Landes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Expansion may have had a role in a $149,000 loss The Guitar  
Center reported for its second quarter. The company said the loss 
was due in part to softness in demand for high-tech equipment, but 
the retailer also attributed its performance to competition in some 
markets where it has opened additional stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The retail musical instrument sector has grown about 7 percent  
annually for the last six years, according to Richard Davis, an 
analyst with Tucker Cleary in Boston. He feels the biggest threat 
to the traditional music stores is not companies like The Guitar 
Center, but the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will see a lot of marginal players get crushed by the  
Internet,'' Davis said. ``It offers massive selection and good 
prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Guitar Center, cognizant of the growing power of online  
retailing, is moving onto the Internet itself, agreeing in June to 
buy the Musician's Friend, a catalog and Web retailer, for $50 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Majeski, publisher of Music Trades, a trade magazine based  
in Englewood, N.J., said it's way too early for independent shops 
to worry -- as long as they provide expert service. A customer will 
pay extra to buy a guitar from a shop where the salesmen are 
knowledgeable and not pushy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the few retail industries where a small dealer  
really can make it,'' Majeski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, a published analysis by Majeski showed revenues of the  
big chains grew faster than the industry average in 1998. Overall, 
the top 200 retailers had sales of $2.8 billion last year, 
according to Majeski. That figure includes other instruments, sheet 
music and equipment, not just guitars. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed to Knut Koupee Music of Minneapolis and the Drum Shop  
in Houston as examples of established regional retailers that may 
have failed due to competition from Guitar Center. 
</P>
<P>
	In Boston, E.U. Wurlitzer, founded in 1890, tried to rapidly  
increase its inventory and renovate when Guitar Center opened in 
the city. The strategy failed, and Wurlitzer declared bankruptcy in 
1997, according to Majeski. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from Guitar Center did not immediately return  
telephone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig at Classic Axe said he is not worried about Guitar  
Center's arrival in Washington. His customers are loyal and trust 
him, Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend, however, decided to close his Centreville guitar shop  
after the two Guitar Center stores opened nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just said, `I'm tired,''' Craig said.

<HEADLINE> Viacom To Buy CBS for $34 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Viacom Inc., the media company that owns  
Paramount Pictures and MTV, is buying CBS Corp. for $34.45 billion 
in stock in the biggest media deal ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The union announced today will create a major media and  
entertainment company with a top TV network, movie studio and 
several cable channels. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone will be chairman and chief  
executive of the new company, which will keep the Viacom name. CBS 
president Mel Karmazin will be president and chief operating 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal, CBS shareholders will receive 1.085  
shares of Viacom's class B stock, which based on Friday's close of 
$45.06 1/4 values CBS at $48.89 per share. That's slightly below the 
closing CBS price Friday of $48.93 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Viacom will be a media powerhouse owning the CBS  
network, several major cable networks -- including MTV, VH1 and 
Nickelodeon -- along with film studio Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal marks a new chapter in the long career of Redstone, 76,  
who took control of Viacom in 1987 and seven years later greatly 
enlarged it by buying Paramount Communications Inc. and Blockbuster 
Entertainment Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact with CBS comes just a month after the Federal  
Communications Commission relaxed television station ownership 
rules and triggered a round of discussions between media companies 
over possible mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom owns a TV station group and a 50 percent stake in the UPN  
network. The future status of UPN was unclear because government 
rules prevent one company owning more than one networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom has been selling off assets to pay down debt, positioning  
it well for a merger. It recently floated shares in its Blockbuster 
subsidiary and said it plans to spin off the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger reunites two companies split apart three decades ago  
by government rules, eliminated a few years ago, aimed at 
preventing networks owning their own programming. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, however, deregulation has sparked a move toward  
vertical integration in the television industry, highlighted by 
Walt Disney Co.'s purchase of Capital Cities/ABC for $19 billion in 
1996, the previous record media combination.

<HEADLINE> Revolution 3, Wizards 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Joe-Max Moore scored with 2:52 to play  
Tuesday night to give the New England Revolution a 3-2 
come-from-behind victory over the Kansas City Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Revolution, playing before a season-low crowd of about  
2,000, overcame a 2-0 deficit with three second-half goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore scored his 13th goal of the season when he beat two Kansas  
City defenders to the ball and while sliding pushed it into the net 
from 8 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	New England (10-17) climbed into a tie for fourth place with  
Miami in the MLS' Eastern Conference. Kansas City (8-19) is in last 
place in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Giovanni Savarese scored his eighth and ninth goals of the  
season for New England in the 67th and 81st minute, pulling New 
England into a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City, 2-12 on the road this season, took a 1-0 halftime  
lead on a goal by Preki in the 8th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City increased its lead to 2-0 in the 49th minute when  
Chris Henderson scored on a tap-in pass from Chris Klein.

<HEADLINE> Levi Strauss Hires Pepsi Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. tapped a savvy marketer  
from beverage giant PepsiCo to lead the struggling jeans maker from 
its prolonged slump and get Americans -- especially today's youth -- 
interested in wearing its jeans again. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Marineau, who has been credited with broadening Pepsi's  
appeal, was named president and chief executive officer on Tuesday. 
He succeeds Levi president Peter Jacobi, who stepped down in 
January after nearly three decades with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment is effective Sept. 27. Bob Haas, the former CEO,  
is continuing as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is not just a soft-drinks man. He is a marketer. He is what  
Levi's needs for the revitalization of its brand,'' said Kurt 
Barnard, a retail consultant and president of Barnard's Retail 
Trend Report in Upper Montclair, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1853 by a Bavarian entrepreneur who made sturdy,  
riveted work pants for Gold Rush miners, Levi's has watched its 
business falter in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been particularly hurt by waning interest from teens, who  
have shunned its stodgy five-pocket jeans in favor of trendier 
offerings from the likes of Old Navy, the Gap, Tommy Hilfiger and 
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining sales and profits forced Levi's to cut more than  
13,000 jobs and close 24 plants in the last two years in an effort 
to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the San Francisco-based company is hoping that Marineau,  
52, can breathe some new life into its ailing business. 
</P>
<P>
	Levi's, in a brief statement, said that Marineau was ``highly  
regarded as a talented brand builder and an innovative leader with 
a track record of expanding market share in competitive 
environments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Marineau's 20-month tenure as president and chief  
executive of Pepsi-Cola North America, the beverage company 
introduced its new Pepsi One diet drink and launched the very 
successful ``Joy of Cola'' campaign, featuring a cute girl who 
takes on the voices of Marlon Brando and Aretha Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, Marineau was also credited with helping improve  
Pepsi's marketing to a broader audience beyond teens. At Levi's, 
analysts said he will be charged to do just the opposite as the 
jeans maker aggressively targets the youth market. 
</P>
<P>
	Marineau was widely regarded as the likely successor to Pepsi  
chairman and CEO Roger Enrico. Steven Reinemund, named Tuesday as 
PepsiCo's chief operating officer, now appears to be the top 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jacobi resigned, Haas said the company would look for  
``somebody with a fresh set of eyes and different experience'' to 
challenge conventional thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was time for Levi's to recognize that its tired old ideas  
had simply played out,'' Barnard said. ``New ideas are necessary to 
bring this company back and they need someone that can think 
outside of the box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Pepsi, Marineau worked at Dean Foods Co. and  
Quaker Oats Co.

<HEADLINE> Gore Urges Health Care Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore promised Tuesday to  
ensure that all children have access to affordable health care by 
2005, offering a wide-ranging package of reforms aimed at bringing 
as many as 15 million uninsured Americans into the health care 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the Democratic presidential candidate stressed that, if he  
captured the White House, he would pursue the same incremental 
approach to changing health care that President Clinton adopted 
after his attempt to revamp the system failed to win congressional 
approval in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have all learned that we cannot overhaul the system in one  
fell swoop,'' Gore said at Children's Hospital. ``Experience has 
taught us that there is a way to keep what is right, while fixing 
what is wrong with American health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The unveiling of Gore's health care proposals -- and Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush's announcement of his education program last week -- 
moves the campaign for the White House to a new stage as the 
candidates begin offering specifics on their agendas. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore did not mention Bush in his remarks, but one reference  
clearly was aimed at the Republican presidential front-runner. ``In 
some states -- Texas springs to mind -- one-quarter of all children 
are still out in the cold,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	With his proposal, the vice president staked out different  
ground than that of his Democratic rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley, 
who has said he will propose something approaching universal 
coverage, and Republicans and health industry advocates, who fear 
that imposing too many mandates on private health care firms will 
drive up costs. 
</P>
<P>
	While portions of his package were new, Gore borrowed heavily  
from initiatives promoted by Clinton, and, in a few cases, by 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taken together, these steps will make health care affordable  
for millions of Americans who cannot afford it today. They will 
move toward the day when every American has access to affordable, 
quality coverage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore did not estimate the cost of his proposals. Spokesman Chris  
Lehane said that would come ``in the near future,'' but that he did 
not anticipate a tax increase would be needed to finance them. 
</P>
<P>
	About $4.3 billion in federal taxes was allocated last year to  
the Children's Health Insurance Program, the primary vehicle Gore 
would use. That program, designed to provide health insurance 
coverage to children in families with incomes too high to qualify 
for Medicaid, is primarily block grants to states. Most states 
establish a sliding scale of subsidies based on family income. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to judge what a program can accomplish, not just  
whether it sounds good,'' Bradley said in a statement. One criteria 
his plan would meet, when he unveils it in the coming weeks, would 
be ``stating honestly what the true cost of this program would 
be,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Gore, 43 million Americans lack health care  
coverage, and the number has grown by about 1 million a year this 
decade. Some 11 million children are uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	To cover them, Gore would expand the Children's Health Insurance  
Program, which helps states provide coverage to children in working 
families. Currently, states can use the federal CHIP money to cover 
children in families that earn up to 200 percent of the poverty 
level. Gore would raise that cap to 250 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	California and four other states already have set the cap at 250  
percent or higher, according to Gabriela Alcalde, policy specialist 
at the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also would allow families that do not qualify for the  
program, and do not receive health benefits through their jobs, to 
buy into the program. States would be permitted to extend coverage 
to all parents whose children are eligible for CHIP or Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore would give financial bonuses to states that meet enrollment  
targets for CHIP and Medicaid, programs he said are not fully 
utilized. 
</P>
<P>
	The CHIP expansions and efforts to bring more eligible people  
into such programs would result in an increase of 11 million to 15 
million children and adults covered, Lehane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the fastest-growing group of uninsured Americans are  
those between 55 and 65. Currently, Americans are eligible for 
Medicare at 65. 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton has, Gore proposed allowing ``vulnerable Americans''  
to buy into the program as early as age 55. Gore promised a 25 
percent tax credit to help defray the cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Let people with disabilities keep Medicare or Medicaid when  
they returned to the workplace. Such a proposal has passed the 
Senate and is awaiting consideration in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	--Encourage small businesses to band together to negotiate rates  
for their workers' coverage by providing a 25 percent tax credit to 
the firms. Republicans favor such an approach. 
</P>
<P>
	--Press for a ``real, enforceable'' Patients' Bill of Rights,  
similar to legislation that Congress will consider this month. Gore 
didn't explicitly say Tuesday whether he favors allowing patients 
to sue their HMOs and collect damages when care has been denied. 
But like Clinton, he has promoted legislation this year that would 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter Zelman, an architect of Clinton's failed health care plan  
who now heads the California Association of Health Plans, called 
Gore's initiatives ``a reasonably strong proposal to get at the 
issue of the uninsured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he warned, the package could be too costly, ``especially  
since it proposes to add benefits for the already insured, as well 
as coverage for the uninsured.''

<HEADLINE> VF Corp. Warns of Earnings Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- VF Corp., the world's No. 2 jeans maker  
behind Levi Strauss, says continued weak jeans sales at mid-level 
department stores and overseas will contribute to a 10 to 15 
percent decline in third quarter earnings per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Greensboro-based VF earned $119.6 million, or 98 cents per  
share, on sales of $1.46 billion during the third quarter in 1998. 
Wall Street analysts had predicted profits for the 1999 third 
quarter to be $1.01 per share, according to First Call/Thomson 
Financial. Earnings will be released Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``It now appears that the caution we expressed at the time we  
released second quarter earnings was warranted,'' president and 
chief executive officer Mackey McDonald said in a news release 
Tuesday. Slow retail traffic at the mid-tier stores was greater 
than earlier expected, while sales in key European markets are 
running below prior year levels, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald said the company's other sectors -- including Vanity  
Fair lingerie, Jantzen swimwear and Healthtex childrenswear brands 
-- continue to perform well, as does the company mass-market jean 
sales. The company's long-term growth targets of 8 percent to 10 
percent remain intact, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While still too early to comment on next year, we believe the  
fundamentals of our business are healthy and we have great 
confidence in our ability to overcome these near term challenges 
and return to more normalized growth levels,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, more than half the company's sales come from jeans.  
</P>
<P>
	VF, which makes Lee, Brittania and Wrangler jeans, earned $388.3  
million on sales of $5.5 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of VF closed Tuesday at $35, down $1, on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Weir Becomes Toast of Canada  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKVILLE, Ontario (AP) -- Mike Weir was on an Air Canada flight  
from Vancouver to Toronto when the pilot invited him up to the 
cockpit for the last hour. After all he has been through, a view 
from the top looked awfully nice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got to steer the plane in for everybody,'' cracked Canada's  
latest sports star. 
</P>
<P>
	That was only part of the spoils from winning his first PGA Tour  
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Weir was met at Pearson International airport by reporters and  
photographer from two newspapers and two national television 
stations. And when he walked downstairs to the media room Tuesday 
at Glen Abbey Golf Club, Tim Finchem was the first to greet him. 
</P>
<P>
	``My name is Tim,'' the commissioner said to a room full of 50  
reporters for an interview carried live by two Canadian networks. 
``I just stopped by to introduce you to our latest PGA Tour winner, 
Mike Weir.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim who?  
</P>
<P>
	Weir is the toast of Canada, no matter what happens this week at  
Glen Abbey for the Canadian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	By holding off Fred Funk in the Air Canada Championship on  
Sunday, Weir became the first Canadian to win a PGA Tour event 
since Richard Zokol won the Greater Milwaukee Open in 1992, and the 
first Canadian to win a tour event on home soil in at least 45 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Weir didn't need a bird's-eye view from 30,000 feet to realize  
that ``something special did happen on Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is the only full-time player on the PGA Tour from north of  
the border, and his victory -- especially at home -- could have the 
kind of impact on junior golf that Tiger Woods delivered in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to have some steady company out there,'' Weir said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lost in the euphoria is what Weir's persistence means to another  
populace. 
</P>
<P>
	In a couple of months, dozens of young players with high hopes  
will try to keep their dreams alive by grinding it out in Australia 
and South Africa, over in Japan or on the Nike Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	They will hit some bumps in the road, and many more will follow.  
Weir still thinks the most important time in his career was also 
his lowest moment -- thousands of miles from home, alone in a hotel 
room wondering if he will make it through Monday qualifying, and 
then make a cut, and someday make it all worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they can learn anything from it, it can be done,'' Weir  
said. ``The tough road can be overcome if you keep at it. They can 
use me as an example.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there are so many instances from which to choose.  
</P>
<P>
	Weir finally made it to the PGA Tour a year ago and promptly  
lost his card. No problem. He returned to Q-School, which he 
not-so-affectionately calls the ``Fall Classic,'' and earned his 
card again by winning the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a guy,'' Finchem recalls telling himself, ``who  
belongs on the PGA Tour. I hope he makes it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't easy.  
</P>
<P>
	Weir was in the final pairing in Atlanta for the BellSouth  
Classic and watched David Duval storm by him, the second close call 
he had on tour in a month. Like Duval, a runner-up seven times 
before he punched a hole through the dam, Weir never panicked. He 
never quit. 
</P>
<P>
	He was paired with Tiger Woods in the final round of the Western  
Open and put a scare into the world's No. 1 player before finishing 
two strokes back. 
</P>
<P>
	But the resilience of the spindly 29-year-old was never more  
clear than over the past two months. Weir paid his way over to 
Scotland to try to qualify for the British Open, opened with a 
lackluster 71 and then closed with a 66 -- getting up-and-down on 
the last two holes -- to qualify on the number. 
</P>
<P>
	He had an 83 in the first round at Carnoustie and then fought  
back with a 71, making a 10-foot putt on the last hole to make the 
cut. He finished in a tie for 37th. 
</P>
<P>
	His first venture into the pressure of a major championship on  
Sunday came at Medinah, paired again with Woods, getting 
mercilessly heckled by a Chicago gallery with every bogey that 
added up to an 80. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't beat myself up at all,'' he said. ``You have to keep  
getting there. You can't always win. There's so much luck involved 
in the game, and you have to learn to deal with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vancouver victory makes him exempt for the next two years,  
but Weir wants more than that. If he can finish strongly, he'll 
earn his way into the Tour Championship and Stroke Play 
Championship, each with a $5 million purse. He'll go to Augusta 
National. 
</P>
<P>
	Weir started the year No. 308 in the world ranking and now is at  
No. 67. He already has his eyes on becoming the first Canadian to 
play on the Presidents Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one win,'' Weir said. ``I want to build on it, and  
get better.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Expected To Delay Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is returning from its summer break  
with just 23 calendar days remaining until the new federal fiscal 
year begins -- and big questions about how it will resolve an 
inevitable spending showdown with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Oct. 1 start of fiscal 2000 just ahead, lawmakers have  
sent Clinton just two of the 13 annual spending bills that keep 
federal agencies functioning. No one anticipates a replay of the 
1995-1996 government shutdowns that Democrats used to brand 
Republicans as extremists, but it is unclear precisely how the 
clash will conclude. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislators swing back into business today after a four-week  
recess. The House plans to debate a $90 billion measure financing 
housing, veterans and science programs, while the Senate resumes 
consideration of a $14 billion bill covering land and cultural 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometime next week, Clinton is expected to send Congress a  
multibillion-dollar request for more spending for farmers, Kosovo 
and perhaps the Turkey earthquake. It is unclear how it would be 
financed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and lawmakers face two major problems. Clinton wants to  
spend at least $20 billion more than Republicans. And both sides -- 
particularly the GOP -- are struggling to figure out how to honor 
their pledges to not spend huge Social Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have stiffened our resolve not to spend Social Security,''  
said John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, 
R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	But Feehery did not say how they would achieve that. Few expect  
they will because of fierce pressure from members of both parties 
to boost spending for defense and domestic programs, and a lack of 
consensus over how to pay for the extra money. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlighting their problems, congressional Republicans probably  
will delay writing the year's biggest spending bill until at least 
next week, a $300 billion measure financing health, education and 
other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate appropriations committees planned to write  
separate versions of the bill this week. But GOP and Democratic 
aides in both chambers said the legislation would probably be 
delayed, citing the Republicans' ongoing struggle over financing 
the measure without using the Social Security surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans must find about $16 billion in savings if they are  
to avoid using Social Security funds to help pay for the measure. 
Among the options they have considered are cutting federal payments 
to the states for Medicaid, welfare and child support enforcement. 
The nation's governors have opposed those proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Clinton has issued a half-dozen veto threats. Disputes  
include: 
</P>
<P>
	--Provisions on the Senate Interior bill affecting mining, timber  
and other industries using federal lands. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cuts in Clinton's requests for the National Aeronautics and  
Space Administration, housing and veterans approved by the House 
Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	--How much emergency aid to grant farmers hurt by low commodity  
prices and drought. Many Democrats want more than the $7.4 billion 
the Senate has approved. The House hasn't approved any. 
</P>
<P>
	--House- and Senate-approved cuts in the departments of Commerce,  
Justice and State, including Clinton's plan to continue helping 
communities hire police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	--House language restricting U.S. family planning aid abroad.  
</P>
<P>
	--The House's decision to kill Pentagon plans to buy F-22 fighter  
planes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Senate language that would limit federal mass transit aid for  
states, in effect cutting funds for California and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Further highlighting problems facing the GOP, an analysis by the  
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said that congressional 
spending proposals, if enacted, would eat into Social Security's 
surplus -- even without the labor-health bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the CBO projected a fiscal 2000 surplus of $14 billion,  
excluding Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	But in an Aug. 26 letter to Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., CBO  
Director Dan Crippen said that based on assumptions adopted so far 
by lawmakers, that surplus would become a $13 billion deficit if 
House proposals became law and a $16 billion shortfall under Senate 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBO said expenditures eating away the surplus included $5  
billion Republicans would use next year for their 10-year, $792 
billion tax cut; the House's decision to declare the 2000 census a 
budget emergency so its $4 billion price tag could come from the 
surplus; and $7 billion for Senate-passed aid to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the House has ordered the CBO to boost its savings  
estimates by $17 billion, while the Senate has directed it to add 
$16 billion in savings, Crippen wrote.

                            *Allen Funt    	
</P>
<P>
	PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Allen Funt, the TV prankster whose  
catch phrase, ``Smile! You're on 'Candid Camera!''' revealed many a 
gag to its blushing foil, died Sunday of complications from the 
1993 stroke that forced him into retirement. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	``Candid Camera,'' which Funt created, produced and directed,  
aired off and on from 1948 to 1990 and was considered a forerunner 
to other reality-based television shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The network continues to air ``Candid Camera'' on Friday  
evenings, with Funt's son Peter and Suzanne Somers as hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier years, Funt himself appeared in many ``Candid  
Camera'' gags, along with such regulars as Dorothy Collins in the 
1960s and comedian and author Fannie Flagg (``Fried Green 
Tomatoes'') in the 1970s. A young Woody Allen appeared in some 
early shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The TV program was born of Funt's ``Candid Microphone,'' a radio  
show the New York native originated after his Army service in World 
War II. He was working as artist for an ad agency, but looking for 
a different job. 
</P>
<P>
	The show had its television premiere, still called ``Candid  
Microphone,'' on ABC in 1948. It bounced to different networks in 
its early years, eventually getting picked up by CBS in 1960 for a 
seven-year run. In 1960-61, it was the seventh-best rated show in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	A syndicated version ran from 1974-78. In the 1989-90 season,  
CBS aired a number of ``Candid Camera'' specials featuring Allen 
and Peter Funt as co-hosts.

</P>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Fred Hervey, founder of the Circle K convenience  
store chain and former mayor of El Paso, Texas, died Wednesday. He 
was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Hervey, who dropped out of high school to support his family,  
opened a restaurant with his brother in El Paso during the 
Depression. They specialized in tamales and their mother's homemade 
pies. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving in the Navy during World War II, Hervey returned  
home and opened three more restaurants, a supermarket and a radio 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	After a failed run for Congress, he was elected mayor of El Paso  
in 1951 and served two terms. He won a third term in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, he expanded a small group of three food stores into  
Phoenix -- the beginnings of the Circle K chain, which became a 
successful international business. Hervey sold his Circle K 
interests in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	He also founded the Bank of Scottsdale, served as chairman of  
the board of the American Bank of Commerce for 12 years and was on 
the boards of Central Arizona Broadcasting Co. and Scottsdale's 
KDOT.

</P>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Rene Lecavalier, who hosted French-language NHL  
games for Radio-Canada for more than 30 years, died Monday. He was 
81. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montreal-born Lecavalier was best known in Quebec, but was  
widely recognized as one of the top sports commentators in the 
history of Canadian radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
	Lecavalier joined Radio-Canada in 1937 as a war correspondent  
based in North Africa. Lecavalier hosted cultural radio shows for 
the CBC's French-language division from 1941 to 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in 1952, the man who had dreamed of becoming a hockey  
player did the next best thing and became the radio commentator for 
the Canadiens until he retired in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from hockey, Lecavalier covered the Olympics from 1960 to  
1984, with the exception of Munich in 1972 and Moscow in 1980. He 
also regularly covered the Commonwealth and Pan American games. 
</P>
<P>
	He was inducted into both the Hockey Hall of Fame and Quebec's  
sports hall of fame, and was honored in 1996 with a lifetime 
achievement award from Sports Media Canada, the country's sports 
press association. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Steve Little    	
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Steve Little, who kicked the longest  
field goal in NCAA history for Arkansas in the 1977, died Monday at 
the age of 43. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of death has not been determined.  
</P>
<P>
	Little, who later played for the St. Louis Cardinals in the NFL,  
was paralyzed from the neck down in an automobile accident in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, Little kicked a 67-yard field goal against Texas, tying  
the NCAA record set by Texas' Russell Erlexben two weeks earlier. 
The record was matched by Joe Williams of Wichita State the next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Little was an All-America in 1976 and 1977 and was named to the  
school's all-century squad. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals made him the 15th overall pick in the first round  
of the NFL draft in 1978. He punted and kicked for the Cardinals in 
1978 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing six games in 1980, he was released Oct. 16. The  
same day, he was involved in the automobile accident that left him 
a quadriplegic.

 *Bert MacLeech    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bert MacLeech, co-founder of one of the  
nation's largest providers of services to developmentally disabled 
people, died of heart failure Aug. 26. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. MacLeech, who was also an emeritus professor at the  
University of Southern California, criticized the practice of 
placing developmentally disabled people in institutions and 
pioneered the 1950s movement to establish community-based services 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
	With his Pearl, he founded the Young Adult Institute in New York  
City, which later became YAI/National Institute for People with 
Disabilities. He served as executive director from 1957 to 1967. 
Now serving more than 15,000 individuals daily, the institute aids 
clients in making the transition from school to jobs and in 
developing social and community-living skills. 
</P>
<P>
	MacLeech was an associate professor of special education at  
USC's Rossier School of Education from 1967 to 1975. During that 
time, he was state president of the California Association of 
Professors in Special Education and co-chair of Mayor Tom Bradley's 
Task Force on the Handicapped. He was a fellow of the American 
Association on Mental Deficiency.

</P>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Robert C. Notson, who joined The Oregonian  
as a reporter in 1925 and retired as publisher 50 years later, died 
Monday. He was 96. 
</P>
<P>
	Notson guided the paper through part of the Depression and World  
War II and rebuilt its staff after a long strike in the 1950s. He 
saw the paper through its transition from paste pots and clackety 
manual typewriters to the first newsroom computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Notson joined the newspaper in 1925 and drew the annual Rose  
Festival as one of his first reporting assignments. He was promoted 
to city editor in 1936 and to managing editor in 1941. He became 
executive editor in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years later, Notson succeeded Michael Frey as publisher, a  
job he held until his retirement in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Notson worked briefly for a Salem newspaper before attending  
Columbia University and joining The Oregonian. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the high points of Notson's career came in 1956 when he  
supervised an investigation by reporters Wallace Turner and William 
Lambert that exposed union racketeering and organized crime in 
Portland. The effort won a Pulitzer Prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Notson is survived by his wife, Adelia; two daughters; five  
granddaughters and three great-granddaughters.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Barry Shipp, who took an oil he found in a drug  
paraphernalia shop and used it to create the popular fragrance 
called Jovan Musk, died Monday of a heart attack. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending time as Revlon sales trainee and rising to become  
the company's Midwest sales representative, Shipp joined 
entrepreneur Bernard Mitchell in creating Jovan in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	As Shipp told the story, he was on a sales trip in New York when  
he stepped into a ``head shop'' where drug paraphernalia was sold 
along with other counterculture items, including something called 
musk oil. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the hottest thing in underground perfumery,'' Shipp, a  
prominent thoroughbred horse owner, said in a recent interview with 
Illinois Racing News. ``It was said to be a sexual attractant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shipp took the oil back to Chicago and helped create Jovan Musk.

<HEADLINE> PepsiCo Names Reinemund New COO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY PHIL GALEWITZ   	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- PepsiCo president Steven Reinemund, longtime  
leader of the company's Frito-Lay division, is looking more and 
more like the heir apparent to head the world's No. 2 beverage 
maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Reinemund was given the additional title of chief operating  
officer on Tuesday, while another possible successor to chairman 
and CEO Roger Enrico announced his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Marineau, president of Pepsi-Cola North American, said  
Tuesday he was becoming the president and chief executive officer 
at clothing maker Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Reinemund, 51, was named president of PepsiCo in June. He was  
previously chairman and chief executive of the company's Frito Lay 
unit, and has been on the PepsiCo board since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	PepsiCo named Gary M. Rodkin 47, president and chief executive  
of the company's Tropicana unit, to succeed Marineau, who resigned 
after a 20-month tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	Marineau, 52, was regarded as a leading contender to succeed  
Enrico, 54. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Reinemund appears to have solidified that position, said  
Martin Romm, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ``He is 
the logical person to succeed Roger,'' Romm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marineau's departure is a disappointment to Pepsi because he  
helped revitalize the Pepsi brand over the past two years, Romm 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Marineau helped improve Pepsi's marketing to a broader audience  
beyond teenagers. But the North American beverage division's profit 
has remained under pressure. Last week, Pepsi announced that 
concentrate shipments were expected to drop 4 percent in the third 
quarter because of price increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi holds 31 percent of the U.S. soft-drink market, compared  
to Coca-Cola's 44 percent, and it accounts for about 21 percent of 
the worldwide soft-drink market. Coke has about 51 percent of the 
global market. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Pepsi, PepsiCo's beverages include Mountain Dew,  
the No. 4 soft drink, and Tropicana juices. The company's salty 
snacks, such as corn chips (Fritos, Doritos) and potato chips 
(Lay's, Ruffles), control more than half of the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo also said the company, along with  
BankBoston and Citibank have sold 51.2 percent of Argentine bottler 
Buenos Aires Buenos Aires Embotelladora SA to local brewery 
Cerveceria y Malteria Quilmes SA. Quilmes paid $5.80 per share or 
$89 million for the stake plus the transfer of some debt to the 
company. It didn't say how much debt was involved in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	PepsiCo was down 87 1/2 cents in mid-afternoon trading to $33.75 in  
New York Stock Exchange trading.

<HEADLINE> Bears Bet on Change To Succeed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- As last season ended, Dave Wannstedt had coached  
the Chicago Bears to another losing record, quarterback Erik Kramer 
was mending from surgery and the team was in need of a makeover. 
</P>
<P>
	It got one, on the field and in the front office.  
</P>
<P>
	Wannstedt was fired after a second straight 4-12 season,  
replaced by Dick Jauron, a former Pro Bowler who's taking his first 
turn as a head coach after 14 seasons as an assistant, the last 
four as Jacksonville's defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron wasn't the team's first choice. Arizona defensive  
coordinator Dave McGinnis was. But after the Bears angered McGinnis 
by announcing his hiring before contract details were in place, he 
went home. So they turned to Jauron. 
</P>
<P>
	The McGinnis fiasco also led to the removal of Michael McCaskey  
as team president. He was kicked upstairs, and the job of running 
the team on a daily basis was given to financial officer Ted 
Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, can the new Bears be any more successful than the old ones?  
</P>
<P>
	Most don't think Jauron can win big as a rookie head coach, not  
with the team's current talent level. Ten draft picks survived the 
final roster cutdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where do people predict we'll finish? They don't predict we'll  
finish near the top,'' Jauron said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not particularly interested in what other people think.  
We're only interested in what we as a team think and feel,'' Jauron 
added. ``We'll see where their predictions are at the end of the 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron is flaunting convention with more than just his refusal  
to build slowly and wait a few years before thinking about the 
playoffs. While most rookie coaches hire at least one veteran 
coordinator, Jauron hired two rookies. 
</P>
<P>
	At least defensive coordinator Greg Blache has been around the  
league for 11 years. Offensive coordinator Gary Crowton is making 
his NFL debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowton spent the last three years as head coach at Louisiana  
Tech, and he brought his wide-open, pass-happy offense with him. 
The days of simply giving the ball to the running back and getting 
out of the way are gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, sure, there will still be a running game. But the Bears are  
going to be flinging the ball like never before. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of quick throws in it, and we've got a lot of  
throws that can push it up the field,'' Crowton said. ``It can be 
smashmouth if you need it, like in the fourth quarter when you want 
to be able to run the clock and keep the ball. But on the other 
hand, it has the ability to score very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So who's going to be making all this happen? Not Kramer. He was  
cut two days before training camp. Instead it's going to be a bunch 
of new guys. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears made Cade McNown, that confident West Coast kid who  
led UCLA on a 20-game winning streak, the 12th overall pick in the 
draft, the highest they've taken a quarterback since Jim McMahon in 
1982. But after missing 11 days of training camp, the future of the 
franchise isn't quite ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of throwing him out there too soon -- remember Ryan Leaf?  
-- Jauron will start Shane Matthews, a six-year veteran who's been 
cut more times just by the Bears (four) than he's played in games 
(two). McNown will play each week, but Matthews will take most of 
the snaps. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to catch me up, but at the same time not just  
throw me on the back burner,'' McNown said. ``They're saying, `We 
want you to get some reps,' but they're not ready to say, `Here, 
run the show.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	After the quarterback shuffle, the most intriguing part of the  
offense is Curtis Enis, the fifth overall pick in the draft last 
year. His rookie season was one big disappointment, from his 
training camp holdout to his sullen attitude to his knee-ending 
injury halfway through the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's behind him now. He was yapping when he arrived at  
training camp in his souped-up Hummer and he never stopped. He's 
eager to show the knee is healthy and prove he deserved to be 
picked so high in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year, I'm going to come out here and be myself and give  
myself the opportunity to just play football and have fun,'' he 
said. ``But first and foremost, just play with my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensively, the Bears' most glaring weakness is the pass rush.  
Chicago had just 28 sacks last season, tied for last in the NFL 
with Cincinnati and way behind the league average of 40.3. 
</P>
<P>
	To bolster the defense, Jauron brought in Clyde Simmons, who's  
10th on the career sacks list with 114. He also moved rookie 
Russell Davis back to end, where he played his first two seasons at 
North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The move worked, and Davis will start ahead of veteran Jamal  
Duff at right end. Rookie linebacker Rosevelt Colvin finished the 
preseason with four sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing that probably won't change much is the Bears' record.  
They still play in the NFC Central, the conference's toughest 
division, and there are too many repairs that have to be made. 
</P>
<P>
	Just don't tell them that.  
</P>
<P>
	``Guys spent all offseason working out here to get something  
done this year. We're tired of going 4-12 and being the (joke) of 
the NFL,'' Enis said. ``We've got things to do this year.''

<HEADLINE> Tanker Derailment Causes Evacuation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVER ROUGE, Mich. (AP) -- About 600 people were evacuated from  
their suburban Detroit homes as a precaution today after the 
derailment of a railroad tanker that possibly contained a toxic 
chemical. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecorse Police Chief Robert Royals said the tanker may contain  
ethylene oxide, which can cause severe burns and ``might even have 
the potential to be lethal if inhaled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no sign of leakage, but officials were monitoring the  
overturned tanker to make sure. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the derailment, which happened about 8 a.m., wasn't  
known. 
</P>
<P>
	A dispatcher at Rocket Cab Co. in Ecorse, who identified herself  
only as Dolly, said police had asked businesses across the street 
from the cab company to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thinking of leaving,'' she said. ``But it's not leaking  
yet. They never told us to leave, so I figured it's all right.''

<HEADLINE> Sovereign To Buy Fleet Branches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- New England's financial landscape will soon take  
on a whole new look following Tuesday's announcement that Sovereign 
Bancorp of Pennsylvania will buy 278 Fleet and BankBoston branches 
as a result of the largest divestiture in U.S. banking history. 
</P>
<P>
	When all the deals are done, Sovereign will be the region's  
third largest bank. Fleet Boston Corp. will be No. 1, and the 
combination of Citizens Financial Group and USTrust Corp. will be 
No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Sovereign, a $25 billion bank based in Wyomissing, Pa., is a  
newcomer to the region. 
</P>
<P>
	By April 1, every Fleet branch in Eastern Massachusetts will be  
called Sovereign Bank New England, said Jay Sidhu, Sovereign's 
chief executive officer and president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within a short period of time, New Englanders will find  
Sovereign Bank New England a household name,'' Sidhu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sovereign was able to buy Fleet and BankBoston's branches  
because bank regulators were concerned a pending merger between the 
two would result in too much market concentration. Sidhu said the 
purchase price, $1.4 billion, comes to $918 million after taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28 remaining Fleet and BankBoston branches to be divested,  
with about $800 million in deposits, will be turned over to 
smaller, community banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the Sovereign purchase say the branches should have  
been sold to either strong national banks that can compete with the 
BankBoston-Fleet powerhouse or to community banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sovereign does not have the financial muscle or resources or  
management depth or experience in New England markets to be a 
really strong competitor, which is needed considering Fleet is 
eliminating its nearest sized competitor,'' said Connecticut 
Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who is considering suing to 
stop the purchase from going through in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tremendous coup for Fleet,'' said Bruce Marks, who  
heads Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of America. ``It's awful for 
the consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sovereign is taking over about 176 branches in Massachusetts, 50  
in Rhode Island, 39 in Connecticut and 13 in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale, which includes about $12 billion in deposits and $8  
billion in loans, also includes BankBoston's consumer lending 
center in Providence, R.I., its telebanking center in East 
Providence, R.I., and its back office operations in Boston's 
Dorchester neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Sovereign has no plans to lay off the Fleet or BankBoston  
employees who will be affected by the merger. More likely, Sidhu 
said, more people will be hired. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve Board, meanwhile, approved the merger  
Tuesday by a 5-0 vote, on condition the branches were divested. 
</P>
<P>
	Sovereign has more than 310 community banking and loan offices  
in eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank acquired 95 branches in 20 counties in Pennsylvania and  
nine in New Jersey in April 1998 as part of First Union Corp.'s 
takeover of CoreStates Financial Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet, the nation's ninth-largest bank, has $69.7 billion in  
deposits and $104.4 billion in assets. BankBoston, the country's 
15th-biggest bank, has $48.5 billion in deposits and $73.5 billion 
in deposits. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger would create the region's largest bank and the  
nation's eighth-largest bank.

<HEADLINE> New CEO for Jewelry Chain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Beryl Raff, president and chief operating officer  
of Zale Corp. since July 1998, will succeed Robert J. DiNicola as 
chief executive of the jewelry chain. 
</P>
<P>
	DiNicola will remain as chairman of the company, a  
once-struggling jewelry retailer that he rebuilt into an industry 
powerhouse over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Raff, 47, has handled day-to-day operations at the company's  
store lines for the past 13 months. She was an executive at 
Emporium and Macy's before becoming president of the Zale's 
Jewelers division in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her knowledge of the jewelry industry is second to none,''  
said Steve Kernkraut, an analyst with Bear Stearns. ``I think it's 
a status quo (succession) ... The format is set, the game plan is 
set, it's just a matter of execution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Raff joins Rose Marie Bravo at British luxury clothier  
Burberry among the handful of female CEOs of big retailers. 
Computer maker Hewlett-Packard made headlines earlier this year by 
naming a woman, Carleton Fiorina, as its president and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Zale operates about 1,330 retail jewelry stores, including its  
namesake chain, plus Gordon's Jewelers, Bailey Banks &AMP; Biddle Fine 
Jewelers and Peoples Jewellers. 
</P>
<P>
	Zale is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year, but its  
history hasn't been all rosy. The company grew to 1,800 stores in 
the 1980s. Heavy debt pushed it into bankruptcy in 1992 and forced 
the closure of 700 stores. The company emerged 18 months later 
lacking focus. 
</P>
<P>
	DiNicola, 51, turned the company around by changing the mix of  
merchandise and pushing for an aggressive approach to inventory 
management, getting rid of the items that didn't sell and 
concentrating on the top-movers. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said DiNicola's decision to give up the CEO's title he  
has held since April 1994 was surprising but didn't signal changes 
at the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bob DiNicola is still going to be looking at the macro issues  
for the company,'' said Richard Zimmerman of Janney Montgomery 
Scott. ``I think it's more a passing-down of the torch ... to an 
incredible merchandising person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company on Tuesday reported better than expected earnings  
for its fiscal fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Zale said earned $8.5 million, or 23 cents a share, for the  
quarter ended July 31. That compared with $7.5 million, or 20 cents 
a share, in the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter were $326 million, up from $280.8 million  
a year ago. Comparable-store sales -- which includes sales only at 
stores open at least a year -- rose 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year ended July 31, Zale earned $81 million, or $2.21 a  
share, compared with $68.9 million, or $1.84 a share, a year ago. 
Sales were $1.43 billion, up from $1.31 billion a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Dafoe Still a Holdout With Bruins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- This year, the big name missing from  
the Boston Bruins' training camp is Byron Dafoe. Next year, it 
could be Ray Bourque. 
</P>
<P>
	Dafoe is holding out while he and the Bruins haggle over a new  
contract. The goaltender is asking for about $4 million a year, but 
the team thinks that's about $1 million too much. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bourque is in the last year of his contract. Though  
the team would love to extend it, he isn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to come a time when it's going to be enough,''  
he said Tuesday as he prepared to start his 21st NHL season -- all 
with the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not here now. But who knows how I'm going to feel in  
June,'' Bourque said. ``I'm excited about playing hockey now. I 
can't tell you when that day is going to come, but it's going to 
come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Harry Sinden said he approached Bourque about  
extending his contract another year, as he did last year. Bourque 
said he wanted to see how things went first. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fire is still there, and burning. As long as those things  
keep going on, I think I'll be successful,'' Bourque said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If things go well, and we have a lot of fun and win a lot of  
games, the game's more enjoyable. Hopefully, that's the type of 
year we're going to have. But I really don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing is certain: Bourque will go quietly. He said he  
doesn't want a farewell tour as he makes his last trip around the 
league. ``That's fine for some people, but not for me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't want any part of that,'' Sinden said. ``He does  
deserve it, there's no doubt. But, knowing Ray the way I do, that's 
not his way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Pat Burns said Bourque is the ``heart and soul'' of the  
team. And that means he has earned the right to make the decision 
on his own pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it goes the whole season (before he decides), I don't  
know,'' Sinden said. ``I wouldn't dare push it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A five-time Norris Trophy winner as the NHL's top defenseman,  
Bourque has said he would rather finish his career in Boston than 
be traded somewhere with a better chance to win the Stanley Cup. 
But if this is his last chance to win a championship, it will be 
difficult to do without Dafoe. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinden said the team reached an impasse with Dafoe before the  
goaltender returned to his home in Los Angeles last week. At this 
point, the Bruins GM says he can see it lasting at least a couple 
of weeks into the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sounds pretty firm in his stance,'' Sinden said.  
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether Dafoe, who had a 32-23-11 record and 1.99  
goals-against average last year, deserves to be paid like the top 
goaltenders in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	His numbers -- for one year, at least -- might say yes, but Sinden  
said he'd like to see Dafoe's name on a Stanley Cup -- or at least 
in the finals-- before he gets paid like Martin Brodeur, Dominik 
Hasek or Olaf Kolzig. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Dafoe, the Bruins will use Rob Tallas in net, with John  
Grahame backing him up. Tallas was Dafoe's backup last year, 
posting a 7-7-2 record and 2.61 GAA in 17 games with Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been waiting for this opportunity. And he's going to get  
it,'' Burns said. ``Harry knows that Byron is an excellent 
goaltender, but he also realizes that he has a budget to follow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Dafoe, P.J. Axelsson and Hal Gill are also  
holding out. The Bruins also walked away from Dmitri Khristich's 
$2.8 million arbitration award and Tim Taylor left as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the sudden, you look down the bench and they're not  
there anymore,'' Burns said. ``Six or seven guys have (left) this 
hockey team and haven't been replaced yet.''

<HEADLINE> Strong Earthquake Shakes Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A strong earthquake shook Athens for  
nearly 10 seconds this afternoon, toppling some buildings and 
sending hundreds of thousands of terrified people into the streets. 
At least five people died and dozens were reported missing. 
</P>
<P>
	People were hit by falling debris -- glass, concrete and marble  
slabs -- and at least three victims were killed when a building 
collapsed in the Menidi suburb north of Athens, police said. At 
least two fatal heart attacks were blamed on the quake, which had a 
preliminary magnitude of 5.9. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 20 people were trapped in the ruins of a flattened  
apartment building, authorities said. In a collapsed section of a 
factory, voices were heard crying for help. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of other buildings collapsed or suffered serious damage  
in the sprawling Athens metropolis. The most serious damage 
apparently occurred in Menidi and other northern areas close to the 
quake's epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no apparent damage to ancient sites, including the  
Acropolis and the towering columns of the Temple of Zeus. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of aftershocks -- as strong as 4.4 -- swayed buildings  
and kept people outdoors after one of the strongest quakes in years 
in the Athens area. Many Athenians have ancestral homes in other 
parts in the quake-prone nation and have memories of devastating 
temblors. 
</P>
<P>
	Chunks of concrete fell from buildings, landing atop cars and  
shattering on streets and sidewalks. Electric power and telephone 
service was out in some parts of this city of more than 5 million. 
People at an afternoon concert in a central Athens auditorium 
screamed and raced for the exits. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Athens Seismological Institute, the 2:56 p.m.  
quake was centered about 12 miles north of Athens. The epicenter 
was between the working class suburb of Menidi and Mount Parnes, 
which is a national park and sparsely inhabited. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake was felt across the Aegean Sea in Izmir, Turkey, about  
180 miles east of the Greek capital. 
</P>
<P>
	In Athens, people sought safety anywhere clear of buildings: on  
road median strips, parking lots and in the National Garden in 
central Athens -- near the site of a concert that was planned for 
later Tuesday to aid victims of last month's quake in neighboring 
Turkey that claimed more than 15,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone panicked, especially because of the recent Turkish  
quake,'' said Dimitris Lalas, head of the Athens Seismological 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Some women dashed out of beauty salons, their hair still wet.  
Men bolted from their offices. Thousands clutched cellular phones 
trying to get through on the overcrowded network. Others tried to 
get to public telephones or huddled around radios at sidewalk 
kiosks. 
</P>
<P>
	Some motorcycle and scooter drivers were knocked to the ground.  
</P>
<P>
	Television and radio stations broadcast appeals calling on  
people not to panic, avoid using their cars and telephones to free 
access for emergency crews. Military and fire units were put on 
alert and hospitals called back all staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a very strong shock,'' said George Skordilis, a  
seismologist with the Athens Seismological Institute. ``There has 
been aftershock activity but we can't make any forecasts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 17, a magnitude 7.4 earthquake hit neighboring Turkey,  
killing more than 15,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	While Skordilis said there was no clear connection with the  
Turkish quake, ``we can say there is increased earthquake activity 
in the eastern Mediterranean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The institute said the quake was among the strongest in nearly a  
century along the fault line crossing near Athens. But stronger 
temblors have hit other areas of Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, a 6.1 magnitude quake killed 26 people in Aegio, about  
120 miles southwest of Athens. The deadliest quake in Greece in 
recent decades was a 6.5 temblor in 1978 the northern port of 
Thessaloniki that killed 45 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Since a strong 1981 earthquake that was felt in Athens, most  
buildings in the capital have been built and reinforced to 
withstand quakes.

<HEADLINE> Gore Pushes Health Care Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore today proposed a  
wide-ranging package of reforms aimed at bringing millions of 
uninsured Americans into the health care system and improving 
coverage for those already in it. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the Democratic presidential candidate's plan  
would be a guarantee that by 2005, every child in the nation would 
have access to affordable health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore made clear that, if elected president, he would pursue the  
same incremental approach to changing managed care that President 
Clinton adopted after his attempt to revamp the system failed to 
win congressional approval in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have all learned that we cannot overhaul the system in one  
fell swoop,'' Gore said at Children's Hospital in Los Angeles. 
``Experience has taught us that there is a way to keep what is 
right, while fixing what is wrong with American health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Children's Health Fund, an advocacy group for disadvantaged  
children, estimates some 11 million children have no health 
insurance and almost as many have inadequate plans or live in 
places without enough doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	To help insure more children, Gore would expand the Children's  
Health Insurance Program, which helps states provide coverage to 
children in working families. Currently, states can use the federal 
CHIP money to cover children in families that earn up to 200 
percent of the poverty level. Gore would raise that cap to 250 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore would also allow families that do not qualify for the  
program, and do not receive health benefits through their jobs, to 
buy into the program. He would give financial bonuses to states 
that meet enrollment targets for CHIP and Medicaid, programs he 
believes are not fully utilized. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the fastest-growing group of uninsured Americans are  
those between 55 and 65. Currently, Americans are eligible for 
Medicare at 65. Gore proposed allowing ``vulnerable Americans'' to 
buy into the program as early as age 55 and he promised a 25 
percent tax credit to help defray the cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Health maintenance organizations were a particular target for  
the vice president. Even as he acknowledged that there are some 
good HMOs, he told a joke about an HMO executive who was admitted 
to heaven -- but was told he could only stay three days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am certainly not satisfied when life or death medical  
decisions are made by HMO bureaucrats at the other end of a 
telephone line,'' he said, drawing applause from the audience of 
about 100. ``They don't have a license to practice medicine and 
they don't have a right to play God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Chris Lehane said the vice president would attach a  
price tag to the health care proposal and explain how he would pay 
for it -- and other initiatives -- ``in the near future.'' He said 
the package would be ``within the context of a balanced budget'' 
and that he did not anticipate a tax increase would be needed to 
fund it. 
</P>
<P>
	Some facets of Gore's plan have been proposed or supported by  
President Clinton, and many have already been considered by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Let people with disabilities keep Medicare or Medicaid when  
they returned to the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	--Encourage small businesses to band together to negotiate rates  
for their workers' coverage by providing a 25 percent tax credit to 
the firms. 
</P>
<P>
	--Press for a ``real, enforceable'' Patients' Bill of Rights,  
similar to legislation that Congress will consider when it returns 
this month from recess. Gore didn't explicitly say in his remarks 
whether he favors allowing patients to sue their health maintenance 
organizations and collect damages when care has been denied. But, 
he has promoted Democratic legislation this year that would do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's ``bill of rights'' would guarantee patients the right to  
see a specialist, and ensure doctors can tell patients all their 
medical options. It would guarantee that pregnant women and cancer 
patients wouldn't have to change doctors in the middle of 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that it also would require managed care companies  
to cover mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make sure that a patient with depression is given  
access to care on terms no different from a patient who has 
diabetes,'' he said. ``And I will begin by improving mental health 
services for those who receive Medicaid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore promised to establish new public-private partnerships to  
expand access to prevention and wellness programs and to promote 
such initiatives in the workplace. He didn't say what the 
government's role would be, however, nor did he say how he would 
finance the new initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's proposal staked out ground between that of his Democratic  
rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley, who has said he will propose 
something approaching universal coverage, and Republicans, who fear 
that imposing too many mandates on private health care firms will 
drive up costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Others will argue against reforming our health care system  
carefully, realistically, and step-by-step. Some of them will tell 
you that the only acceptable answer is a one-size-fits-all 
solution,'' Gore said, in an apparent reference to Bradley.

<HEADLINE> Japan Technicians Brace for Y2k </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- About 100,000 technicians from top Japanese  
electronic companies will camp out in their offices in case any 
computer failures occur at the turn of the millennium, an industry 
official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	NEC Corp. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. will both have 15,000  
computer specialists on hand 24 hours a day from Dec. 31 to Jan. 4 
in case problems occur as a result of the date change to 2000, said 
Haruhisa Suzuki, spokesman for the Japan Electronic Industry 
Development Association. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Hitachi Ltd., Fujitsu Ltd., Toshiba Corp., and IBM Japan  
will have 10,000 technical specialists on standby to watch out for 
the so-called Y2K bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzuki said the leading companies will be on alert ``not because  
they expect problems, but because they need to be there in the 
unlikely event there is a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said larger companies have invested considerable time and  
effort to ensure a smooth transition from 1999 to 2000, but noted 
smaller companies which have been through financial difficulties in 
recent years may not have done as much. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, he said he did not expect a significant impact on  
people's daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The association consists of about 150 member companies.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Tech Has Tough Game Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary believes  
top-ranked Florida State can be had, but it will take an 
extraordinary effort by his 10th-ranked Yellow Jackets. 
</P>
<P>
	The odds makers don't agree with O'Leary, making the Seminoles  
an 18-point favorite in the nationally televised game in 
Tallahassee on Saturday night in the Atlantic Coast Conference 
opener for both schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't look at that stuff. They could have said 50 points and  
that would be fine with me. We just got to go in and play,'' 
O'Leary said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously they're the top team in our conference and in the  
country and I think the ranking is richly deserved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've watched tape on them and I don't see a lot of flaws in  
their offense, defense or kicking game,'' he said. ``We'll have our 
work cut out for us down there. Obviously it's going to be a 
difficult place to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are several reasons Tech is a big underdog.  
</P>
<P>
	--The Seminoles are 50-1-1 at home in the 1990s, the best record  
in the country. Florida State last lost at home in 1991, 17-16 to 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	--After beating Louisiana Tech 41-7 in their opener, the  
Seminoles are riding a 41-game home unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
	--Florida State, 7-7-1 overall against Tech, hasn't lost to the  
Yellow Jackets since 1975 and are 7-0 against them since entering 
the ACC in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Seminoles have beaten Tech by an aggregate score of 121-10  
in their last three meetings, winning 49-3 in 1996, 38-0 in 1997 
and 34-7 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But, O'Leary pointed out that his Yellow Jackets were only down  
10-7 late in the third quarter last season when quarterback Joe 
Hamilton was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The year before, Tech trailed 7-0 at halftime.  
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't been able to put a full game together against them  
and that's basically what we need. Our task is to play a full 60 
minutes against them and we haven't done that,'' O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't play a half or three quarters. We've got to play a  
full game and do it with the same intensity from the first snap,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tech is coming off an easy 49-14 win over Navy in its season  
opener a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a lot different than last week. It'll be two  
times faster,'' said senior linebacker Chris Edwards, who had a 
career-high 10 tackles against the Seminoles last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yellow Jackets have won six straight games since losing to  
the Seminoles last year. Facing them early in the season could be a 
break. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is the best time to play Florida State,'' Edwards  
said. ``As the season goes on they get stronger and stronger, so 
maybe we can catch them before everything is clicking.''

<HEADLINE> Swissair Relatives Criticize FAA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Relatives of two victims of last year's  
Swissair plane crash off the coast of Nova Scotia complained 
Tuesday that the Federal Aviation Administration was moving too 
slowly to address aircraft wiring and insulation issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyn Romano, whose husband, Raymond, was killed in the Sept. 2,  
1998, crash, and Barbara Fetherolf, whose 16-year-old daughter Tara 
was also a victim, said the agency failed to protect the public 
last month when it gave airlines four years to replace insulation 
coated with a material that fails a new flammability test. 
</P>
<P>
	``Four years of these `flying coffins' -- that's my term for them  
-- flying around, and it's just OK in their opinion,'' Romano 
complained to reporters after meeting with Thomas McSweeny, the 
FAA's head of aircraft regulation and certification. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA spokesman Les Dorr said the agency has issued more than a  
half-dozen airworthiness directives since December requiring 
airlines to check wiring and other electrical components on Boeing 
MD-11s, the type of widebody aircraft that crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel like we're taking positive action on a lot of these  
wiring issues as they come up,'' Dorr said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also has said that the four-year schedule for  
replacing the insulation will give airlines enough time to do the 
work without creating problems with other aircraft equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators still do not know what caused Swissair Flight 111,  
bound from New York to Geneva, to plunge into the ocean off Nova 
Scotia last year. The plane hit the water 16 minutes after the 
pilots reported smoke in the cockpit, and investigators have found 
traces of electrical arcing and heat-related damage in the top rear 
portion of the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
	All 229 aboard were killed.

<HEADLINE> `Sixth Sense' Soars at Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The end of the summer movie season failed to  
exorcise the ghostly grip ``The Sixth Sense'' has on the box 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The tale of the walking dead took in $28.5 million over the  
four-day weekend, according to industry estimates Monday. It was 
the movie's fifth straight weekend as the country's No. 1 film and 
a new box-office record for Labor Day, when movie attendance 
typically begins to trail off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixth Sense,'' starring Bruce Willis in the tale of a boy who  
communicates with ghosts, grossed almost as much as the next four 
movies' combined total of $30.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just amazing,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of  
Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks movie-ticket sales. 
``Nobody expected it to be this big of a picture, but it's totally 
dominating the market place right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Runaway Bride'' was No. 2 with $8.6 million, ``The 13th  
Warrior'' was third with $8.4 million, ``Bowfinger'' was fourth 
with $7 million, and ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' was fifth with 
$6.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one new movie, the Skeet Ulrich-Cuba Gooding Jr. thriller  
``Chill Factor,'' cracked the top 10 this weekend, grossing $5.7 
million for sixth place. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend's other major opening, ``Outside Providence,'' was  
in 11th place with $3.2 million. The coming-of-age comedy was 
unable to capitalize on the track record of writers Peter and Bobby 
Farrelly, who made ``There's Something About Mary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To date, ``Sixth Sense'' has taken in $175.5 million, and  
distributor Disney projects a final gross of at least $250 million, 
said Chuck Viane, head of distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers continue to talk up the movie among friends, and ``Sixth  
Sense'' is getting a lot of repeat business from people going back 
to see it again, Viane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall box office figures will top $100 million for the  
weekend, breaking the previous Labor Day record of $96 million in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a fitting end to a record summer movie season. The movie  
industry did about $3 billion in business from Memorial Day weekend 
through Labor Day, topping the previous high of $2.6 billion in 
summer 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Monday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
are to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Sixth Sense,'' $28.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Runaway Bride,'' $8.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The 13th Warrior,'' $8.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Bowfinger,'' $7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' $6.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Chill Factor,'' $5.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' $5.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``The Blair Witch Project, $3.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``The Muse,'' $3.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``The Astronaut's Wife,'' $3.4 million.

<HEADLINE> No More Waiting, Browns Finally Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Walking off the 18th green one day this summer,  
Ty Detmer got his first taste of what it was like to be the 
Cleveland Browns' starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys looked like they had had a few,'' said Detmer,  
``and they just started barking at me. My dad looked over and said, 
``Now I know why you wanted to play here.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	A love affair which began in the 1940s has been renewed in this  
football-mad town. The Browns are back in the NFL following a 
three-year exile, and as far as Clevelanders are concerned, all is 
right with the world again. 
</P>
<P>
	When coach Chris Palmer leads the Browns back on the field  
Sunday night for their opener in the new, 73,000-seat Cleveland 
Browns Stadium against the dreaded Pittsburgh Steelers, a national 
TV audience will join Cleveland in celebrating the Browns' rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what I'll do,'' Cleveland president Carmen Policy  
said a few weeks ago. ``I think there will be lots of hugs and lots 
of tears. It's going to be a truly memorable and emotional 
moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a moment Cleveland has been counting down to since the NFL  
awarded it an expansion franchise last year. Maybe former owner Art 
Modell's decision to take his team to Baltimore in 1996 was the 
best thing that ever happened here. 
</P>
<P>
	In the frugal Modell's place is Al Lerner, a local billionaire  
banker who plunked down $530 million in cash to buy the Browns. 
Lerner brought in Policy, who was part of the San Francisco dynasty 
that won five Super Bowls, and in less than a year Policy has given 
the Browns a distinctive West Coast design. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, these Browns could be called the Cleveland 99ers.  
</P>
<P>
	Dwight Clark, Cleveland's director of football operations, was  
the first of the San Francisco arrivals. When the Browns offense 
takes its first snap against the Steelers, the starting backfield -- 
Detmer, running back Terry Kirby, fullback Marc Edwards -- will 
consist entirely of ex-Niners. 
</P>
<P>
	Detmer was acquired in a trade to start and to serve as a mentor  
for rookie Tim Couch, the No. 1 overall pick in April's college 
draft. Detmer's ability to improvise will be a big plus for the 
Browns, who are thin at the skill positions and certain to have 
trouble scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Tim is the guy for the future, but I can't worry about  
that right now,'' Detmer said. ``That's not why I came here. I came 
to start. A player can never look over his shoulder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of uncertainty, and with Cleveland fans divided over  
who should be the team's top pick, the Browns went with Couch, who 
rewrote NCAA and school passing marks at Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, Jacksonville's offensive coordinator last year and a  
quarterbacks guru, had the final call on Couch, who during the 
preseason showed he might not need the grooming Cleveland had 
originally thought. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage, Ty's ahead of Tim, but I don't think there's a  
gap that's three miles long,'' Palmer said. ``If something happens 
to Ty or Ty is struggling and we wanted to make a change, we would 
make a change and feel very comfortable with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't be surprised to see Couch at least take some snaps against  
the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be ready whenever I'm called upon,'' said Couch, who  
signed a seven-year, $48 million contract before the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Carolina and Jacksonville, who both had two years to  
build, Cleveland had less than a year to get ready. And since '95, 
NFL free agency has changed dramatically, with teams signing their 
players to longer contracts, thus denying the Browns a chance to 
lure many. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, they got a few -- linebacker Jamir Miller, punter Chris  
Gardocki, Kirby, wide receiver Leslie Shepherd, center Dave 
Wohlabaugh -- but nearly half of Cleveland's roster consists of 
players the Browns took in February's expansion draft (14) and 
rookies (12). 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlabaugh will anchor an experienced offensive line, the  
Browns' strongest unit. There aren't many teams who can match the 
tackle tandem of Lomas Brown, a 15-year vet, and Orlando Brown, who 
played with the old Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby has been a third-down specialist throughout his career,  
and will now have to endure the pounding of carrying the ball 25 
times a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready, my body's ready,'' said Kirby, who will be backed  
up by Sedrick Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepherd, slowed by a groin injury during the preseason, caught  
eight TD passes for Washington and will be the No. 1 target. Rookie 
wideout Kevin Johnson showed big-play potential with three 
preseason TDs. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer knows points will be tough to come by, though  
fortunately, the Browns will have the easiest schedule in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	``Offensively, we're going to have to work,'' he said. ``We're  
going to have to be blue-collar and go down the field and execute. 
And if we're not executing, we could have a long day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not too comforting for the Browns defense, which lost its  
heart and soul last week when Chris Spielman retired because of a 
neck injury. Rookie Wali Rainer tries to fill Spielman's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Browns have some good players on defense, the best of  
whom is Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old still doesn't understand why teams were  
reluctant to sign him after he led Arizona in tackles despite 
playing the final 14 games with a dislocated left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my time to show them all they made a mistake,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Winning four games would be a good first year for the new  
Browns, but as Detmer has already learned, Cleveland fans are 
hungry for a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks after his golf outing, Detmer was signing autographs  
for fans who had come to see Cleveland's first training camp 
practice in three years. He noticed a change in attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first,'' he said. ``They were like, `We're glad to have you  
back. Just beat Baltimore and we'll be happy,' to ``You're going to 
lead us to the playoffs.' There's really never a grace period in 
the NFL.''

<HEADLINE> Thoreau Manuscript Being Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the summer of 1850, Henry David Thoreau was  
sharing a house with his parents and wondering what to do. He had 
completed his second book, the now-classic ``Walden,'' but had no 
idea how to follow it. ``I feel ripe for something, yet do 
nothing,'' he wrote in his journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Having started a surveying business, he chose to ponder the  
``rich and fertile mystery'' of the wildlife around Concord, Mass. 
He spent the last decade of his life compiling data, apparently for 
a comprehensive natural history of Concord. 
</P>
<P>
	Now a section of that unfinished project, ``Wild Fruits,'' will  
soon be available for the first time, nearly 140 years after the 
author's death. The book is being published this fall by W.W. 
Norton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prior to 1851, Thoreau was writing about himself in nature,''  
said the book's editor, Bradley Dean. ``With `Wild Fruits,' he 
seems to be getting out of the way. He writes about nature 
itself.'' Dean also edited another portion of Thoreau's project, 
``Faith in a Seed,'' which was published a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Thoreau has long been celebrated as one of the greatest  
American thinkers and prose stylists, it seems unthinkable that 
even fragments of Thoreau's work took so long to be published. At 
its best, the writing in ``Wild Fruits'' is clearly comparable to 
his more famous books. And Thoreau remains highly influential among 
writers and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thoreau is the most compelling among classic American writers  
in spelling out man's relation to the environment,'' said Dean, who 
has taught at several universities and now works at the Thoreau 
Institute in Lincoln, Mass., less than a mile from Walden Pond. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoreau was just 44 when he died of tuberculosis in 1862,  
passing away in the front parlor of his family home. Shortly before 
his death, he had wrapped the manuscript for ``Wild Fruits'' in 
heavy paper, tied string around it and placed it in a wooden chest, 
where he kept thousands of pages from other projects. 
</P>
<P>
	But it took decades for his works to be stored safely, in the  
New York Public Library. By then, the wooden box had vanished and 
the pages were scattered. And even in mint condition, Thoreau's 
handwriting was virtually illegible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started reading his manuscripts back in the late 1970s,''  
Dean said. ``I was reading manuscripts of works that had been 
published. I would come across a word I didn't know and compare it 
to the published text. You do that a thousand times and after a 
while you become an expert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In gathering material for ``Wild Fruits'' and other later books,  
Thoreau explored the nearby woods and swamps. He would walk miles 
just to watch the changes in a plant. ``We are surrounded by a rich 
and fertile mystery,'' he noted. ``May we not probe it, pry into 
it, employ ourselves about it -- a little?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of ``Wild Fruits'' is a catalogue of Thoreau's  
observations. Each plant or fruit has its own entry. He offered 
poetic descriptions of the elm tree (``we owe to it the first 
deepening of the shadows in our streets''), the dandelion (``that 
little seedy spherical system'') and the strawberry (``better call 
it by the Indian name of heart-berry, for it is indeed a crimson 
heart''). 
</P>
<P>
	A famous believer in Transcendentalism, which worshipped nature  
as divine, Thoreau attacked commercialism and status-seeking and 
other forms of materialism. In ``Wild Fruits,'' he cited the 
difference between buying fruit and gathering it yourself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a grand fact that you cannot make the fairer fruits or  
parts of fruits matter of commerce,'' he wrote. ``You cannot buy 
the pleasure which it yields to him who truly plucks it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dean said additional papers remain to be transcribed, including  
``Moonlight,'' a volume inspired by Thoreau's nighttime walks. 
Influenced by the then-recent publication of Charles Darwin's 
writings, Thoreau apparently was trying to apply the theory of 
natural selection to his own work. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to get his mind around the entire phenomenon of  
Concord,'' Dean said. ``He wanted to know it scientifically, 
historically, aesthetically. He was trying to compile the natural 
history of Concord, which nobody had tried anything like before.''

<HEADLINE> Reichel To Play in Czech Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Phoenix forward Robert Reichel  
will play for his hometown team this fall after failing to get a 
contract from the Coyotes, the newspaper Sport reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reichel, born in Litvinov in the Czech Republic, will play for  
HC Litvinov at least until Oct. 1, when the NHL season begins, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reichel, who earned $1.7 million last season, has been seeking a  
multiyear contract for more than $3 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have the right to get the salary I require,''  
Reichel said, adding he would not return to the NHL unless his 
demands were met. 
</P>
<P>
	Coyotes general manager Bobby Smith declined comment. Last  
month, Smith said Reichel would not play for the Coyotes next 
season and the team was open to trade offers. 
</P>
<P>
	Reichel, obtained in a March 20 trade with the New York  
Islanders for forward Brad Isbister, played 13 regular season and 
seven playoff games with the Coyotes before becoming a restricted 
free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	His 69 points last season, including 14 in 13 games with  
Phoenix, were three less than Jeremy Roenick, who led the Coyotes. 
Reichel had 10 points in his first seven games with the team, then 
faltered during the playoffs against St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Reichel has complained that Czech players, winners at both the  
Olympics in Nagano and at the last world championships, are not 
adequately paid in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Reichel -- who has 209 career goals -- has skipped an NHL season  
before. After back-to-back 40-goal seasons with Calgary, and 
scoring at a 40-goal pace in the strike-shortened 1994-95 season, 
he failed to reach a deal with the Flames. 
</P>
<P>
	The following season, he played in the German Hockey League with  
the Frankfurt Lions. He returned to Calgary in 1996-97 before being 
traded to the New York Islanders for Marty McInnis toward the end 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Reichel is not the only Czech to start playing at home this  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaclav Varada of Buffalo will play for his native HC Vitkovice;  
and Ottawa's Radek Bonk -- a member of the gold medal-winning Czech 
team at the 1996 World Championships -- will play for HC Pardubice. 
Both players have contract disagreements with their NHL clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman Hamrlik, one of the NHL's best defensemen, may play for HC  
Zlin if he doesn't reach an agreement with Edmonton. Hamrlik is 
seeking a deal for at least $2.5 million a year, while Oilers GM 
Glen Sather has reportedly only offered a $2 million salary.

<HEADLINE> NY Cop Found in Subway, Not Sure Why </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An off-duty police officer insists he doesn't  
know how he ended up deep inside a subway tunnel, covered with 
soot, with one ankle broken and evidence he had fired 15 shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Service on three subway lines in lower Manhattan was interrupted  
for nearly four hours on Labor Day after David Mercado shot out a 
train signal to get someone to rescue him. 
</P>
<P>
	The misadventures of Officer Mercado, 34, began after he  
finished a shift at Police Headquarters late Sunday and went out 
with two fellow officers. Police declined to say whether alcohol 
was consumed. 
</P>
<P>
	He told investigators he boarded a northbound train near Canal  
Street around 4:30 a.m. Monday, but doesn't remember anything else 
until he awoke in the subway tunnel with his ankle apparently 
broken in two places. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, Mercado said, he spent more than three hours in the  
tunnel, yelling and covering a train signal with his shirt in 
futile efforts to attract someone to rescue him. 
</P>
<P>
	He was finally found about 8 a.m. after he attracted the  
attention of a subway motorman by shooting out the signal. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said 15 empty shell casings were found in the area, and  
believe Mercado had emptied his service pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercado, a six-year veteran, was suspended from duty pending an  
investigation, said Officer Kevin Tyrell.

<HEADLINE> 'Candid Camera' Creator Dies at 84 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Allen Funt's comical handiwork  
always popped up where it was least expected: in a talking mailbox, 
a trick coffee cup or a bowling ball that would roll back without 
finger holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Only after viewers enjoyed a hearty laugh would Funt's popular  
catch phrase release his unwitting foil from befuddled wonder. 
``Smile!'' they'd be told. ``You're on 'Candid Camera!' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Funt died Sunday at his Pebble Beach home of complications from  
the 1993 stroke that forced him into retirement, the show reported 
in a statement. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	``Candid Camera,'' which Funt created, produced and directed,  
aired off and on from 1948 to 1990 and was considered a forerunner 
to other reality-based television shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``People toss around the word pioneer all the time, but Allen  
Funt was really one of those rare people,'' said Michael Naidus, a 
spokesman for CBS-TV. ``He created what has become an entire 
programming genre.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The network continues to air ``Candid Camera'' on Friday  
evenings, with Funt's son Peter and Suzanne Somers as hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier years, Funt himself appeared in many ``Candid  
Camera'' gags, along with such regulars as Dorothy Collins in the 
1960s and comedian and author Fannie Flagg (``Fried Green 
Tomatoes'') in the 1970s. A young Woody Allen appeared in some 
early shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The TV program was born of Funt's ``Candid Microphone,'' a radio  
show the New York native originated after his Army service in World 
War II. He was working as artist for an ad agency, but looking for 
a different job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned the power of radio watching Eleanor Roosevelt do her  
show,'' he recalled in a 1987 interview with The Associated Press. 
``I used to go up to Hyde Park and hold her papers. I was just a 
messenger, but it planted the bug of radio in me. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got my hands on an old wire recorder that was the forerunner  
of tape recorders,'' Funt said. ``That's how it began. In those 
days, we had to lug around these enormous recorders and camera 
equipment and find a place to conceal them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show had its television premiere, still called ``Candid  
Microphone,'' on ABC in 1948. It bounced to different networks in 
its early years, eventually getting picked up by CBS in 1960 for a 
seven-year run. In 1960-61, it was the seventh-best rated show in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	A syndicated version ran from 1974-78. In the 1989-90 season,  
CBS aired a number of ``Candid Camera'' specials featuring Allen 
and Peter Funt as co-hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	Funt was born in New York City and went on to earn a bachelor's  
degree in fine arts from Cornell University. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the years, Funt said he was never caught in a  
hidden-camera trick. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awfully hard to catch someone who does this for a  
living,'' he said. ``Nobody ever really turned the tables on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After his stroke, Funt remained an inspiration to his family,  
Peter Funt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He endured many hospitalizations and treatments, yet did so  
with good spirit and a ferocious will to live,'' he said in a 
statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Funt is survived by his five children.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Give Back Some Gains / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices fell Tuesday, erasing much  
of the gains from Friday's big rally, as investors reassessed last 
week's government report on employment and worried about impending 
corporate bond sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 13/16  
point, or $8.12 1/2 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, rose to 6.07 percent from 6.01 percent 
late Friday. The bond market was closed Monday in observance of 
Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said Friday's strong rally that drove 30-year bond  
yields down from 6.13 percent Thursday was probably an overreaction 
to the August employment report, which traders viewed as 
noninflationary. The Labor Department reported that August nonfarm 
payrolls increased just 124,000, well below expectations, while 
average hourly earnings rose a slight 0.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That convinced some traders and investors that Federal Reserve  
policy-makers won't raise rates for the third time this year when 
they meet next on Oct. 5. But Tuesday, the market turned cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders fear upcoming payroll data could show a big rebound in  
manufacturing jobs, indicating continued tight labor markets. That 
could signal inflation, which could prompt the Fed to raise 
interest rates. Higher interest rates hurt the value of bonds, 
which pay a fixed rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market also is under pressure from a number of possible  
corporate debt offerings, though Safeway's $1.5 billion bond 
offering is the only major deal expected this week. Large corporate 
bond sales diminish demand for government bonds because they tend 
to pay higher yields. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities were down between 3/32  
point and 1/8 point, and intermediate maturities were down 7/32 point 
to 7/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.82 percent as the  
discount fell 0.08 percentage point from Friday to 4.69 percent. 
Six-month yields were 5.13 percent, as the discount was unchanged 
at 4.93 percent. One-year yields were 5.23 percent as the discount 
rose by 0.02 percentage point from Friday to 4.95 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.31 1/4 percent from 5.13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 3/16 to 114 1/32. The average yield to 
maturity rose to 5.80 percent from 5.79 percent.

<HEADLINE> Reno Asks Danforth to Probe Waco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno has offered  
Republican former Sen. John Danforth the job of heading an 
independent inquiry into the government's use of force at the fiery 
end of the Branch Davidian standoff in Waco, Texas, government 
sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, told The  
Associated Press that the Justice Department was in final 
negotiations over the details of the independent inquiry and an 
announcement could come as early as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional officials who spoke with the Justice Department  
Tuesday said they understood Danforth was willing to take the job. 
According to government lawyers and congressional officials, the 
Justice Department was considering appointing a second person to 
assist Danforth in the investigation and help to manage the 
day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth, 63, would bring solid Republican credentials as well  
as a background in law enforcement. Before entering the Senate, he 
served as attorney general in Missouri for eight years. He retired 
from the Senate in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	A phone call to Danforth's office seeking comment was not  
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	He is an Episcopal priest, and both admirers and detractors have  
noted his emphasis on morals as well as his stubborn independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Final touches were being put on the scope and nature of the  
investigation, said the sources, who include Republicans on Capitol 
Hill who had discussions Tuesday with Justice Department officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno's decision comes as congressional Republicans have  
increased pressure on her and on FBI Director Louis Freeh to 
explain how evidence, including a videotape, about the siege was 
withheld from the public for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP wants to know whether the FBI lied about using  
incendiary tear gas canisters during the final raid on the 
compound. More than 80 sect members died, some of them children, a 
fire that the government contends was set by sect members. 
</P>
<P>
	No evidence has been uncovered by any of the committees probing  
the raid that the government was responsible for starting the fire, 
according to several aides familiar with the investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Several GOP-led committees in Congress have begun  
reinvestigating the Waco matter. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are recent revelations by the FBI that it fired several  
flammable tear gas canisters at a storm shelter hours before the 
main Branch Davidian building went up in flames. The FBI and the 
Justice Department had previously denied use of any incendiary 
devices, and investigations will focus on whether this 
misinformation was the result of a bureaucratic slip-up or a 
cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department insists there is no change in conclusions  
that it was David Koresh and his followers who started the fatal 
fire. The department also stresses that military special operations 
officers were on the scene only as observers and advisers, and not 
in an illegal capacity as participants in the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have used the revelations to attack the credibility  
of Reno and the Justice Department. The White House has stood 
behind Reno, but President Clinton has declined to give a similar 
vote of confidence to Freeh. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats on Capitol Hill have asked the GOP to let the  
independent investigation sought by Reno occur before congressional 
hearings 
</P>
<P>
	Those who know Danforth say he would bring instant credibility  
to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He calls them like he sees them,'' former Sen. Thomas  
Eagleton, a Missouri Democrat who served 10 years with Danforth, 
has said. ``Members of the Senate or House will have full faith in 
his finding.''

<HEADLINE> Jets Sign Running Back Parmalee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- For more than a year, New York Jets  
linebacker Bryan Cox has been urging coach Bill Parcells to try to 
sign Dolphins running back Bernie Parmalee. On Tuesday, two days 
after Miami let Parmalee go, Parcells did just that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday, I called Bryan up and told him, `Quit bugging me, I  
got the player,' '' Parcells said. Parmalee, 32 next week, will be 
plugged in immediately on most of the Jets' special teams. The 
eighth-year veteran, Miami's leading tackler on coverage teams the 
past two seasons, also might be utilized as a third-down back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great,'' said Parmalee, who is from New Jersey, as is  
Parcells. ``I've got an opportunity to play for one of the greatest 
coaches that ever coached. When my career is done, I can say I had 
the opportunity to play for the big Tuna. It's good to know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Parmalee, the Jets terminated the contract of  
running back Keith Byars, who had been scheduled to be a backup 
F-Back in the club's restructured offense. Byars, who did not play 
special teams, was effectively bumped to third string Sunday when 
Parcells elected to keep second-year player Blake Spence, a 
promising talent. 
</P>
<P>
	Jets players were as happy to see Parmalee arrive Tuesday as  
Dolphins players were sorry to see him go Sunday. The back, a 
special-teams co-captain for Miami a season ago, is known as a 
solid locker room presence and a leader on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins, overloaded with running backs and young players on  
the rise, no longer had room for Parmalee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm never bitter,'' Parmalee said. ``I don't hold any grudges.  
I just move on. That's life; everything's not going to work out the 
way you want it all the time, so you just have to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells had eyed Parmalee long before Cox began to speak up.  
The former rookie free agent, signed by Miami in 1992, has been a 
familiar scouting target for the coach in stints with the New 
England Patriots and Jets. The men talked often before games in 
recent seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I know Bernie Parmalee as well as some of my  
players, probably better than some of my players,'' Parcells said. 
``I've coached against him 15 or 16 times. I know the player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox, with the Dolphins from 1991-95, said he approached Parcells  
about Parmalee because he knew what his former teammate could do. 
The coach joked Tuesday that he would blame the linebacker if 
Parmalee didn't work out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll take that responsibility, because I'm not going to put my  
name on nothing that I don't believe in,'' Cox said. ``I believe in 
Bernie. If we're going to be successful, he's going to be a major 
part of that.''

<HEADLINE> Pre-Human Skull Found in NYC Shop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A fossil skull, presumably of a Homo erectus  
believed up to 1 million years old, has been found in a Manhattan 
shop, The New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Paleoanthropologists have concluded that the skull is a genuine  
specimen from Indonesia that could be critical in determining the 
place on the human family tree of the East Asia branch of Homo 
erectus. 
</P>
<P>
	Such information could be central to the understanding of where  
and how modern humans, Homo sapiens, evolved, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The skull was delivered in March to the Columbus Avenue shop  
Maxilla and Mandible Ltd., whose window display boasts bleached 
bones, mounted insects and animal sculptures, among other 
natural-history curiosities. 
</P>
<P>
	The shop's owner, Henry Galiano, said the fossil was dropped off  
by a mysterious man who claimed to represent the estate of a 
collector. Galiano, in cleaning the skull, realized it could be 
ancient and valuable. 
</P>
<P>
	The dark gray skull, anywhere from 100,000 to 1 million years  
old, probably belonged to a male in his 20s, scientists said. The 
individual's brain was about half the size of that of Homo sapiens 
but within the range for Homo erectus. He had a humanlike high 
forehead. 
</P>
<P>
	Casts of the inside of the skull indicate differential  
development of the two sides of the brain and swelling in a region 
of the brain known as the Broca cap, which suggest the Homo erectus 
was developing the potential for language and speech, scientists 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very interesting specimen because it's not like any  
other Homo erectus we know from Indonesia or anywhere else,'' said 
Dr. Eric Delson, a City University of New York paleoanthropologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists from Indonesia and the United States who studied the  
skull -- an almost complete cranium but missing the upper and lower 
jaws -- are preparing to publish their findings. 
</P>
<P>
	The shop's owner has presented the skull, which was traced to  
the Poloyo village on the Solo River in Central Java, to an 
Indonesian paleoanthropologist for its return home. Experts 
estimate it might have commanded $500,000 on the open market.

<HEADLINE> IMF Issues World Economic Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund  
expects the world economy to expand by 2.8 percent this year and by 
3.4 percent in 2000, according to preliminary IMF projections 
posted late Tuesday on the Dutch Finance Ministry's Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	The document, placed for unknown reasons on the Finance  
Ministry's Web site, reveals the forecasts along with the agenda 
for the IMF's Sept. 26-27 meeting. A Finance Ministry spokesman who 
declined to give his name said the forecasts in the document were 
preliminary and could change before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dutch document also indicated the IMF is close to abandoning  
efforts to sell 10 percent of its gold reserves on the open market 
to finance debt relief for the world's poorest countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The document said that strong opposition from U.S. lawmakers and  
mining interests in the United States to outright sales of gold had 
forced the IMF to consider alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those alternatives would involve selling 10 million  
ounces of the IMF's 103 million ounces of gold to the central banks 
of a group of nations, rather than selling the gold on the open 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Those central banks would purchase the gold at the going price  
on the open market -- around $256 an ounce currently. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF would then turn around and repurchase the gold at the  
same open-market value rather than the $47 per ounce at which the 
gold is currently valued on the IMF's books. 
</P>
<P>
	While the IMF would end up with the gold again, the circular  
transaction would allow it to value the repurchased holdings at the 
higher value. The agency would use the higher asset value on its 
books to support increased debt relief. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether this plan would be able to win over  
congressional critics, however. Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., called the 
new proposal ``about as murky as the proceeding proposal, showing 
once again the characteristic lack of IMF transparency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The outlook for the expansion of the global economy as outlined  
in the document is an upward revision of the IMF's previous world 
economic outlook in May, when gross domestic product was seen to 
rise by 2.3 percent in 1999 and by 3.3 percent next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, IMF spokesman William Murray said that the IMF's  
executive board held discussions on a revised economic outlook last 
week but ``final projections won't be ready until closer to the

	The IMF is scheduled to release its new ``World Economic  
Outlook'' on Sept. 22, in advance of the annual meetings of the 
182-nation IMF and its sister lending agency, the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finance Ministry said growth estimates for all ``Asian  
crisis countries'' have been revised upwards, and that the crises 
in Russia and Brazil are less problematic than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's 1999 GDP is expected to contract by only 1 percent,  
down from a previous 3.7 percent, and Russia's economy should 
shrink by 2 percent, down from an earlier forecast of 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Growth in Japan and Europe seems to be recovering and the  
expansion in the U.S. is continuing, almost without price or wage 
pressure,'' the document said. 
</P>
<P>
	It noted that the IMF now sees imbalances such as the highly  
valued stock market and the strong U.S. dollar as a danger for an 
overheating of the American economy, and said timely rate increases 
in the United States might be needed in order to prevent a ``hard 
landing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Japan, the preliminary economic outlook called for GDP  
growth of 0.2 percent in 1999 and a growth of 1 percent in 2000. 
``Several signals point to a limited recovery of the Japanese 
economy,'' the document read. 
</P>
<P>
	It said economic growth in the 11 countries committed to  
Europe's common currency should expand by 2.1 percent this year and 
by 2.8 percent in 2000. For the entire European Union, GDP was 
projected to increase by 1.9 percent in 1999 and by 2.7 percent 
next year.

<HEADLINE> Milwaukee Buys Bere, Mouton Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Milwaukee Brewers purchased the contracts  
of pitcher Jason Bere and outfielder Lyle Mouton from Louisville of 
the International League on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers also recalled pitcher Carl Dale from Louisville. To  
make room on the roster, Milwaukee transferred catcher Bobby Hughes 
and infielder Fernando Vina to the 60-day disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Bere was released by the Cincinnati Reds on Aug. 4 and signed to  
a minor league contract by Milwaukee nine days later. He was 2-0 
with a 2.08 ERA in five starts with Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee acquired Mouton from Baltimore on July 1 for  
outfielder Todd Dunn. He hit .357 with 19 homers and 77 RBIs in 83 
games in Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale will be making his major league debut.  
</P>
<P>
	It appears increasingly unlikely Vina, an All-Star last season,  
will play again for Milwaukee this year. He was placed on the DL on 
June 4 with a strained left quadriceps, but he also developed 
tendinitis in his right knee. Treatment and rehabilitation 
assignments have failed to correct the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes has a strained right elbow.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Launches `Skinny Cat' Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Trying to close the money gap separating  
him from front-runners for the Republican presidential nomination, 
Sen. Orrin Hatch on Tuesday launched a television ad seeking $36 
from each resident of his home state of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-second spot features prominent Utah figures, such as  
former Gov. Norm Bangerter, Brigham Young football coach LaVell 
Edwards, University of Utah football coach Ron McBride, 
professional golfer Bruce Summerhayes and Utah Jazz assistant coach 
Phil Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	In the commercial, Bangerter says the check for the four-term  
senator ``is for 24 great years working for Utah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Just think,'' says Summerhayes, ``If we each send in $36, we  
can change history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If every Utah resident donates $36 to Hatch's long-shot run for  
the GOP nomination, ``we'll have more than enough'' to run a 
competitive campaign against Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who is 
leading in polls, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has raised an unprecedented $50 million. Hatch began the  
$36 per donor campaign earlier this summer, after the Bush campaign 
reported raising $36 million. Hatch said he has raised about $1 
million, half from Utah donors. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Bush has the fat cats. I want the skinny cats,'' Hatch  
said.

<HEADLINE> Report: CBS and Viacom To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. were expected to  
announce they are combining the companies in what would be the 
biggest media merger ever, The Wall Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination would create a media powerhouse owning the CBS  
network, several major cable networks -- including MTV, Nickelodeon, 
Country Music Television and the Nashville Network -- along with 
film studio Paramount Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's market valuation is about $37 billion at Friday's closing  
stock price, while Viacom's market capitalization is about $31 
billion, the newspaper said on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged companies would likely be run by CBS's chief  
executive officer, Mel Karmazin, who rose from the ranks of the 
radio industry to take control of CBS in 1997, the Journal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal marks a new chapter in the long career of Viacom  
Chairman Sumner Redstone, 75, who took control of Viacom in 1987 
and seven years later greatly enlarged it by buying Paramount 
Communications Inc. and Blockbuster Entertainment Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the transaction were not immediately available.  
</P>
<P>
	The pact with CBS comes just a month after the Federal  
Communications Commission relaxed television station ownership 
rules and triggered a round of discussions between media companies 
over possible mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom owns a station group and a 50 percent stake in the UPN  
network. The future status of UPN was unclear because government 
rules prevent one company owning more than two networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger reunites two companies split apart three decades ago  
by government rules, eliminated a few years ago, aimed at 
preventing networks owning their own programming. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, however, deregulation has sparked a move toward  
vertical integration in the television industry, highlighted by 
Walt Disney Co.'s purchase of ABC in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Anti-McDonald's Campaign Is Coming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals  
is preparing a public relations assault on McDonald's that will 
include billboards depicting a bloody, slaughtered cow's head and a 
caption: ``Do you want fries with that? McDonalds. Cruelty to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	PETA also plans to issue stickers, bumper stickers, posters,  
T-shirts and print advertisements with the cow's head and other 
disturbing images, such as a drawing of Ronald McDonald holding a 
bloody butcher knife and a dead chicken. The ad calls the 
McDonald's clown ``Son of Ron -- America's Biggest Serial Killer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Riker, a McDonald's spokesman, said the PETA ad campaign is  
``unwarranted and tasteless and disgusting, and I'm sure it will 
turn off a vast majority of Americans who might see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riker said McDonald's remains committed to animal welfare and  
will work with other groups on the issue. He declined to identify 
those groups. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's already has made some reforms, such as implementing  
training at suppliers' slaughterhouses, Riker said. The company 
also hired Temple Grandin, an animal welfare expert at Colorado 
State University, as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	PETA has recommended a number of actions that McDonald's can  
take, such as ensuring that animals are killed without prolonged 
suffering and that chickens are allowed to roam free, and selling 
veggie burgers nationwide. The chain already sells veggie burgers 
in some restaurants in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	PETA's campaign follows what it said was the breakdown of talks  
with McDonald's over steps the company can take to reduce cruelty 
to animals that are slaughtered for food. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign begins Oct. 1 when two billboards go up in the  
Norfolk area, where the 600,000-member animal-rights group has its 
headquarters. PETA also will try to put up billboards in other 
cities, including Chicago, near McDonald's Oak Brook, Ill., 
headquarters, said Bruce Friedrich, PETA's vegetarian campaign 
coordinator.

<HEADLINE> Gore Offers Plan for Uninsured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore today will offer a  
wide-ranging package of proposals aimed at bringing millions of 
uninsured Americans into the health care system and improving 
coverage for those already in it. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore plans to make it clear that, if elected president, he  
would pursue the same incremental approach to changing managed care 
that President Clinton adopted after his attempt to revamp the 
system failed to win congressional approval in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have all learned that we cannot overhaul the system in one  
fell swoop,'' Gore said in remarks prepared for a speech at a 
hospital here today. ``Experience has taught us that there is a way 
to keep what is right, while fixing what is wrong with American 
health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the Democratic presidential candidate's plan  
would be a guarantee that by 2005, every child in the nation would 
have access to affordable health care. 
</P>
<P>
	The Children's Health Fund, an advocacy group for disadvantaged  
children, estimates some 11 million children have no health 
insurance and almost as many have inadequate plans or live in 
places without enough doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	To help insure more children, Gore would expand the Children's  
Health Insurance Program, which helps states provide coverage to 
children in working families. Currently, states can use the federal 
CHIP money to cover children in families that earn up to 200 
percent of the poverty level. Gore would raise that cap to 250 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore would also allow families that do not qualify for the  
program, and do not receive health benefits through their jobs, to 
buy into the program. He would give financial bonuses to states 
that meet enrollment targets for CHIP and Medicaid, programs he 
believes are not fully utilized. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the fastest-growing group of uninsured Americans are  
those between 55 and 65. Currently, Americans are eligible for 
Medicare at 65. Gore proposed allowing ``vulnerable Americans'' to 
buy into the program as early as age 55 and he promised a 25 
percent tax credit to help defray the cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Let people with disabilities keep Medicare or Medicaid when  
they returned to the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	--Encourage small businesses to band together to negotiate rates  
for their workers' coverage by providing a 25 percent tax credit to 
the firms. 
</P>
<P>
	--Press for a ``real, enforceable'' Patients' Bill of Rights,  
similar to legislation that Congress will consider when it returns 
this month from recess. Gore didn't explicitly say in his remarks 
whether he favors allowing patients to sue their health maintenance 
organizations and collect damages when care has been denied. But, 
he has promoted Democratic legislation this year that would do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's ``bill of rights'' would guarantee patients the right to  
see a specialist, and ensure doctors can tell patients all their 
medical options. It would guarantee that pregnant women and cancer 
patients wouldn't have to change doctors in the middle of 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that it also would require managed care companies  
to cover mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make sure that a patient with depression is given  
access to care on terms no different from a patient who has 
diabetes,'' he said. ``And I will begin by improving mental health 
services for those who receive Medicaid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore promised to establish new public-private partnerships to  
expand access to prevention and wellness programs and to promote 
such initiatives in the workplace. He didn't say what the 
government's role would be, however, nor did he say how he would 
finance the new initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's proposal staked out ground between that of his Democratic  
rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley, who has said he will propose 
something approaching universal coverage, and Republicans, who fear 
that imposing too many mandates on private health care firms will 
drive up costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Others will argue against reforming our health care system  
carefully, realistically, and step-by-step. Some of them will tell 
you that the only acceptable answer is a one-size-fits-all 
solution,'' Gore said, in an apparent reference to Bradley.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Hire Two Executives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Rooneys have done fairly well running the  
Pittsburgh Steelers, so new owner Mario Lemieux has recruited a 
member of the family to run the Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Rooney, who worked for the Penguins from 1981-90 in their  
marketing and promotions department, was hired Tuesday as the 
team's chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Sawyer, the NHL's chief financial officer from 1979-93, also  
was hired as the Penguins' chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Rooney, Sawyer and general manager Craig Patrick will serve as  
executive vice presidents under Lemieux, whose takeover of the 
Penguins was approved by last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick served as team president and chief executive officer for  
nine months while the Penguins were in bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Tom and Ken have NHL experience, as well as a great deal  
of enthusiasm for what we're doing here with the Penguins,'' 
Lemieux said. ``I will rely on their expertise and advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rooney, 49, is the nephew of Pittsburgh Steelers founder Art  
Rooney and is the cousin of Steelers president Dan Rooney. He once 
ran the Civic Arena, where the Penguins play, and most recently has 
been president of PACE Facilities Group, which oversees 15 
amphitheaters and entertainment venues, including Star Lake 
Amphitheater in Washington County. 
</P>
<P>
	Sawyer, 50, has been a financial consultant to a number of pro  
sports teams, including the Penguins, since 1993.

	CINCINNATI (AP) -- An arrest warrant was issued for former NBA  
player Dontonio Wingfield after he failed to show for his 
sentencing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wingfield pleaded guilty June 7 to assaulting two suburban  
Cincinnati police officers during a fight last year at his
