<HEADLINE> GOP Plans Senior Prescription Aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans will use $40 billion
of their proposed budget to help low-income elderly people pay for
prescription drugs, party leaders said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is simply unacceptable that 13 million seniors do not have
prescription drug coverage,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla.,
chairman of the House Republican Conference. ''Republicans are
committed to helping these most vulnerable seniors, offering a plan
to get prescription drugs to them while, at the same time,
preparing Medicare for the next generation of retirees.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican proposal would cost about the same as President
Clinton's plan, whose price tag is an estimated $35 billion over
five years and $149 billion over the next decade. The
administration's plan would also include another $35 billion in its
final five years to help seniors with catastrophic drug expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president wants to create a big-government health system
that offers no competition or options for individual states,''
Watts said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, who are drafting their budget for next year,
still have to work out the details of their proposal.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings Re-Acquire Todd Gill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Red Wings, looking for an experienced
defenseman, reacquired Todd Gill late Monday for minor league left
wing Philippe Audet.
</P>
<P>
   Gill, 35, had one goal and six assists in 41 games with the
Coyotes this season. He was a minus-10.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a good opportunity to take Todd and trade him back to
Detroit,'' said Coyotes general manager Bobby Smith. ''I think he's
happy with the move. He wasn't playing a lot and he wasn't happy
with his ice time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill signed with the Coyotes as a free agent before the start of
the season after playing for the Wings the last half of the 1998-99
season after being waived by St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The defenseman, who missed 24 games with a broken forearm, had
two goals and two assists in 23 games for Detroit last season.
</P>
<P>
   Audet, the Wings' second-round choice in the 1995 draft, was the
third-leading scorer for the Cincinnati Cyclones of the IHL with 19
goals and 22 assists. He also had 115 penalty minutes.

<HEADLINE> Assembly Democrats say they will block sportsman fee increase  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Two Assembly Democrats say they won't let
hunting and fishing license fees go up in New York until the state
Department of Environmental Conservation is willing to sit down and
discuss why the increase is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until there is a full discussion, we're not proceeding,'' said
Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman of Onondaga County. He and
Democratic Assemblyman Richard Brodsky said Monday the Assembly
will not include a license fee increase in their budget to be
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There probably is a need for a license increase but they need
to justify it,'' Bragman said.
</P>
<P>
   This came as state Comptroller H. Carl McCall released an audit
of the state's Conservation Fund, which state officials say is
running out of money and needs hunting and fishing license
increases to keep in the black.
</P>
<P>
   But ''this audit shows that there may be more funds available
and more options to consider before a final decision is made to
raise those fees,'' McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   The audit, though, also proves that the fee increase that state
officials have been asking for is needed, said Jennifer Post,
spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The audit confirms that revenues do not meet expenditures and
that lawmakers need to address the situation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The $32.7 million Conservation Fund pays for about half of the
state's fish and wildlife programs. The rest comes from federal
aid, state taxes and other funds.
</P>
<P>
   The DEC has said it would have to cut $2 million worth of state
programs by April to keep the fund in the black. It has also said
the state Conservation Fund will have an almost $30 million deficit
by April 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The DEC has asked for an increase in sportsmen's fees by 19.9
percent to help make up for the difference and Gov. George Pataki
included the increase in his budget.
</P>
<P>
   After not getting an increase last year, the department closed a
state-run game farm that provides pheasants for hunters. It already
has announced a nine-point contingency plan for further cuts this
year if it doesn't get its increase, including scaling back on some
fish production efforts, reducing forest management, reducing some
fish hatcheries and reducing some law enforcement efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups have been pushing for the increase. ''New York state
already has one of the lowest sportsman license fees in the nation,
and it has not been increased for close to a decade,'' said David
Miller, executive director of the National Audubon Society of New
York State. ''The proposed increase will support critical wildlife
habitat conservation efforts that benefit all New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   State law requires the money in the Conservation Fund to go only
to fish and wildlife programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you read the audit, you will see that it confirms that the
fund has been properly managed,'' Post said.
</P>
<P>
   While McCall says DEC has been spending the Conservation Fund's
money appropriately, not all of the fund's revenue from the sale of
licenses has been accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sporting licenses are sold by nearly 1,800 vendors around the
state,'' McCall said. ''DEC has not reconciled its books since 1994
to ensure that the state has received all of the revenues for
licenses sold by those vendors.''
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller also said DEC underestimated the fund's balance
by $1.5 million when it said a fee increase was needed. That
includes $700,000 in fund interest from the sale of lifetime
licenses that had not been calculated by the department.
</P>
<P>
   Despite McCall's findings, Brodsky says DEC won't sit down and
talk with them about whether a fee increase is needed. ''We found
close to $2 million! They ought to come out of their bunkers,''
Brodsky said.

<HEADLINE> Senate leader wants to eliminate gas sales tax completely  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Another tax cutting war may be starting in
the state Capitol, but this time it is over gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate's Republican majority leader on Monday
suggested that the state eliminate its sales tax on gasoline
completely, instead of for just two months like the state
Assembly's Democratic leader has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Bruno called for eliminating the 4 percent sales tax
on May 1, saving drivers more than $300 million a year. That means
drivers would save 8 cents a gallon if gas hits $2 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the sales tax helps ''ensure that government doesn't
profit from drivers' pain,'' the Republican leader said.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers have been hit with a double whammy of sorts on
energy prices. OPEC's decision to curtail oil production caused
crude oil prices to climb, and a harsh stretch of weather in
January and early February caused demand and the price of home
heating oil to soar in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices have followed suit, with unleaded regular now
routinely costing $1.50 or more a gallon. There have been
predictions of continued price escalation into the summer tourist
months.
</P>
<P>
   The state would make up the money lost from the increase in tax
revenues due to record bonus payments to Wall Street traders, Bruno
said. ''What better use can we make of those additional dollars
than to return those dollars to the taxpayers of this state?'' the
Senate leader said.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver had called Sunday for
eliminating the sales tax on gasoline for just two summer months.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great idea,'' Bruno said Monday. ''I'm glad that he
focused on that. We just want to make a great idea even greater.''
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly plan would cost some $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki said he was generally in favor of eliminating
the state's gas sales tax but delivered a warning to legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the strength of the state economy we could afford a tax
cut that would get rid of the state sales tax on gasoline for years
to come, but not if we go on spending binges in other areas, not if
we're going to pass other massive tax cuts,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Silver proposed a $967 million increase in education
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, Silver and Bruno are in the middle of hashing out the
state budget. It has been 16 years since lawmakers and the governor
completed passage on a new budget prior to the April 1 start of the
new state fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate GOP proposal would give counties and municipalities
which also impose a local gas tax -- their add-ons are generally
between 3 percent and 4 percent -- the option of also waiving those
levies.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruno proposal is similar to the state's elimination of its
portion of sales taxes on clothing purchases worth $110 or less.
That went into effect on March 1. A handful of localities -- most
significantly New York City -- also decided to give up their portion
of sales taxes on those purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed sales tax eliminations from Silver would only cover
gas and diesel fuel for automobiles, not diesel fuel for large
trucks. Bruno's proposal would include diesel for trucks.

<HEADLINE> Pataki proposes opening New York's GOP prez primary ballot  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Just days after defending the state's
Republican presidential primary system, Gov. George Pataki has
proposed a massive overhaul of the system before the next one comes
around.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of widespread criticism that he had tried to stack
the deck in Texas Gov. George W. Bush's favor, Pataki on Monday
unveiled a four-point ballot reform proposal that, if approved by
the state Legislature, would allow all nationally recognized
candidates onto the New York GOP ballot. It would also make the
state's GOP primary a winner-take-all contest and allow New York
Republicans to vote directly for the candidates, not for delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would also have primary polls open from 6 a.m. to 9
p.m. statewide. Those hours are currently in force only for New
York City, the suburban counties surrounding the city and in Erie
County where Buffalo is located. In the rest of the state, primary
polls are only open from noon to 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''Campaigns should not get bogged down needlessly by
technicalities that draw attention away from the candidates'
ideas,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   The call to make the GOP primary a winner-take-all affair drew
immediate fire from state Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's just another way of rigging the primary'' for the party
favorite, Hope said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, state GOP Chairman William Powers, citing the results
of last week's primary, said Monday that ''winner-take-all looks
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   In last week's New York GOP primary, Bush won at least 67 of the
93 delegates at stake. Sen. John McCain took the rest. Pataki had
run the Texas governor's campaign in New York. Had the Pataki
reform been in place, Bush would have captured all 93 delegates at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and Powers had led an unsuccessful effort to use the
state's complex ballot access rules to keep everyone but Bush off
the New York primary ballot this year. McCain took to calling
Pataki and Powers ''comrade'' and compared the New York ballot
access rules to the old Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge's order eventually opened up the ballot to
McCain, who suspended his campaign in the wake of Bush's Super
Tuesday primary victories in a host of states including New York,
California and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Under Pataki's plan, all GOP presidential candidates who had
qualified for matching federal funds would have spots on the New
York GOP ballot. Also, the two Republican members of the
four-person state Board of Elections could add other Republicans to
the ballot by designating them nationally recognized candidates.
Other candidates seeking to get on the GOP ballot would have to
collect the signatures of 5,000 party members.
</P>
<P>
   This year, GOP candidates had to collect signatures from party
members in any of the state's 31 congressional districts in which
they wanted to field delegate slates. GOP voters then got to vote
for the delegate slates, but not the candidates. There were, in
effect, 31 mini-primaries with three GOP delegates elected in each
congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Pataki proposal, GOP voters would cast ballots
directly for the candidates and the winner of the popular vote
statewide would win all the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP primary ballot rules were eased somewhat in the wake of
the 1996 contest when Pataki and Powers also got roundly criticized
for their unsuccessful effort to keep everyone off the ballot that
year but Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't go far enough,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a little late, isn't he?'' Hope said with a laugh Monday
when asked Pataki's plan. ''It's a disgrace the way the Republicans
have manipulated the ballot to their own backroom purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's Democrats vote directly for the candidates in their
party's primary and delegates are then awarded proportionately in
accordance with the percentage of the primary vote, above 15
percent, won by each candidate.

<HEADLINE> New York City vies with upstate town in zoning decision  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN BREZOSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- An all-year resort planned for a picturesque
mountain valley pits stewardship of New York City's drinking water
source against local zoning authority.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the Catskill watershed agreement was
signed in 1997, New York City petitioned the state to become the
lead agency in the environmental quality review, or SEQR, of plans
for the Belleayre resort. That resort would include 1,900 acres of
hotels, time-share housing, markets and golf greens surrounding the
state-run Belleayre ski mountain in Ulster and Sullivan counties.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Shandaken, population 3,000, sees the city's
application as an affront. Town officials feel are seen as unable
to protect the drinking supply of 9 million New York City residents
and that the city is violating the spirit of the watershed
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very fundamental and very important issue, not just
for Shandaken but really for the Catskill region and the whole
Hudson Valley,'' said Joel Sachs, attorney for the Coalition of
Watershed Towns. ''The issue really is are the municipalities going
to make the fundamental decisions as to what type of land use there
should be, or is New York City?''
</P>
<P>
   State Environmental Conservation Commissioner John Cahill is
expected to decide in a week whether the city will become the lead
agency in the environmental review of the development project.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's drinking water comes from three upstate
watersheds -- the Catskill, Delaware and Croton systems.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to some who live in the region, the city's
interest in the watershed is strangling the region's attempts to
recover from the economic doldrums left by its faded resort
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''You dig a hole here, they're right here checking where the
hole is,'' said Robert DeKalb, a member of Shandaken's planning
board. ''I moved away from New York City to be in the mountains.
Now I'm right here in the middle of a conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Sachs, ''New York City agreed they would not do anything
to impede the municipalities in upstate New York from proceeding in
their own land use decisions. They're getting in the way of
economic development in the town of Shandaken.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of legal battles between upstate and downstate
interests and environmentalists and developers, the 1997 watershed
agreement required the city to spend $1.5 billion on watershed
protection upstate, including buying land to keep it from
development.
</P>
<P>
   In return, upstate officials agreed to allow the city to
regulate development in certain swaths of the watershed. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency waived an order requiring the city
to build an $8 billion filtration plant to ensure the quality of
the city's drinking water supply.
</P>
<P>
   That waiver expires in 2002, when the EPA will again review the
city's management of the water.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Department of Environmental Protection has an
ally in James Tierney, assistant attorney general to state Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer. Tierney urged Cahill to approve the city's
request on Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ''Polluted and heated runoff could significantly add to the
degradation of this unfiltered drinking water supply,'' Tierney
said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   He added that a number of trout streams in the region could be
harmed by runoff during construction and later by pollution such as
fertilizers and pesticides from golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   Tierney said that while the Shandaken planning board has
consultants and engineers to provide advice and technical
assistance, DEP's watershed expertise and experience as lead agency
for numerous large-scale projects makes it the better choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''The project really needs to be reviewed from both the local
and regional perspective,'' said Adirondack Mountain Club spokesman
Neil Woodworth. The club's hikers who also trek the Catskills
envision mountaintops marred by hotels and vacation housing, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the issue particularly sensitive is the economics of
the proposal, so far estimated at around $200 million while
creating 300 permanent jobs.
</P>
<P>
   According to DeKalb, Belleayre Mountain is all the town has to
draw tourists and their dollars.

<HEADLINE> Silver proposes $967 million more than Pataki for education  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver says he
wants to pump at least $1.3 billion into the state's public school
system, despite urgings from Gov. George Pataki to put less money
into the state system.
</P>
<P>
   Silver on Monday proposed to add $1.3 billion in general support
for state schools and a one-time $500 million boost for school
construction and minor repairs. The extra money can be funded out
of the state's surplus, which totals about $4.2 billion, the
Manhattan Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Considering that our education system and our workforce are
some of our greatest assets ... we believe that this state owes it
to them and their parents to make this kind of investment,'' Silver
said.
</P>
<P>
   Silver's proposal is $967 million more than what Pataki had
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   In his budget proposal in January, Pataki had asked the
Legislature to put an additional $353 million into elementary and
secondary education, a 3 percent increase over the current-year aid
levels.
</P>
<P>
   That would have brought education spending up to about $12.9
billion, a continuation of record amounts of spending on education
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki did not sound supportive when asked about Silver's plan,
saying the Legislature already is proposing massive tax cuts and
other spending programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we didn't do anything else, we could do this, but it's a
question of everything being added together,'' he said. ''Record
increases in education, increases in local assistance, increases in
highway and transportation funding and at the same time record tax
cuts -- any one of these or any combination can be done within a
context of a balanced budget, but they can't all be done within the
context of a balanced budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver said the Assembly will present a balanced budget plan
with their education proposals. ''Therefore, it makes sense,'' he
said. ''It makes sense to invest in our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver, Republican Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno and state
Education Commissioner Richard Mills have all said that more money
is needed than Pataki proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Assembly proposal for a $1.3 billion increase is welcome
news and should help direct the discussion toward ways to improve
learning standards and student achievement,'' Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said the additional funding will be used to provide for
smaller class sizes and universal pre-kindergarten, better teacher
training, improved academic standards and promotion of summer
education programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly leader also suggested that increased education
spending could reduce local property taxes, which go toward
supporting schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every dollar that New York state invests in education is a
dollar that the property taxpayers will not have to contribute,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Education spending is often at the center of budget negotiations
and is expected to be there again this year.

<HEADLINE> Malcolm Wilson, former New York governor, dead at age 86  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Malcolm Wilson, who had a resume that
included 20 years in the state Assembly, 15 years as lieutenant
governor and one year as New York's chief executive, has died.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who served as governor of New York for a year after the
resignation of the late Nelson A. Rockefeller, died Monday morning
at the New Rochelle home of his daughter, Katherine Wilson Conroy.
He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Family friend William O'Shaughnessy, head of WVOX radio in
Westchester County, said the former governor died in his sleep.
Wilson had long been a resident of Scarsdale, Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative Republican, Wilson had a lengthy career in
banking and maintained a private law practice after losing the 1974
governor's race to Democrat Hugh Carey. It was the only election
Wilson has ever lost.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson had undergone surgery for an aortic aneurysm in September
1991 and had been in failing health in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a real loss for New York,'' Gov. George Pataki told a
state Capitol news conference. ''He was a wonderful governor and a
great person.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he had gotten to know Wilson while working on
Rockefeller's 1970 re-election campaign and said the
then-lieutenant governor often put ''politics completely aside'' in
favor of policy ''whether or not it was in his interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was a loyal and self-effacing No. 2 during his four terms
as Rockefeller's heir apparent beginning in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   He achieved his lifelong ambition of being governor when
Rockefeller, deciding his way to the White House did not lie
through Albany, resigned in December 1973 with a year to go in his
final term. Eight months later, President Gerald Ford appointed
Rockefeller vice president in the wake of Richard Nixon's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson had 12 months as a largely caretaker 50th governor of New
York and enjoyed the advantages of incumbency when he ran on his
own in November 1974. But Wilson was overwhelmed by Democrat Carey
in the post-Watergate electoral disaster that brought down
Republican candidates all across the country.
</P>
<P>
   After serving as lieutenant governor longer than any man in
state history, Wilson's tenure as governor was the shortest since
the 29-day reign of Democrat Charles Poletti in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was only 24 years old and two years out of Fordham Law
School when he was elected to the Assembly from Yonkers in 1938. He
was elected to nine more two-year terms in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed as a young man with a bright political future, Wilson
found paths to power blocked by other Republicans with
gubernatorial ambition and decided in 1958 to cast his lot with
Rockefeller, a relative newcomer who needed pull with the
Republican regulars.
</P>
<P>
   As a conservative, organization counterweight to Rockefeller's
perceived liberalism and inexperience, Wilson helped line up the
support of county leaders for Rockefeller's first run.
</P>
<P>
   While remaining in the background, Wilson was known among his
colleagues for narrow ties, a dry wit and using at least two long
words where one short one would do.
</P>
<P>
   Once, talking about a coincidence, he called it a ''fortuitous
concatenation of felicitous circumstance.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a devout Roman Catholic and one of the few issues on
which he ever publicly differed with Rockefeller was liberalizing
state abortion laws.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who styled himself ''a human-rights liberal and an
economic conservative,'' served two years in the Navy in World War
II, seeing action at the Normandy invasion.
</P>
<P>
   From 1977 to 1986, he was chairman of the Manhattan Savings Bank
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He was born near Columbia University in New York City on Feb.
26, 1914. The family moved to Yonkers, where Wilson's schoolteacher
mother became a Republican district leader.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 he married Katharine McCloskey, who died in 1980. They
had two daughters, Katherine and Anne.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services will be held Thursday morning at the Holy
Family Church in New Rochelle.

<HEADLINE> Pataki, CSEA reach agreement  </HEADLINE>
By HADLEY PAWLAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state's largest union has a tentative
agreement with annual raises of up to 3.5 percent that could end
acrimonious negotiations with the Pataki administration.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the 77,000-strong Civil Service Employees Association
will soon vote on the proposed four-year contract recommended by
their negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative deal follows more than a year of contentious
contract negotiations and union protests across the state. The
members have worked without a contract since April 1, 1999. Members
will vote on this offer in April.
</P>
<P>
   The new contract, which CSEA leaders will recommend to members,
includes across-the-board salary increases of: 3 percent
retroactive to October 1999; 3 percent effective April 2000; 3.5
percent effective in April 2001 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   A contract offering smaller raises over the four years was
rejected by the union last March.
</P>
<P>
   ''A combination of the mobilization of members and persistence
at the bargaining table is what made this possible,'' said Stephen
Madarasz, spokesman for the CSEA. ''Members were energized as we've
never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Many members of the mostly blue-collar union had been angry over
what they felt was a substandard contract offer from the state,
particularly after state lawmakers and Gov. George Pataki approved
38 percent pay raises for themselves in December 1998. Then in
March 1999, the state ended its fiscal year with a multi-billion
dollar surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no question that was the reason the contract was
rejected last March,'' Madarasz said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the CSEA's $1 million advertising budget over the last
year was shifted to cover radio and television ads aimed at
mobilizing union members. During the same time, protests staged by
members of CSEA and other state worker's unions met Pataki at
appearances across the state and as far away as Michigan. One rally
at the capital drew 20,000 members, according to Madarasz.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could not have had the results at the table without the
individual efforts of our members who stood up in every part of the
state,'' said Danny Donohue, CSEA's president.
</P>
<P>
   For state employees who have worked 10 years or more, the
contract also eliminates the 3 percent yearly pension contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said the contract demonstrates a commitment to CSEA
members, ''as well as our efforts to safeguard the interests of
taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also includes:
</P>
<P>
   --A $500 lump sum payment to be counted toward pensions.
</P>
<P>
   --The elimination of an additional premium cost for prescription
coverage and increased funding for dental and eyeglass benefits.
</P>
<P>
   --Increases in the downstate salary adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   --Improvements in hazardous duty pay, inconvenience pay, overtime
meal allowances and standby pay.
</P>
<P>
   Members of New York's second-largest public employees union,
Public Employees Federation, are still working without a contract.

<HEADLINE> Reservation gas, cigarette prices looking even better lately  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CATTARAUGUS INDIAN RESERVATION, N.Y. (AP) -- There have been a
lot of new faces at JR's Smokeshop lately, well ahead of the usual
warm-weather crowds.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Morgan Reid only expects to get busier as more
consumers seek relief from the highest cigarette and gasoline
prices many have ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Since March 1, the cost of cigarettes off the reservation has
jumped to $4 a pack or more while gasoline has soared a record 12
cents per gallon to an average of $1.59.
</P>
<P>
   On the reservation, where Native American vendors pay no tax on
cigarettes and only federal tax on gasoline, cigarettes sell for
about $2.29 a pack and gas for $1.29 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Palczwski expected to save about $15 Monday during a
minutes-long stop at JR's, where he filled the tank and picked up a
carton of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a day off so I decided to go for a ride,'' said
Palczwski, who lives about 25 minutes away in West Seneca, just
outside Buffalo. ''It's definitely worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reservation vendors say the increased traffic that normally
comes with the warm weather seems to have started already. Reid
estimated business is up about 10 percent at JR's.
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette increase was the work of the state, which raised
the cigarette tax by 55 cents a pack effective March 1 to a
highest-in-the-nation $1.11. The high gas prices come amid rising
crude oil costs.
</P>
<P>
   Off-reservation convenience store owners say they are already
feeling the effects of charging more for cigarettes and worry
things will only get worse when smokers who stocked up before the
hike look to replenish their supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The early information we're getting is there is a very large
exodus of business from our member convenience stores,'' said Jim
Calvin, executive director of the New York Association of
Convenience Stores. ''I expect we'll have a clearer idea by the end
of March but I wouldn't be surprised to see some stores lose 30 to
50 percent of their cigarette business and potentially more.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, fuel sales seem to be holding steady, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The association wants the state to repeal the March 1 cigarette
tax increase, saying the state has to level the playing field or
risk putting stores out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said reservation stores have raised the price of cigarettes
by about $3 a carton in recent weeks to close the gap between on-
and off-reservation stores. But cigarettes are still between $9 and
$13 cheaper by the carton on the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not trying to take all the business from off the
reservation,'' he said. ''We've never said we want all the sales,
but (the state) keeps pushing the people toward us every time they
raise their prices.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rossell detoured off the Thruway on his way from Jamestown
to Buffalo to stock up on cigarettes at the Seneca Hawk truck stop.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not normally do that,'' he said, ''but now that
cigarettes are $4.25 a pack I thought I'd save a dollar or two.''

<HEADLINE> Facility will develop strategies and hi-tech training vs.cybercrime  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- A $300,000 federal grant will help create a
high-tech lab at the former Griffiss Air Force Base to train police
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Criminals have clearly gone high-tech, with more cybercrimes
being reported every day,'' Sen. Charles Schumer, D-NY, said in a
statement Monday. ''I am pleased to announce that now
crime-fighting has gone high-tech, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal grant from the National Institute of Justice, the
research and technology development arm of the U.S. Department of
Justice, enabled the project to move forward. The goal is to
develop five such facilities across the nation as the influence of
computers grows.
</P>
<P>
   Several projects already are in the works, including development
of a system for the rapid electronic dissemination of photos of
missing or exploited children. A low-power radar gun that can
detect concealed weapons made of any material is expected to be
available within a year. Law-enforcement officials are hopeful it
will greatly limit the potential for violence in schools and
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ''The threats to our national security are growing and taking on
many new forms,'' said Delores Etter, Deputy Undersecretary of
Defense for Science and Technology in the Clinton administration.
''Information warfare is something we have to look at seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The facility will work closely with Rome Laboratory, one of the
Air Force's top high-technology facilities. One of the major goals
is to enable overlapping law-enforcement agencies to share vital
information much more easily than they can now.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has local implications, but it reaches far beyond,'' said
U.S. Representative Sherwood Boehlert, R-NY. ''The things that they
can do here are exciting. James Bond looks like a piker compared to
them. Their challenge is working to stay one step ahead of the
criminal -- whether he's on the streets or in cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Citarella has been a prosecutor for 18 years in Westchester
County, and news of the formation of the new lab had him more
excited than he's been in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ''This sort of partnership between technology and industry and
law enforcement is very critical at the local level,'' Citarella
said. ''We need to be able to proceed from the seizure of the
computer to completed forensics really within a week or less in 99
percent of the cases. That gives us the capability to do computer
crime. It's terribly exciting. Without this, it's much more
difficult.''

<HEADLINE> Religious Compound Leader Acquitted  </HEADLINE>
By JAY REEVES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVINGSTON, Ala. (AP) -- A leader at a controversial religious
compound was acquitted Monday of charges that he beat a 13-year-old
boy with a paddle as punishment for scuffling with another youth.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Lee Roberts, charged with misdemeanor assault, admitted
striking Derrick Wilson with a paddle as many as eight times.
</P>
<P>
   But Roberts said disciplining children is part of his job at the
Holyland commune, where parents are not allowed to live with their
children. Roberts said he used restraint in whipping the boy,
hitting him with only half-swings rather than full-force blows.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wouldn't have been able to take that,'' said the 240-pound
Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Sumter County District Judge Tammy Montgomery acquitted Roberts,
48, after hearing conflicting stories about what had happened at
the compound in west Alabama near the Mississippi line. There was
no jury.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts left the courthouse without commenting.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson testified that Roberts hit him repeatedly on Jan. 17 as
two other youths held him on the ground. He said the whipping was
prompted by a scuffle with another boy at the commune.
</P>
<P>
   ''He gave me about 10 licks. Then he said he was gonna give me
five more. Then he said he was going to give me three more. Then he
said two more,'' said the youth, whose family used to be members of
the commune.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts testified that he paddled Wilson only at direction of
head deacon Martin Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, the boy's uncle, testified that parents who live at
Holyland give officers the right to discipline their children. He
said Wilson's mother, Geraldine Wilson, filed the assault charge
eight days after the whipping and only after a radio was taken away
from her children.

<HEADLINE> Sonics 113, Grizzlies 103  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Gary Payton led a
third-quarter charge and finished with 40 points as the Seattle
SuperSonics rolled to a 113-103 win Monday over the Vancouver
Grizzlies, who absorbed their ninth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Payton keyed an 18-6 Seattle run to begin the second half,
hitting five of his first seven shots to offset Vancouver center
Bryant Reeves's season-high 31 points.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was virtually unstoppable in the opening 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He hit his first 11 field goal attempts, setting a franchise
record, and had 25 points and eight rebounds at intermission. The
Sonics started with Jelani McCoy guarding Reeves, switched to Greg
Foster and then to Horace Grant. None were effective defensively.
</P>
<P>
   But once the Sonics began to double-team Reeves, they slowed
him, and built an 81-64 lead by the midway point of the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Vancouver assigned Doug West, its best defensive
player, to guard Payton.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies got as close as 96-92 with 6:49 left, but the
Sonics held on for their third win in four outings.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Barry added 14 for Seattle and helped the Sonics'
backcourt outscore Vancouver's guard tandem of Mike Bibby and
Michael Dickerson, 54-24.
</P>
<P>
   Payton finished one point shy of the career-high 41 he scored
against Washington on Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Shareef Abdur-Rahim had 17 points for Vancouver, the fifth
straight game he has been held to 20 points or less.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver shot 59 percent in the first half but still trailed
60-58 at the break.
Notes: Sonics coach Paul Westphal would not comment before the
game on the $100,000 fine levied Monday against the club when he
refused to wear a microphone during Sunday's contest against
Toronto. ... Seattle forward Vin Baker (strained left hamstring)
was a scratch for the second straight game. ... The Grizzlies
entered Monday's game allowing opponents to make 47.3 percent of
their field goal attempts, last in the league.

<HEADLINE> Thrashers Trade Buchberger, Emerson  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Thrashers, who have lost 21 of 22
games, shook up their team late Monday night by trading captain
Kelly Buchberger and winger Nelson Emerson to the Los Angeles Kings
for winger Donald Audette and minor-league defenseman Frantisek
Kaberle.
</P>
<P>
   Buchberger, 33, was the cornerstone of the Thrashers franchise,
a right winger who played on three Stanley Cup championship teams
in Edmonton before he was taken in the expansion draft by Atlanta
and given a three-year, $2.85 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very tough,'' Thrashers general manager Don Waddell
said. ''Honestly, I wrestled with this one the last four days.''
</P>
<P>
   But he wouldn't pass up a chance to land a 26-year-old
defenseman like Kaberle, who had nine assists in 37 games for the
Kings and has been playing with Long Beach of the IHL. The Czech
native is expected to join the Thrashers for Thursday night's game
against the New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a very skilled defenseman who moves the puck well,''
Waddell said. ''He's going to jump right into this team and become
one of our top defensemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchberger had five goals and 12 assists while playing in all 68
games for the Thrashers. The trade was announced a couple of hours
after his final game in Atlanta, a 3-0 loss to his previous team,
the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson, 32, signed with the Thrashers as a free agent and had
14 goals and 19 assists in 58 games, making him the team's
third-leading scorer. When Los Angeles asked for him in the deal,
the Kings agreed to give up Audette, 29, who has 12 goals and 20
assists in 49 games.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta coach Curt Fraser said he wouldn't name a new captain
until next season out of respect to Buchberger.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kelly was special to me,'' Fraser said. ''He was a leader and
we did a lot of work to build this team together. It was very tough
on him. I think I put him in a role that was maybe too much for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchberger and Emerson already had left Philips Arena when the
trade was announced and were not available for comment.

<HEADLINE> Flyers 4, Coyotes 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers beat the Phoenix Coyotes
4-1 Monday night, but may have lost Eric Lindros for the fifth time
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Primeau scored twice and John LeClair and Valeri Zelepukin
also connected for the Flyers, who won for the ninth time in 13
games. Philadelphia kept pace with the Atlantic Division-leading
New Jersey Devils, who beat Pittsburgh 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle Odelein scored the lone goal for the Coyotes, who fell nine
points behind Dallas in the Pacific Division after the Stars' 4-3
victory over the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, who played but did not score in Philadelphia's 3-1 loss
to Colorado on Monday, was scratched from the lineup because of a
headache.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, second on the Flyers with 27 goals and third with 59
points, was beginning to dress for the nationally televised game,
but stopped because of the pain. He was examined by Flyers trainer
John Worley and scratched from the lineup shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials said the headache does not appear to be related
to the concussion Lindros sustained Jan. 14 at Atlanta, the third
of the six-time All-Star's career. Lindros missed four games
following that concussion.
</P>
<P>
   The center, who already had missed 13 games this season with
four different injuries, will return to Philadelphia with the team
and will be re-examined by team doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros most recently missed five games in February and early
March because of back spasms. He also missed two games each because
of a bruised left hand and a viral infection.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers are 7-5-2 without Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   Zelepukin scored the game-winner at 13:39 of the second period.
Stan Neckar tried to backhand a pass from behind the net, but
Zelepukin stole the puck, then turned and banked a shot off Sean
Burke's right leg while skating into the crease.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes protested, saying Zelepukin interfered with Burke
before the goal was scored, but replays showed the puck was in the
net before he collided with the goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Primeau added an insurance goal, his second in 10 games, with
15:40 to go, then got an empty-netter with 22 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   LeClair gave the Flyers a 1-0 lead in the first period when he
took a pass from Primeau to the right of the net and stuffed the
puck between Burke's pad and the left post for his team-leading
35th goal.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, who posted consecutive shutouts against the New York
Islanders and Vancouver, had not allowed a goal in his last 138
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Odelein tied the game in the second period with a power-play
goal. Odelein, acquired from the Devils last week, took a pass from
Mikael Renberg in the high slot and blasted a shot past John
Vanbiesbrouck for his first goal since Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Renberg has a goal and two assists in three games with the
Coyotes since he was traded Wednesday from the Flyers for Rick
Tocchet.

<HEADLINE> Fiat May Outlast it's Founders  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TURIN, Italy (AP) -- Starting it as little more than an
aristocratic hobby 101 years ago, ex-cavalry officer Giovanni
Agnelli built Fiat automaker into a family dynasty that outlasted
kings, innumerable Italian governments and one envious dictator.
</P>
<P>
   In 1927, annoyed at the reverence Italy was paying the Agnelli
clan, Benito Mussolini grumbled that Fiat was on its way to
becoming ''an untouchable and sacred state institution, on par with
royalty, the church, a regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Mussolini fell, and the Agnellis and the reverence endured, so
much so that Gianni Agnelli, the patriarch at the start of Fiat's
third century, is widely known today as Italy's uncrowned king.
</P>
<P>
   But the king is 79, with no family heir-apparent. Fiat,
strengthened now through its $2.4 billion alliance Monday with
General Motors Corp., now may well thrive beyond the Agnelli auto
dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've given us life. They've given us labor,'' Giorgio
Gziva, a native-born Turino, said of the Agnellis. ''But today in
2000, you have to develop, you have to look outward.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiat in a sense always looked outward, to America -- and
flourished from it.
</P>
<P>
   Giovanni Agnelli, starting Fiat with some aristocratic friends
and $400 in capital in 1899, made the company's fortune by doggedly
melding Detroit production principles with Italian style.
</P>
<P>
   Fiat meant jobs for entire generations of Italian families,
drawing epic migrations of workers from the poorer south in
previous decades.
</P>
<P>
   Italy today still is second only to the state in giving
Italians' employment, with 221,000 jobs in all.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the alliance with GM, Fiat said the best guarantee
of jobs was economic success -- suggesting that almost unthinkable
job cuts may well be ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Fiat clearly has to do something to stop the decline that has
afflicted the company, as well as the family, since the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1990s, Fiat saw its share of the Italian auto market
fall from 60 percent to 39 percent. Even in its backyard, Western
Europe, Fiat's auto share barely made the double digits.
</P>
<P>
   Italian industrial leaders are said to have made humiliatingly
clear the waning influence of Fiat and the uncrowned king this
month when they passed over his candidate to lead Italy's key
business lobbying bloc.
</P>
<P>
   The dynasty itself suffered what may be its irrecoverable blow
in 1997, when cancer robbed Fiat of its chosen leader for the next
generation, a 33-year-old grandnephew of Giovanni Agnelli.
</P>
<P>
   The death forced Fiat to turn outside to American industry for
leadership, picking as chairman Paolo Fresco, a former
second-in-command at General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company is once again turning to America as it looks to
its future.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's deal gives GM a 20 percent stake in Fiat Auto, while
Fiat acquires 5.1 percent of GM. Both companies hope to save
billions of dollars through shared supply and labor and make
billions through shared entries into international markets.
</P>
<P>
   Fiat said the partnership preserves untouched its beloved
Ferrari and Maserati sports car lines -- and its equally beloved
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We laid down two goals: an alliance as strong as possible and
autonomy,'' said Gianni Agnelli, who approved the deal with GM on
his birthday Sunday, after earlier reportedly rebuffing other
partnerships that might have meant surrendering control.
</P>
<P>
   But the accord gives GM first choice at buying a bigger stake of
Fiat at some undisclosed time in the future -- most likely years
from now, after the end of its last Agnelli leader.

Bush Embraces GOP Congresional Leaders

<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- George W. Bush cast himself as a Washington outsider Monday
even as he embraced Republican congressional leaders after months of keeping his
distance. As primary voting headed into a Southern ''Super Tuesday'' with all
the suspense gone, the two remaining major candidates -- Al Gore from Florida,
Bush from stops in Mississippi and Louisiana -- dueled over which of them has
the makings of a president. Gore said Bush offers only ''risky'' tax cuts that
no one but special-interest campaign donors want.

Finland Marks Post Winter War Peace
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Finns on Monday marked the 60th anniversary of a
truce that followed 105 days of fierce fighting against Stalin's Red Army in the
Winter War, possibly one of the coldest in history. Finland lost, but the small
country's resistance against the Soviets helped secure its independence in
post-war Europe. Some 23,000 Finnish soldiers were killed, and 45,000 wounded,
in a population of 3.7 million. But Finland's white-clad troops on skis, which
became famous as the ''ghost army,'' proved a stronger force than expected. The
Soviet Union put its losses at 217,500 dead or wounded, but Finland estimated
enemy casualties at up to 400,000.

Utility Industry Reliability Questioned
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson Monday said rapid change

the likelihood of power outages this summer. Richardson said Congress must pass
legislation to restructure the electric utility industry as it becomes
competitive or risk ''more long, hot summers of outages in America's cities.''
An Energy Department report says the transition to competition has caused some
utilities to focus on competing for markets, cutting costs and maximizing
prices, instead of assuring that power is kept flowing.

<HEADLINE> New Milford officer convicted of manslaughter in suspect's death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- Civil Rights leaders were closely
watching the murder trial of New Milford Police Officer Scott
Smith, a white police officer accused of killing an unarmed black
man.
</P>
<P>
   It came in the wake of highly publicized acquittals of New York
City police officers charged in the shooting death of African
immigrant Amadou Diallo, and the decision not to prosecute a white
Hartford police officer, Robert Allan, who killed a 14-year-old
black mugging suspect, Aquan Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a jury found Smith guilty of intentional manslaughter
for shooting Franklyn Reid in the back at point-blank range on Dec.
29, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Vann, the president of the state chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said he would
have preferred that Reid was convicted of murder. But he said the
guilty verdict should send a message to all police officers who
''needlessly take lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This verdict ought to be a cue to those involved to improve
the relationship between the community and police to open up a
dialogue about how things can change,'' said Vann.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 28, was the first Connecticut police officer to be
charged with murder for an action committed in the line of duty. He
said he fired the fatal shot because he believed Reid was reaching
for a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, 27, was unarmed. A small folding knife was discovered in
the pocket of a jacket found a few feet away from Reid's body.
</P>
<P>
   Reid was shot once in the back. Prosecution witnesses testified
that they saw him sitting or lying on his stomach in surrender
moments before the shooting; an expert testified for prosecutors
that Smith's bootprint was present on Reid's shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Reid made a sudden motion at the belt line. ''When he
made that classic move, I thought 'Oh (expletive), I'm dead,''
Smith testified last week.
</P>
<P>
   Jury forewoman Mary Cranouski told The News Times of Danbury the
panel did not accept that Smith feared for his life, but did not
believe the shooting was premeditated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure he didn't get up in the morning and say he was going
to kill someone,'' Cranouski said. ''He made the wrong decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith shook his head ''no'' when the verdict was read, but made
no other comment. He left the courthouse with his family. He faces
from 5 years to 40 years in prison at his May 5 sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight and Pearlylyn Reid, who moved with their three sons from
Jamaica to New Milford in 1986, did not seek to make race the focus
of the case. They rejected an offer of assistance from the Rev. Al
Sharpton, the New York activist involved in the Diallo case.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they highlighted the number of police shootings in the
state. Between December 1998 and November 1999, nine people were
killed and a 10th wounded in police shootings in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a public execution,'' Mrs. Reid said after the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''A trillion, trillion, trillion thanks to the jury, for your
courage to do the right thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Allen McGrady, a New Milford resident and the only black juror
told The News Times that race played no roll in their
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't brought up once,'' he said. ''That doesn't mean it
wasn't in the back of minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the objections of Smith's lawyers, Superior Court Judge
Charles D. Gill had allowed the jury to consider the less serious
charges of intentional manslaughter and reckless manslaughter in
addition to murder.
</P>
<P>
   In the moments before the shooting, Reid -- who was well-known to
area police and wanted for failure to appear in court -- had led
Smith on a brief foot chase.
</P>
<P>
   Reid had also eluded another officer earlier in the day,
witnesses testified.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith's partner testified that he was in the car at the time
of the shooting and did not see what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors began considering the case on Thursday, deliberating
about 2{ hours that day and all day on Friday. The verdict was
returned about 4 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Smith initially brought protests from
hundreds of police officers, who denounced Waterbury State's
Attorney John Connelly as a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a police officer and a young man was killed -- this
was a difficult case for everyone involved,'' Connelly said.

<HEADLINE> Son of Sam Sheppard testifies for Ross in death penalty hearing  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- The son of a famous murder victim says
serial killer Michael Ross is worth more to society alive than
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of murder victims and psychological experts can use
lives such as Ross' to better understand what makes people kill,
said Sam Reese Sheppard, the son of Marylin and Dr. Sam Sheppard.
</P>
<P>
   His father was convicted -- and later acquitted -- in the 1954
beating death of his mother, a case that inspired ''The Fugitive''
television show.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard, who was 7 at the time of his mother's death, met Ross
and corresponded with him for about two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The effect of knowing Mr. Ross has been profound on my life,''
Sheppard testified Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He said that executing convicted killers is inhumane and would
be ''literally killing resources.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the information he got from Ross ''has helped me put the
pieces together of the shattered experience of losing my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers are trying to show why Ross should be spared the
death penalty for killing four teen-age girls in eastern
Connecticut in the 1980s. An earlier death sentence was overturned
on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Ross already is serving two life sentences for killing two other
young women in Windham County. He has confessed to killing two
women in New York state but has not been prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Sheppard is currently suing the state of Ohio,
seeking a formal declaration of his father's innocence and
compensation for the time the elder Sheppard spent in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Monsignor John Gilmartin of Long Island, N.Y.,
testified that Ross is truly sorry for his crimes and feels badly
that the relatives of his victims must go through the anguish of
another court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Ross was baptized Roman Catholic as a child and was confirmed in
prison. Gilmartin is Ross' spiritual advisor.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmartin arranged for an article Ross wrote about the death
penalty to be published in a Catholic Charities magazine -- an
article Gilmartin said he has used in his work since.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Barry Butler asked whether the religious
conversion was genuine or a ''rent-a-Bible'' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really felt Michael was growing spiritually, in a really
deep and significant way,'' Gilmartin said.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, State's Attorney Kevin Kane asked if
Gilmartin found it presumptuous that Ross tried to decide what was
best for his victims' families when he signed an agreement to be
executed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he did it out of sensitivity to the families,''
Gilmartin replied.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was thrown out by a judge, who ordered the new
penalty hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The defense played for the jury a tape of Ross' speech to the
court in February 1998, the day he and former prosecutor Robert
Satti signed the execution agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, Ross' voice was choked with emotion at times as he
tried to explain why he tried to sign his life away.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm so sorry. I know those words don't mean much,'' he said on
the tape. ''I wish I could bring back the women I killed. I wish I
could trade my life for them.''
</P>
<P>
   As the tape was played, Ross wiped his eyes and face and sniffed
softly.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Shelley, the father of one of the victims, testified the
first day of the trial and stands vigil in the courthouse corridor,
wearing a button with his 14-year-old daughter's face on it.
</P>
<P>
   Because Shelley is a witness, he is barred from the courtroom
and is not allowed to speak with the media about his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Judge Thomas Miano warned Shelley not to speak with
the media. Last week Shelley was quoted in a newspaper interview
and wrote a letter to the editor of another.

<HEADLINE> Rowland announces insecticide purchase  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Cities and towns concerned that
mosquitoes this summer may again carry the West Nile or Eastern
Equine strains of the encephalitis virus will get some preventative
help from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. M. Jodi Rell announced Monday the distribution of
$500,000 worth of larvicide to 41 communities.
</P>
<P>
   An outbreak last year of a West Nile-like encephalitis infected
62 people in New York, killing seven. No human cases of the virus
were reported in Connecticut, but thousands of birds were killed in
Connecticut, New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the outbreak last fall, officials sprayed
pesticides to try to kill mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next month, the state plans to distribute larvicide to
try to kill mosquito larvae in 41 communities where indications of
West Nile or eastern equine were found, as well as in all of
Connecticut's coastal communities, where mosquitoes are most likely
to breed.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus was found in southwestern Connecticut last
year, while EEE caused a scare in southeastern Connecticut in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur J. Rocque Jr., commissioner of the Connecticut Department
of Environmental Protection, said testing this winter has not
turned up any indication of the West Nile virus in hibernating
mosquitoes in Connecticut. But he said environmental officials
believe the larvicide is necessary to ward off another outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know when or if it will show up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no need to panic here -- there really isn't,'' Rocque
said. ''What we need to do is to do this judiciously.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocque said the DEP will contact town officials to distribute
the larvicide and to offer technical assistance for its
application. The larvicide, which comes in both granular and tablet
form, will be deposited in breeding grounds for mosquitoes, such as
catchbasins.
</P>
<P>
   The $500,000 in funding announced Monday is in addition to $1
million allocated in this year's budget for the state's overall
mosquito management program.
</P>
<P>
   Centers for Disease Control researchers announced last week that
some hibernating mosquitoes in New York City are probably still
carrying the West Nile virus. The CDC said it is unclear whether
the virus will persist or pose a health hazard when mosquitoes
become active this spring.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton speaks to Irish group -- again  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE WATSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Irish America magazine's annual award
celebration gave Hillary Rodham Clinton an opportunity to praise an
old friend while courting an important voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady presented Britain's former Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam with the magazine's Peace Award. Clinton called
Mowlam a good, reassuring friend who worked for a safe resolution
in Northern Ireland. She said Mowlam's efforts included making
women's voices stronger in the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   During Monday night's event honoring the top 100 Irish-Americans
of 2000, the Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate seat in New
York promised to support those who have fought, died ''and, yes,
voted'' for peace in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people in the room have worked for a lifetime to make
hope and history rhyme,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration also showed there's one constituency in New York
that no one can accuse Clinton of ignoring: Irish-Americans. In
December, she spoke at a dinner sponsored by Irish America magazine
honoring the top 100 Irish-Americans of all time.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's publisher, Niall O'Dowd, founded Irish-Americans
for Clinton in 1991 and said he was happy to help Clinton increase
her visibility among voters of Irish extraction because both
Clintons have been such strong supporters of the Irish peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Clintons, O'Dowd said, ''No president or first lady
ever particularly cared about this issue. She's the first first
lady to ever go to Northern Ireland, she knows the issue extremely
well, and she deserves a tremendous amount of credit for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's 100 honorees included several individuals who
have to go back generations to pinpoint their Irish ancestors --
among them, Vice President Al Gore and President Clinton, who has
said his mother was descended from an 18th-century Northern Irish
farming family. Neither man attended the event.
</P>
<P>
   The list also included several members of the Kennedy family,
including Sen. Ted Kennedy, filmmaker Rory Kennedy and Ambassador
Jean Kennedy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton's involvement with Irish issues gives her an in
with a large segment of Catholic voters. Catholics made up 45
percent of New York voters in 1998 and 1996 elections but are a
group Clinton will have to work to court. She supports abortion
rights and opposes school vouchers and is running against a
Catholic opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Irish America magazine has a circulation of about 100,000 and is
published six times a year.

<HEADLINE> Aging Farmers Won't Accept Limits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) -- Ed Geest plans to be farming, on the same
land where he grew up, when he's 90.
</P>
<P>
   He's 64 now, just shy of the average age of an Iowa farmer. That
aging population has created new concerns for farm safety
officials.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study released by Iowa's Center for Agriculture
Safety and Health, older farmers often are unwilling to recognize
or accept their physical limitations. Daily farming can pose
enormous risks to those with arthritis, limited vision and hearing,
depression and other conditions associated with age.
</P>
<P>
   Geest, who farms in Blue Grass just west of the Quad Cities, has
been fortunate in his more than 40 years of farming. The worst of
his injuries has been a cut leg after a fall from a ladder.
</P>
<P>
   But he's had to change how he goes about things as he gets
older.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty obvious I'm not as agile as I used to be. I still
might run around on the barn roof, but I hang on more than I used
to,'' he said. ''I wouldn't jump from one barn to another. I used
to do that stuff. I wouldn't do it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   That realization that with age comes limits is key to safety,
said Tracy Keninger, from Easter Seals of Iowa. She is working with
the Iowa Center for Agriculture Safety and Health and is chairwoman
of a task force on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''This means we need to heighten awareness among farmers of the
risks in farming as they grow older,'' she said. ''They need to
learn what adjustments they may need to make, such as changes in
equipment they use or certain behaviors.''
</P>
<P>
   Depression is also common among the aging farmer -- especially
because of the current economic downturn in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Katey Geest, Ed's wife, said she understands the risks of
farming -- which are exacerbated by the 12- to 14-hour day,
seven-day-a-week schedule that her husband and son, Dieter, work to
keep up with the family's 500-acre soybean, corn and hog farm.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very dangerous. We've been lucky,'' she said. ''I pray a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ABERDEEN, S.D. (AP) -- Don Roehr doesn't like the thought of
applying more chemicals to his crops, but that may be a cheaper
alternative this year, given the high cost of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   It takes only one pass through the field to apply chemicals.
Cultivating row crops means repeated trips that burn up fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Premium diesel fuel cost $1.08 per gallon last week for bulk
delivery to farms, compared to about 70 cents a year ago, said Ed
Stauch, petroleum manager for South Dakota Wheat Growers' northern
division.
</P>
<P>
   A big tractor that's tilling uses easily 180 gallons of fuel
daily, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used to do everything without chemicals,'' said Roehr, a
Britton-area farmer. ''But this year I'm going the lazy man's way --
the chemical way.''
</P>
<P>
   Stauch said that even an immediate increase in petroleum
production would be too late to lower prices for spring planting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe by May,'' he said. ''But it's all up in the air. OPEC is
really going to be the one to decide all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Most farmers did not fill their bulk tanks before prices rose,
he said. ''They were waiting for the price to drop. My inkling is
that a lot of tanks out there are not full. It's one of those deals
where hindsight is better.''

<HEADLINE> US Official Makes Overture to Serbs  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRACANICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A senior U.S. official chose the
placid monastery in this predominantly Serb town to make an
overture to Kosovo's Serbs, stressing that the United States did
not act to stop repression here to perpetuate a cycle of violence.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Rubin has been hammering the point at every stop in
Kosovo: Ethnic Albanian leaders must end the violence -- or else.
But Monday he also sought to reassure Kosovo's Serbs that
Washington is pushing for a multiethnic Kosovo in which they will
have a share.
</P>
<P>
   The United States did not stop Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's repression against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo ''to
watch Albanians act against Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Serbs should know that we want coexistence for all the
peoples inside Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's spokesman has been
pressing Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders in every town he has
visited, insisting that they take responsibility for failing to
stem ethnic violence that has engulfed this southern province in
Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's constant drumbeat has only underlined Washington's
anxiety over the continuing attacks on Serbs and other minorities --
a morass in the making that is threatening the international
support that ended Milosevic's systematic campaign of repression
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are now free of the oppression from Belgrade,'' Rubin told
an Albanian crowd Monday near a mosque in western Kosovo that was
destroyed in last year's Serb-led crackdown. The measures ended
when Yugoslav troops withdrew following a 78-day NATO air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''But with that freedom comes responsibility to ensure that
coexistence can exist in Kosovo,'' Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the troubles in the Balkans are touching off criticism in
Congress. The Clinton Administration wants to insulate Vice
President Al Gore from reproach during an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Washington's considerable leverage with the ethnic
Albanians, it was unclear whether the province's factious
leadership understood the message. Hashim Thaci, the political
leader of Kosovo's rebels during the war, called Rubin ''a friend
of Kosovo'' and said ''we accepted his statements as advice from a
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, no unequivocal pledge to stop the violence,
much of which is believed carried out by former Kosovo Liberation
Army fighters who were Thaci's allies in the war against the Serbs.
Many ethnic Albanians feel the struggle with the Serbs will not end
until all Serbs have been forced out and Kosovo becomes an
independent Albanian state -- something no other nation supports.
</P>
<P>
   Before Djakovica, Rubin went to Kosovska Mitrovica, the
province's most volatile city and the only one with a substantial
Serb population. Rubin met with ethnic Albanian leaders and
international officials but did not cross the Ibar River to visit
the Serb-controlled north of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs there had threatened to throw stones and eggs at Rubin if
he ventured into their part of town.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin visited Djakovica, 55 miles southwest of the capital,
Pristina, to draw attention to the issue of thousands of people
still unaccounted for after last year's crackdown. Rubin met
privately with an ethnic Albanian family that has six missing male
members.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's visit coincided with release of a report by Amnesty
International that was sharply critical of the NATO and U.N.
mission in Kosovo. The report accused peacekeepers and U.N. police
of failing to respect international human rights in suppressing
unrest in Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their response to the violence in Mitrovica is illustrative of
a wider failure by the international presence in Kosovo to
consistently administer justice and uphold human rights standards
in the exercise of their duties,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, Russia's foreign minister has urged his
counterparts in the seven major industrialized nations to help
prevent Kosovo's tensions from spilling over into southern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the foreign ministers, Igor Ivanov expressed
Moscow's concern that ''the very critical situation'' in southern
Serbia could ignite a new war, Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov
said at a news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The formation of a new, Kosovo-inspired ethnic Albanian
guerrilla group in Serbia's southern Presevo Valley has worsened
fears of yet another war in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Judge finds U.S. law extends to foreigners who attack Americansabroad  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge sided with prosecutors in ruling
that the U.S. government did not reach beyond its authority when it
charged Osama bin Laden and 16 others in the bombing of two U.S.
embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for six men charged in the case had argued that U.S.
Attorney Mary Jo White sought an unprecedented expansion of federal
jurisdiction over crimes committed on foreign soil.
</P>
<P>
   The men are accused of conspiring to attack Americans in the
Aug. 7, 1998, bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The
attacks killed 224 people, including 12 Americans. Six men are in
custody in the United States and three abroad, and the rest are
fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand said it would make little sense
to restrict enforcement of U.S. laws overseas to suspects who are
U.S. citizens or lawful residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find it difficult to conceive of Congress saying we want to
protect our interests abroad against attacks by Americans but not
against attacks by non-Americans,'' the judge said two weeks ago
during a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling Monday, the judge wrote that ''foreign nationals
are in at least as good a position as are United States nationals
to carry out such attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a law written to prosecute anyone who conspires to use a
weapon of mass destruction against a U.S. resident or citizen
outside the United States ''unambiguously applied to offenders who
are foreign nationals.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors dismissed the arguments made by lawyers for Mohamed
Sadeek Odeh, a 34-year-old furniture salesman charged in the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''Odeh cannot be surprised to learn that his conduct was
criminal under the laws of every civilized nation, and (thus) he
has no right to complain about the particular forum in which he is
brought to trial,'' they argued.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Odeh did not immediately return a telephone call
for comment on the ruling. Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for the U.S.
attorney, said he had no comment.

<HEADLINE> Men Out of Touch With Health Care  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gil Purisch never went to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his life, the New York City optician would only have
physicals or checkups if it was required for his work or insurance.
Purisch, 55, said he was the kind of man ''who wouldn't go to the
dentist unless my tooth hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Then 10 years ago his vision started to fail and his feet began
to swell, signs of diabetes. Even then he just lived with his
illness until his sister forced him to get medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''After a year's worth of symptoms I was still regarding it like
it would just go away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many men have similar stories, and an independent survey,
confirming what frustrated wives and mothers long have known, finds
that far too often men fail to seek out health care until it's too
late.
</P>
<P>
   ''Society's demand that men be strong and stoic can be harmful
to their health if it causes them to ignore what their bodies are
telling them and avoid seeking needed medical care,'' said David
Sandman, lead author of the study sponsored by The Commonwealth
Fund, a philanthropic foundation that promotes health awareness.
</P>
<P>
   The life spans of both sexes have increased dramatically in the
past century, but men, who once lived just as long as women, now
die on average six years earlier. Men are far more likely to
experience deaths related to violence, but other leading causes of
male death like heart disease and certain cancers can be treated if
caught early.
</P>
<P>
   The survey released Monday found that in the past year a quarter
of men had not seen a doctor and more than half had not had a
physical exam or a cholesterol test. More than a third of men over
50 had not been tested in the past five years for colon cancer or
prostate cancer, potentially fatal diseases that require early
detection for successful treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''You got a boy when he's 8 years old being told 'big boys don't
cry' when he skins his knee -- when he's 50 and he's got chest pains
he says it's just indigestion, '' said Dr. Jean Bonhomme, an
Atlanta physician who works with the Men's Health Network, a
national group that advises on male health issues.
</P>
<P>
   Since most women visit gynecologists or obstetricians, they have
regular exposure to health care throughout their lives, something
that men lack, Bonhomme said.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things that keeps men out of the health care system
is that there's nothing with a male face on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But getting men into doctor's offices doesn't solve all their
problems. Men in the study rated their doctors highly overall, but
few said they received counseling on ways to improve their health
or to prevent illness or injury. While men with a family history of
prostate cancer are at greater risk for contracting the disease,
less than a third of men over 40 said their doctors had ever asked
them about their family's medical history.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sensitizing physicians to male health concerns could bring
about improvements in men's longevity and well-being,'' Sandman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone survey of more than 1,000 men and 2,000 women was
conducted from May to November 1998. The margin of error was plus
or minus 4 percentage points for the men and 3 percentage points
for the women.
</P>
<P>
   The Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit foundation established in
1918 that received the assets of the James Picker Foundation in
1986, promotes better health behavior for minorities, older people
and children.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that men with low incomes or no health
insurance were even less likely to see doctors,
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Miller, 42, a free-lance writer and single father from
Vienna, Va., said he insists on good care for his 12-year-old son,
but he often just lives with his own bouts of pain and illness
because he has no insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can feel in my body that there are things wrong, but I don't
dare go to the doctor because of the expense involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that even if he could afford it, he and many men
only get medical help when money or a job is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ''You go to the doctor to get fixed so you can go back to work
again,'' he said. ''You don't go to the doctor because you want to
take care of yourself.''

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Campaigns Shift to South  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- With the presidential nominations all but
decided, George W. Bush and Al Gore basked in the glory of their
home states today as voters in Texas, Tennessee and four other
Southern states went to the polls for primary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Texas governor, was tending to state business after
voting last week by absentee ballot. Gore, the vice president, was
headed back to Florida after voting at home in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, both men sought to cast themselves as reformers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not happy with the status quo and the best reform is to
end Clinton-Gore in Washington, D.C.,'' Bush said Monday as his
audience chanted ''No more Gore'' during a rally at a Will Rogers
World Airport hangar in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking at a Nashville, Tenn., fund-raiser, self
consciously addressed criticism that he comes to the issue of
campaign finance reform as a political opportunist now that
Republican John McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley -- who campaigned
as reformers -- have dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm naturally going to want to provide a home for those who
were drawn to their candidacies in part because of that issue,''
Gore said. ''That's not the only reason I'm saying (I support
campaign finance reform). I've said it beforehand.''
</P>
<P>
   During an earlier visit Monday to the University of Miami's
teaching hospital, Gore said Americans want to continue the
prosperity begun under the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know what works. Are you with me?'' he asked cheering
doctors, nurses and administrators. He said Bush offers only
''risky'' tax cuts favored by no one but his campaign donors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who also campaigned Monday at Brandon High School in
Brandon, Miss., said voters don't want more of the same. ''America
wants somebody not of Washington,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While portraying himself as the ''outsider'' America wants, Bush
stood on stage, in front of a mural depicting the U.S. Capitol
dome, with Mississippi's two Republican senators, Majority Leader
Trent Lott and Thad Cochran -- part of an embrace of congressional
Republicans from whom Bush had previously distanced himself on
occasion because of differences with certain legislative
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I'd like to tell this Congress is be patient, help is on
the way,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders are trying to hold their majorities in both houses
of Congress, a task that will be simplified if Bush runs a strong
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma
were voting today as part of a Southern ''Super Tuesday'' and were
awarding 341 Republican and 566 Democratic delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the contests, Bush had 701 of the 1,034 delegates
needed to win the GOP presidential nomination, and Gore had 1,921
of the 2,170 required to clinch the Democratic nod.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the suspense surrounding the elections was eliminated
when Bradley and McCain dropped out. Republican Alan Keyes is still
a candidate despite drawing mostly single-digit support.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's focus on Florida is significant, however.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats gave up on the state earlier in the campaign
because its governor is Bush's brother, Jeb. But after weekend
polls showed Gore erasing Bush's lead nationally, Sen. Bob Graham,
D-Fla., said Monday that Florida is back ''in play'' for Gore in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Gore headed into the day's moot balloting hoping that strong
turnouts would show he can be competitive in the fall in
traditional Republican strongholds, especially Florida.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the night with his mother Pauline and voting in
Carthage, Tenn., Gore was celebrating the returns at a Tallahassee,
Fla., rally. He also raised about $200,000 at a fund-raiser Monday
and huddled with more than 30 Democratic mayors to showcase his
grass-roots support.
</P>
<P>
   Bush retired Monday night to the Governor's Mansion and was
tending to state business today before heading to an Austin
community center for his own primary night celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reform Party presidential contender Pat Buchanan,
rejoining the fray now that the major party nominations have been
settled, seconded the attacks by Bush and Gore on each other.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview Monday, Buchanan said Bush ''hasn't
demonstrated the depth or capacity or wisdom or knowledge'' to be
president.
</P>
<P>
   And he said Gore ''hasn't told the truth'' about his fund-raiser
at a Buddhist temple during the 1996 re-election campaign. Gore's
new focus on overhauling campaign finance rules carries ''a real
element of cynicism,'' said Buchanan, who hopes to pick up the
anti-establishment mantle carried by McCain.

<HEADLINE> Automakers Criticized on Child Seats  </HEADLINE>
By CHAD ROEDEMEIER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- After praising DaimlerChrysler and General Motors
for their child seat safety programs, the chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board criticized six other automakers for not
doing enough.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Jim Hall, in a speech Monday at a national highway
safety meeting in Atlanta, scolded Volvo, Mitsubishi, Kia, Subaru,
Suzuki and Isuzu.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the six companies have refused to set up ''fitting
stations,'' where parents can get expert advice on how to install
child safety seats. Government studies have shown that eight of 10
safety seats are installed incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that all these car companies are run by responsible
adults, and if they get the message effectively -- and maybe it
needs to be repeated -- they will take the steps necessary to
address the No. 1 health problem for kids,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic accidents are the leading cause of death for children 14
and younger. Transportation officials say properly used child seats
cut the risk of fatal injuries in half. The more common mistakes
include using the wrong size seat and using a forward-facing seat
for an infant who's not old enough to ride in one.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo spokesman Soren Johansson said he wasn't sure the NTSB had
even approached his company about a child-safety program, but he
praised the focus of the meeting in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''Child safety has been on the agenda with us for years,''
Johansson said. ''It's good to see other manufacturers are now
jumping on the bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Subaru spokesman Richard Marshall said his company sent a letter
to the NTSB saying it would like to cooperate in a child seat
safety program if guidelines could be worked out. Mitsubishi
spokesman Kim Custer said his company has done a series of
campaigns about child passenger safety.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the three other companies singled out by Hall
did not return phone calls seeking comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hall praised a DaimlerChrysler program launched last month that
allows adults driving any make of vehicle to make appointments at
DaimlerChrysler dealerships to see if their child seat is properly
installed.
</P>
<P>
   He also praised General Motors, which has had a long-standing
partnership with the National Safe Kids Campaign to hold car seat
checkups.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a viable first step taken by two of our major auto
manufacturers to change the safety culture on our highways and to
put the focus on our kids,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Ford Motor Co. officials told him Sunday that they plan
to announce a major car-seat program soon.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said BMW, Honda, Nissan and Saab are still deciding what
sort of commitment they will make. Toyota and Volkswagen have said
they will encourage dealers to set up fitting stations, but they
haven't committed any money to the effort, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall also called on states to strengthen and enforce child
passenger protection laws. He said children should be in child
restraints up to age 4, in booster seats to age 8 and in the back
seat at all times.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, not one state currently has a comprehensive child
passenger protection law with all of these requirements,'' Hall
said. ''There must be zero tolerance for unbuckled children.''
</P>
<P>
   Car crash fatalities for children ages 5-9 increased by 23
percent from 1982 to 1998. In the same time period, fatalities for
children up to 4 years old decreased by 8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Want To Be Reformers  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore says he's learned from
his campaign finance mistakes and wants to rid the nation of
big-money politics. George W. Bush calls himself a ''reformer with
results.'' Pat Buchanan insists he is the truest reformer of all.
</P>
<P>
   Without John McCain and Bill Bradley, where do reform-minded
voters turn?
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nobody,'' says John Longmire, the Reform Party's
Kentucky chairman. ''Every time you turn around these days,
somebody's claiming to be a reformer. It's enough to make you want
to throw up.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, McCain's national
co-chairman, says attracting such independent-minded voters won't
''be terribly easy for anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the ''R-word'' is a minefield for all three
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's and Bush's finances in particular raise the issue of
credibility, while Buchanan's focus on cultural and social changes
has led members of both parties to brand his call for reform as
extremist.
</P>
<P>
   A federal jury's recent conviction of Maria Hsia, a Gore friend
a political supporter, for arranging more than $100,000 in illegal
donations during the 1996 campaign resurrects Gore's questionable
attendance at a fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple in California.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says the public doesn't have ''amnesia'' about the episode
and alludes to it on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   The reform mantle is a risk for Bush as well. He declined
federal subsidies for the primary campaign, which freed him from
federal limits on campaign spending. He then went on to set a new
fund-raising record by raking in more than $73 million.
</P>
<P>
   And some Republicans cringed upon learning that two Texas
businessmen and supporters of Bush financed $2.5 million in TV ads
criticizing McCain's environmental record and touting Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was not good,'' acknowledged Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn.,
who had endorsed McCain but announced Sunday -- days after McCain
pulled out of the race -- that he is supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a reform advocate who chaired Senate hearings into the
fund-raising abuses of the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign,
nonetheless recommended that Bush focus on other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we ought to spend all our time talking about
Gore's fund-raising,'' Thompson said. ''We're not going to win if
that's all we talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   On the sidelines, the Reform Party is somewhat amused.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's getting a great chuckle out of them,'' said
Russell Verney, the party's former chairman and top aide to Ross
Perot, who founded the party on a vision of campaigns run without
the influence of large, unregulated contributions to the political
parties, known as soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who is seeking the party's presidential nomination,
would push for vast political and social change, from scrapping
free trade pacts to banning abortion. Party Chairman Pat Choate,
Perot's 1996 running mate, said Buchanan will soften his rhetoric,
especially on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says he has learned from his mistakes and now wants to
overhaul the very system that allowed money to be raised in
questionable ways. He also has challenged Bush, the Texas governor,
to give up campaign ads in favor of regular debates. Bush has
refused.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush favors faster, more complete disclosure of
campaign donors on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man is willing to forgo their parties' soft money
operations in the upcoming election, though each supports
legislating such bans for future campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bush say he is reaching out for McCain's support and
may end up adopting some of the Arizona senator's campaign finance
legislation as part of his own agenda, or support it becoming part
of the GOP platform at the national convention in August.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and the lawmakers who backed his challenge to Bush have
indicated they ultimately will back the Texas governor in spite of
seemingly limitless fund raising. Thompson said Bush ''has not been
a part of an operation that turned out in many respects to have a
lot of people engaged in illegal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley, who both campaigned as reformers, both
pulled out of the race last week.

<HEADLINE> Polish Navy Gets a U.S. Warship  </HEADLINE>
By SONJA BARISIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Instead of heading for scrap, the
guided-missile frigate USS Clark will embark on a second career
after being decommissioned as a U.S. Navy warship.
</P>
<P>
   The Clark will be turned over to Poland in a ceremony Wednesday
at the Norfolk Naval Station, the world's largest naval base. It is
the first of two U.S. Navy ships to be transferred to Poland as
part of a NATO upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Poland joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization a year ago
as one of its first new members since the Cold War ended.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old Clark's U.S. sailors have been working with a
crew of Polish sailors, including two U.S. Naval Academy graduates,
since early January to prepare for the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish sailors adjusted quickly because U.S. and Polish navy
customs are similar, said Cmdr. Marian Ambroziak, the Clark's
Polish commanding officer.
</P>
<P>
   The ''ship is really big, new for us, but generally, navy is
navy,'' Ambroziak said in an interview on the ship's bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The Clark made two cruises to the Mediterranean before joining
the U.S. naval reserve force in 1985 and fighting illegal drug
trading in the Caribbean. Last year, the ship did a recruiting
cruise in the Great Lakes, stopping at towns that seldom see Navy
ships.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish sailors first attended U.S. naval training centers
around the country to learn how to run the ship, then moved on
board for hands-on training. The American and Polish sailors sailed
together three times.
</P>
<P>
   At 445 feet long, the Clark will be the second-largest ship in
the Polish navy, Ambroziak said. The Polish navy mostly is a Baltic
fleet, but as a NATO member, Poland needs some bigger ships that
can handle operations in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Ambroziak said about half his crew speaks at least some English,
so communication wasn't a big problem. Translators were available,
and sailors used computer software to translate English into
Polish.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the second time the United States has given a ship
to Poland, which received a U.S. submarine during World War II,
Ambroziak said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clark's American crew is proud the ship will live on to
serve NATO, said the present commanding officer, Cmdr. Albert F.
Lord Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's kind of like a late-model car with not a whole lot of
miles on it,'' Lord said. ''The Poles are getting a good ship.''

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico's Publico Faces Threat  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGUAS BUENAS, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Under an early morning sky,
Miguel Molina rolls his 1979 Ford van into the main square of this
mountain town and waits. Passengers come, dropping 60 cents into
his hand and squeezing inside, until Molina thinks he has made a
small profit.
</P>
<P>
   A slam of the door, a cough of the engine, and a breakneck dive
into the darkness begins. The rattling Ford swerves around slower
traffic to the bleats of Molina's horn, bleary-eyed passengers
bracing against doors and windows to keep steady on vinyl seats as
Molina tears through another red light.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the hill, it's another wait to fill up the
''publico'' -- Puerto Rico's once-ubiquitous, declining but still
beloved brand of public transport.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a lot of work and not much pay,'' Molina sighed. ''But
the customers know me, and I'm providing them a good service.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicos were once a staple of life on the island, and they are
still prized by many as an emblem of more patient, rustic times.
But things are changing in this U.S. territory, which has rapidly
developed since the 1950s and is now packed with new cars and
highways and offers commuters sleek, air-conditioned buses.
</P>
<P>
   The number of publicos in operation has declined by 20 percent
in the 1990s, according to the island's Public Service Commission --
but some 10,000 remain.
</P>
<P>
   Lovingly maintained and often adorned with good luck charms,
hand-painted slogans and statuettes of the Virgin Mary, they run
along set routes at rates fixed by the government -- never departing
until the driver has collected enough.
</P>
<P>
   The system began in 1907, when entrepreneurs launched a route
between the capital, San Juan, and the mountain town of Caguas.
</P>
<P>
   It intrigued the U.S. government, which helped build more than
100 publico terminals and commissioned a study in 1986 on applying
the concept in the mainland United States. The result, said Alex
McNeil, an administrator at the Federal Transit Administration, was
the ''vanpool'' concept in cities like Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they have down there is really a fabulous system,'' said
McNeil. ''It doesn't cost the taxpayers anything, which is
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   It costs passengers little too: $2.50 pays for the 40-mile ride
from the bustling capital to the town of Humacao on the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   But the system has its disadvantages: crowded seats, no
air-conditioning and long waits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm always getting to class late,'' said Betzaida Vegas, 20,
who rides publicos to her university every day.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Juan area, home to half of Puerto Rico's 4 million
people, publicos are losing business to a bus system that has
introduced private contractors, streamlined routes and added new
buses with federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, people are increasingly driving themselves. The
island now has 146 automobiles per mile of road -- three times
higher than in the U.S. mainland.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, one of every ten trips taken by travelers in San Juan
was by publico; that has fallen to 3.5 percent of trips in 1990,
according to official figures. Drivers say usage has declined
considerably since.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in absence of an island-wide train system or good
mass transit systems in other cities, publicos still carry 40
percent of the public transport traffic in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The ranks of the drivers -- who earn between $35 and $60 a day --
are thinning, and aging.
</P>
<P>
   Carmelo Otero, 56, is reminded of the changing times every day
as he parks his publico in his traditional spot at San Juan's Plaza
del Carmen.
</P>
<P>
   A giant earth-eating machine recently punched a new subway
tunnel underneath the square where hundreds of publicos gather.
Otero fears the $1.5 billion Urban Train, due to open next year,
may be the coup de grace.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he said, ''we still manage to survive ... but it's
getting harder.''

<HEADLINE> Audit Cites Pentagon Oversights  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN DONNELLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An internal audit of over 100 government
military contracts for professional, administrative and management
services worth $6.7 billion uncovered what it termed inadequate
government oversight.
</P>
<P>
   In 81 of the 105 contracts reviewed, ''contracting officers
either failed to prepare cost estimates or developed estimates that
were inadequate or lacked detail,'' the Pentagon's inspector
general said in a report Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Deficiencies in estimating clearly left the government
vulnerable -- and sometimes at the mercy of the contractor to define
the cost,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon spent $51.8 billion last year on all kinds of
services contracts -- from trash collection to engineering studies --
up from $39.9 billion in 1992, but the amount of oversight hasn't
gone up accordingly, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The $6.7 billion is a representative sample of such deals from
1997 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As for oversight once the awards occurred, the report said,
''Contracting officers essentially used contractor-prepared status
reports as evidence of surveillance to determine how well the
contractor was performing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army and Navy, in written responses included in the report,
agreed with the inspector general's basic findings. The Air Force
and the defense secretary's office had not responded to the report
before publication.
</P>
<P>
   The $6.7 billion was spent in 1997 and 1998 on ''professional,
administrative and management support services'' -- covering
scientists, engineers, office managers and more.
</P>
<P>
   A major problem, according to the audit, is the frequent use in
services contracts of ''cost-plus'' deals, in which the government
reimburses all the contractors' costs and then pays an award fee on
top of that. Typically, cost-plus deals are used on technically
challenging, new programs, where the government assumes most of the
financial risk.
</P>
<P>
   In ''fixed-price'' contracts, which the government usually
prefers, the contractor gets paid a set amount negotiated
beforehand. These generally are used when a program's cost history
and technology are well known.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general found that the armed forces frequently buy
support services from the same company for years using cost-plus
contracts. Instead of making the company stick to a fixed price,
the military covers all the costs as if it were buying a
cutting-edge fighter.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, the Army in 1997 awarded Raytheon Corp. a $36.2
million contract for engineering services for the Hawk air-defense
system without any competition. Though this system was first
fielded in 1958, the Army still chose to cover the contractors'
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Army contracting officials said it wasn't possible to fix the
prices beforehand because of uncertainties about costs. But the
inspector general pointed out the Army had ''39 years of history
with this same contractor.''
</P>
<P>
   In another example, the Navy paid EG&AMP;G, Inc., $73.4 million for
consulting services, also on a cost-plus basis, although the Navy
had 25 years of cost data that could have been used to fix at least
some of the costs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the contracts studied, 84 were of the cost-plus variety. In
these deals, the auditors found costs had risen a total of $80
million above goals.
</P>
<P>
   When the government assumes so much of the risk, its need to do
its own cost estimates and to conduct robust oversight grows, the
audit says -- but just the opposite is occurring.
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring of contractor performance is important for many
reasons, the report said, including the fact that it is used to
determine award fees. In 94 percent of the cases studied, the
company got the maximum amount in awards, though ''none of the
documentation clearly supported'' these decisions, the auditors
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, on 63 of the 105 deals, ''inadequate competition
occurred,'' the report says, with Army, Navy, Air Force contracting
officers sometimes picking ''preferred contractors'' without giving
other firms a chance.
</P>
<P>
   On 22 of the contracts, the auditors found $535 million in
spending for materials without any paperwork justifying the buys or
showing the Pentagon paid reasonable prices.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Flood Victims Head Home  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY HATTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Despite fears of more flooding and a
possible cholera outbreak in Mozambique, restless flood victims
were abandoning aid camps and heading back to their devastated
villages, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clear weather and receding flood waters in recent days have
encouraged refugees to return to their wrecked homes in hopes of
salvaging some of their possessions.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Mozambican flood victims, particularly in
southern Gaza Province, were feeling confident enough to leave the
camps. With refugees spread over more than 100 camps, many do not
know what happened to their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But the government says it is still unable to provide food and
medicine to outlying villages hard-hit by last month's floods and
warns that drinking the filthy flood water there could spark a
cholera epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, aid workers were paying more attention to Madagascar,
an Indian Ocean island nation off the coast of Mozambique that was
also hit by the recent flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Six French military helicopters that arrived on the island
aboard a ship Monday began surveying damage from storms that killed
more than 100 people, left at least 10,000 homeless and battered
coffee plantations, rice paddies and banana, orange and avocado
groves.
</P>
<P>
   In Mozambique, 1 million people need aid, but the number is
expected to decline. The U.N. World Food Program appealed for $27
million to feed an estimated 650,000 people over the next six
months.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Ministry does not know how many people have left the
camps because the chaos wrought by the floods makes it difficult to
keep track of people.
</P>
<P>
   Graca Machel, Mozambique's former first lady and the wife of
former South African President Nelson Mandela, said she sympathized
with the victims' desire to head home, though she agreed with the
government's position that refugees should stay in camps until the
situation improves.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is extremely difficult to keep people in the camps,'' she
said at a meeting of aid groups. ''They have legitimate concerns
about what happened to their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern Mozambique has been sunny for the past three days,
allowing relief organizations to step up their aid shipments by
road.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, aid officials said they would send seeds along with
emergency food supplies to flood victims who need to plant new
crops in April.
</P>
<P>
   The floods wiped out farming fields throughout southern and
central Mozambique, and if farmers miss the next growing season,
the need for international food aid will be extended for months.
</P>
<P>
   International aid groups have said they fear last month's floods
may have killed thousands, but Sunday's confirmed toll of 492
remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Accurate casualty numbers probably won't be available until the
flooded Limpopo and Save rivers return to normal.

<HEADLINE> Dialogue on Workplace Safety Opening  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is inviting the
public to suggest improvements to its proposal for new worker
protections against repetitive motion injuries.
</P>
<P>
   It already knows, and is unlikely to grant, what business wants:
scrap the idea altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing here that isn't subject to change depending
upon the nature of the comments,'' said Assistant Labor Secretary
Charles N. Jeffress. But he added, ''We're on a schedule to have a
final rule adopted by the end of this year. That remains our
current goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate lawyers turned out in force Monday, as the
administration began nine weeks of public hearings, to grill
officials from the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, which Jeffress heads.
</P>
<P>
   A lobbying coalition including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the
National Association of Manufacturers and hundreds of other
business groups and corporations is asking that the proposal be
dropped. They contend it is not based on sound science, and its
costs are grossly underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're asking businesses to spend billions of dollars while
failing to ensure the prevention of these injuries,'' said the
coalition spokesman, Al Lundeen.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress have pushed for delays and won a 30-day
extension of the public comment period. But the administration,
hedging its bets against the possibility of a GOP takeover of the
White House in November, is determined to complete the rules during
President Clinton's last months in office.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed regulations, rolled out in November after years of
holdups imposed by Congress for scientific research and other
scrutiny, would require employers to minimize everyday physical --
or ergonomic -- stresses of certain jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The rules do not require congressional approval, but business
lobbyists note that legislation has been introduced that could
derail the regulatory process again. The House passed one such bill
last fall. The Senate has not acted on the subject, which could
become politically touchy in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA officials laid out their case in opening testimony Monday.
Each year 1.8 million workers have musculoskeletal injuries related
to ergonomic working conditions, they say, and 600,000 people miss
work because of them.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries to muscles, nerves, ligaments and tendons include such
problems as carpal tunnel syndrome, back pain and tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   Marthe Kent, head of OSHA's regulatory programs, said the agency
has devoted a decade of study to the problems and has observed that
in the meantime, some companies have come up with effective
solutions on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ''The science base is strong, the risk is significant, and
feasible means of reducing that risk are widely available and
understood. The time to act is now,'' Kent said.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules would cover a broad range of workers from nurses
to baggage handlers at airports and people who work at computers or
on assembly lines.
</P>
<P>
   Unions, also represented at the hearings, want even stronger
protections -- for example, penalties against companies that
intimidate workers from reporting ergonomic injuries.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA estimates businesses would spend $4.2 billion a year to
comply but predicts net savings of $9 billion in medical costs and
increased productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses claim the government is far underestimating the cost.
The corporate-financed Employment Policy Foundation pegs the price
of worker education, reconfiguration of workspaces and workers'
compensation at $80 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   Companies also say the rules are overly broad, requiring them to
address individual physical problems that may be the result of
factors other than working conditions, such as a person's overall
health or activities at home.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomics hearings are scheduled to move to Chicago on April
11, then to Portland, Ore., on April 24 before a wrap-up back in
the nation's capital May 8-12.

Finland Marks Post Winter War Peace

   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Finns on Monday marked the 60th anniversary of a
truce that followed 105 days of fierce fighting against Stalin's Red Army in the
Winter War, possibly one of the coldest in history. Finland lost, but the small
country's resistance against the Soviets helped secure its independence in
post-war Europe. Some 23,000 Finnish soldiers were killed, and 45,000 wounded,
in a population of 3.7 million. But Finland's white-clad troops on skis, which
became famous as the ''ghost army,'' proved a stronger force than expected. The
Soviet Union put its losses at 217,500 dead or wounded, but Finland estimated

Utility Industry Reliability Questioned

<HEADLINE> Branch Davidians Seek To Drop Case  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Branch Davidian plaintiffs who are suing
the government over the 1993 Waco siege are asking a federal judge
to dismiss their case against an FBI sharpshooter who is the lone
named defendant in their wrongful-death lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   There is ''no credible evidence'' that FBI sharpshooter Lon
Horiuchi or his sniper team fired any shots at the Branch Davidian
compound outside Waco, Texas on April 19, 1993, the plaintiffs'
lead counsel said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A forensic analysis of spent shell casings found at the sniper
outpost occupied by Horiuchi's team indicate the bullets were
''most likely'' fired by agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms during the initial Feb. 28 gun battle that sparked the
51-day siege, lawyer Michael Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our investigation has determined that, while the FBI was
clearly sloppy in gathering evidence following the ATF raid on
February 28, there is no credible evidence that Horiuchi or other
members of his sniper team fired at Mount Carmel on April 19,
1993,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer stressed that the move to dismiss the claims against
Horiuchi doesn't diminish the plaintiffs' view that other FBI
agents directed gunfire at the Branch Davidians' retreat during the
standoff's final, deadly hours. Their civil suit proceeds to trial
in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   ''This in no way undermines or alters our strong belief that
government agents, almost certainly (FBI Hostage Rescue Team)
members, directed gunfire at the back of Mount Carmel, from
positions that were not observable by the press or the FBI
leadership in Washington,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, which is representing Horiuchi, offered
no immediate comment. But weeks ago, Horiuchi's government lawyers
filed a motion saying there is not a ''shred of evidence'' he fired
his weapon on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Horiuchi first came to widespread public attention in 1992 when
he killed the wife of white separatist Randy Weaver during the
standoff at Ruby Ridge, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials insist that no government personnel fired any
shots in the waning hours of the Waco siege, when the FBI initiated
a tank-and-tear gas operation designed to flush the Davidians out
of their building.
</P>
<P>
   Davidian leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died during a
fire that consumed the compound several hours into the tear-gassing
operation. Some died from the blaze, others from gunshot wounds
that federal authorities say were inflicted by sect members.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs contend FBI infrared surveillance footage taken
April 19 captured bursts of light that can represent nothing other
than muzzle blasts directed from government positions into the
burning building -- a contention federal officials deny.
</P>

   The plaintiffs' theory will be put to the test Sunday in a
court-ordered field test at a Texas military base. The
demonstration is designed to show whether infrared video technology
captures gunfire with bursts of light similar to those that appear
on the 1993 infrared videotape.

<HEADLINE> Delta Plane Makes Emergency Landing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A Delta Air Lines flight bound from San
Francisco to Salt Lake City made an emergency landing Monday
evening after experiencing problems with its landing gear,
according to an airport spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 727-200 landed without any injuries to the 77
passengers, although the pilots could not use their right landing
gear, said airport spokeswoman Kim Dickie. Emergency crews were
waiting for the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot informed the passengers of the landing gear problems
soon after takeoff. The plane then circled the airport for an hour
and dumped fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was so silent on the plane, except for a baby crying, which
made us mothers even more tense,'' passenger Jane Vaughn of Utah
told KTVU-TV in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane landed, its right wing dragged on the runway and
broke. Passengers exited by an inflatable slide.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed like an eternity from the time we went to the braced
position until the time we finally touched the ground. And as we
touched the ground, we could hear the wings dragging along the
ground,'' said Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Some planes bound for San Francisco were routed instead to
Oakland or San Jose because the runway where the emergency landing
took place was temporarily closed.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 1972 was scheduled to leave at 6:35 p.m. and arrive in
Salt Lake at 9:08 p.m. It was then scheduled to travel on to
Kalispell, Mont., arriving 11:45 p.m. The flight landed back in San
Francisco at 8:01 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Season Continues With Lunch  </HEADLINE>
By BOB THOMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- There were no winners or losers at
the annual Oscar nominees luncheon. Those distinctions are two
weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   Collegiality ruled Monday among contenders for honors at the
72nd annual Oscars, to be presented March 26. In the interview room
before lunch, actors and directors echoed the theme.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Oscars are not really a competition,'' commented Haley
Joel Osment, the 11-year-old nominee for Best Supporting Actor in
the ''Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It isn't a competition,'' said Michael Mann, nominated for
directing ''The Insider.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The stiffest competition is to make the picture. If you're
attracted to this work with awards in mind, you wouldn't last one
week of photography,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't call it a competition,'' insisted Denzel Washington,
named for best actor in ''The Hurricane.'' ''People do the best
they can. And a lot of the actors this year have done good work.''
</P>
<P>
   As he left the room, Washington was asked if he was rooting for
anyone. ''Yes,'' he replied with an enigmatic smile.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen of the 20 acting nominees and four of the five
directors, along with 80 other achievers mounted a row of bleachers
for the ''class picture.'' All stood while the photo was taken a
dozen times for safety's sake.
</P>
<P>
   An endearing scene appeared at the middle of the front row. It
was Richard Farnsworth, the 79-year-old nominee as Best Actor for
''The Straight Story,'' who fondly held his hands on the shoulders
of the diminutive Haley Joel.
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon ended with the usual warning.
</P>
<P>
   The show's producers Richard and Lily Zanuck instructed the
nominees that if they should be lucky enough to win, please avoid
filibusters as acceptance speeches.

<HEADLINE> Maryland on Newest Quarters  </HEADLINE>
By SETH HETTENA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Katie Carr, an 11-year-old numismatist
from Cloverley Elementary School in Silver Spring, gives a
thumbs-up to the design of Maryland's new commemorative quarter.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington's profile remains on the heads side, of
course. But the Maryland State House, the site where the future
president resigned his Army commission, will take the place of the
American eagle on the reverse of Maryland's new quarter, unveiled
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's gotta lot of history to it,'' said Katie. As for
Georgia's peach, Connecticut's tree and the four other state
designs, she said, ''They just don't go.''
</P>
<P>
   The State House design was selected by the governor from
hundreds of entries, beating out another finalist: a depiction of
the British bombs bursting over Fort McHenry in 1814 that inspired
Francis Scott Key to pen ''The Star-Spangled Banner.''
</P>
<P>
   It was another striking nighttime scene that inspired Maryland's
new quarter designer William Krawczewicz. The 33-year-old bank note
designer for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing was in Annapolis
two years ago when he happened to glance up and see the dome lit up
against the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I saw the dome,'' he said, ''that was my main source of
inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland State House is the nation's oldest statehouse still
in legislative use and is the only one to have served as the
nation's capitol, from November 1783 to August 1784. Washington
resigned his Army commission here in 1783, before taking the oath
of office as the nation's first president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope when people look at this dome they get a sense of what
Maryland is all about,'' Gov. Parris Glendening said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 billion Maryland quarters will be stamped in a
10-week period to keep pace with public demand for the new
quarters, said David Pickens, associate director of the U.S. Mint.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors snapping up the commemorative coins have forced the
Mint to more than double its normal production of about 1.5 billion
quarters to 3.6 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''These quarters have joined the most popular collections in the
world, even outstripping Pokemons and Beanie Babies,'' said David
Pickens, associate director of the U.S. Mint.
</P>
<P>
   By 2008, all 50 states will have had a chance to redesign the
tails side of the quarter in the order which they entered the
union. Washington's profile will always remain on the heads side.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Filing Complaint Against EU  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The European Union's decision to limit use of
older commercial jet aircraft equipped with engine mufflers called
''hush kits'' will be challenged by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   EU officials, especially concerned about the environment, have
said that while reducing noise pollution, the kits are ineffective
at controlling pollution. The administration says the regulations
discriminate against American airlines, which resell aircraft with
the mufflers in Europe, and kit makers, which are all American.
</P>
<P>
   David Aaron, the Commerce Department's undersecretary for
international trade, told reporters Monday that the administration
planned to file the challenge today with the Montreal-based
International Civil Aviation Organization. The group sets standards
for flights around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint will seek the repeal of the EU's regulations,
which have been adopted but are not slated to take effect until May
4. Administration officials contend the rules discriminate against
U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Europeans and industry have been trying to
resolve the matter, but have been unable to come to an agreement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Release China Trade Text  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of legislation to implement an
accord opening trade barriers between China and the United States
are hoping the law will be easier to sell with release of the text
of the landmark agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the document's text would be sent
today to each member of Congress and released to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William Daley, the administration's point man
on the lobbying effort, said Monday that once people examine the
fine print, ''They will see a very positive deal'' for American
exporters.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to release the text, reported by officials who
spoke on condition of anonymity, represents a turnabout for the
Clinton administration. It has insisted the deal could not be made
public because China is negotiating with Europe and other countries
over terms under which it will enter the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In the agreement between the United States and China, reached in
November, China agreed to remove, in return for U.S. support of its
membership in the WTO, barriers that American exporters have long
complained are keeping billions of dollars' worth of their products
out of the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
   But under WTO rules, Congress must scrap its annual review of
China's trade status and grant it permanent normal trade relations
in order for U.S. exporters to receive the trade benefits China is
offering. Permanent normal trade relations status, formerly known
as most-favored-nation status, is enjoyed by almost all countries
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The text of the November agreement has been available to members
of the House and Senate and staff members with appropriate security
clearances for reading in secure reading rooms. But lawmakers
complained the secrecy was difficult to justify to their
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have insisted that all the agreement's
details were released in November when the deal was announced, even
though the exact text of the document was withheld. But opponents
in the labor and environmental movements have said the public
deserved the right to examine the fine print.
</P>
<P>
   A major business group said Monday that release of the full text
will make their lobbying job in support of the agreement easier.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now the general public will be able to see what a terrific
deal this is for America. The text of the agreement contains page
after page of concessions that will improve our access to China's
huge market,'' said Calman J. Cohen, co-chairman of the Business
Coalition for U.S.-China Trade, an umbrella lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents insist, however, that Congress will make a big mistake
if it ends the annual congressional review. To do so would
surrender leverage the United States has to force China to improve
its human-rights record, opponents say.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, speaking to reporters, said the administration still
faces an uphill battle in the House, where strong opposition from
labor unions is making it difficult for President Clinton to
attract Democratic votes.
</P>
<P>
   But Daley said he believes momentum on the issue is beginning to
shift. Daley and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman will lead
delegations of undecided lawmakers on trips to China next month.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said Republican leaders need to schedule votes in both the
House and Senate so the matter can be decided before the end of
May. Delays past that time, he said, would make it much harder to
win passage because the issue would become embroiled in fall
election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Daley conceded that China's recent belligerent statements
regarding Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province, are not
helping in the lobbying effort.
</P>
<P>
   He said government leaders in Beijing are ''very capable of
doing something very stupid'' that could cost important votes in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Daley stressed that Clinton is working hard to round up votes
for what the administration has called its biggest remaining
foreign policy objective.
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker Dennis Hastert said in a separate appearance
Monday the agreement has the backing of the ''Republican leadership
and a large majority of Republicans'' in the House. He said if
Democratic support was as weak as had been reported, ''I cannot
solve this problem for the president.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to boost bipartisan support, the administration
released a letter from six former secretaries of state saying
permanent normal trade relations with China and China's membership
in the WTO are ''critically important tools'' for moving China to a
more open society.

<HEADLINE> More Power Outages Possible  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- This summer could see a repeat of power
outages if reliability problems in a rapidly changing electricity
industry are not addressed, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
warned.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a group of mayors and local officials on Monday,
Richardson urged that they help convince Congress to enact
legislation that would require mandatory reliability standards for
wholesale power producers.
</P>
<P>
   ''While demand for electricity is soaring ... the reliability of
our electric grid is at times faltering, mainly because policy
makers haven't kept pace with rapid changes in the electric utility
industry,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   He released an Energy Department report that concluded the
transition to electricity competition has strained transmission and
distribution lines, and caused some utilities to focus on competing
for markets, cutting costs and maximizing prices, instead of
assuring that power is kept flowing.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the report, including its key findings, was made
public as an interim document in January.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson, speaking to the National League of Cities, used
the analysis to reiterate his call for Congress to pass legislation
governing the new, more competitive electricity industry or risk
''more long, hot summers of outages in America's cities.''
</P>
<P>
   For several years, lawmakers have been trying to craft
legislation that would establish a national program of electricity
industry deregulation, ending the historic monopolies utilities
have had in their local service areas.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four states already are well along to a competitive
electricity market and in some states such as California and
Pennsylvania people can choose their electricity supplier, although
the actual power still comes over the same local distribution
systems.
</P>
<P>
   But a national electricity deregulation bill has been stymied by
disagreements among various segments of the $200 billion electric
power industry, and opposition from some states where electricity
already is cheap. There also has been controversy over what role
the federal government should play as opposed to the states, which
traditionally have regulated electric utilities, and whether a
federal law should require an openly competitive market, or allow
states to make that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Citing power disruptions last summer, Richardson told a cities'
conference that ''without action (on the federal level) things
could get worse before they get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Richardson told a conference of state regulators that
the system of voluntary reliability rules, established by the
industry itself, is inadequate in the current competitive market
system.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need mandatory reliability standards for (wholesale) power
providers,'' Richardson reiterated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson also has raised concerns about large power providers
manipulating prices.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the movement toward competition, electricity supply in
some parts of the country remains ''highly concentrated in the
hands of only a few companies,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This raises a warning flag that these companies will be able
to dominate the market and raise prices,'' he recently told a
conference of state utility regulators. He accused ''a handful of
utilities and other organizations'' of using a ''state's rights''
argument to block federal rules needed to ensure reliability and
market power abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The DOE report released Monday said that while many states have
made significant progress in developing competitive electricity
markets, their efforts to develop market-based mechanisms to ensure
against power disruptions have lagged behind.
</P>
<P>
   The report examined power disruptions and electricity price
spikes that occurred during high electricity demand last summer and
how to prevent a repeat of the same problems this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents included outages in Chicago, New York City, Long
Island, New Jersey, Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana as
well as some non-outage electricity grid disturbances in New
England and the mid-Atlantic states.

<HEADLINE> Scott Smith trial jurors say they didn't believe officer feared forhis life  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW MILFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The jury in New Milford police officer
Scott Smith's murder trial didn't buy the officer's story that he
feared for his life when he shot and killed an unarmed black
suspect, The News Times of Danbury reported today.
</P>
<P>
   Allen McGrady, a New Milford resident and the only black juror,
and jury forewoman Mary Cranouski of Barkhamsted told the paper the
evidence was clear that Franklyn Reid did not pose a threat to
Smith when he was shot in the back on the afternoon of Dec. 29,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   McGrady and Cranouski said they were strongly influenced by
testimony from the motorists who witnessed the episode because they
didn't know each other and had no stake in the outcome, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Although police officers at the scene said they didn't witness
the shooting, prosecutor John Connelly called numerous civilian
witnesses who testified Reid appeared to have surrendered. Early in
their deliberations, the jurors asked to rehear testimony from
eight civilians who were either driving by or were in a nearby gas
station as the episode unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   The two jurors told the News Times that the panel pieced
together a picture of the shooting that didn't fit with Smith's
account.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you have all the framework in the film that seems to follow
sequence, and then you hit a blip in one of the frames that doesn't
fit anything, then you have to make a decision to credit it or
discredit it,'' McGrady said. ''That's what we did with Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of convicting Smith of murder, jurors chose a lesser
charge of first-degree manslaughter with a firearm. The two jurors
said it was the best fit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure he didn't get up in the morning and say he was going
to kill someone. He made the wrong decision,'' Cranouski said.
</P>
<P>
   There were some aspects of the deliberations that both Cranouski
and McGrady declined to discuss. They refused to say whether jurors
took any votes on the murder charge, or whether there was a
straight-up vote to acquit Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Both jurors they labored over their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do respect police, but we had to make a decision based on
the evidence we had,'' McGrady said. ''I feel for Scott and his
family. I feel for the Reids and I feel for Franklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel for both sides. One lost a child, and now the other
has,'' Cranouski said. ''It was a tough decision. ''
</P>
<P>
   The jurors also said they never discussed whether the shooting
was a racial incident, although Smith is white and Reid was black.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't brought up once,'' McGrady said. ''That doesn't mean
it wasn't in the back of minds.''

Finland Marks Post Winter War Peace

<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Finns on Monday marked the 60th anniversary of a
truce that followed 105 days of fierce fighting against Stalin's Red Army in the
Winter War, possibly one of the coldest in history. Finland lost, but the small
country's resistance against the Soviets helped secure its independence in
post-war Europe. Some 23,000 Finnish soldiers were killed, and 45,000 wounded,
in a population of 3.7 million. But Finland's white-clad troops on skis, which
became famous as the ''ghost army,'' proved a stronger force than expected. The
Soviet Union put its losses at 217,500 dead or wounded, but Finland estimated
enemy casualties at up to 400,000.

<HEADLINE> US, NRA Continue Gun Control Clash  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says he's ''just trying to
keep more people alive'' as he and the National Rifle Association
keep throwing elbows on the sensitive election-year topic of gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the White House nor the NRA was backing off from a war
of words that included an accusation from NRA Executive Vice
President Wayne LaPierrre that Clinton was ''willing to accept a
certain level of killing to further his political agenda and his
vice president too.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty hard to take,'' Clinton told a Democratic crowd
during a political fund-raising speech Monday night in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   As he did earlier during two appearances in Cleveland, Clinton
repeated LaPierre's comment in a soft, almost incredulous tone. ''I
didn't like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth seemed sure to continue, as the White House
tries to train an unflattering light on the NRA and its mostly
Republican backers in Congress as Vice President Al Gore campaigns
to replace Clinton and Democrats hope to regain a majority in the
House in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not trying to pick a fight with anybody,'' Clinton said
Monday night. ''I'm just trying to keep more people alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has issued a challenge to Congress to pass what he calls
''common-sense gun control'' before the April 20 anniversary of the
Columbine High School shootings in Colorado, although his plan
failed in Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to impose background checks on sales at gun shows that
could take as long as 72 hours. Many congressional Republicans,
like the NRA, want any such checks to be instant or at least no
longer than 24 hours. Clinton also wants trigger locks to be
required on new guns and a ban on the import of large-capacity
ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the face of Columbine and the shooting death of a
6-year-old by a first-grade classmate, Clinton said, the NRA is set
in its opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want you to see what we're up against whenever we try to
change here,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre, who made his original charge Sunday, held his ground
on Monday. He said it is Clinton who owes the parents of children
killed by guns an explanation of why federal gun laws are being so
poorly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he should look them in the eye and explain why he
won't enforce the laws against crack dealers with guns and take
them off the street,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   What began the exchange Sunday is a new campaign in which NRA
President Charlton Heston implies in television ads that Clinton
lied when he characterized the NRA as stubbornly resistant to
reasonable gun-control laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''When what you say is wrong, that's a mistake,'' Heston says in
several of them. ''When you know it's wrong, that's a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Clinton noted that when he was governor of
Arkansas the NRA once gave him a lifetime membership, and that he
had a productive partnership with the gun group to promote safety
for young hunters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's been revoked now,'' he joked.

<HEADLINE> Study Questions Estrogen-Heart Link  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The decision of whether to stay on
estrogen after menopause has gotten even more difficult with new
research that questions the pill's benefits for the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Many women take estrogen supplements for a few years to ease the
miseries of menopause. But some stay on the drug much longer
because of its apparent health advantages.
</P>
<P>
   The decision has always involved weighing benefits against
risks, but until recently, one of those benefits seemed clear:
Estrogen pills after menopause prevent heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   That dogma was called into question for the first time two years
ago when a large study came to the surprisingly conclusion that the
supplements do not protect aging heart patients from new heart
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been left in a state of indecision and lack of
knowledge about what to recommend,'' said Dr. Marion Limacher of
the University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there is more evidence, and it also suggests that estrogen
does nothing good for heart patient's hearts, although it probably
doesn't do them any harm, either.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors think estrogen pills such as Premarin, the
country's top-selling prescription drug, helps the heart largely by
improving cholesterol levels after women go through menopause.
</P>
<P>
   The pills lower total cholesterol and artery-clogging LDL
cholesterol, while raising protective HDL cholesterol. Doctors
assume these changes translate into less heart disease, even though
no experiments definitively prove this.
</P>
<P>
   The first to put the idea to the test was the landmark Heart and
Estrogen-progestin Replacement Study -- HERS -- finished two years
ago. It found that four years of treatment with combination
estrogen and progestin pills failed to lower the risk of new heart
attacks in women who already had heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The latest report backs up HERS' disturbing conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ''These results are indeed somewhat surprising in view of the
large body of evidence indicating that estrogen does have a
favorable effect on cholesterol and heart disease,'' said the
study's director, Dr. David Herrington of Wake Forest University
Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't say for certain there is no benefit, but we can rule
out a large effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sidney Smith of the University of North Carolina, a
spokesman for the American Heart Association, noted that neither
HERS nor the latest study shows whether hormone replacement helps
if begun early in menopause or before women develop heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to those questions should come from the federally
sponsored Women's Health Initiative, which is examining the effects
of hormone replacement on more than 27,000 women ages 50 to 79. The
first results are expected in about five years.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing the pros and cons of estrogen is already complex. Many
women use it for a few years to relieve hot flashes and other ill
effects of menopause. Others stay on the hormone for many years to
improve cholesterol levels and to prevent brittle bones and vaginal
changes, even though the treatment can also increase the risk of
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Now doctors are confused and divided over what to expect from
estrogen on the heart. However, many agree that even if the hormone
proves to be good, its benefit is unlikely to be as large as that
of statin drugs, which clearly lower cholesterol and save lives.
</P>
<P>
   In Herrington's study, sponsored by the National Institutes of
Health, 309 older women with heart disease were randomly assigned
to Premarin, the estrogen-progestin combination Prempro or dummy
pills. After four years, doctors measured their heart arteries and
found no difference in the progression of their disease.
</P>
<P>
   Limacher said that until recently, she routinely recommended
estrogen supplements for older women with heart disease. Now she
takes them off hormone replacement, largely as a result of HERS.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Michael H. Davidson of the Chicago Center for
Clinical Research said estrogen may still turn out to be good for
many women's hearts. He presented evidence that estrogen plus a
statin lower cholesterol more than does a statin alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have several years to go before we know which women will
benefit from hormone replacement therapy and which ones should
avoid it,'' Davidson said.

<HEADLINE> Few Heart Patients Taking Aspirin  </HEADLINE>
By TROY GOODMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Only about a quarter of the people who have heart
disease and could benefit from taking aspirin are using the pain
reliever, according to a new report.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Medical School's Dr. Randall Stafford, who led the
study, said the findings suggest a substantial number of heart
patients are risking more problems because they're not using
aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   Regular use of aspirin as an effective circulatory therapy has
proven to reduce the risk of blood clots that can trigger a heart
attack. Aspirin also may help patients avoid strokes and protect
them from angina, or severe chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   But because taking aspirin poses some health risks -- including
causing stomach ulcers, internal bleeding and allergic reactions --
doctors too often are reluctant to prescribe it for heart patients,
said Stafford. The findings appear in Monday's editions of
Circulation, a journal of the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings support an earlier study, released more than a
year ago, that found too many heart attack victims were dying
because hospitals nationwide weren't using simple treatments such
as aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   That study, reported in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, looked at 186,000 Medicare patients treated for heart
attacks in 1994 and 1995, and found only 14 percent of them got
aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a bias in medicine toward treatment and within that
bias we tend to underutilize preventative services -- even if
they've been clearly proven,'' said Marty Sullivan, an associate
professor of cardiology at Duke University in Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Using 1996 data, Stafford and his fellow researchers looked at
10,942 doctor visits by people with heart disease and found that
only 26 percent took aspirin. That's up 5 percent from 1980
figures.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also found that aspirin use among heart patients
differed between men and women and also between the young and the
aging. More men than women -- 29 percent vs. 21 percent -- took
aspirin, and more young adults took the drug before those over age
80.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford said the findings may underestimate aspirin use because
some doctors don't report when they recommend patients take
over-the-counter medications. But he called the data ''a wake-up
call.''

<HEADLINE> Reports Critical of NASA's Approach  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW FORDAHL, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NASA's space exploration program is trying to
do too much with too little money and not understanding the risks
that could lead to embarrassments like last year's failed Mars
missions, according to two panels of experts.
</P>
<P>
   The reports released Monday did not suggest the agency abandon
its mantra of ''faster, cheaper, better'' missions, but instead
urged officials to focus less on quickness and cost and more on
quality and reliability.
</P>
<P>
   ''The success of 'faster, better, cheaper' is tempered by the
fact that some projects and programs have put too much emphasis on
cost and schedule reduction,'' said one panel led by Arthur
Stephenson, director of the Marshall Space Flight Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to slow down some, not rush too quickly into important
programs and projects, plan and implement them more carefully,''
said Tony Spear, who led the other review and is a former manager
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was especially difficult for NASA: In addition to
losing two Mars probes, space shuttle flights were delayed, the
Hubble Space Telescope temporarily shut down and other missions
either missed their targets or failed at launch.
</P>
<P>
   NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin ordered reviews, including
Spear's analysis of ''faster, better, cheaper'' and the report on
NASA management by the Mars Climate Orbiter failure board, which
Stephenson led. Last week, another panel made 81 recommendations on
space shuttle management, safety and technical issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew this change would not be easy,'' Goldin said. ''We
knew we would have problems.''
</P>
<P>
   JPL, which operated both the $125 million Mars Climate Orbiter
and $165 million Mars Polar Lander, said the failed missions serve
as a wake-up call.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lessons learned, findings and recommendations seem to be
on target, and we intend to take them seriously and do what we can
to make the necessary improvements here at JPL,'' said Larry Dumas,
the lab's deputy director.
</P>
<P>
   A common theme runs through both reports: ''Faster, better,
cheaper'' missions place too much emphasis on cost and schedule
reduction and too little on management, oversight, leadership and
evaluating risk.
</P>
<P>
   The Climate Orbiter, for instance, was lost when a contractor
failed to convert measurements into metric units. The $125 million
probe flew too close to Mars on Sept. 23 and is believed to have
burned up in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake itself was not as serious as the failure to catch
it, the review board said. Its first report, issued in November,
attempted to remedy the failures before Mars Polar Lander arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But the $165 million spacecraft was last heard from on Dec. 3,
just as it was beginning its descent to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's Management 101. They're basically saying there are four
things you have to balance: cost, schedule, content and risk,''
said John Pike, an analyst for the Federation of American
Scientists. ''But they don't say very much about how to balance
those.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the reports do not detail the funding deficiencies
and staff shortages that contributed to the problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency will decide what specific actions to take by
midsummer, said W. Brian Keegan, NASA's chief engineer. Another
report, on the loss of the Polar Lander, is due by the end of this
month.

<HEADLINE> GOP Plans Senior Prescription Aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans are preparing a plan
to allocate $40 billion to help low-income elderly people pay for
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is simply unacceptable that 13 million seniors do not have
prescription drug coverage,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla.,
chairman of the House Republican Conference. ''Republicans are
committed to helping these most vulnerable seniors, offering a plan
to get prescription drugs to them while, at the same time,
preparing Medicare for the next generation of retirees.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican proposal announced Monday would cost about the
same as President Clinton's plan, whose price tag is an estimated
$35 billion over five years and $149 billion over the next decade.
The administration's plan also includes an additional $35 billion
in its final five years to help seniors with catastrophic drug
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president wants to create a big-government health system
that offers no competition or options for individual states,''
Watts said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, who are drafting their budget for next year,
still have to work out the details of their proposal.

<HEADLINE> Marijuana Bill Before Legislature  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- A bill before the Legislature would have
the state distribute confiscated marijuana plants to people who are
allowed to use it for medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The law is meant to help people who have trouble getting
marijuana to help treat their medical conditions, a practice that
Maine voters approved in November.
</P>
<P>
   But even the bill's sponsor doubts it will pass, as long as
marijuana possession remains illegal under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal government really has to change its attitude about
marijuana, it's got to allow research,'' Sen. Anne Rand,
D-Portland, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency to
distribute the marijuana and provides for a registry of patients
allowed to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Clark, 26, favors the law. He has been using marijuana to
quell the nausea that began after he got the AIDS virus at age 13
from the blood clotting agent prescribed for his hemophilia.
</P>
<P>
   His doctor has written a letter saying Clark meets the
requirements of the state law. But federal anti-marijuana laws keep
Clark from getting it by prescription, and growing it at home is
too expensive, he says -- $500 for lighting equipment and about $50
in electricity per month.
</P>
<P>
   The only other option is buying it illegally, he says, which
defeats the purpose of the new state law. ''You've got to do what
you've got to do, and that's the unfortunate thing about this,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature's Health and Human Services Committee was
scheduled to discuss the bill further Thursday. Maine's attorney
general hopes to form a task force to study the question.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana is banned by the federal government, although voters
in six states have approved laws allowing the drug to be used for
medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Maine law limits medical marijuana use to those who have
nausea, vomiting or wasting syndrome from AIDS; who are undergoing
chemotherapy; who have glaucoma; or who have chronic seizures or
muscle spasms.
</P>
<P>
   Patients must be under a physician's care and must discuss the
use of medical marijuana with the physician. Patients may have up
to 1\ ounce of marijuana or six plants, no more than three of which
may be flowering.

By The Associated Press	   ''Tanglewood Tree'' (Signature Sounds) -- Dave Carter
and Tracy
Grammer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''Tanglewood Tree'' is simply brilliant, a skyrocket of an album
that should establish this Oregon duo as stars, at least in the
firmament of contemporary folk. Dave Carter's songwriting embraces
the mythic, the metaphoric and the surreal. He writes songs that
can stand with the best of contemporary singer-songwriters or sound
like they were written 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Carter's songs ring like tales from the past. ''Hey
Conductor'' could have been on a Merle Travis record, and ''Cat-Eye
Willie Comes to Claim His Lover'' sounds like it was written by
some muleskinner-poet 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Carter writes more standard singer-songwriter material, as well,
such as ''Walkin' Away From Caroline,'' a vivid and heartbreaking
slice of a conversation between a couple breaking up.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Grammer's instrumental prowess and lovely voice (she
handles lead vocals on four songs as well as singing harmony) and
Carter's songwriting combine to make this album great.

   ''Wandering Moon'' (Sony Classical) -- Terence Blanchard
</P>
<P>
   Terence Blanchard's new disc captures the ear from the opening
bars, when a languid counterpoint pairs a piano/bass line against
three bluesy horns playing in harmony to create a captivating mood.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what follows is just as good, showing that while
Blanchard has been hailed as a composer and orchestrator, leading a
small jazz group may be what he does best. On ''Wandering Moon,''
the New Orleans trumpeter has stellar help from his touring group
and such guests as saxman Branford Marsalis and bassist Dave
Holland, and Blanchard is generous in sharing the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   His eight compositions include tributes to trumpeter Harry
''Sweets'' Edison, who died last year, and to jazz legend Sidney
Bechet. The quality of the set dips only on ''If I Could, I
Would,'' which flirts with free form and isn't for the faint of
heart. But there are also plenty of highlights, capped by a
beautiful rendition of the Johnny Mercer/Jimmy Van Heusen ballad
''I Thought About You.''
</P>
<P>
   -- By Steven Wine, Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
   ''Trio 99-00'' (Warner Bros.) -- Pat Metheny
</P>
<P>
   Pat Metheny plays the kind of jazz that people who don't like
jazz like.
</P>
<P>
   Is that a compliment? Not necessarily. The talented guitarist is
prolific to a fault, and the quality of his catalog would be higher
if his output were lower. But when Metheny is good, he's terrific,
and that's the case on ''Trio 99-00.''
</P>
<P>
   Metheny teamed up with bassist Dave Holland and drummer Roy
Haynes to record 11 tunes in just two days, and the group meshed
beautifully. Metheny can sometimes be guilty of New Age noodling,
but here every note he plays has a purpose as he shows off a
remarkable vocabulary on both electric and acoustic guitar. His
playing is impressively fast on the opening ''(Go) Get It,''
playful on ''Soul Cowboy,'' and just plain lovely on ''Just Like
The Day'' and the closing ''Travels.'' He finds a Latin groove by
slowing the tempo on John Coltrane's ''Giant Steps'' and makes the
most of the Wayne Shorter standard ''Capricorn.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland and Haynes are terrific, too, and deserve credit for
bringing out the best in Metheny. Even people who do like jazz can
applaud ''Trio 99-00.''

<P>
   BEDFORD, N.Y. (AP) -- New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani blamed
the Clinton administration for the high cost of gasoline, saying,
''their failure to act has caused this crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This administration is napping, hibernating, asleep,
unfocused, whatever you want to call it, with regard to what's
going on with gasoline,'' said Giuliani, a Republican candidate for
the U.S. Senate running against Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani spoke Monday at a gas station in the affluent
Westchester County community of Bedford, where the prices marked at
the full-service island were $2.03.9 a gallon for regular gasoline,
$2.13.9 for medium and $2.23.9 for premium.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can say, 'Thank you, President Clinton, thank you, Vice
President Al Gore and thank you, (U.S. Energy Secretary) Bill
Richardson for these prices,''' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani called for a repeal of the 1993 federal gas tax
increase and said he supported State Senate Majority Leader Joseph
Bruno's proposal to eliminate the 4 percent state sales tax on
gasoline on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Gas prices were as low as 85 cents a gallon last year in some
parts of the country and have since risen to an average of $1.59 a
gallon, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the increase was a March 1999 decision by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce production
as a means of driving up prices.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Erin Brockovich'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a name like ''Erin Brockovich,'' it better be good.
</P>
<P>
   After delivering big box office with the sweet and pleasantly
titled ''Notting Hill'' and bigger box office with the dumb and
cloyingly titled ''Runaway Bride'' last year, Julia Roberts comes
through with a salty, tough-as-glue-on-fingernails turn in her
latest stab at a more dramatic role: as an uneducated but fiercely
determined environmental crusader.
</P>
<P>
   Cheers to Roberts and director Steven Soderbergh for not trying
to hang an ear-catching title above the credits. Clunky as it
sounds, ''Erin Brockovich'' fits the film like the title
character's low-cut, skin-tight outfits.
</P>
<P>
   The movie likely will pack in the crowds. Who wouldn't pay to
see Hollywood's reigning nice gal talk trash, dress slutty,
champion the little guy, and deal out obscene comeuppances left and
right to snooty lawyers?
</P>
<P>
   Roberts stars in the real-life story of Brockovich, a single mom
with three kids, roaches in the kitchen, a ratty car, sky-high
debts and no employable skills.
</P>
<P>
   After an unsuccessful lawsuit against a rich doctor over a car
accident, Erin elbows her way into a clerical job with attorney Ed
Masry (Albert Finney), who handled her case. Co-workers complain
about her call-girl attire, including gaudy makeup and short
leather skirts, and Erin is perpetually in dutch with her boss
because of her outspokenness.
</P>
<P>
   But when pro bono files about a sickly desert family land on her
desk, Erin uncovers a major pollution scandal involving a utility
and poisoned water.
</P>
<P>
   She persuades the reluctant Masry, who has his eye on
comfortable retirement, to pursue the case. Downright ignorant on
scientific matters at first, Erin soon becomes expert on such toxic
compounds as hexavalent chromium.
</P>
<P>
   She sneaks onto utility land, grabbing water samples, plucking
mutated frogs from ponds and running from security guards. Her
earthy, unlawyerly demeanor wins over the 600-plus people affected
by the tainted water.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate lawyers,'' Erin tells them. ''I just work for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Erin shamelessly puts her looks to work when the law firm needs
records from the local water authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''What makes you think you can just walk in there and find what
we need?'' Ed asks her.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're called boobs, Ed,'' she replies.
</P>
<P>
   The script is chock-full of choice, ribald exchanges between
Erin and the lawyers, her co-workers and Aaron Eckhart as the biker
with a heart of gold who moves in next door. He becomes Erin's
romantic interest, and surrogate parent to her children when she
begins to neglect them because of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts simply has never been better as she glares and swears
her way through the movie, an R-rated Frank Capra heroine with
pinpoint accuracy in cutting down to size anyone who needs cutting.
She could serve as patron saint for everyone who has ever belatedly
thought of a great retort and wished they could go back in time to
deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   Finney is fine in his usual gruff teddy-bear mode, and there's
solid support from Eckhart, and Marg Helgenberger and Cherry Jones
as two of the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh wisely keeps the courtroom scenes to a minimum. This
is Erin's story, and the movie focuses on her dogged research, her
empathy with the victims, the toll the case takes on her family and
the esteem she gains as events unfold.
</P>
<P>
   ''I walk into a room and everybody shuts up to see if I've got
something to say,'' Erin proudly says. ''I've never had that
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Slick as the movie is, questions of credibility arise. Erin
Brockovich is not your typical trailer-trash mom. How could a woman
so willful, intelligent, attractive and self-possessed fail so
miserably -- then abruptly spring full-blown to skewer the pricey
legal windbags of a major utility?
</P>
<P>
   The movie tries to give glimpses of Erin's early expectations
and how she failed to live up to them. Lamenting the pocket change
in her checking account, she wistfully recalls her days as a beauty
queen in Wichita and how she dreamed of doing ''something important
with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a half-hearted effort to explain away Erin's dire straits.
As played by Roberts, Erin Brockovich had the goods all along, and
it's a stretch to think she couldn't have pulled herself up by her
bootstraps, even a little bit, beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   At its core, though, ''Erin Brockovich'' is a fairy tale, with
Roberts as a foul-mouthed Sleeping Beauty. Movie-goers will have
great fun watching her awake.
</P>
<P>
   ''Erin Brockovich'' is distributed by Universal and rated R for
deliciously vulgar dialogue.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is up 21 points
in today's early going. Advancing and declining issues are evenly
split on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is ahead 90 points and the Standard &AMP;

   Wall Street appears to be in modest recovery mode today after a

   The Dow recovered to finish slightly higher but the Nasdaq still
posted its fourth-worst point drop ever.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 82; Dow Gains 19  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mostly higher in early trading on
Wall Street on Tuesday as technology shares bounced back from their
single-day decline and financial stocks led blue-chip issues
higher.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average
was up 19.46 at 9,966.59.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 82.12 at 4,989.36, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 5.50 at 1,389.12.
</P>
<P>
   After sending technology stocks down sharply on Monday,
investors returned to buy shares of the companies that have led the
market all year. Oracle rose 3} to 82{, Applied Materials rose 2[
to 190 1/16 and Biogen rose 3[ to 83\.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which lists most of the world's leading technology
companies, tumbled 141 points on Monday as investors collected
profits from the sector's continuing rally. The Nasdaq is up more
than 21 percent since the start of 2000, while the Dow and the
broader S&AMP;P 500 are down for the year to date.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, investors have determined that technology
companies, with their rapid growth, are best prepared to thrive if
the Federal Reserve continues raising interest rates this year. The
Fed has raised interest rates four times since June in an effort to
slow the economy to a more sustainable pace.
</P>
<P>
   The latest evidence that higher rates haven't yet slowed the
economy came today from the Commerce Department, which reported
that retail sales rose by 1.1 percent in February. With Americans
continuing to spend freely, feeding the surging economy, many
analysts expect the Fed will raise rates again when they meet next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Higher rates can be bad for financial stocks, but today, those
issues led the Dow's advance. J.P. Morgan rose 1 3/16 to 113 3/16
after saying Monday that business has been robust in the first two
months of the year. American Express rose 1 11/16 to 128\.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 169.44 million
shares, ahead of Monday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 9.11 to 599.25.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.3 percent,
narrowing its losses from Monday, when it fell 2.8 percent on the
news that the nation's gross domestic product declined for a second
consecutive quarter. The report, which meant Japan's economy is
officially back in recession, unsettled markets around the world on
Monday and contributed to weakness on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.6 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Giant Steam Locomotive Gets Jazzy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The star of an arctic jazz concert premiere
this week is really big. Enormous, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   At 130 tons and 72 feet long, the steam locomotive Svarta
Bjoern, which means Black Bear, has to be the biggest performer
ever to hit the annual winter festival in Narvik, a township of
18,000 people about 145 miles north of the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   The 81-year-old locomotive's steam hisses, rattling and other
noises are the basis for Thursday's premiere of ''Steam
(loco2trip),'' a jazz work composed for orchestra and steam engine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who has ever been aboard a steam train knows all of the
strange and wonderful sounds that really lend themselves to
music,'' Steingrim Sneve of Narvik's Winter Festival Week said.
</P>
<P>
   The work was composed by three Norwegian jazz musicians, Joern
Oien, Boerge Peterson-Oeverleir and Svein Schultz, for events
leading up to Narvik's 100th anniversary in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   A rail theme was fitting since Narvik claims to have the world's
northernmost railroad.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 people are expected to crowd around Svarta Bjoern and
its human accompanists in Old Locomotive Hall No. 1, which was
built in 1902.
</P>
<P>
   But organizers don't trust Svarta Bjoern as a live performer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We couldn't really stoke up a steam engine in a hall full of
people. We cheated a little,'' said Sneve by telephone. ''We taped
it, but Svarta Bjorn will be the center of performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The locomotive will be accompanied by guitar, drums, trumpet and
keyboard.

<HEADLINE> Controversial Dr. Laura Heads for TV  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Enmeshed in a bitter battle with gay rights
activists, radio talk show host Laura Schlessinger is about to find
out whether the show biz adage about any publicity being good
publicity is really true.
</P>
<P>
   The tough-talking ''Dr. Laura,'' who dispenses relationship
advice on her enormously popular radio show, is being criticized
for calling homosexuality a ''biological error'' and ''deviant.''
</P>
<P>
   Gays and lesbians upset about her comments have targeted the
''Dr. Laura'' television show that begins this fall. The anti-Laura
campaign is aimed at convincing her syndicators, Paramount, not to
distribute the TV show and stations not to broadcast it.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the television business suspect the effort may backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, I don't think it has had any effect except to
make the general public aware that she is doing a television talk
show, which they might not have been ... if this hadn't been in the
headlines,'' said Bill Carroll, an expert on TV syndication for the
Katz Television Group.
</P>
<P>
   So far, none of the stations signed on to air ''Dr. Laura'' have
backed out. Paramount has also stood firm. But the campaign is
continuing despite Schlessinger's attempt to put out the fire with
an apology issued late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger has said she doesn't hate gays, but that homosexual
activity runs counter to her religious beliefs. She supports the
idea of therapy for gays who want to change their sexual
orientation, an insulting concept for many homosexuals who believe
that would be like trying to change nature.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Klein, a spokesman for the Web site, www.stopdrlaura.com,
calls Schlessinger a homophobe and believes her remarks breed
intolerance. A double standard protects her at a time baseball star
John Rocker is widely condemned for racially and ethnically
insensitive remarks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're seeing is this idea that homophobia and anti-gay
bigotry is somehow less important than racism and other kinds of
bigotry,'' Klein said, ''and that's not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger has lashed out at her critics, likening their
threats to terrorism. ''This guy Alan Klein and his Web site, this
is fascism,'' she said on her radio show. ''My mother grew up under
fascism, so I know something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement issued Friday, Schlessinger said she's
sorry that words she used in a clinical context have hurt people.
She said she did not want others to use her words to disparage
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Klein called the apology ''hollow and half-hearted'' and said it
was ''a last-ditch attempt to save a multimillion-dollar
syndication deal'' by her and Paramount. He said a protest rally
scheduled for March 21 outside the gates of Paramount's
headquarters is still on.
</P>
<P>
   Some gay rights activists who don't like Schlessinger also don't
like the campaign against her show.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one thing to protest, to raise voices,'' said Bill Dobbs,
member of the organization Queer Watch. ''It's another thing to
call for her show to be knocked off the air before it is even
broadcast. Too many gay and lesbian people have been silenced over
the years to use that tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   KPIX-TV in San Francisco, which plans to run ''Dr. Laura,'' has
been deluged by calls and e-mails urging it to back out. The
station is keeping a close watch on the situation, said Jerry
Eaton, vice president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been talking to Paramount a lot about the show,'' Eaton
said. ''We're not going to support a show that denigrates any
individual or espouses hate or intolerance. We're seeking their
assurances that the show is not going to have those elements.''
</P>
<P>
   Paramount executives aren't speaking publicly beyond issuing two
prepared statements. They haven't even said much about the show's
format, and how close it will be to what Schlessinger does on the
radio.
</P>
<P>
   One person who watches Paramount closely has an idea about what
its executives are thinking these days.
</P>
<P>
   ''In many respects, controversy is a positive,'' said Richard
Kurlander, a specialist on the syndication market for the ad firm
Petry Television. ''I'm sure Paramount -- if they would admit to it,
and I'm sure they won't -- would rather have this controversy take
place in September.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when ''Dr. Laura'' is scheduled to debut on stations seen
by more than 90 percent of the nation's television viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The market for new syndicated talk shows is tough right now --
the last clear hit was ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' four years ago
-- but ''Dr. Laura'' may have a better shot than most.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount did an effective job of getting out early and selling
the show to stations, Kurlander said. It's on CBS affiliates in
several big cities, which is a plus since CBS has been the
top-rated network in daytime for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   The competition also appears to be thinning out; experts
anticipate talk shows by Roseanne, Martin Short, Leeza Gibbons and
Joy Browne not to be back in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Working against Schlessinger is the format's relative weakness.
Daytime chat ratings have been down over the past couple of years,
with courtroom shows like ''Judge Judy'' the hot format.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she has a legitimate shot,'' Kurlander said. ''I don't
think it's a sure bet by any stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   If the show's chances are somehow enhanced by a campaign aimed
at stopping it, well, Klein can live with that.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always a risk,'' he said. ''But the converse is
completely unacceptable and that is to not speak up. A community
that is silent loses its power.''

<HEADLINE> Impasse over, land claim negotiations to resume  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Confusion led to a breakdown in
negotiations in the Oneida Indian Nation land claim. Now that the
confusion is cleared up, a court-appointed mediator said a
settlement could be just around the corner in the decades-old
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Settlement Master Ronald Riccio said Tuesday the parties were
''90 percent of the way home'' and could reach a settlement within
weeks once they return to the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of the extraneous issues that were sidetracking us are
off the table. What's left are only the issues germane to the land
claim,'' said Riccio, a Seton Hall University law professor
assigned last year to mediate the 26-year-old dispute.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn called an impasse in
negotiations on Friday after state officials refused to sign a
letter to extend the talks until April 30. It appeared that the
claim was headed back to court for what promised to be years and
years of legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Riccio said the state's refusal resulted from confusion about
the stipulation letter. Riccio spent Monday on the telephone and
resolved the misunderstanding, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hated to see it fall apart on a mistake,'' Riccio said. ''If
we can't agree on an issue, and it falls apart, that's one thing.
But it shouldn't fall apart based on confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Settlement talks over the past year under Riccio's guidance have
produced significant progress, according to the parties involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a huge disappointment to see all that hard work go down
the drain,'' said Madison County Supervisor Harry Hatton, chairman
of the county's Native American Affairs committee. ''We are so
close to a settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue was a lawsuit filed in 1995 by the state against the
Oneidas over slot-like video gaming machines at the nation's
Turning Stone casino in Verona.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared Friday to state officials that the extension
agreement would have required them to drop the lawsuit, something
they were unwilling to do, said Mike McKeon, a spokesman for Gov.
George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was reworded to make it clear the lawsuit was not
being dropped. With that, the state was willing to return to
negotiations, McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   Once all the parties have signed the stipulation letter, McCurn
must give it his final approval before negotiations can resume.
McCurn is spending the month as a visiting judge in Florida but
will act on the letter immediately, Riccio said.
</P>
<P>
   The land claim stems from the state's purchase of 250,000 acres
from the Oneidas in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The
U.S. Supreme Court found in 1985 that the land was seized in
illegal transactions and ruled the Oneidas were entitled to
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the federal government sided with the Oneidas and filed
an amended complaint asking that 20,000 landowners in Madison and
Oneida counties be added as defendants. McCurn postponed a decision
on that motion while negotiations are pending.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the issues on which the Oneida Nation and the counties
have come to general agreement include: a cap on the amount of land
the Oneidas will purchase in the two counties; some type of
reimbursement to local governments for losing property and sales
tax revenues to the Oneidas; and the issue of sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, NRA Hold Firm on Guns  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House today labeled as sad and
shameful a National Rifle Association leader's accusation that
President Clinton is ''willing to accept a certain level of killing
to further his political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd have to agree with The New York Times this morning, that
called it desperate rhetoric,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said on NBC's ''Today.'' ''I think it is sad but it's also
shameful. The NRA desperately doesn't want to have the real debate
we should be having in this country about whether we can keep our
kids safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne LaPierre, the NRA executive vice president, who made the
accusation, did not back away from the words in an NBC interview
today. But he twice refused to repeat them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the fact is the president would rather make NRA
rhetoric the issue rather than his own policies,'' LaPierre said.
''The truth is, of the 500,000 cases the president brags about
where they stopped felons trying to buy guns under the instant
check, which NRA supports, he's prosecuted only a handful.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart responded that enforcement is up 16 percent during
Clinton's presidency, and ''on all levels, state, local, where most
of the enforcements happen, it's up 25 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Crime is down. We've put more cops on the street. We've tried
to take guns off the street. The NRA has stood in our way at every
step,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the president's spokesman criticized Texas Gov. George W.
Bush for declining Monday to denounce LaPierre's remarks, saying
the likely Republican presidential nominee should have considered
it part of his duty as a political leader to speak out against
''outrageous statements.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The way I saw it was the governor saying that both sides
should stop calling each other names,'' Lockhart said. ''That,
certainly, I didn't see as a repudiation. This gentleman has made a
statement and it's gone unchallenged, as far as I can tell, by the
governor and others.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre said in a televised interview Sunday that ''President
Clinton is willing to accept a certain level of killing to further
is political agenda, and his vice president, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty hard to take,'' Clinton told a Democratic crowd
during a political fund-raising speech Monday night in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   As he did earlier during two appearances in Cleveland, Clinton
repeated LaPierre's comment in a soft, almost incredulous tone. ''I
didn't like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth seemed sure to continue, as the White House
tries to train an unflattering light on the NRA and its mostly
Republican backers in Congress as Vice President Al Gore campaigns
to replace Clinton and Democrats hope to regain a majority in the
House in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not trying to pick a fight with anybody,'' Clinton said
Monday night. ''I'm just trying to keep more people alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has issued a challenge to Congress to pass what he calls
''commonsense gun control'' before the April 20 anniversary of the
Columbine High School shootings in Colorado, although his plan
failed in Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to impose background checks on sales at gun shows that
could take as long as 72 hours. Many congressional Republicans,
like the NRA, want any such checks to be instant or at least no
longer than 24 hours. Clinton also wants trigger locks to be
required on new guns and a ban on the import of large-capacity
ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the face of Columbine and the shooting death of a
6-year-old by a first-grade classmate, Clinton said, the NRA is set
in its opposition.
</P>
<P>
   	   ''I want you to see what we're up against whenever we try to
change here,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre held his ground on Monday. He said it is Clinton who
owes the parents of children killed by guns an explanation of why
federal gun laws are being so poorly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he should look them in the eye and explain why he
won't enforce the laws against crack dealers with guns and take
them off the street,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   What began the exchange Sunday is a new campaign in which NRA
President Charlton Heston implies in television ads that Clinton
lied when he characterized the NRA as stubbornly resistant to
reasonable gun-control laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''When what you say is wrong, that's a mistake,'' Heston says in
several of them. ''When you know it's wrong, that's a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Clinton noted that when he was governor of
Arkansas the NRA once gave him a lifetime membership, and that he
had a productive partnership with the gun group to promote safety
for young hunters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's been revoked now,'' he joked.

<HEADLINE> 25 years later, Skakel arrainged in Moxley case  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- After nearly 25 years, reading the murder
charge against a nephew of the late U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy
will likely take only a few moments.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Skakel, now 39, was to be arraigned Tuesday afternoon as
a juvenile in the 1975 slaying of a 15-year-old neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel was 15 on the October 1975 night Martha Moxley was
bludgeoned to death with a golf club traced to a Skakel family set.
He denies any involvement in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeding -- being held in a Superior Court courtroom to
accommodate a crush of media and family -- is expected to last just
a few minutes. The charge will be read and Skakel advised of his
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Michael Sherman said it was unclear whether
Skakel would be asked to enter a plea. Sherman said he expected
state prosecutors to ask that the case be transferred to adult
court, which would require a hearing at a later date and would
probably delay any plea.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and members of Skakel's high-profile family were
expected to attend the arraignment. About 75 news organizations
requested seats in the courtroom, but because of limited space only
about 30 reporters were given spots.
</P>
<P>
   Martha's older brother, John, and her mother, Dorthy, said they
also planned to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I never had to see him, it would be fine with me,'' said
John Moxley, who was 17 when his sister was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't need to look him in the eye,'' he said. ''I'm going
(to the arraignment) for my own peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Skakel is the son of Rushton Skakel Sr., who is the
brother of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel.
</P>
<P>
   Moxley's case was reopened after more than two decades when an
investigative grand jury was appointed in June 1998. The
appointment followed the publication of books about the case,
including one by former Los Angeles police Detective Mark Fuhrman.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman, who gained notoriety during the O.J. Simpson trial for
racist remarks, has been hired by ABC to provide commentary on the
case.
</P>
<P>
   He identified Michael Skakel as the likely killer in his book.
Prosecutors deny that Fuhrman's book had any influence on their
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Because of confidentiality laws surrounding juvenile cases,
Skakel's arraignment would normally be closed to the public. But
Judge Maureen Dennis, acting on a request from five newspapers and
The Associated Press, last week agreed to open the proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis found that Skakel had already effectively waived his
juvenile confidentiality rights, both because he is an adult and
because his name and the charges against him are already
well-known.
</P>
<P>
   Although the grand jury proceedings were closed to the public,
prosecutors have said in court documents that they were told by
former students at a private school in Poland Spring, Maine, that
Skakel made ''admissions as to the murder of Martha Moxley'' while
a student there from 1978 to 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel was arrested in January after Judge George Thim -- acting
as a one-man grand jury -- ruled there was enough evidence to charge
him.

<HEADLINE> Peru TV Has 'Anything for Money'  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- For $20, two women stripped to their underwear
in front of television cameras, then had buckets of slime-covered
toads poured over their bodies to the hoots and whistles of the
studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   For $20, three men raced to gobble down bowls of large,
twitching, maggot-like tree grubs from the Amazon jungle.
</P>
<P>
   For $30, a woman licked the armpits and toes of a sweaty body
builder who had not bathed for two days.
</P>
<P>
   And some people think 50 women vying for a rich husband is a
sick idea for a TV show.
</P>
<P>
   The gross antics were part of ''Laura en America,'' a talk show
that gets great ratings in Peru but enrages critics. This episode,
''Anything for Money,'' aired late last year and has galvanized an
alliance of feminist groups and human rights organizations in a
drive to pull the plug on the program.
</P>
<P>
   Host Laura Bozzo is Peru's highest rated TV talk-show host. She
reigns as the most visible celebrity in a growing lineup of seamy
''reality-based'' tabloid TV shows that are becoming the norm for
Peruvian programming. U.S. television also is experimenting with
more ''reality-based'' shows, including Fox's recent ''Who Wants to
Marry a Multimillionaire,'' which the network said later had gone
over the line.
</P>
<P>
   Wilfredo Ardito, an attorney with Peru's Legal Defense
Institute, a human rights group, says Bozzo's show exploits the
poor Peruvians who appear on it and are her biggest fans. Critics
say the show's ''real life'' depictions of incest, infidelity, teen
pregnancy and prostitution are staged -- charges that Bozzo denies.
</P>
<P>
   Bozzo, a lawyer, insists her show portrays real people's real
problems. She says guests leave with concrete solutions, and are
provided legal, medical and psychological assistance long after
revealing the tragedy of their personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish-speakers in the United States can judge for themselves.
''Laura en America'' (Laura on the America Channel) has been picked
up by the Miami-based Telemundo Spanish-language network. Since
mid-January, it can be seen in 63 cities by an estimated 85 percent
of U.S. Hispanic viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's official human rights advocate has urged President
Alberto Fujimori's government to stop bankrolling Bozzo's show with
public service ads.
</P>
<P>
   Bozzo offers no apology -- although she says she does regret the
''Anything for Money'' episode -- and claims her critics are
politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ''The segment of the Peruvian press that is opposed to the
government wants to put me on the cross because I support the
president,'' Bozzo says.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's foes say the government is happy to support Bozzo's
show because it has a direct line to the poor majority that is
considered critical to his bid for an unprecedented -- many say
illegal -- third term in an election next month.
</P>
<P>
   Performing humiliating, dehumanizing tasks for a few dollars
loses its entertainment value when the participants desperately
need the cash, Ardito says. Moreover, Bozzo regularly berates,
lectures and insults her panelists for their moral lapses, and
frequently threatens to pursue legal charges against them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are people who, because of their poverty and lack of
opportunities, believe she can help,'' Ardito says.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my home we have a maid whose sister-in-law went with her
son who has epilepsy. They were told, 'That is not the theme of the
day. You have to say you hate your father, and that guy over there
will be your father.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors abound that the show's producers will pay for a
compelling, albeit fabricated, story of sleazy woe.
</P>
<P>
   Bozzo rejects such accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the public has an immense affectionate love for me, it is
because they know I do not lie and that my job would not require me
to,'' she says between puffs of a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Then she instructs the photographer: ''Please, no photos while
I'm smoking.''

<HEADLINE> Tribune Takeover Ends Newsroom Test  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL WHITE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When Mark Willes arrived to lead Times Mirror
Co. five years ago, he dissected its newspaper holdings with the
eye of an industry outsider.
</P>
<P>
   One way to boost sagging profits: Shatter the traditional
barrier between editorial and business employees and create
sections targeting specific audiences that, in turn, would attract
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Times Mirror's sale to the Tribune Co. on Monday in a $6.3
billion deal seems to have ended Willes' experiment, which critics
assailed as an attack on journalistic integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Willes, a former General Mills executive with no previous
journalism experience, said he wasn't told of the buyout talks
until two weeks ago and will leave once the deal is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Otis Chandler, the former publisher who led the Los Angeles
Times from 1960 to 1980 and was a critic of Willes, said he didn't
know about the deal until late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of all the people, of all the media companies that Times
Mirror could join, this is the most logical and probably the best
company,'' Chandler said in an interview published in today's
editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't surprised by the announcement because I was not happy
with current management of the Times and Times Mirror,'' he said,
''and my assumption was the board of directors and the family
weren't happy either, and under those circumstances, to move
forward in this megamerger world, one has to consider merging.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's sister, Camilla Chandler Frost, one of seven trustees
of the two family trusts that control about 65 percent of the Times
Mirror stock, confirmed that she did not tell her brother about the
deal until Monday. ''We were told that if anyone found out, it
would be a deal-breaker,'' she told the Times.
</P>
<P>
   Both The Wall Street Journal and the Chicago Tribune reported
today that Willes had been approached by Tribune Co. officials
about a possible merger last year, though nothing resulted from the
initial discussions. Tribune Co. officials later went directly to
the Chandler family.
</P>
<P>
   Willes didn't return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees, although uncertain about their future, said the
sale might end up benefiting the Times because it transfers
ownership to a company with a long history in newspaper publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ''They know a solid newspaper company will be in charge of the
newspaper again,'' said Brett Levy, who works in the Times'
information technology department.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will create a coast-to-coast media empire encompassing
the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, New York's Newsday, The Sun
of Baltimore, 22 TV stations, Internet news sites and magazines
such as Popular Science, Golf and Field &AMP; Stream.
</P>
<P>
   After sending Times Mirror shares soaring almost 79 percent
Monday, investors today bid up the stock an additional $2.62{, or 3
percent, to $88.25 by early afternoon on the New York Stock
Exchange. The Tribune Co., which tumbled 17 percent on Monday, was
up 8 percent, rising $2.50 to $33.31\ a share.
</P>
<P>
   With the acquisition, the Tribune Co. would become the nation's
third-largest newspaper company with total daily circulation of 3.6
million. Only Gannett Co. Inc., which publishes USA Today, and
Knight Ridder would be larger.
</P>
<P>
   Times Mirror hired Willes in 1995 to boost the company's lagging
profits and share price. His policies apparently resulted in a
major embarrassment for the Los Angeles Times when the newspaper
shared revenue with the new Staples Center from a special issue of
the Times' magazine devoted to the sports arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Times survived as a pretty good newspaper despite him,''
said Edwin Guthman, a journalism professor at the University of
Southern California and a former national editor of the Times.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the criticism, Willes was not the only newspaper
executive to experiment with such newsroom cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Other papers around the nation are trying similar approaches but
do so outside the glare of public scrutiny, said Bill Boyd, a
faculty member at the Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg, Fla., a
journalism education center and think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact it didn't work out for him doesn't mean it can't
work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Boyd said, today's newsroom debate focuses
more on how different media outlets owned by the same company --
such as newspapers, television stations and Internet sites -- will
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suspect there will be more emphasis in breaking down those
walls, the walls between media, than on the walls between
departments,'' Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune Co. executives said they don't expect layoffs at Times
Mirror properties and had no current plans to reduce the foreign
staffs of the various newspapers, some of which will overlap.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they said the sale would help the company remain
profitable. Analysts say media companies that offer a wide range of
outlets -- including newspapers, magazines, the Internet, TV, cable
and radio -- will have the best chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about being better positioned to compete in a
fragmenting media world,'' said Dennis J. FitzSimons, Tribune Co.
executive vice president.

<HEADLINE> Grocery Shoppers Use Self-Scanners  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Never mind the paper-or-plastic debate. Here's
the new question at grocery stores: Man or machine?
</P>
<P>
   Self-serve checkout systems -- you scan it, you bag it, you pay
for it -- are popping up at groceries nationwide. Kroger has U-Scan
Express machines in more than 200 stores. Harris Teeter,
Winn-Dixie, Wal-Mart and smaller grocery chains all have
experimented with the systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very easy,'' said Laura Walker of Atlanta, who uses a
Kroger self-checker around four times a week. ''The lines are
shorter, and you can just run through.''
</P>
<P>
   From his post behind a computer screen at a Kroger in midtown
Atlanta, Alfonso Jeffery monitors four U-Scan Express machines --
touch-screen terminals with a soothing female voice that guides
shoppers through checkout.
</P>
<P>
   She's even polite: ''Thank you for shopping at Kroger,'' she
coos.
</P>
<P>
   Self-scanning is efficient and popular, grocers say. But even in
an ATM-driven, pay-at-the-pump society, some shoppers have trouble
adapting to new technology, as Jeffery can attest.
</P>
<P>
   At one terminal, a man throws up his hands, furious that U-Scan
won't recognize his ground beef. At another, a woman shakes her
fist at the screen after being shortchanged 5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers try to scan their own booze or cigarettes, but U-Scan
will have none of it. The voice firmly asks them to show
identification to the clerk on duty.
</P>
<P>
   Others try to sneak an item into their bag without passing it
over the scanner. No dice: U-Scan compares the total weight of your
bag with the items that have been scanned, alerting a cashier when
there is a discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't sneak anything by it,'' Jeffery said
</P>
<P>
   The systems, introduced by Montreal-based Optimal Robotics Corp.
in 1995, have grown incredibly popular in the past 18 months, the
company reports.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues for Optimal Robotics shot up 427 percent last year, to
$29.6 million. And the company's stock, which was trading for less
than $10 on the Nasdaq exchange a year ago, was trading around $35
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Kroger has received an overwhelmingly positive response
from customers, said company spokeswoman Susie Brower. ''They love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati-based company ''definitely'' plans to expand the
service, particularly because it helps cut staffing needs during
the current tight labor market, Brower said. One cashier can
oversee four checkout lanes.
</P>
<P>
   The new scanners aren't for everybody, said Stephen
Doheny-Farina, a professor at Clarkston University in Potsdam,
N.Y., who studies how new technology changes communities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gadget freaks jump to it. They're intrigued by it,'' he
sad. ''But you end up with people who will just never do it. My
mother still will not pump her own gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, grocers say: The human cashier is far from
obsolete. Too many shoppers prefer a friendly face to a computer
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of them have been shopping here for years. They're used
to the conversation,'' cashier Terrell Thompson said. ''It took a
while to get used to not having a person talking to them while they
scanned their groceries.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson far prefers working as a traditional cashier to
monitoring the self-checkers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can talk to them,'' he said. ''They can feel a sense of
warmth instead of'' -- he frowns and gestures to the machines --
''Her.''
</P>
<P>
   The cashiers have even given her a name: Miss Kroger.
</P>
<P>
   That voice guides customers through checkout by giving them
touch-screen prompts.
</P>
<P>
   Any coupons? The system scans those, too. Paying by cash,
credit, debit? U-Scan accepts bills and coins like soft-drink
vending machines do, and its card swipers are just like the ones at
the end of most regular checkout lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Tricky produce? The machines automatically weigh fruits and
vegetables, assigning prices when customers punch in code numbers
for each food type.
</P>
<P>
   But Miss Kroger isn't perfect: In Lexington, Ky., a U-Scan
system rejected redesigned $20 bills.
</P>
<P>
   Cashiers assigned to watch the systems can clear up most
problems by touching prompts on their own screen. And there's one
important thing the voice can't do, cashiers say.
</P>
<P>
   ''She can't say goodbye,'' Thompson said. ''She can't say, 'Have
a good day.' She can't talk to the little babies.''
</P>
<P>
   That's no problem for some shoppers. They say the self-scan
machines save time, hassle and mindless chatter. At the midtown
Atlanta Kroger, a pilot store for U-Scan in metro Atlanta, up to
800 customers a day scan their own groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Most self-scanners are designed to handle customers who use
express lanes, carrying 15 or fewer items. But Optimal Robotics
spokeswoman Robin Jaffe said the company soon will roll out a
U-Scan model designed for six to eight bags.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Katz, who was buying a box of Lucky Charms for her
4-year-old son Ian, said she realizes she's missing out on
old-fashioned interaction between clerks and customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do recognize some of the cashiers,'' she said, ''but it's
just not like a neighborhood grocery store anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Mixed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices turned mixed on Wall Street on Tuesday as
biotechnology stocks pulled the Nasdaq composite index lower and
Dow stocks wavered in response to a big acquisition by Alcoa.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
4.96 at 9,947.13.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower after surrendering early
gains. The Nasdaq composite index was down 45.04 at 4,862.20, and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 1.64 at 1,381.98.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech stocks, particularly the shares of companies involved in
genetic mapping, brought the Nasdaq lower after the United States
and Britain agreed to openly share data from a project to decode
the human genetic pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement halts several companies' plans to sell genetic
data to drugmakers and researchers. Incyte Pharmaceuticals fell 49\
to 147}, and Human Genome Sciences fell 21 1/16 to 131{. PE Corp.'s
Celera Genomics fell 48 1/16 to 140 15/16 on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness in biotech stocks hampered the Nasdaq's efforts to
rebound from Monday's selloff, when the index dropped 141 points as
investors collected profits from the sector's continuing rally. The
Nasdaq is up more than 21 percent since the start of 2000, while
the Dow and the broader S&AMP;P 500 are down for the year to date.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get something that's gone up to that extent, you're
going to get violent shakeouts,'' said Don Selkin, chief investment
strategist at Joseph Gunnar in New York. ''This year, people are
going to have to get used to the volatility.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were not significantly affected by the latest evidence
that the economy continues to grow rapidly. The Commerce Department
reported today that retail sales rose by 1.1 percent in February.
With Americans continuing to spend freely, feeding the surging
economy, many analysts expect the Federal Reserve will raise
interest rates when they meet next week.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Vitner, economist at First Union Securities, noted that the
retail sales report is less crucial to the Fed than a pair of
reports due out later this week: the Producer Price Index and the
Consumer Price Index. Both are considered barometers of
inflationary pressures in the robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key for the Fed is still the inflation data,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A rate increase at the Fed's March 21 meeting would be the fifth
since last June. Higher rates tend to be particularly damaging to
financial stocks, but today, those issues led the Dow's advance.
J.P. Morgan rose 1 3/16 to 113 3/16 after saying Monday that
business has been robust in the first two months of the year.
American Express rose 4 7/16 to 131.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa outweighed the strength in the financial sector, tumbling
5 11/16 to 62]. The steel company agreed to buy Cordant
Technologies Inc., a major supplier of aluminum airplane parts and
solid-fuel rockets, for $2.3 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Cordant shares were up 25 13/16 to 55].
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 749.27 million
shares, ahead of Monday's moderate pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.33 to 583.81.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.3 percent,
narrowing its losses from Monday, when it fell 2.8 percent on the
news that the nation's gross domestic product declined for a second
consecutive quarter. The report, which meant Japan's economy is
officially back in recession, unsettled markets around the world on
Monday and contributed to weakness on Wall Street.

<HEADLINE> EU Panel Rejects Volvo-Scania Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- The European Commission on Tuesday
rejected Volvo's planned $6.9 billion merger with rival Swedish
truck and bus maker Scania as anticompetitive.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which is the executive arm of the 15-member
European Union, said the merger ''would have caused serious
competition concerns by creating dominant positions'' in several
sectors, including the heavy truck and bus markets in Sweden,
Denmark, Norway, Finland and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The commission ruled that a combined market share, which it
estimated would range from 50 percent to 90 percent, would raise
barriers to entry or expansion in those markets.
</P>
<P>
   ''The merger would therefore significantly change the market
structure to the detriment of the customers,'' the commission's
decision said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger, announced in August, would have created the
world's second-largest truck and bus maker, behind DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo, which is based in Goteborg, had lobbied hard for
approval, offering to open its extensive truck retail and service
network to competition and to reduce its market share. But the
commission rejected the concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo's chief executive, Leif Johansson, expressed regret over
the decision, saying it seemed ''to go against the basic concept of
the common market.''
</P>
<P>
   Volvo currently holds 45.5 percent of Scania and will retain its
stake for now, according to a statement issued before the
commission made its decision public.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will now follow the continuing developments, but in the
short term we foresee no need to divest our shares in Scania,''
Johansson said.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies will pursue other forms of cooperation, Volvo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Scania's managing director, Leif Oestling, said he was not happy
it took the commission so long to reach a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty, he said, ''influenced Scania and our sales
organization negatively.'' But he added that there was ''no serious
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Volvo, which had a net income last year of $3.74 billion, has
about 52,500 employees worldwide and Scania 23,500.

<HEADLINE> 'The Big Bang' Is Funny, Camp  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two men, Jed Feuer and Boyd Graham, have taken
their considerable talents and used them for total fun in ''The Big
Bang.''
</P>
<P>
   The campy, satirical musical show, running at the off-Broadway
Douglas Fairbanks Theater, has something in common with an
improvised-looking college show that happily flails about at
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is that the middle-aged Feuer and Graham, in a
borrowed New York apartment, are putting on an audition for
potential backers of a Broadway musical about the history of
civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer and Graham, veterans of cabaret and off-Broadway musicals,
have collaborated before. For ''The Big Bang,'' Feuer wrote the
music and Graham the lyrics. Graham also directed.
</P>
<P>
   The two sing the songs and do constant costume changes,
including taking down window drapes to wrap around themselves as
Caesar and a soothsayer. The show opens in the Garden of Eden, with
the duo singing the funny ''Free Food and Frontal Nudity'' to a
calypso beat played by pianist Albert Ahronheim. Then they switch
to Yiddish accents to build the pyramids before moving on to
ancient Rome, the Virgin Mary and Attila the Hun, whose lines are
sung by Graham in Sinatra style.
</P>
<P>
   The show manages to encompass Columbus, Napoleon and Josephine
the U.S. Civil War in its breakneck 90-minute romp through history.
It's seldom risque, but on occasion comes gleefully close to bad
taste, as in the portrayal of Eva Braun, Hitler's lover, singing
''For the longest time I thought his first name was Heil.''

<HEADLINE> U.S., U.K. To Share Genetic Data  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Britain today agreed to
openly share data from a groundbreaking project to decode the human
genetic pattern -- a study that could serve as the foundation for
developing new medical cures and preventions.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries said they would share raw fundamental data on
the human genome, including the human DNA sequence and its
variations, with scientists everywhere. A joint statement urged
private companies to follow the lead of government laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have shared data, while others have not. PE
Corp.'s Celera Genomics Corp., a private company that is competing
with government researchers, walked away from talks over
cooperation and patent opportunities last month.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and directors of the public-private Human Genome
Project denied that the timing of the announcement from President
Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair was intended to put
pressure on Celera or other private firms.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain and the leading partners in the
nonprofit Human Genome Project, which plans to publish a full
genetic map on the Internet by 2003. The information would be free
and available to all researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''To realize the full promise of this research, raw fundamental
data on the human genome, including the human DNA sequence and its
variations, should be made freely available to scientists
everywhere,'' Clinton and Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unencumbered access to this information will promote
discoveries that will reduce the burden of disease, improve health
around the world and enhance the quality of life for all
humankind,'' they said. ''Intellectual property protection for
gene-based inventions will also play an important role in
stimulating the development of important new health care
projects.''
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the sharing of
data would accelerate scientific advances.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, he said, the U.S. Patent Office has
decided that scientists cannot obtain patents for individual genes.
However, he said, ''If you develop a vaccine or something off of
the genetic data -- that will continue to have intellectual property
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted quickly to announcement of the agreement,
which puts the brakes on several companies' plans to sell genetic
data to drugmakers and researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Incyte Pharmaceuticals fell $49.25 to $147.75, and Human Genome
Sciences fell $21.06\ to $131.50. Celera fell $48.06\ to $140.93}
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Those reversals helped drag the Nasdaq index down by 80 points
in early afternoon trading.

<HEADLINE> Beaujolais Vintners Allow Machines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France (AP) -- Makers of famed Beaujolais wine, whose
grapes have been plucked laboriously by hand for centuries, have
decided to allow machines to do the picking for the first time
ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Union of Beaujolais Vintners has authorized automated
harvesting of the gamay grapes that go into the light, fruity wine,
although the famed Beaujolais Nouveau will continue to be made from
hand-picked grapes.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Monday, the group said the top 10 Beaujolais
grands crus -- Morgon, Saint-Amour, Chiroubles, Brouilly, Julienas,
Moulin a Vent, Regne, Chenas, Cote de Brouilly and Fleury -- will be
made from machine-harvested grapes.
</P>
<P>
   The group said the automated procedure would not affect the
delicate fragrance of these popular wines. The machines remove only
the grapes, leaving behind the stems and seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Beaujolais Nouveau grapes, which ferment for a shorter period of
time along with their stems and seeds, will continue to be
harvested by hand - as will vineyards on slopes too steep for
machines to climb.

   Retail Sales Surged in February
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans, unfazed by rising interest rates
and higher gasoline prices, snapped up cars, clothing and groceries
in February and caused retail sales to jump by 1.1 percent, the
Commerce Department reported today. Economists said this fresh
evidence of a strong economy justifies another interest rate boost
by the Federal Reserve next week to slow things down a bit and
prevent an outbreak of inflation. With plentiful jobs, low
inflation and rising incomes, Americans are feeling wealthy and in
the buying mood, economists said. Retail sales rose to a seasonally
adjusted $265.7 billion last month, the Commerce Department said.
The 1.1 percent jump in sales marked the biggest gain since
December and was slightly stronger than many analysts were
predicting.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration today unveiled its
new royalty collection system for oil taken from the Gulf of Mexico
and other federal lands, capping a long-running battle with oil
producers and congressional Republicans. The new royalty valuation
system, which Congress barred from taking effect for nearly two
years, will be implemented on June 1. At issue is a royalty
collection system that brought in $1.2 billion in 1998 for oil
taken from public lands and offshore tracts, mainly in the Gulf of
Mexico. The Interior Department's Minerals Management Service
estimates its new collection system will collect an extra $67
million annually.

   3 Japanese Banks Announce Merger
</P>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Three Japanese banks plan to combine, creating a $1
trillion institution that will be the second largest bank in Japan
and third largest in the world in terms of assets. The trio -- Sanwa
Bank Ltd., Tokai Bank Ltd. and Asahi Bank Ltd. -- plan to set up a
joint holding company in April 2001 and reorganize their retail,
wholesale, international and other operations. A number of
cooperative projects will begin before that, the banks said today.
The deal is the latest in a string of mergers as the Japanese
banking industry struggles to regain a competitive edge and
overcome billions of dollars in bad loans from a speculative
lending boom in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Utah-based Cordant soared on news of the merger, which values the
company at $57 a share, nearly double the stock's closing price
yesterday of $29.56\. Cordant shares were up $25.68} or 87 percent
at $55.25 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Alcoa's shares were off $5.68} at $62.37{, also on the NYSE. As

nation's second-biggest retailer behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc., will
promote AOL in its 858 large department stores. AOL, in turn, will
feature Sears on its Web sites and market the giant retail chain to
its more than 21 million subscribers. AOL will be Sears' preferred

   U.S. Plans Another $1B Debt Buyback
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury, brimming with cash, plans to buy
back another $1 billion of the national debt Thursday, the second
repurchase in a week. The Treasury Department said today that
Thursday's debt buyback operation will involve 11 outstanding
issues of 30-year bonds issued between May 1988 and November 1991.
The bonds carry coupon interest rates ranging from 7.875 percent to
9.125 percent. By buying back some of its older, higher-yielding
securities, the government over the long run expects to save money
on interest payments. On Thursday, the Treasury paid $1.345 billion
to repurchase $1 billion of debt, its first repurchase in 70 years.
That $1 billion is a tiny fraction of the $5.7 trillion national
debt.

   Boards Approve German Bank Merger
</P>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The merger of Deutsche Bank and
Dresdner Bank won approval from the boards of both companies today
even as bank workers rallied to protest plans for 16,000 layoffs.
Investors were also expressing reservations about the proposed
merger, which would create a leading global bank with $1.2 trillion
in assets. By selling off shares, they've drained about $3 billion
from the deal's value since it was announced last Thursday.
Originally weighing in at $30 billion, the deal dropped to $26.7
billion Tuesday because of a decline in Deutsche's share price.
Investors backed off mostly on fears that the two banks overlap in
too many areas to make the merger worthwhile.

<HEADLINE> GOP: Stem Tide of Asbestos Suits  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lester Skramstad was diagnosed with
asbestosis, a deadly lung disease, in 1995, 34 years after he quit
working at a Libby, Mont., mine that produced asbestos-tainted
vermiculite, a material used in insulation and construction.
</P>
<P>
   Since then his wife and two of his children have come down with
the disease, possibly from secondhand exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to kill me, I've accepted that,'' Skramstad, 63,
said at a recent Capitol Hill news conference. ''But I hope my wife
and children get their day in court. That's what the American
justice system is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Skramstad and the people of Libby, a town ravaged by
asbestos-related diseases, are the faces behind a debate raging in
Congress over efforts to streamline the claims process for hundreds
of thousands of asbestos victims.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are business groups and Republicans; on the other,
trial lawyers and Democrats. And the first battleground is the
House Judiciary Committee, where Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., is
pushing a bill this week to channel all asbestos claims through a
new Justice Department office that would establish medical
eligibility and encourage quick settlements.
</P>
<P>
   But not one Democrat on Hyde's committee has indicated support.
The committee's top Democrat, John Conyers of Michigan, calls it a
''mean-spirited'' attempt to ''literally shut the door on many who
will eventually die from what was often, in my judgment, reckless
if not intentional misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee action on the bill scheduled for Tuesday was delayed
as six states were holding primary elections, keeping lawmakers
away from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill point to the Supreme Court decision last
year that rejected a $1.5 billion asbestos settlement with
Fibreboard Corp. of Dallas. At issue was the huge size and unwieldy
nature of the class action pool, which ranged from the deathly sick
to those not yet suffering from health problems. Chief Justice
William Rehnquist said the situation ''cries out for a legislative
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed legislation, the new Justice Department
office would determine if a person is eligible for payment. The
defendant company would make a settlement offer, and the office
would propose its own figure. If the claimant was unhappy with the
offer, he could appeal to an administrative court for action within
90 days or to a state or federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition for Asbestos Resolution, the industry-backed group
lobbying for Hyde's bill, said more than 500,000 asbestos cases
have been filed in the past three decades and more than 200,000 are
still pending.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation will ''reduce today's overwhelming backlog'' and
''ensure that asbestos victims will receive cash in hand rather
than years in court,'' the coalition says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sick claimants are victimized twice, once by disease and once
by the legal system,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Middleton, president of the Association of Trial Lawyers
of America, has a counterargument: The Supreme Court was dealing
with outdated information and, after decades of precedent-setting
decisions, there's no longer a backlog in asbestos cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only is the bill not necessary, but we have Congress
attempting to invade the medical profession,'' Middleton said.
</P>
<P>
   The intent of the bill, Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook
wrote Hyde, ''would be to relieve corporations of their
responsibilities to fairly compensate workers injured by their
wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill defines eligible claimants as only those people who are
actually sick with asbestosis, lung cancer or other ailments
associated with inhaling asbestos, a fibrous mineral once commonly
used for insulation and fireproofing in goods and buildings. People
who show evidence, such as spots on the lung, but aren't yet ill
would not qualify for settlements, although they could be retested
in the future at government expense.
</P>
<P>
   ''The theme is to take care of the sick right away. The others
can come back again and again and again,'' said Hyde's chief of
staff, Thomas Mooney.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the medical criteria would reject many very sick
asbestos victims.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Sullivan, attorney for numerous Libby victims, said 78
percent of 125 clients, all with debilitating illnesses, would be
turned down by the proposed Office of Asbestos Compensation's
medical review board. He said Skramstad, who in 1997 settled with
the mining company W.R. Grace for $660,000, and his family would
all be denied compensation under the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will strongly oppose any such medical criteria that could
keep people who have clearly been injured from exercising their
legal rights,'' Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., wrote Hyde. Montana's
Republican Sen. Conrad Burns, facing criticism back home, withdrew
his name as a co-sponsor of the Senate version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Mooney disputed contentions that the Libby victims would be
excluded, saying the bill sets up an ''exceptional medical claims
panel'' for non-occupational victims and those who don't meet
traditional criteria. The American College of Chest Physicians and
the National Association of VA Physicians and Dentists have
endorsed the medical criteria.

<HEADLINE> Coke, Pepsi Juicing Up OJ Sales  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The soda wars have come to breakfast. PepsiCo
Inc. and the Coca-Cola Co. are using their marketing muscle to
revolutionize what used to be a basic beverage -- orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   Cans of frozen OJ are out. They've been replaced by an expanding
array of refrigerated varieties: With or without pulp. With or
without calcium. With or without extra vitamin C. And now,
variations like ''Orange Passion,'' ''Orange Banana,'' and ''Orange
Ruby Red with calcium.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by industry giants Tropicana, which PepsiCo acquired in
1998, and Minute Maid, a unit of Coca-Cola, sales of refrigerated
OJ have been soaring over the past two to three years, especially
the calcium-fortified and high-pulp varieties. Sales of frozen
concentrate are down 21 percent since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is ... no longer your grandmother's orange juice,'' said
John Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, an industry publication.
</P>
<P>
   Tropicana's Pure Premium orange juice last year became the
fourth largest-selling brand in the grocery business after
Coca-Cola Classic, Pepsi-Cola and Campbell's Soup. In 1993,
Tropicana was 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of refrigerated orange juice, which includes varieties
that are made from concentrate and those that aren't, rose 7
percent between 1997 and 1999 to 632 million gallons.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in the not-from-concentrate segment, Tropicana's
specialty, were up more than 28 percent over the same period to 287
million gallons, according to A.C. Nielsen supermarket data. The
growth in the calcium-fortified juices has been even more dramatic
-- their sales jumped 58 percent from 1998 to 1999 and now represent
20 percent of the refrigerated orange juice market.
</P>
<P>
   Consumption of orange juice overall rose from 5.3 gallons per
person in 1997 to 5.7 gallons last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I drink this stuff like it's water,'' said Cathy Kissel, 57,
of Falls Church, Va., as she surveyed the refrigerated juices in a
supermarket recently.
</P>
<P>
   There were 15 different varieties of Tropicana and Minute Maid
orange juice on display, including Tropicana's high-pulp,
calcium-fortified ''Grovestand'' and Minute Maid's pulp-free
''Orange Tangerine.'' At $3.39 to $3.49 a half gallon, the chilled
juice costs at least a third more than the frozen concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   Kissel is just the kind of consumer that the industry is
targeting -- aging baby boomers that are looking for extra calcium
and don't want to fuss with frozen concentrate. The 55-to
64-year-old age group is projected to grow by 25 percent over the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The baby boomer population is the biggest, wealthiest and now
the most self-care oriented part of the population,'' said Audrey
Rummele, a spokeswoman for Minute Maid, which first introduced
calcium-fortified orange juice in 1987. ''They're increasingly
looking for ways to take care of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Orange juice and broccoli top the list of foods that consumers
are trying to consume more often for disease prevention, ahead of
fish and spinach, according to a survey done in late 1998 by
HealthFocus Inc., which tracks consumer trends for the food
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The high-pulp juices, which are supposed to seem more like
fresh-squeezed OJ, also are supposed to appeal to the adults, as
well as the new varieties of grapefruit juice and orange-grapefruit
blends.
</P>
<P>
   Pulp-free juice and the new orange-tangerine blends, which are
sweeter than regular OJ, are aimed at kids.
</P>
<P>
   While it's good that people appear to be increasing their
calcium intake by drinking fortified juice, they still need
nutrients found in dairy products, said Cyndi Thompson, a nutrition
expert at the University of Arizona and a spokeswoman for the
American Dietetic Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''There may be a false sense of security that if I get my
vitamin C and calcium from orange juice I don't need to drink any
milk or eat other dairy products,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- ''American Beauty'' picked up another prize,
while Kevin Spacey was named best actor and Sam Mendes best
director at the Chicago Film Critics Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The most nominated film in this month's Oscar race, ''American
Beauty'' also led the pack at the British Academy Film and
Television Awards, with 14 nominations. Mendes also won the top
award from the Directors Guild of America over the weekend. And the
movie's screenwriter, Alan Ball, won a top honor from the Writers
Guild of America.
</P>
<P>
   The dark comedy continued its prize-winning ways Monday night,
one night after Spacey and Annette Bening won top acting nods from
the Screen Actors Guild.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Bentley, who played an intense, drug-dealing teen-ager in
the film, was named most promising actor. ''Boys Don't Cry'' scored
with a best actress award for Hilary Swank and a best supporting
actress prize for Chloe Sevigny.
</P>
<P>
   The critics gave Charlie Kaufman the best screenplay award for
''Being John Malkovich.''
</P>
<P>
   Best supporting actor went to Tom Cruise for ''Magnolia.''

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Mostly Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mostly lower on Wall Street today as
biotechnology stocks pulled the Nasdaq composite index lower and
blue chips wavered following a big acquisition announcement by
Alcoa.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
33.82 at 9,913.31. Alcoa, down 7 1/16 at 61, more than accounted
for the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower after surrendering early
gains. The Nasdaq composite was down 101.34 at 4,805.90, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 9.30 at 1,374.32.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech stocks, particularly the shares of companies involved in
genetic mapping, brought the Nasdaq lower after the United States
and Britain agreed to openly share data from a project to decode
the human genetic pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement halts several companies' plans to sell genetic
data to drugmakers and researchers. Incyte Pharmaceuticals fell 42
7/16 to 154 9/16, and Human Genome Sciences fell 14 9/16 to 138. PE
Corp.'s Celera Genomics fell 36| to 152] on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness in biotech stocks hampered the Nasdaq's efforts to
rebound from Monday's selloff, when the index dropped 141 points as
investors collected profits from the sector's continuing rally. The
Nasdaq is up more than 21 percent since the start of 2000, while
the Dow and the broader S&AMP;P 500 are down for the year to date.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get something that's gone up to that extent, you're
going to get violent shakeouts,'' said Don Selkin, chief investment
strategist at Joseph Gunnar in New York. ''This year, people are
going to have to get used to the volatility.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors were also continuing to take profits
from high-tech stocks. Apple Computer fell 5 7/16 to 115~ and 3Com
fell 8\ to 56 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were not significantly affected by the latest evidence
that the economy continues to grow rapidly. The Commerce Department
reported today that retail sales rose by 1.1 percent in February.
With Americans continuing to spend freely, feeding the surging
economy, many analysts expect the Federal Reserve will raise
interest rates when they meet next week.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Vitner, economist at First Union Securities, noted that the
retail sales report is less crucial to the Fed than a pair of
reports due out later this week: the Producer Price Index and the
Consumer Price Index. Both are considered barometers of
inflationary pressures in the robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key for the Fed is still the inflation data,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A rate increase at the Fed's March 21 meeting would be the fifth
since last June. Higher rates tend to be particularly damaging to
financial stocks, but today, those issues led the Dow's advance.
J.P. Morgan rose { to 112{ after saying Monday that business has
been robust in the first two months of the year. American Express
rose 3{ to 130 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa outweighed the strength in the financial sector, falling
after agreeing to buy Cordant Technologies Inc., a major supplier
of aluminum airplane parts and solid-fuel rockets, for $2.3 billion
in cash. Analysts said investors were afraid Alcoa was paying too
much for Cordant.
</P>
<P>
   Cordant shares were up 25} to 55 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 870.25 million
shares, ahead of Monday's moderate pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 10.09 to
580.05.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.3 percent,
narrowing its losses from Monday, when it fell 2.8 percent on the
news that the nation's gross domestic product declined for a second
consecutive quarter. The report, which meant Japan's economy is
officially back in recession, unsettled markets around the world on
Monday and contributed to weakness on Wall Street.

<HEADLINE> Closing arguments in arson murder trial of Branford businessman  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Jurors were asked Tuesday to consider
the mindset of a Branford business owner accused of setting a fire
at his store that killed a firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony ''Gene'' Bontatibus was last seen before the fire
leaning against a sample rack and looking out the window of his
Floors &AMP; More business on Thanksgiving Day 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour later, a fire first reported by a passerby
would destroy the business, kill firefighter Edward Ramos, 36, and
injure another firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   Bontatibus, 61, is charged with arson murder and three counts of
arson. A trial in July 1998 ended in a hung jury.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments Tuesday to his 2{-week retrial, the
prosecutor insisted the fire was set and defense lawyers pointed to
a gas leak or other accidental cause.
</P>
<P>
   State's Attorney Michael Dearington described Bontatibus as a
man heavily in debt and behind on his taxes. Sales of carpet, tile
and other flooring materials were down, and Bontatibus had just
been told he needed a new furnace.
</P>
<P>
   ''His financial problem was not good,'' Dearington told the
jury. ''You look at his state of mind that afternoon and what was
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Dearington accused Bontatibus of pouring an accelerant on the
floor and setting fire to the business to collect $124,000 in
insurance money.
</P>
<P>
   A state fire inspector testified that a burn pattern was found
on the floor of the business' kitchen. The fire traveled into the
attic and spread, eventually collapsing the roof and trapping Ramos
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there hadn't been a death in the building, the
investigation ... would have been substantially different,''
Dearington said. ''It would have been written off as a gas fire.
What no one anticipated, including Mr. Bontatibus, is that there
would be a death.''
</P>
<P>
   But defense lawyers said Bontatibus was turning his business
around. He was paying off his taxes and debts and wanted to buy the
building that housed his business.
</P>
<P>
   After the fire Bontatibus put the business back together,
continued to pay his workers and was able to fill customers' orders
on time.
</P>
<P>
   Bontatibus took the stand to say he did not set the fire.
</P>
<P>
   An expert hired by the defense found possible accidental causes
for the fire, including a natural gas leak documented in the two
weeks before the fire. Also, the fluorescent lights in the building
had been malfunctioning, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   No exact cause for the fire was found, attorney Auden Grogins
told the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means reasonable doubt,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The expert said the fire started in the attic, causing the roof
to collapse and killing Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   Bontatibus' lawyers blamed Ramos' death on the Branford Fire
Department, which did not realize for some time that Ramos was
trapped in the building.
</P>
<P>
   ''They underestimated the fire, their equipment malfunctioned,
they mismanaged the fire, and you know, it's a lot easier to blame
someone else,'' attorney Thomas Ullmann said.

<HEADLINE> Flashlight Mogul Paying Palimony  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- The founder of the multimillion-dollar
Mag-Lite flashlight company has agreed to pay a $29 million
settlement to a former companion he lived and worked with for two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement reached last week is only a fraction of the $84
million an Orange County Superior Court jury ordered Anthony
Maglica to pay Claire Maglica in 1994, which was considered the
highest-ever palimony judgment.
</P>
<P>
   That award was thrown out by an appeals court in September 1998,
and a new trial was ordered.
</P>
<P>
   A month into the new trial, the Maglicas agreed to an
out-of-court settlement after the dismissal of several jurors
threatened to lead to a mistrial and further delay the long-running
case.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Maglica has maintained Anthony Maglica promised her a
share of Mag Instruments during the 21 years they were together.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ms. Maglica views this as peace,'' said John Keker, her
attorney. ''She settled because she decided that peace was more
important than getting all that she deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Maglica started a machine shop business in 1955 and kept it
after a 1971 divorce. That same year, he met interior designer
Claire Halasz. They lived together, she took his last name, and the
couple presented themselves as married. When the company
incorporated in 1974, he became president and she became secretary,
with equal salaries. All the shares were in his name.
</P>
<P>
   The company started making flashlights in 1978 and thrived, and
a court ruled that her work and ideas were partially responsible
for its success.
</P>
<P>
   Mag Instruments is now estimated to be worth as much as $750
million.
</P>
<P>
   The couple broke up in 1992 after Ms. Maglica found Maglica was
trying to transfer stock to his children but not to her, the court
said.
</P>
<P>
   Maglica chose to settle because Ms. Maglica's attempts to claim
half of the Ontario-based company hampered its growth, according to
his attorney, Robert C. Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes sense for him to move forward, and more or less
complete his dream of having a $1 billion company,'' Weiss said.

<HEADLINE> Strike Casts Pall on Papal Visit  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZARETH, Israel (AP) -- Only days before Pope John Paul II
begins his Holy Land pilgrimage, a municipal workers' strike -- and
mounds of reeking garbage -- cast a smelly pall over his planned
visit to Jesus' boyhood town.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole world will be watching us, and it's a disgrace for
us to be seen this way!'' Nazareth's mayor, Ramez Jeraisi, fumed
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Just down the hill from City Hall, a knot of striking workers,
including trash collectors, waved signs protesting two months of
missed paychecks. Pope or no pope, they vowed to stay off the job
until they're paid.
</P>
<P>
   In Nazareth, like nearly all the stops on the papal itinerary, a
dizzying variety of political disputes threaten to overshadow the
historic visit -- the first to the Holy Land by a pontiff in 36
years. Many of the grievances being aired have little or nothing to
do with John Paul's journey, but the glare of attention surrounding
the visit has thrust them messily into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the mayor of Nazareth, a town of 70,000 people
nestled in rocky hills just north of the West Bank, was speaking --
in all seriousness -- of the need to personally explain to the
Vatican the complexities of this local labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   There's much more than uncollected trash at stake here. Nazareth
is the largest Arab city in Israel. Like other Arab municipalities,
it claims its money woes stem from discriminatory fiscal policies
on the part of the Israeli government against its Arab citizens,
who make up 20 percent of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a similar situation took place in a Jewish town prior to
the pope's visit, they would solve it immediately,'' the mayor told
reporters. The government of Prime Minister Ehud Barak was sending
an envoy, Cabinet minister Haim Ramon, to try to resolve the
dispute before the pope's arrival Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In Nazareth, the garbage wars are only one of several ongoing
quarrels laid bare by the pope's pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Muslims -- who make up nearly three-quarters of
Nazareth's population -- laid the cornerstone for a large mosque to
be built in the shadow of the Basilica of the Annunciation, revered
by many Christians as the site where the Angel Gabriel revealed to
the Virgin Mary that she would bear the son of God. During his
March 25 visit to the town, the pope is to celebrate Mass at the
basilica and hold private prayers in its dimly lit depths.
</P>
<P>
   The planned mosque construction drew sharp objections from the
Vatican, and just before Christmas, churches throughout the Holy
Land were shuttered for two days to protest the project.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic activists say the pope's visit is a good time to remind
Christians they will continue to assert their rights to a larger
share of the city's land. Today, the building site is covered with
Muslim prayer rugs and aflutter with green Islamic flags.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pope is welcome here -- he is an important visitor for
Nazareth,'' Sheik Nazim Abu Slein, clad in a long tunic and white
cap, said sternly. ''But we have a message for the pope, and that
is the message of Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Christians fear the growing political clout of Islamic
activists -- who control Nazareth's city council and govern in
uneasy partnership with the Christian mayor -- could help set the
stage for sectarian strife. Last Easter, Christian-Muslim tensions
boiled over into violence, with clashes and firebombings that left
two shops burned and more than a dozen people hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Shopkeeper Joseph Banna, who sells Christian souvenirs across
from the mosque site, sometimes wonders whether he can keep his
business going.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I've been here for 50 years -- I live here, and I must keep
living here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The visit has also prompted sparring over the pope's planned
route into Nazareth. Municipal officials want him to arrive via the
main thoroughfare, named for Pope Paul VI, who came to the Holy
Land in 1964. But Israeli security plans to spirit John Paul
directly to the basilica via a short road that passes through the
city's unprepossessing industrial zone.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some Jewish religious leaders have complained
because the Nazareth visit takes place on a Saturday, meaning
Israeli security contingents must work on the Jewish Sabbath, a
biblically mandated day of rest.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the basilica, foreign pilgrims visiting in advance of
the pope's trip said they were just as happy to skip the hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad to be here now, not then,'' said Taren Sterrett, a
student from Amsterdam. ''It's crowded enough as it is.''

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Investors OK Wireless Stock  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. announced Tuesday that its
shareholders approved the company's proposal to create a tracking
stock that will reflect the performance of AT&AMP;T's mobile phone
division and other wireless businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to begin selling the shares this spring in
what may be the biggest initial public offering of stock in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was approved by 97.6 percent of the shares that
were cast in a special vote and about 65.5 percent of all AT&AMP;T
shares. The preliminary tally was announced at a special meeting of
AT&AMP;T stockholders in Parsippany, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 20 percent of the new wireless shares, worth as much as
$10 billion according to some estimates, would be sold in the IPO.
The remainder would be distributed to AT&AMP;T stockholders later this
year at an undisclosed rate for each AT&AMP;T share.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, trying to jump-start its languishing stock price, is
hopeful the IPO will capitalize on Wall Street's infatuation with
the ongoing convergence of Internet services with wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to unlocking what the company perceives as the
hidden value of its mobile phone operation, the IPO would help fund
the expansion of AT&AMP;T's wireless network, which will also be used
to provide telephone and Internet service to homes and businesses
with special antennas.

<HEADLINE> Feds Issue Rules for Oil Royalties  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a four-year battle with the oil
industry, the Clinton administration disclosed a new system Tuesday
for collecting royalties on crude oil pumped from the Gulf of
Mexico and federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   While Interior Department officials described the new oil
valuation system as balanced, meeting the needs of both the
taxpayers and industry, producers complained the plan overstates
oil's value and will prove too confusing to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   The system, which Congress barred from taking effect for almost
two years at the behest of disgruntled producers, will be
implemented on June 1. It replaces a system that lets oil companies
set arbitrary values at the wellhead with one that will peg the
value to a market indicator.
</P>
<P>
   The government took in $1.2 billion in 1998 for oil drilled on
public lands and offshore tracts. Interior's Minerals and
Management Service estimates its new oil valuation system will
collect an extra $67 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe we have a rule that strikes a responsible balance
between the interests of the oil and gas industry and the
government's absolute obligation to assure a fair return for the
public's mineral resources,'' the service's director, Walt
Rosenbusch, said.
</P>
<P>
   That assessment wasn't shared by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't view this as a balanced approach,'' said Mark Rubin
of the American Petroleum Institute. ''We are very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry has had problems with the existing system, which
has exposed major oil companies to numerous lawsuits that charged
they were underpaying royalties. Settlements in one case, an
underpayment case filed in Lufkin, Texas, exceed $275 million.
</P>
<P>
   A government watchdog group, the Project on Government
Oversight, estimates the industry has underpaid its royalties by
more than $2 billion over two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The industry fears the new plan may expose oil companies to a
flurry of new litigation. ''We're very concerned that it's going to
lead to more lawsuits in the future because the system is getting
more complex, not less complex,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials now will assess whether to file a federal
suit seeking to block implementation of the new royalty collection
system.
</P>
<P>
   The Minerals and Management Service began rewriting its oil
valuation rules more than four years ago, armed with audits
suggesting the government was not receiving its fair share. The
process was delayed when energy producers successfully lobbied
Congress to delay the final rule for close to two years. A
moratorium barring the service from issuing the final rule expires
Wednesday, and the agency will publish its rule then in the Federal
Register.
</P>
<P>
   The author of that moratorium, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,
R-Texas, slammed the administration for issuing its plan as gas
prices soar.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time this administration stopped depending upon the
goodwill of foreign oil producers and instead focused on creating
the incentives for domestic production that can permanently take
Americans off this gas-price roller-coaster,'' Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Carolyn Maloney, who battled the oil companies on
Capitol Hill, praised the mineral service's action.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's announcement finally brings to an end the decades-old
scam that has permitted big oil companies to rip off the American
taxpayer,'' said Maloney, D-N.Y. ''This is a tremendous win for the
taxpayers, who will now finally get the money they deserve from
companies that produce oil on federal land.''

<HEADLINE> House Starts Rural Caucus Again  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN BIERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House lawmakers, saying the nation's
prosperity had failed to reach farmers, revived on Tuesday a
members' coalition dedicated to advancing the interests of rural
America.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American economy has been booming, yet many of our rural
and agricultural communities are being left behind,'' said Rep. Jo
Ann Emerson, R-Mo., co-chairwoman of the Congressional Rural
Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rural America gets the short end of the stick on funding from
economic development to education and everything in between,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   They said the caucus, an informal group of legislators with a
common agenda, would take up problems that have contributed to the
crisis in rural America. Among them are changing economic
conditions, foreign competition, taxes and the flight to the cities
of rural areas' most educated young people.
</P>
<P>
   To keep up with the international competition, Rep. John
Peterson, R-Pa., suggested the United States lift food embargoes in
place against some foreign nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic co-chairwoman, Rep. Eva Clayton of North
Carolina, said the 112-member caucus will concern itself with how
to get the government to provide better services to rural
Americans. She said the rural elderly are 66 percent more likely to
live in poverty than other elderly Americans, and many of the
nation's rural hospitals operate at financial losses.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is, rural communities are faced with a Catch-22
situation,'' Emerson said. ''They don't have the infrastructure
needed to attract new and high-tech businesses, and they don't have
the resources needed to invest in the infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., said some rural schools in her
district lack federal free lunch programs for poor students because
the schools don't have the money to employ people to navigate
federal regulations to obtain the benefit.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Power Management Fired  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- President Olusegun Obasanjo fired the
entire senior management of Nigeria's beleaguered electricity
monopoly on Tuesday as the country endured the sixth day of
widespread power outages.
</P>
<P>
   The outage has left millions of people without lights or water
and forced some businesses to shut. Doctors at one Lagos hospital
performed surgery in parking lots lit by generators because of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The government-owned National Electric Power Authority is known
for its disintegrating power plants, broken lines and haphazard
service. Some Lagos neighborhoods regularly endure weeks of
blackout.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent outage is believed to be the worst since
Nigeria's civil war ended 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It began Thursday when the power authority shut down its
nationwide network after its thermal power generating systems in
Lagos broke down. An explosion at a hydroelectric plant in northern
Niger State compounded the company's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Power was restored to some parts of the country on Sunday, but
not at sufficient levels to power many domestic appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ''There can be only one verdict and this is that NEPA has failed
woefully,'' Obasanjo said, announcing the firings. He did not say
how many people would lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A power authority spokesman said Monday the company had received
inadequate funding over the years to maintain its plants, warning
that power failures were likely to persist until a major overhaul
was done.
</P>
<P>
   The government asked legislators to approve some $120 million
for new thermal stations, radio stations reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria was ruled by a series of deeply corrupt military
governments for 15 years, leaving much of the country's
infrastructure desperately crumbling. The junta rule ended with
Obasanjo's election in February 1999.

<HEADLINE> Families Bury Russian Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
By MAXIM MARMUR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PSKOV, Russia (AP) -- Thousands of mourners gathered Tuesday to
bury soldiers killed in an ambush that shocked Russia and
represented one of its worst defeats in the breakaway republic of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners, many of them weeping, paid their final respects at the
Holy Trinity Cathedral to eight soldiers who were among 84
servicemen killed in Chechnya's southern mountains two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The ambushed unit was based in Pskov, 350 miles northwest of
Moscow. The bodies of the remaining soldiers, who came from other
Russian regions, were to be sent to their hometowns for funerals.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev lauded the soldiers, saying they
chose to die rather than retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ''The paratroopers knew that if they retreated, the bandit units
would hit the coming troops. For this reason, they made the last
decision -- to accept the deadly fight and remain undefeated,'' he
said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. Only six members of
the unit survived.
</P>
<P>
   The government has said a priority in its campaign to retake
Chechnya is to keep troop casualties low, and the deaths of 84
soldiers in a single engagement came as a shock to many Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Television stations repeatedly ran lists of the victims' names
and a memorial service was held Tuesday in Moscow's Novospassky
Monastery, conducted by Russian Orthodox Church head Patriarch
Alexey II and attended by acting President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Putin signed a decree decorating the dead soldiers. Twenty-one
were awarded the Hero of Russia medal, while 63 were given the
Order of Courage. The awards are among the country's highest
honors.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is the clear front-runner going into March 26 presidential
elections, and the high casualty toll in recent weeks does not
appear to have reduced his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels kept up their intense resistance in the southern Chechen
village of Komsomolskoye, which they captured from Russian troops
over a week ago, and in the settlements of Ulus-Kert and
Selmentauzen.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian commander, Col. Gen. Alexander Baranov, said on ORT
television that Chechen rebels ''have been practically routed'' in
Komsomolskoye, with snipers remaining in only a few buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev, the defense minister, said the rebels had been split
into small groups and would probably try to flee Chechnya soon. But
officials frequently offer predictions of imminent defeat; the
rebels in Komsomolskoye have held out despite shelling and air
attacks that have left the town in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   There is little indication the rebels will give up their fight,
even after the capture this weekend of a key rebel leader, Salman
Raduyev.
</P>
<P>
   Raduyev was being questioned Tuesday after being brought to
Moscow. He was charged Tuesday with premeditated murder, terrorism
and hostage-taking, Deputy Prosecutor General Vasily Kolmogorov
told the Interfax news agency. He said Raduyev would likely face
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Raduyev was behind a raid on the Russian town of Kizlyar in
1997, when hundreds of hostages were taken, and is suspected of
involvement in two deadly railway station bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in neighboring Dagestan said Tuesday that Adam
Dibiyev, a rebel leader from Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest
city, had been detained and was charged with several kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, a top Russian general said the Chechen capital
should be moved from the city of Grozny, where few buildings were
left standing after months of Russian air raids.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Gennady Troshev said the ruined capital would serve as
a warning that might deter future moves toward Chechen
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Russia began its campaign in Chechnya in September after rebels
invaded a neighboring Russian republic. The government said it was
time to restore order in Chechnya, which had become lawless since
rebel fighters drove out Russian troops at the end of the 1994-96
Chechen war.

<HEADLINE> Barak Names New Secret Service Head  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced Tuesday
that the new chief of Israel's Shin Bet intelligence agency will be
a man who served in the elite army commando unit Barak once headed.
</P>
<P>
   Avraham Deichter, 47, served in the Sayeret Matkal commandos and
in several key positions in the Shin Bet, Barak's office said in a
statement. Barak headed Sayeret Matkal in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Deichter will continue serving as deputy chief of the Shin Bet
until the current head of the Shin Bet, Ami Ayalon, steps down at
the end of his four-year term. Israel television said Deichter
would take the position in May.
</P>
<P>
   Deichter's main challenge will be fighting terror. Several
militant Islamic groups have sworn to torpedo the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Ayalon was named to head the Shin Bet in 1996 in the aftermath
of the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by an
ultranationalist Jew, one of the service's worst blunders.
</P>
<P>
   He came under fire initially for failing to prevent suicide
bombings that killed scores of Israelis and effectively froze the
process.
</P>
<P>
   However, in recent years, Ayalon has been praised for the
agency's role in stopping major attacks. He has also cultivated a
successful working relationship with the Palestinian security
services.

<HEADLINE> Whitman offers child care plans; parents ask tough questions  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENNINGTON, N.J. (AP) -- Bouncing a baby on her knee, Gov.
Christie Whitman talked to parents Tuesday about her plans to help
them find reliable child care.
</P>
<P>
   She unveiled a hotline they could call for referrals. She
highlighted plans to help some grandparents get subsidized day care
when they're raising their grandkids.
</P>
<P>
   But in answer to some tough questions, the governor told parents
they would still have to rely on their own resourcefulness to find
care for their kids.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman met with about 20 new parents attending a Capital Health
Systems parent support group meeting here, while their babies
played on a mat on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   One asked why so few corporations provide onsite day care and
what the governor plans to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Necowitz, a Princeton resident and mother of a 7-month-old
girl, said her husband works at AT&AMP;T, which does not provide onsite
day care.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have so much money,'' said Necowitz, a marriage
counselor. ''There's really no reason why they can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman told Necowitz that her husband should get other
employees together and convince the corporation to open a center.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something you've got to really lobby the businesses to
make sure they're responsive to your needs,'' said Whitman. ''You
can have a lot of influence, particularly in this tight job
market.''
</P>
<P>
   After the session, Necowitz said it would help if the governor
and Legislature required large companies to provide centers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need to be doing more,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman also highlighted a new program to help grandparents who
are raising their grandchildren, but that, too, promises to fall
short of the need.
</P>
<P>
   The governor wants to earmark 500 subsidized day care slots for
grandparents. More than 100,000 New Jersey grandparents are raising
their grandkids.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just the first piece of many supports we're going to
be offering many kinship caregivers,'' said Wendi Patella,
spokeswoman for the state Department of Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   The day care slots are part of a two-year, $12 million
initiative that will also provide support services, such as respite
care or help buying baby items.
</P>
<P>
   Grandparents have lobbied Whitman to provide the same monthly
payments that non-relative foster parents receive. Earlier this
year, a state task force backed them up, recommending the state pay
grandparents the $400 to $500 per month foster care board rate.
</P>
<P>
   But the Whitman administration has resisted providing payments
to kin, fearing it would cost too much and encourage parents to
place their children with relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Human Services Commissioner Michele Guhl, who previously opposed
providing the subsidies, said Tuesday the state is re-examining its
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''DYFS is looking at subsidized guardianship,'' Guhl said,
noting that legislation has been introduced that would require the
state to provide that support.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman also plans to use federal welfare funds to add 500 day
care slots to the more than 69,000 currently subsidized for
low-income parents. That will help reduce the current 1,500-parent
waiting list for these slots, according to Beverly Lynn,
administrator of office of child care operations.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman touted the new hotline -- 1-800-332-9227 -- designed to
connect parents with their local child care referral service.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents said it would help.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the phone number will be great,'' said Kirsten
Detrick, a Pennington resident who works at Bristol-Myers Squibb.
The company has an onsite day care center, but there is a waiting
list, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband Herb both took leave to care for their son,
Hadley, 5 months. But soon, they'll be in the market for day care.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things that has prevented us from moving forward
was not knowing where to turn for answers,'' said Detrick.

<HEADLINE> Antiseptic Supplies Recall Widens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A maker of packaged antiseptic products
being investigated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has
widened a voluntary recall over concerns about possible bacterial
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The products made by Clinipad Corp., including swab sticks,
ointments and protective dressings, were sold to hospitals, blood
banks and retail pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut-based company, which eliminated 200 jobs when it
closed its Charlotte plant last month after it failed an FDA
inspection, says it found bacterial contamination in some products
made at the plant and cannot ensure the sterility of others.
</P>
<P>
   ''This situation represents a potential public health hazard,''
Clinipad President Nelson Ford wrote in a letter to customers last
week. The announcement widened a recall that began in December.
</P>
<P>
   The company is sending notices to 3,000 customers and 100
manufacturers who make kits that incorporate its products.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria found in the recalled products include a common
form of staphylococcus.
</P>
<P>
   The contaminated items, made in the last three years, could have
caused serious infections, said FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan. But
there have been no reports of infection or illness caused by the
products, according to the FDA and Clinipad.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Feb. 14 plant closing, the company notified customers
that sales of several products using iodine were being suspended.
At that time, Ford wrote that previously manufactured products were
''safe and pose no health risk to patients or the general public.''
But now, two iodine products are among those being recalled by the
company.
</P>
<P>
   An FDA spokeswoman said the agency has not finished its
investigation of the Clinipad plant in Charlotte.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plans Another $1B Debt Buyback  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flush with cash from a booming economy,
Treasury will buy back another $1 billion of the national debt
Thursday, one week after the first such repurchase in 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   That means Treasury will ask investors who hold certain older,
higher-yielding 30-year Treasury bonds to consider selling them
back to the government. No one would be forced to surrender bonds
to the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Treasury Department said Tuesday that it wants
to buy back 11 outstanding issues of 30-year bonds sold between May
1988 and November 1991. The bonds carry coupon interest rates
ranging from 7.875 percent to 9.125 percent. Those rates are higher
than the 6.16 percent yield 30-year Treasury's fetched on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Because the bonds the Treasury wants to buy back generally pay a
high yield compared with current yields, the Treasury most likely
will have to pay sellers a premium for them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, over the long run, the government expects to save money
through its debt buyback operations because it will save more in
interest payments than its costs of buying the bonds back.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Treasury paid sellers $345 million in premiums
to repurchase $1 billion of debt, its first repurchase in 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   That $1 billion is a tiny fraction of the $5.7 trillion national
debt. Of that total, $3.6 trillion is held by the public.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Treasury said it would like to buy back up to $30
billion of debt this year.
</P>
<P>
   The new era of bulging government surpluses -- helped by a
booming economy that is generating lots of tax revenues -- is making
it possible for the Treasury to repurchase some debt.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury will buy back the debt using a process known as a
''reverse auction,'' in which the government selects offers on a
competitive basis based on the lowest prices.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone holding a 30-year bond issued between May 1988 and
November 1991 can seek to participate in the second buyback
operation but must do so through brokers, known as primary dealers,
who handle the initial sales of Treasury securities. The offers
must be submitted by 11 a.m. EST Thursday and the winning offers
will be announced around midday.

<HEADLINE> USDA Proposes Livestock Price Rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Meatpackers will soon be required to disclose
the prices they are paying for livestock, under rules proposed
Tuesday by the Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   The new program, which was authorized last year by Congress, is
intended to give cattle, hog and sheep producers more leverage in
bargaining with processors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to ensure that small farmers and ranchers have a full
and fair opportunity to compete in an increasingly concentrated
agricultural economy,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said.
''This new mandatory price reporting program will help producers by
making the market more transparent, giving them better information
about what's happening in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The pricing data are to be reported to USDA at certain times of
the day. In addition to livestock, purchases of imported lamb cuts
also will be covered by the reporting requirement. The department
is seeking input from producers and processors on how to report the
data back to the industry.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials say they expect to have the system operational by
this summer.

<HEADLINE> Payden &AMP; Rygel Stays Independent  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL WHITE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a financial world dominated by giants,
California-based money manager Payden &AMP; Rygel is finding success in
global markets while staying small and independent.
</P>
<P>
   Payden &AMP; Rygel's small cap European Aggressive Growth fund is up
58 percent so far this year, with total investment nearly doubling
from $50 million to just over $100 million since the end of
January.
</P>
<P>
   On the domestic front, the company recently sealed a Missouri
state pension fund deal that boosted funds under Payden &AMP; Rygel
management by $1.4 billion to $29 billion. And the company's family
of 25 no-load funds recently has won accolades from such
publications as Barron's, the Wall Street Journal, USA Today and
Morningstar, the mutual fund rating service.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, people value independents,'' said John
Siciliano, one of the company's eight partners.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are not interested in having a manager who is owned by a
large institution and seeks to sell them other financial products.
They want to know who they're dealing with and we're able to engage
with them eyeball to eyeball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of intimacy sets Payden &AMP; Rygel apart in a financial
services landscape dominated in recent years by international
mergers and consolidation. Citigroup was created in 1998 by the
merger of Citicorp and Traveler Group. Dutch insurer Aegon SV
purchased Transamerica Corp. in a deal that combined their mutual
fund management into a new entity, Transamerica Investment
Management.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent combination, the largest U.S. bond manager,
Pimco Advisors Holdings of Newport Beach, Calif., is being acquired
by Germany's Allianz.
</P>
<P>
   Payden &AMP; Rygel has no interest in courting buyers, and no
incentive to do so, Siciliano said. ''The incentive is to stay
independent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The European Aggressive Growth Fund owes its existence in part
to a joint venture formed last year with Metzler Bank, Germany's
oldest private bank. That venture, Metzler/Payden, was an attempt
to take advantage of investment opportunities created by Europe's
adoption of a common currency, the Euro. While the Euro itself has
foundered against the dollar, it has helped open up European
companies to foreign investment. The fund is managed from Payden &AMP;
Rygel's Frankfurt, Germany office.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Euro has caused the single largest market after the dollar
market to develop,'' Siciliano said. ''Having a common currency
causes people to look at Europe in a different way. They're looking
at Europe as a single market rather than a group of companies.''
</P>
<P>
   About 50 percent of Payden &AMP; Rygel's European fund is comprised
of technology and communications stocks, with the rest scattered
across a range of consumer product, financial and industrial
holdings. Companies in the fund include Psion, the British maker of
hand-held computers, German bakery company Kamps and Gruppo
Editorial L'Expresso, publisher of La Republica and other Italian
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The average market capitalization of the fund is between $500
million and $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Europe was kind to investors over the past year, said Geoffrey
Bobroff, an industry consultant in East Greenwich, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear that people look at Europe as a place that is
several years behind the United States in terms of expansion, and
poses a glorious opportunity,'' he said. ''U.S. investors are
underweighted in terms of the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the early part of the year, international
small-capitalization funds have done exceedingly well, in some
cases yielding returns that rival the more-talked about technology
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Payden &AMP; Rygel fund gets generally good marks from financial
consultant Paul Merriman, operator of Fundadvice.com, although he
worried that its spectacular growth could be driven by the fund's
own reinvestment into a relatively small number of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   At $100 million, Siciliano said, the fund is much too small and
the companies in question too large for that to be a factor in the
fund's growth. The key to the fund's growth, he said, has been the
wealth of good values to be found in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Ticking off the fund's positives, Merriman noted that expenses
are low, below 1 percent, and it fits a hard-to-fill niche by
focusing on small European companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bigger question is whether a family of funds is being run
by the marketing department or run by the people who manage
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This looks to me more like money managers who have funds than
marketing people who are trying to sell funds. You can see that, by
the way, in the pricing. If this was a fund family being run by the
marketing department, my guess is you would have higher expenses,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Finnish PM Taking Paternity Leave  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- While other leaders reconsider
Scandinavia's liberal social benefits, Finn Paavo Lipponen decided
to take advantage of one: he'll be taking a six-day parental leave
from his job as prime minister to be with his new baby.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time: in 1998, Lipponen became the first
Finnish government minister to take parental leave, when his wife,
Paivi, gave birth to their first child, Emilia.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Tuesday that the prime minister's office granted
Lipponen, 58, father's leave after Paivi, 33, gave birth to a girl
on Sunday. The baby has not yet been named.
</P>
<P>
   During the six-day leave that starts Wednesday, Lipponen will
receive a paternity allowance instead of his normal salary, as
stipulated in the social security act.
</P>
<P>
   Finnish fathers are entitled to take up to 18 days off work
after a baby is born. Women may take up to 105 paid days of
maternity leave.
</P>
<P>
   Lipponen married Paivi Hertzberg, a history teacher, in January
1998 after they lived together for more than a year. Their wedding
was the first by an incumbent prime minister since Finland gained
independence in 1917.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Air Force, Israel Team Up  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMACHIM AIR FORCE BASE, Israel (AP) -- Six khaki-colored Arrow
missile tubes rose skyward Tuesday, part of a pricey
American-Israeli project to shoot enemy missiles out of the
stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The Arrow, designed to intercept missiles at high altitude and
far away from their targets, will cost more than $2 billion during
its 10-year life span. More than half the funding is coming from
the United States, according to U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Additional training and practice is needed before the system can
be declared operational, although, if missiles were suddenly fired
at Israel, ''we could improvise operations within a few days,''
said air force commander Maj. Gen. Eitan Ben-Eliahu, who took
delivery of the first Arrow battery from its manufacturers in a
ceremony at this seaside base.
</P>
<P>
   Three Arrow batteries are needed to protect Israel's skies, said
Ben-Eliahu. Production of the second battery is underway and
approval has been given for the third one, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the system has suffered some setbacks in testing, it is
capable of countering threats against Israel, including Iran's top
missile, the Shihab-3.
</P>
<P>
   He said the system would be constantly upgraded as foes improve
the relatively simple weapons like the unguided Scud now deployed
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Arrow project dates back to 1988, three years before Iraq
demonstrated the need for it by pounding Israel with 39 Scud
missiles during the 1991 Gulf War. The U.S. rushed upgraded Patriot
anti-aircraft missiles to Israel to try to bring down the Scuds,
with limited success.
</P>
<P>
   The Arrow was part of former President Reagan's ''Star Wars''
missile defense project. Most of the space-based system was never
built.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at Tuesday's ceremony, U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk
said Israel's experiments with the Arrow will benefit similar
United States theater missile defense systems now in development.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of Israel will be able to sleep easier at night,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a khaki-colored trailer, a line of computer terminals showed
detailed maps of the Middle East, including Iraq, Iran and Saudi
Arabia. Incoming missiles would show up on the computer display
along with the Arrow missiles heading out to meet them.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said the upgrade in
Israel's defenses provided by the Arrow system is a part of
Israel's technological edge that ''allows us to go to any peace
negotiation table from (a position of) strength.''

<HEADLINE> Skakel: 'You've got the wrong guy'  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- After nearly 25 years, Dorthy Moxley and
the Kennedy nephew accused of murdering her daughter faced each
other in court for the first time Tuesday. ''You've got the wrong
guy,'' Michael Skakel told Mrs. Moxley.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel, now 39, was arraigned as a juvenile in the October 1975
killing of Martha Moxley. Both Skakel and Martha Moxley were 15 at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   In a simple, four-minute court appearance, Skakel heard the
charge read aloud and was advised of his rights. Skakel was charged
with being a juvenile delinquent ''based on an underlying charge of
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, he stunned the crowded courtroom when he walked
over to Mrs. Moxley, seated in the front row, and told her,
''Dorthy, I feel your pain, but you've got the wrong guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moxley did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll find out in court,'' Martha's brother, John, told
Skakel.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, John Moxley said Skakel's comment was ''just for
himself -- just theater.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think for 24 years, they've thought they're above the law,''
he said of the Skakels. ''We're going to find out now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moxley said Skakel's remark sounded rehearsed and made no
difference to her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really feel as though I know what happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Michael Sherman said Skakel was sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ''Michael Skakel has no idea who killed Martha Moxley. If he
did, he'd be the first one to tell the state's attorney,'' Sherman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Skakel is the son of Rushton Skakel Sr., who is the
brother of U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel.
</P>
<P>
   The Skakels and the Moxleys were neighbors in an exclusive
enclave in upscale Greenwich, Conn. Martha was beaten to death the
night of Oct. 30, 1975, with a golf club later traced to a set
owned by the Skakels.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel, who did not enter a plea during the appearance Tuesday,
has denied any involvement in her death.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict said it will take
at least a year for the case to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a 25-year-old case. I don't think it was handed to the
state on a silver platter here, but we did an awful lot of work in
the case, we developed an awful lot of evidence in the grand jury,
and I'm looking forward to trying it,'' Benedict said.
</P>
<P>
   A ''reasonable cause'' hearing, when prosecutors must prove that
there is enough evidence to proceed with the case, is scheduled for
June 20.
</P>
<P>
   Moxley's case was reopened after more than two decades when an
investigative grand jury was appointed in June 1998. The
appointment followed the publication of books about the case,
including one by former Los Angeles police Detective Mark Fuhrman.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman, who gained notoriety during the O.J. Simpson trial for
racist remarks, has been hired by ABC to provide commentary on the
case.
</P>
<P>
   He identified Michael Skakel as the likely killer in his book.
Prosecutors deny that Fuhrman's book had any influence on their
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Before the court session Tuesday, Fuhrman blamed police mistakes
and deference to the wealthy Skakel family for the delay in making
an arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''You walk into a house with a chandelier in the foyer that
costs more than your whole house, that's intimidating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of confidentiality laws surrounding juvenile cases,
Skakel's arraignment would normally have been closed to the public.
But Judge Maureen Dennis, acting on a request from five newspapers
and The Associated Press, last week agreed to open the proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis found that Skakel had effectively waived his
confidentiality rights, both because he is an adult and because his
name and the charges against him were already well-known.

<HEADLINE> Danforth: Waco Probe To Cost $11M  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE FARROW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Working in secrecy protected by armed guards
and metal detectors, the independent investigator looking into the
FBI siege at the Branch Davidian compound expects to spend nearly
$11 million, interview up to 1,000 people and review 1.5 million
pages of documents.
</P>
<P>
   A 23-page budget for the inquiry headed by former Sen. John
Danforth was obtained by The Associated Press from the Justice
Department through the Freedom of Information Act. It offers
previously unreported details of the investigation, which is being
conducted mainly in a suite of offices on the 15th floor of a
downtown St. Louis office building.
</P>
<P>
   The information becomes known just before a re-enactment that is
scheduled for Sunday at a Texas military base. Danforth's purpose
in seeking the field test is to determine whether flashes recorded
by the FBI's infrared camera at the Waco, Texas, compound could be
from gunfire, as survivors claim in a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth refused interview requests Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Danforth in September amid
criticism that followed revelations that the FBI, contradicting a
position it had taken for six years, used potentially incendiary
devices on the last day of the 51-day standoff on April 19, 1993.
David Koresh and about 80 followers died. Reno and the FBI deny any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think my job is to answer the dark questions,'' Danforth
said at the time of his appointment.
</P>
<P>
   The budget, which Danforth was required to file within 60 days
of starting work, shows that his plan called for interviews of up
to 1,000 people -- everyone from Branch Davidians to the Pentagon's
Delta Force commandoes -- who had knowledge of events related to the
siege. Danforth anticipated his investigators would sift through
more than 1.5 million pages of documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''The (Office of Special Counsel) will examine all physical
evidence, including thousands of pounds of uncataloged physical
evidence located in large repositories in Waco,'' Danforth said in
the document.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also planned to analyze ''hundreds of hours'' of
video, audio and infrared tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The document made no specific mention of the re-enactment at
Fort Hood, about 30 miles southwest of Waco. But documents released
by lawyers in the case showed Danforth has hired Vector Data
Systems Inc., which specializes in the installation of intelligence
gathering systems, to act as his expert for the test.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth didn't speculate on how long his investigation would
take. He projected spending $9,704,106 through the end of the year.
He spent $1,062,598 in the last three months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   When he agreed to the assignment, the former Republican senator
promised to try to get to the bottom of four issues: whether
government agents shot into the complex, the origin of the fire,
the extent of the military's involvement and whether there was a
cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth set up headquarters in St. Louis, his hometown, along
with an office in Washington and one in Waco. About $3.3 million of
his budget will be used to rent, furnish and protect those offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Special Counsel is not listed among the tenants at
the 20-story building, which is across the street from Danforth's
law offices. Danforth estimated he would spend $145,670 to have
security guards greet visitors when they step off the elevator to
the 17,124-square-foot office on the 15th floor. A metal detector
similar to the ones used by airports is wedged between the security
desk and hallway. Those without approved business are whisked back
into the elevator and sent on their way.
</P>
<P>
   Federal protective service at the Washington office was expected
to cost $118,975. There was no such allocation for Waco since it
was in an already-protected post office building.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Danforth expected to pay $1.2 million for contract
workers to scan documents into a computer system ''that will allow
attorneys and investigators rapid search and analysis capability.''
Danforth also planned to hire seven specialists such as forensics
experts at a cost of $100,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the work would be done by a staff of 17 lawyers --
including Danforth and his deputy, former U.S. Attorney Edward Dowd
-- along with 17 full-time and 15 part-time postal investigators.
The postal inspectors are not funded through Danforth's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth is not using Justice Department investigators to avoid
a conflict of interest, since the actions of FBI agents are under
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth and six of his top lawyers earn a U.S. attorney's
salary, $118,400 a year. He also has two non-postal inspectors, two
paralegals and 16 support people, bringing his total payroll to
$3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth is the first person to wield powers spelled out in a
new set of Justice Department regulations adopted in the wake of
the June 30 expiration of the independent counsel statute. If
necessary, he is authorized to prosecute for federal crimes arising
from his investigation. He can also call a grand jury. Those costs
would not be covered in the current budget.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's investigation is expected to cost far less than some
recent investigations by independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr spent an estimated $47 million for the five-year
investigation of President and Mrs. Clinton and their associates.
In the 1980s, the office of independent counsel spent $48.5 million
for a six-year inquiry into the Reagan White House's alleged
arms-for-hostages deals with Iran and its secret war against the
communist-led government of Nicaragua.

<HEADLINE> Dolly Creators Claim Cloning Pigs  </HEADLINE>
By KIA SHANT'E BREAUX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- The company that cloned Dolly the sheep
has produced the first cloned pigs, five little piggies named
Millie, Christa, Alexis, Carrel and Dotcom that raise hopes for a
new source of transplants for humans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is a big step forward they've made. I applaud
it,'' said Dr. Fritz Bach of Harvard Medical School, who studies
genetic and immunological aspects of transplants from animals to
people and was not involved in the cloning.
</P>
<P>
   The piglets, delivered by Caesarean section March 5 at the
Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, were produced by
a subsidiary of PPL Therapeutics of Edinburgh, Scotland, which
nearly four years ago created Dolly, the world's first clone of an
adult mammal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The birth of these pigs is a very significant
accomplishment,'' Dave Ayares, PPL's vice president of research,
said at a news conference Tuesday. ''It has the potential to
essentially revolutionize the transplantation field.''
</P>
<P>
   The five female pigs were cloned from an adult sow named Destiny
using a slightly different technique than the one that produced
Dolly.
</P>
<P>
   Independent tests of the DNA of the piglets confirmed they were
clones of the sow, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The identical baby pigs playfully wrestled and nibbled on each
other's ears inside a wooden pen at the news conference. Their
mother was not present.
</P>
<P>
   PPL touted the clones as a major step toward achieving its
xenograft objectives, which would create genetically altered pigs
whose organs and cells could be successfully transplanted in
humans. Pigs are physiologically one of the closest animals to
humans.
</P>
<P>
   Imutran, a Cambridge, England-based company pursuing similar
research, called PPL's announcement ''interesting news.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is potentially a useful technology to develop new lines of
pigs for (transplant),'' the company said. ''However, the next step
is to see if the technology can be applied to developing
genetically modified animals whose organs can be transplanted into
humans without being rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using animal organs for transplant, known as
xenotransplantation, is controversial because some believe
illnesses could cross from pigs to humans.
</P>
<P>
   PPL scientists plan to try to eliminate a gene responsible for
incorporating in pig cells a sugar group recognized by the human
immune system as foreign. The gene triggers an immune response in
the human body, prompting it to reject the organ.
</P>
<P>
   PPL said transplantation of genetically altered pig organs could
be tested on humans in four years and that analysts believe the
market for them could be worth $6 billion for solid organs alone.
Other uses include cellular therapies such as transplantable cells
that produce insulin for treatment of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope in the very near-term to overcome the shortage of
human organs,'' said Ayares, who noted ultrasounds performed
Tuesday confirmed additional pig cloning pregnancies at the
company's farm in Blacksburg.
</P>
<P>
   The only connection the births have to the veterinary school at
Virginia Tech is that the university provided the clinical services
for the delivery. All of the research was conducted and funded by
PPL.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential solution for organ shortages, the pig
cloning drew criticism from animal rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's always a reason given to validate these
Frankenstein-like experiments,'' said Lisa Lange, a spokeswoman for
Norfolk-based People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
''Animals are not test tubes with tails and they are not
commodities to be marketed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayares countered that pigs for years have been raised and
slaughtered for food.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think our pigs are being mistreated,'' Ayares said.
''They live better than any other pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   The names of the first cloned piglets each have their own
significance. Millie was named for the millennium. Christa, Alexis
and Carrel were named after Dr. Christiaan Barnard, who performed
the first human heart transplant, and Dr. Alexis Carrel, who won
the Nobel prize in 1912 for his work in the field of
transplantation.
</P>
<P>
   And Dotcom?
</P>
<P>
   ''Any association with dotcoms right now seems to have a very
positive influence on a company's valuation,'' said Ron James,
PPL's managing director.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks $1.3B From Nursing Co.  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department is seeking more than
$1.3 billion from Vencor, Inc., alleging that the large national
nursing-home company has defrauded government health care programs
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The department made its claims in two filings with the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. Since last September, Vencor has been
operating under the bankruptcy court's protection from creditors.
The company is reorganizing in response to what it called reduced
Medicare reimbursements and other changes in the long-term care
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Vencor operates 62 hospitals, 303 nursing homes and related
service businesses in 46 states.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen at the company's Louisville, Ky., headquarters did not
immediately respond to requests for comment. But the company had
said earlier it was trying to negotiate a settlement with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Charles Miller said those
settlement talks are continuing.
</P>
<P>
   The department filed its claims with the court late last week
and released them to reporters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In one filing, the Justice Department sought $1.01 billion plus
undetermined civil penalties for fraudulent reimbursement claims
the company allegedly made against government programs from 1992 to
the present. It said the civil penalties amount to $5,000 to
$10,000 for each false claim.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said those claims came in the Medicare, Medicaid and
federal military health care programs. Some of the claims are
trebled in calculating damages under the False Claims Act, Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government said these claims are buttressed by evidence
submitted in at least one lawsuit filed by a private whistle-blower
under the False Claims Act.
</P>
<P>
   The other filing sought more than $290 million. It said more
than $289 million was overpayments the company allegedly obtained
from Medicare from 1994 through the present. In addition, the
government claimed more than $1 million in civil penalties related
to those overpayments from 1998 through the present.

<HEADLINE> Waco Probe To Cost $11 Million  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE FARROW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Working in secrecy protected by armed guards
and metal detectors, the independent investigator looking into the
FBI siege at the Branch Davidian compound expects to spend nearly
$11 million, interview up to 1,000 people and review 1.5 million
pages of documents.
</P>
<P>
   A 23-page budget for the inquiry headed by former Sen. John
Danforth was obtained by The Associated Press from the Justice
Department through the Freedom of Information Act. It offers
previously unreported details of the investigation, which is being
conducted mainly in a suite of offices on the 15th floor of a
downtown St. Louis office building.
</P>
<P>
   The information becomes known just before a re-enactment that is
scheduled for Sunday at a Texas military base. Danforth's purpose
in seeking the field test is to determine whether flashes recorded
by the FBI's infrared camera at the Waco, Texas, compound could be
from gunfire, as survivors claim in a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth refused interview requests Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Danforth in September amid
criticism that followed revelations that the FBI, contradicting a
position it had taken for six years, used potentially incendiary
devices on the last day of the 51-day standoff on April 19, 1993.
David Koresh and about 80 followers died. Reno and the FBI deny any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think my job is to answer the dark questions,'' Danforth
said at the time of his appointment.
</P>
<P>
   The budget, which Danforth was required to file within 60 days
of starting work, shows that his plan called for interviews of up
to 1,000 people -- everyone from Branch Davidians to the Pentagon's
Delta Force commandoes -- who had knowledge of events related to the
siege. Danforth anticipated his investigators would sift through
more than 1.5 million pages of documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''The (Office of Special Counsel) will examine all physical
evidence, including thousands of pounds of uncataloged physical
evidence located in large repositories in Waco,'' Danforth said in
the document.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also planned to analyze ''hundreds of hours'' of
video, audio and infrared tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The document made no specific mention of the re-enactment at
Fort Hood, about 30 miles southwest of Waco. But documents released
by lawyers in the case showed Danforth has hired Vector Data
Systems Inc., which specializes in the installation of intelligence
gathering systems, to act as his expert for the test.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth didn't speculate on how long his investigation would
take. He projected spending $9,704,106 through the end of the year.
He spent $1,062,598 in the last three months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   When he agreed to the assignment, the former Republican senator
promised to try to get to the bottom of four issues: whether
government agents shot into the complex, the origin of the fire,
the extent of the military's involvement and whether there was a
cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth set up headquarters in St. Louis, his hometown, along
with an office in Washington and one in Waco. About $3.3 million of
his budget will be used to rent, furnish and protect those offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Special Counsel is not listed among the tenants at
the 20-story building, which is across the street from Danforth's
law offices. Danforth estimated he would spend $145,670 to have
security guards greet visitors when they step off the elevator to
the 17,124-square-foot office on the 15th floor. A metal detector
similar to the ones used by airports is wedged between the security
desk and hallway. Those without approved business are whisked back
into the elevator and sent on their way.
</P>
<P>
   Federal protective service at the Washington office was expected
to cost $118,975. There was no such allocation for Waco since it
was in an already-protected post office building.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Danforth expected to pay $1.2 million for contract
workers to scan documents into a computer system ''that will allow
attorneys and investigators rapid search and analysis capability.''
Danforth also planned to hire seven specialists such as forensics
experts at a cost of $100,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the work would be done by a staff of 17 lawyers --
including Danforth and his deputy, former U.S. Attorney Edward Dowd
-- along with 17 full-time and 15 part-time postal investigators.
The postal inspectors are not funded through Danforth's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth is not using Justice Department investigators to avoid
a conflict of interest, since the actions of FBI agents are under
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth and six of his top lawyers earn a U.S. attorney's
salary, $118,400 a year. He also has two non-postal inspectors, two
paralegals and 16 support people, bringing his total payroll to
$3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth is the first person to wield powers spelled out in a
new set of Justice Department regulations adopted in the wake of
the June 30 expiration of the independent counsel statute. If
necessary, he is authorized to prosecute for federal crimes arising
from his investigation. He can also call a grand jury. Those costs
would not be covered in the current budget.

<HEADLINE> New York City vies with upstate town in zoning decision  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN BREZOSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- An all-year resort planned for a picturesque
mountain valley pits stewardship of New York City's drinking water
source against local zoning authority.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the Catskill watershed agreement was
signed in 1997, New York City petitioned the state to become the
lead agency in the environmental quality review, or SEQR, of plans
for the Belleayre resort. That resort would include 1,900 acres of
hotels, time-share housing, markets and golf greens surrounding the
state-run Belleayre ski mountain in Ulster and Sullivan counties.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Shandaken, population 3,000, sees the city's
application as an affront. Town officials feel they are seen as
unable to protect the drinking supply of 9 million New York City
residents and that the city is violating the spirit of the
watershed agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very fundamental and very important issue, not just
for Shandaken but really for the Catskill region and the whole
Hudson Valley,'' said Joel Sachs, attorney for the Coalition of
Watershed Towns. ''The issue really is are the municipalities going
to make the fundamental decisions as to what type of land use there
should be, or is New York City?''
</P>
<P>
   State Environmental Conservation Commissioner John Cahill is
expected to decide in a week whether the city will become the lead
agency in the environmental review of the development project.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's drinking water comes from three upstate
watersheds -- the Catskill, Delaware and Croton systems.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to some who live in the region, the city's
interest in the watershed is strangling the region's attempts to
recover from the economic doldrums left by its faded resort
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''You dig a hole here, they're right here checking where the
hole is,'' said Robert DeKalb, a member of Shandaken's planning
board. ''I moved away from New York City to be in the mountains.
Now I'm right here in the middle of a conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Sachs, ''New York City agreed they would not do anything
to impede the municipalities in upstate New York from proceeding in
their own land use decisions. They're getting in the way of
economic development in the town of Shandaken.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of legal battles between upstate and downstate
interests and environmentalists and developers, the 1997 watershed
agreement required the city to spend $1.5 billion on watershed
protection upstate, including buying land to keep it from
development.
</P>
<P>
   In return, upstate officials agreed to allow the city to
regulate development in certain swaths of the watershed. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency waived an order requiring the city
to build an $8 billion filtration plant to ensure the quality of
the city's drinking water supply.
</P>
<P>
   That waiver expires in 2002, when the EPA will again review the
city's management of the water.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Department of Environmental Protection has an
ally in James Tierney, assistant attorney general to state Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer. Tierney urged Cahill to approve the city's
request on Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ''Polluted and heated runoff could significantly add to the
degradation of this unfiltered drinking water supply,'' Tierney
said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   He added that a number of trout streams in the region could be
harmed by runoff during construction and later by pollution such as
fertilizers and pesticides from golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   Tierney said that while the Shandaken planning board has
consultants and engineers to provide advice and technical
assistance, DEP's watershed expertise and experience as lead agency
for numerous large-scale projects makes it the better choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''The project really needs to be reviewed from both the local
and regional perspective,'' said Adirondack Mountain Club spokesman
Neil Woodworth. The club's hikers who also trek the Catskills
envision mountaintops marred by hotels and vacation housing, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the issue particularly sensitive is the economics of
the proposal, so far estimated at around $200 million while
creating 300 permanent jobs.
</P>
<P>
   According to DeKalb, Belleayre Mountain is all the town has to
draw tourists and their dollars.

<HEADLINE> Judge calls Hamilton the 'gatekeeper' of the election fraud plan  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The political director for ousted Teamsters
President Ron Carey was sentenced Tuesday to three years in prison
by a judge who credited him for good deeds done prior to his
embezzlement and fraud conviction.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas P. Griesa said it would be
''unreasonable and unmerciful'' not to credit William W. Hamilton
for his devotion to public service and civil rights causes
throughout a 30-year career.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he strayed somewhat reluctantly from the federal
sentencing guidelines calling for a nearly four-year prison term as
he is permitted to do for extraordinary public service.
</P>
<P>
   He described in detail how others relied on Hamilton for
permission to donate $885,000 in Teamsters money to five
organizations in return for donations from individuals to the
effort to re-elect Carey in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Hamilton did not initiate that concept but he agreed to
play a role in it and his role was crucial,'' Griesa said. ''He
was, in effect, the gatekeeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, 57, was convicted last November after a three-week
trial of embezzlement, mail and wire fraud and perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was sentenced, he told Griesa that his crimes were
meant to help keep the union out of the hands of those who had
corrupted it in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes when you try to do something you believe in deeply,
you do dumb things, you cross the line, you overreach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said he was thrilled in 1989 when the federal
government seized control of the Teamsters through a consent order
meant to separate the powerful union with more than one million
members from mob influence.
</P>
<P>
   He said his trial and conviction had been a ''degrading and
humiliating'' experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am ashamed and deeply angry at myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trial featured testimony from Richard Sullivan, former
finance director of the Democratic National Committee. He said
President Clinton's close friend and chief fund-raiser, Terence
McAuliffe, urged him and others to find donors for Carey.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we could get a $50,000 donor to Carey, ... he knew we would
get $500,000 from the Teamsters,'' Sullivan said McAuliffe told
him. The union is not permitted to use its money to fund elections
for union members.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats failed to produce a donor and the Teamsters did
not make a donation. McAuliffe was not charged with any crime and
his lawyer, Richard Ben-Veniste, said he cooperated with
prosecutors.

<HEADLINE> American Bodies Found in Costa Rica  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- Two 19-year-old American women were
found shot to death near a beach town in Costa Rica, security
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were found along a highway near the town of Cahuita,
about 90 miles east of San Jose, according to Jesus Urena, a
spokesman for the Public Security Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Urena said one of the victims had been shot twice in the head
and the other three times in the back. He said one of the victims
was found nude.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the victims was believed to be a student at
Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. Identification is being
withheld pending an investigation, a State Department spokesman
said Tuesday. He said the department was notified of the slayings
on Monday, but officials did say when they believed the slayings
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy said a consular official had gone to the area
to discuss the case with local officials.
</P>
<P>
   The area is part of Limon province, where five slayings have
occurred so far this month. It includes a depressed banana industry
and beaches popular with tourists.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Back Toward 6-Week Low  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell back toward a six-week low
against the yen Tuesday despite speculation that Japan's central
bank would intervene for the second time in a week to weaken its
currency. The dollar also fell against the euro.
</P>
<P>
   In late trading, the dollar was quoted at 105.05 Japanese yen,
down from 105.55 at the same point on Monday, but still a shade
above Monday's six-week low of 104.83. In dollar-euro trading, the
euro was quoted at 96.73 cents, up from Monday's 96.49 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Traders bought yen despite speculation that the Bank of Japan
would reprise last Wednesday's market intervention, when the bank
sold an estimated $1 billion to $3 billion worth of yen in a bid to
stem the currency's advance.
</P>
<P>
   Some expected the central bank to take aggressive action
following Monday's report that Japan's gross domestic product fell
1.4 percent in the October-December quarter. It was the second
consecutive quarter of GDP decline, meaning the economy was
technically back in recession. A strong yen may exacerbate the
situation by making Japanese exports more expensive in other
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar, meanwhile, was also undermined Tuesday by another
shaky day for the U.S. stock market, where technology shares
tumbled for a second straight day. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite
index has tumbled nearly 7 percent from Friday's record high.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 1.6668 Swiss
francs, down from late Monday's 1.6698, and 1.4645 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.4617. The British pound fell to $1.5765 compared
with $1.5785 a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0223
German marks, down from 2.0269 on Monday; 6.7824 French francs,
down from 6.7978; and 2,002.04 Italian lire, down from 2,006.60.

<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin's campaign manager
on Tuesday defended the front-runner's failure to release a
detailed program proposing solutions to Russia's economic morass.
</P>
<P>
   With the election less than two weeks away, Dmitry Medvedev told
a news conference that Putin preferred to take his time developing
thorough proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Putin's opponents have strongly criticized him for being
vague about his strategy for addressing Russia's complex economic
woes -- although the criticism appears not to have affected his
strong popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's understandable that the broad public in Russia and abroad
is waiting to hear answers to the issues faced by the country,''
Medvedev said. ''Vladimir Putin believed it would be wrong to try
and present a conclusive program in such a short time. It would be
more feasible to thoroughly prepare a conclusive program.''
</P>
<P>
   Pre-election polls have consistently shown Putin gaining about
60 percent support in the March 26 vote, with his nearest
challenger, Communist Gennady Zyuganov, commanding about 20 percent
support.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has been generally lackluster and predictable,
although the Central Election Commission added some spice Tuesday
when it renewed efforts to keep ultranationalist firebrand Vladimir
Zhirinovsky off the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The commission had to add Zhirinovsky to the list of 11 other
candidates last week after the Supreme Court overturned its
decision to keep him from the March 26 vote for not declaring
property belonging to his son, as required by law.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court had earlier rejected a Zhirinovsky appeal, but
the court's Board of Appeal said banning Zhirinovsky was unlawful.
</P>
<P>
   Central Election Commission chief Alexander Veshnyakov said
Tuesday he would go to the Prosecutor General's Office to lodge an
appeal to the highest possible court -- the Supreme Court's
Presidium.
</P>
<P>
   Zhirinovsky gained notoriety in the early 1990s with his
firebrand rhetoric, ranging from promises to annex Finland and
Alaska to calls for resettling Jews and napalming Chechnya. He was
elected to parliament and came fifth in the 1996 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his maverick ways and angry rhetoric, Zhirinovsky and
his Liberal Democratic Party consistently backed the government in
showdowns with the parliament, then dominated by Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Zhirinovsky, who is now a deputy speaker in parliament, issued
his trademark shocking tirades in the city of Nizhny Novgorod on
Tuesday, promising to establish a ''military-police state,''
increase the size of the army and restore the feared Soviet-era KGB
if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Russia needs a ''firm president who will be feared,'' he said,
according to the Interfax news agency. ''Democracy will lead this
country to an abyss.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the liberal Union of Right Forces, led by former
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, voted to back Putin in the race
even though one of its leaders, Samara Governor Konstantin Titov,
is running.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sailors Go To Philipines Court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEBU, Philippines (AP) -- Three U.S. sailors went to court on
assault charges Tuesday in what Philippine officials called a test
of a new agreement to try U.S. servicemen in local tribunals for
crimes they commit here while off-duty.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said the case marked an
important step in implementing the U.S.-Philippine Visiting Forces
Agreement, designed to reassure the Philippines and allow the
resumption of joint military exercises here.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be a very important case on the issue of
jurisdiction,'' Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
   Taxi driver Marcelo Batistil said he drove the three sailors
around the port city of Cebu on Sunday, but they refused to pay
him. They then jumped into another taxi and he gave chase, blocking
the car, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The three sailors got out and punched him several times in the
face and body, Batistil said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which allowed the two countries to resume
large-scale joint military exercises after a five-year cessation,
has been vehemently opposed by many left-wing groups, which say it
will result in a string of crimes by U.S. troops and a rise in
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters marched Monday and Tuesday to a pier near the men's
ship, the USS Blue Ridge, and demanded it leave.
</P>
<P>
   Elmer Cato, spokesman for a presidential commission overseeing
U.S. military visits to the country, said officials of the vessel,
the flagship of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, ''apologized profusely''
for the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The three sailors appeared somber in casual clothes Tuesday at
the prosecutor's office where Batistil filed criminal and civil
complaints against them. They later were arraigned in court, where
they pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
   They face a maximum of 13 months in jail if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Rosabella Tormis said she allowed the men to leave with
their ship for Japan on Wednesday after their commanding officer
pledged they would return for all court sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, approved in May by the Philippine Senate,
the United States generally has legal jurisdiction over U.S.
personnel who commit crimes while on duty, and the Philippines has
jurisdiction over those who commit crimes while off duty.
</P>
<P>
   The visit by the USS Blue Ridge followed a month-long joint
military exercise involving thousands of American and Filipino
troops -- the first in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The United States suspended major military exercises in the
Philippines in December 1996 after Manila closed a loophole
shielding U.S. military personnel from prosecution in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Military ties with the United States remain a sensitive topic
more than seven years after the last U.S. base was closed by the
Philippine government, ending nearly a century of heavy U.S.
military presence.

<HEADLINE> Higher Fuel Prices Burden Farmers  </HEADLINE>
By ELLIOTT MINOR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- Farmer Tommy Daughtry wishes he had topped
off his 10,000-gallon fuel storage tank during the winter, before
diesel prices skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm trying to save pennies to the acre and that's going to run
me dollars to the acre,'' Daughtry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers like Daughtry, already trying to survive the lowest
commodity prices in years and a two-year-long drought, are being
hit hard by the highest fuel prices in almost 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to increase the cost of everything we do on the
farm,'' said Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin has asked Gov. Roy Barnes and Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., to
urge President Clinton to release some of the national oil reserves
in hopes of alleviating fuel shortages and reducing prices.
</P>
<P>
   For farmers, higher fuel prices mean increased costs to run
irrigation pumps and other farm equipment and higher prices for
petroleum-based chemicals and fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just going to be as conservative as possible and hit the
markets as best we can,'' said Daughtry, who grows 650 acres of
tobacco, cotton, peanuts, watermelons and cucumbers near Lenox in
south-central Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Darvin Eason, who runs a farm supply business in Lenox, said the
wholesale price of diesel fuel has climbed from 37 cents per gallon
in February 1999 to $1.01 last month. His business provides large
trucks that apply custom-blended fertilizers and chemicals to farm
fields in four counties.
</P>
<P>
   Eason can pass on the higher fuel prices to his 150 customers,
but farmers -- being dependent on market conditions -- have to absorb
the added costs.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Givan, an agricultural economist with the University of
Georgia in Athens, said Georgia farmers spent $62.3 million for
electricity and $124.4 million for petroleum fuel and oil in 1998,
the last year for which figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fuel prices are currently nearly 50 percent higher than late
last summer,'' he said. ''Should they continue to rise,
expenditures for fuel and oil could top $200 million in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   While fuel and electricity make up less than 10 percent of total
farm expenses, they represent a sizable expenditure, Givan said.
</P>
<P>
   And with forecasters predicting a continuation of the drought
that began in the Southeast in the spring of 1998, farmers will
have to rely more heavily on irrigation. About 1.5 million of
Georgia's 3.5 million acres of cropland is irrigated.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Harrison, a University of Georgia agricultural engineer in
Tifton, said about half of the fuel consumed by farmers is used to
power irrigation systems.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers who broke even last year will lose money this year if
they can't find ways to cut costs, Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The agricultural community is not too upbeat,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Toronto Dominatrix Seeks S&AMP;M Ruling  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A Canadian woman convicted of running a house of
prostitution wants a court to rule once and for all whether the
sadomasochistic services she provided were sex or not.
</P>
<P>
   When police raided Terri-Jean Bedford's north Toronto home in
1994, they confiscated whips, restraints and even a coffin the
dominatrix used in her professional life as Madame de Sade.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the long legal process since, she has insisted the
service she sells involves helping men express their feminine side,
not sex. She was eventually fined $2,050 for running a house of
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Alan Young, argued before an appeals court Monday
that though sexual arousal occurred in her profession, that fell
far short of prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   ''Country fairs and kissing booths -- why is that not an act of
prostitution?'' Young asked. ''It's not a sexual service because
it's too far removed from the sexual act.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the court that convicted her had failed to determine
what constitutes a sexual service and was ''overwhelmed'' by a case
that was ''graphic and quite frankly disgusting at times.''
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutor Scott Hutchison said sexual acts took place at
Bedford's business.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all saturated with sex,'' he said. ''Everything speaks of
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Monday's hearing, the appeals court indicated it
would pass judgment later.
</P>
<P>
   The original judge in Bedford's case threw out the charges,
calling them too vague. That decision was overturned by the Ontario
Court of Appeal, and the Supreme Court of Canada backed that ruling
in 1997. Bedford was then convicted on the original charge.
</P>
<P>
   Bedford, 40, argues that most clients come for fantasy
role-playing that often involves punishment from spanking to
dungeon-style torture such as being tied up or put in a coffin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not selling sex,'' she said recently. ''I'm not selling my
body.''

<HEADLINE> Serbs, French Clash Over Bridge  </HEADLINE>
By ELENA BECATOROS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A Serb official in Kosovo
warned Tuesday of new conflict in this ethnically divided city if
NATO follows through on what he claims are plans to take control of
a bridge and remove its Serb guards.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Ivanovic said French Gen. Pierre de Saqui de Sannes told
him in a meeting that NATO troops would establish a 100-yard
''safety zone'' on the Serb-controlled north bank of the Ibar River
in an ethnically mixed neighborhood called Little Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The only civilians who would be allowed in the zone are those
who live there, Ivanovic quoted the general as saying. That would
require Serb ''bridge guardians'' to leave the area, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians who used to live in the neighborhood are afraid
to return as long as the Serb guards remain on the bridge across
the Ibar. The Serbs, however, consider the guards their only
reliable defense against revenge-seeking ethnic Albanians, who
vastly outnumber Serbs here.
</P>
<P>
   ''This measure will create greater tension and I think that it
will lead to a certain amount of conflict and I think it could lead
to the expulsion of Serbs or their fleeing the area,'' Ivanovic
said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no comment from NATO spokesmen. However, NATO and U.N.
officials have been saying for more than a week that they plan to
establish such control zones to move out the Serb bridge guards and
reassert international authority in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanovic said he was told that NATO's commander in Kosovo, Gen.
Klaus Reinhardt, and the chief U.N. administrator, Bernard
Kouchner, were expected here Wednesday to oversee the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanovic said he tried to talk the French general out of the
plan but failed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The general was very arrogant and decisive,'' Ivanovic said.

<HEADLINE> FEC Aims To Ban Foreign Donations  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Election Commission is urging
Congress to pass a law saying foreigners cannot give any money to
federal campaigns -- a subject at the heart of the scandals
involving President Clinton's 1996 re-election effort.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners want Congress to enact such a measure during its
current session, saying it is one of the FEC's top legislative
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   An existing law specifically bans foreign contributions to
candidates and the FEC has ruled that the statute also applies to
unregulated soft money given to the political parties. The
commission, citing court cases that ruled otherwise, has
recommended in the past that Congress pass a new law, but this is
the first year that the FEC has made it a priority.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman in 1998 threw out several
Justice Department charges against Democratic fund-raisers Maria
Hsia and Yah Lin ''Charlie'' Trie, ruling that the law applied just
to donations that directly support individual candidates. An
appeals court reinstated the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the foreign donations to the 1996 Democratic
presidential campaign, on the other hand, were soft money
contributions. The party refunded around $3 million in questionable
donations.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a federal jury convicted Hsia, a friend and
supporter of Vice President Al Gore, for arranging more than
$100,000 in illegal donations. Trie pleaded guilty last year to
violating campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee also has been accused of
receiving foreign soft money contributions. Hong Kong businessman
Ambrous Young contributed $2.1 million in 1994 to the RNC's
National Policy Forum. The forum used $1.6 million to pay off a
loan from the RNC, which, in turn, spent the funds on the fall
elections.
</P>
<P>
   After the FEC deadlocked along party lines and dropped the case,
the Democratic National Committee sued in U.S. District Court last
January to force the commission to act.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, acknowledging he made mistakes in 1996, has called for a
ban on soft money. Republican challenger George W. Bush has called
for banning soft money contributions from corporations and unions,
but not individuals.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Group Outlines China Hurdles  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China has a long way to go in establishing a fair
environment for international business, the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce in China said Tuesday in a report outlining a litany of
troubles faced by foreign investors here.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. businesses find China's legal system ''unpredictable,
undependable and confusing'' and feel that many of the country's
trade policies and business practices are ''fundamentally unfair,''
the group said in its annual report.
</P>
<P>
   Heading the list of recommendations was a need to make laws and
administrative regulations of all kinds public and to enforce and
interpret them in a consistent way, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''U.S. businesses are in a relatively optimistic mood with
regard to the medium- and long-term prospects,'' said Christian
Murck, general manager for The Chase Manhattan Bank in Beijing and
an editor of the report. ''But you have to recognize that the
situation for many foreign companies is quite difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is to be distributed to members of the U.S. Congress
and the Clinton administration as well as Chinese government
ministries and is part of a growing effort by U.S. companies in
China to directly lobby for changes in policies and business
practices that handicap foreign businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The report indicated that American Chamber of Commerce members
viewed market access restrictions and high taxes and tariffs as
greater barriers to profitability than bottom-line issues such as
high labor costs and competition.
</P>
<P>
   Limits on the sorts of businesses that foreign companies can
engage in were a particularly sore point. China has until now
severely limited foreign involvement in distribution, particularly
of products made by joint ventures, as well as banking, insurance,
securities and the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   The report also suggested:
</P>
<P>
   --Better enforcement of protection of trademarks, copyrights and
other forms of intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   --Allowing foreign business partners greater control over their
technology, including a say in how the technology is used and
better protection of patents, trademarks and copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   --Reducing taxes and other costs associated with hiring Chinese
workers and lifting limits on who can be employed where.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese companies struggling with piracy of their products and
with local protectionism also are pushing for a more equitable
business climate, said Tim Stratford, chairman of the American
Chamber of Commerce and general counsel for General Motors in
China.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really think that China's coming into the WTO will be a
watershed event comparable to U.S. and China normalizing relations
back in 1979,'' Stratford said.

<HEADLINE> Blind Vendor Helps Police Nab Woman  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL ZOLL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Richard Fracasso, snack bar vendor at the
state Traffic Court, likes to joke that he's blind -- not stupid.
</P>
<P>
   When a friend told him a bill he accepted was a one and not a
twenty as he thought, he vowed to nab the wrongdoer. Soon after, he
helped police catch the court clerk now charged with trying to take
his money.
</P>
<P>
   ''She thought I was her own private ATM machine,'' Fracasso, 67,
said Tuesday. ''Can you picture some dame coming in here doing
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Bingham, 33, was arrested after she handed Fracasso a
dollar bill for a bottle of apple juice last week and told him it
was $20, state police said.
</P>
<P>
   She was fired Monday, just two months after she started, and has
been charged with misdemeanor obtaining money under false
pretenses.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham could not be reached for comment Tuesday because her
home telephone number in Smithfield is unpublished.
</P>
<P>
   Fracasso, who can only see light and dark, recognizes most of
his customers by voice. They tell him how much they have paid and
he makes change by feeling the coins or grabbing bills from their
assigned slots in his cash drawer.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, he was making change when the friend told
Fracasso about the disparity with the bills. Fracasso asked someone
to check some of his other bills and discovered the same
discrepancy with a few more.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to think who was giving me a lot of twenties and I
remembered (Bingham),'' Fracasso said. ''I guessed it was her.''
</P>
<P>
   Bingham arrived to buy juice a few days later and said she was
giving him $20, Fracasso said. He slid the bill into a small
electronic currency scanner he keeps on hand but rarely uses. The
machine identified the money as $1 and he called security.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was angry because she was trying to take advantage of my
blindness,'' said Fracasso, who lost his sight 22 years ago from a
degenerative eye disease.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed in connection with the other bills
Fracasso questioned due to lack of evidence, state police said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first time someone tried to steal from the vendor.
In 1997, another clerk pleaded no contest to taking potato chips
from the snack bar. She was fired, fined and ordered to perform
community service.
</P>
<P>
   Fracasso also said his cane has been stolen several times.
</P>
<P>
   ''People will take anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he pledged not to become bitter.
</P>
<P>
   As customers lined up at the snack bar Tuesday for ham salad
sandwiches and chocolate milk, Fracasso said he would follow the
example his late wife set as she fought cancer: Face problems with
courage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try not to let it change me,'' Fracasso said. ''I don't want
to turn into something else because people treat me this way.''

<HEADLINE> Advisor Injured in Tennis Match  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A doubles match with Treasury Secretary Larry
Summers, the Romanian ambassador and a former Romanian tennis star
left White House economic adviser Gene Sperling nursing a torn
muscle in his left leg.
</P>
<P>
   The injury occurred Saturday after Sperling and his doubles
partner, Summers, lost to Romanian ambassador Mircea Geoana and
former tennis pro Ilie Nastase at Congressional Country Club
outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nastase thought it was a leg cramp but I knew in my heart it
was worse,'' said Sperling, who was rushed to a hospital following
the injury. He was treated and released wearing a cast and walking
on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling noted Nastase's on-court diplomacy, saying he ''is a
nice guy and when he plays with people like us he aims more to keep
us happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers had earlier defeated Nastase 6-2 in a singles game.

<HEADLINE> Corzine set to unleash TV commercial 'air war' to boostrecognition  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- The anticipated ''air war'' is ready
to launch as Jon Corzine begins to deploy his personal millions in
an effort to boost his name recognition among the Democrats he
hopes will nominate him to run for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, a former Wall Street executive with a personal fortune
exceeding $300 million, said a pair of commercials will begin
airing Wednesday on New York and Philadelphia television stations
and probably continue through the next 12 weeks until the June 6
New Jersey primary.
</P>
<P>
   His primary campaign opponent, former Gov. Jim Florio, has no
immediate plans to broadcast TV commercials, according to Michael
Murphy, a co-manager of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are contemplating doing something briefly early on,''
Murphy said, but the heaviest TV spending would not occur until
mid-May with two or three weeks left before the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine and his aides were officially mum about the exact level
of spending. Steve Goldstein, co-manager of his campaign, said it
would be ''in the mid-six figures,'' roughly $500,000 a week.
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat close to the campaign told The Associated Press the
weekly ad buys could reach $1 million a week. At that rate, Corzine
would be spending more of his own money each month on TV
commercials than Florio will spend for the whole primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein would not comment directly on that estimate but did
say, ''Jim Florio has a 30-year head start on Jon Corzine in terms
of name recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   TV stations provide public files on political advertising but
will not share it on the phone, according to officials at the ABC
network affiliates in New York and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   However, a staff member at WABC-TV Channel 7 in New York said
Corzine had placed more than a dozen spots to air through Tuesday
at a cost of $200,000 just at that one station.
</P>
<P>
   There are two commercials, a 60-second biographical spot and a
30-second ad focusing on health insurance. Goldstein said both
would have equal exposure on network-affiliated channels in New
York and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are descriptive of my background, why I am running, the
kinds of things that are important to me,'' Corzine said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Early polls taken last month indicated that only one in three
registered Democrats recognizes Corzine's name, and that only one
in five has formed a favorable view of him.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking during a break at a luncheon he sponsored with union
leaders here, Corzine conceded that he trails Florio in polls and
that his emphasis must be to make his name known.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is that we think we have to make sure we establish
strong name recognition, and the only way you can do that on a
broad basis in New Jersey is by getting out and getting started in
the media,'' Corzine said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the primary campaign does not officially begin until
after candidates file petitions April 13, Florio and Corzine have
been competing for party support since last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said he does not believe this is an especially early
start for TV advertising. ''In elections around the country, people
have started a lot earlier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy disagreed, saying never in his political career has he
seen such a heavy dose of TV commercials placed so early.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have expected that he was going to spend an enormous amount
of personal wealth on the airwaves,'' Murphy said. ''Jon Corzine is
engaging in the media equivalent of carpet bombing, and we are
going into be launching smart bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   The longer commercial features photos of his family background
on an Illinois farm followed by narration on five policy points:
health care, long-term care for seniors, gun licensing, access to
education and racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter commercial features Corzine speaking about his idea
of mandating that all employers provide health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Old ideas are not working and we need to bring new
perspectives to bear on a very tough problem,'' Corzine says in the
ad.

<HEADLINE> Congo Troop Deloyment On Track  </HEADLINE>

   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Congolese rebels said Tuesday they had
killed at least 150 government troops in taking a southern town,
even as a top U.N. official claimed a planned 5,000-strong
peacekeeping deployment was on track.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel spokesman Kin-Kiey Mulumba said his forces dealt a heavy
blow to Congolese President Laurent Kabila's army and its
Zimbabwean allies Saturday, killing 150 soldiers and capturing
ammunition in Idumbe, 375 miles east of the capital, Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   In Harare, the Zimbabwean army confirmed the Rwandan-backed
rebels had taken control of the town, and threatened to retaliate
for what it said was a direct threat to Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bernard Miyet, U.N. undersecretary general for
peacekeeping operations, was upbeat after meeting rebel leaders and
Rwandan officials in Kigali, and announced that all the countries
involved in the 1{-year Congolese war had given the go-ahead for
the deployment of more than 5,000 U.N. troops and cease-fire
monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the parties have pledged necessary security guarantees and
freedom of movement for U.N. personnel,'' Miyet said before
departing for the Ugandan capital, Kampala. He had traveled already
to Namibia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Miyet did not give a timetable for the deployment of four U.N.
battalions in four cities under the control of government troops
and their backers -- from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia -- and of
Congolese rebels and their allies -- Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   But as a result of Miyet's visit, two aircraft carrying 12 U.N.
personnel traveled Tuesday to one of the four base towns, Mbuji
Mayi in the south of Congo, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The guns in Congo were supposed to have fallen silent after an
August peace agreement between the president and the rebels
fighting to oust him. Rwanda, Uganda, Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia
also signed.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the United Nations is to deploy observers
and soldiers to protect them. Later it would send a larger U.N.
presence to oversee the disengagement of forces, the withdrawal of
foreign troops and the disarmament of Rwandan Hutu militiamen, who
were responsible for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and are now
fighting in Kabila's army.
</P>
<P>
   But the conflict has continued, with mutual accusations of
cease-fire violations. Last week the United States warned that,
without an end to the fighting, any deployment would be hard to
achieve.

   MONEY MANAGEMENT: Americans expect to spend $15,210 this year on
day-to-day expenses.
</P>
<P>
   A national survey of 800 adults by American Express found the
amount that people spend on items like groceries, gasoline, fast
food, cellular and Internet services will remain relatively
unchanged from 1999 to 2000. In last year's survey, respondents
reported spending $14,917 on household expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that men and women are each involved in
household financial management, but in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that more women (72 percent) than men (52
percent) handle the bill-paying at home, while more men (57
percent) than women (43 percent) make financial investment
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   AND THE WINNER IS ...: The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences may have its opinion of the best pictures, but many
Internet users disagree with its choices for the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 percent of 1,000 Internet users polled agreed with last
year's choice for best picture, ''Shakespeare in Love,'' according
to a Greenfield Online Omnibus study for WebSwap.com. Nearly five
times that, 46 percent, thought ''Saving Private Ryan'' should have
taken the award. Eight percent thought ''Life is Beautiful,''
should have won.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, only 11 percent agreed with the choice of Robert
Benigni as best actor for his role in ''Life is Beautiful.''
Forty-three percent said Tom Hanks deserved the award for ''Saving
Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   The respondents were kinder to Gwyneth Paltrow, who won the best
actress award for ''Shakespeare in Love.'' Twenty-five percent
agreed with the choice, while 11 percent said Cate Blanchett
deserved the Oscar for ''Elizabeth.''

   EMPLOYEE ENVY: If you're feeling cheated by your employer,
you're not alone.
</P>
<P>
   A recent telephone survey 1,015 adults found that half of the
respondents feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ''Too many of us have been fed the line that 'work isn't
necessarily about money,'' says author Stephen Pollan, who
commissioned the poll. ''But tell that to Visa next time they send
you your bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The respondents said they felt cheated because they weren't
being paid comparable wages to others in their industry (25
percent), receive inadequate vacation time (16 percent),
insufficient retirement savings (16 percent), aren't paid for
overtime (15 percent) and feel they have no privacy or are spied
upon at work (14 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The poll found women feel cheated more than men 56 percent to 47
percent. And 66 percent of African-Americans felt cheated, versus
47 percent of whites.

<HEADLINE> Convictions in Date Rape Drug Death  </HEADLINE>
By JIM IRWIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- One of the nation's first trials involving a
death linked to the date-rape drug ended Tuesday with the
convictions of three young men accused of spiking a 15-year-old
girl's soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Cole, 19, Daniel Brayman, 18, and Nicholas Holtschlag,
18, were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and lesser
poisoning charges.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth defendant, Erick Limmer, 26, was convicted of one count
each of being an accessory to manslaughter, poisoning, delivery of
marijuana and possession of the date-rape drug GHB, or
gamma-hydroxybutyrate. Earlier this month, the judge threw out a
manslaughter count against Limmer.
</P>
<P>
   ''This can kill you. It's a highly dangerous substance, and
(users) are risking a lot. Hopefully this jury has sent that
message,'' Assistant Prosecutor Doug Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors alleged the men gave Samantha Reid a soft drink
secretly spiked with GHB during a Jan. 16, 1999, party at Limmer's
Grosse Ile apartment. She died the next day. Her friend Melanie
Sindone, now 16, also ingested the drug and was briefly in a coma,
but survived.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been waiting for this for over a year, and we finally
got what we wanted,'' said Melanie's father, Peter Sindone.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants sat impassively as the verdicts were read, but
Cole's mother wept softly. A few relatives and friends of the
victim whispered ''Yes!'' as the last of the verdicts was read.
</P>
<P>
   The manslaughter convictions carry a sentence of up to 15 years
in prison. The penalty for the lesser poisoning conviction is up to
five years. Sentencing for all four was set for March 30.
</P>
<P>
   GHB has been linked to at least 58 deaths since 1990 and more
than 5,700 recorded overdoses, according to the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   A few drops of the colorless, odorless drug can render a victim
unconscious within 20 minutes. Victims frequently have no memory of
what happened and the drug is difficult to trace, often leaving the
body within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration banned GHB for public sale in
1990, and a 1998 Michigan law made possessing the drug a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, President Clinton signed legislation toughening
federal laws against possessing, making or distributing the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ''Samantha's death is what brought (GHB abuse) to light,'' said
Denise Newman, a member of Cole's jury. ''It's sad to say, but when
she died it brought it to everybody's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Brayman and Holtschlag had argued their clients
were unaware GHB was present at the party. Cole's attorney has said
his client spiked the drinks with what he believed was only a
harmless intoxicant supplied by Limmer.
</P>
<P>
   Limmer has said he was gone or in his bedroom most of the night
the girls were drugged.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Cole's attorney, John Courtright, repeatedly told
jurors Samantha's death was a ''tragic accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole's case was heard by a separate jury because authorities
said he confessed. His jury began deliberations March 7, and the
jury for his three co-defendants began Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The jury for Holtschlag, Brayman and Limmer reached its verdict
shortly before noon Monday, and the judge sealed it until Cole's
jury reached its verdict Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cole was found innocent of a third poisoning count. Prosecutors
alleged he drugged a third girl who did not become ill.

<HEADLINE> ABC's Winning Streak Hits 11 Weeks  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC clearly learned what television viewers
weren't interested in watching on Sunday night, when NBA basketball
and the gangster movie, ''Donnie Brasco,'' dragged the network to a
historic low in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The network had its smallest audience of any Sunday evening --
except in the summer rerun season -- since Nielsen Media Research
began its more precise measuring system in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In a gangster face-off, the average audience for ''Donnie
Brasco'' was even smaller than HBO's competing episode of ''The
Sopranos.'' That's remarkable because HBO, a pay cable station, is
available in roughly one-third the number of homes that get NBC.
</P>
<P>
   On basic cable, the Discovery Network's ''Raising the Mammoth''
even beat out the Al Pacino movie. The documentary was by far the
highest-rated show in Discovery's 15-year history, with more than
double the audience of the previous best, a 1997 ''Raising the
Titanic'' special.
</P>
<P>
   It was another bad night for the NBA on NBC, which filled two
hours of prime-time Sunday with either a Sonics-Raptors matchup or
Knicks-Spurs. The NBA's ratings are down 27 percent from last year,
and 31 percent from 1998, Michael Jordan's last season.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday is usually the most-watched night of television during
the week.
</P>
<P>
   Two midseason replacement series -- CBS' ''Grapevine'' and NBC's
''God, the Devil and Bob,'' are both doing so poorly that they're
not likely to have a long life.
</P>
<P>
   ABC won its 11th week in a row in the ratings, drawing an
average prime-time audience of 14 million people (9.3 rating, 16
share). As is fast becoming typical, the week's three airings of
''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' were the week's three
most-watched programs.
</P>
<P>
   CBS was second with 11.8 million viewers (8.3 rating, 14 share),
NBC had 9.6 million (6.8, 11), Fox had 8.9 million (5.7, 9), UPN
had 3.7 million (2.6, 4), the WB had 3 million (2.2, 3) and Pax TV
had 1.1 million (0.9, 1)
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ''World News Tonight'' won the evening news ratings race
with 10.5 million viewers last week (7.7 rating, 16 share). NBC's
''Nightly News'' averaged 10 million viewers (7.6, 16), and the
''CBS Evening News'' had 8.2 million viewers (6.3, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of March 6-12, the top 10 shows, their networks and
ratings were:
</P>
<P>
   ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday), ABC, 19.5; ''Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Sunday), ABC, 17.5; ''Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC, 17.2; ''60 Minutes,'' CBS, 14.7;
''Friends,'' NBC, 13.9; ''The Practice,'' ABC, 13.4; ''ABC News
Special Report: Super Tuesday (8 p.m.), ABC, 13.1; ''Touched By an
Angel,'' CBS, 12.9; ''ABC News Special Report: Super Tuesday (9
p.m.), ABC, 12.0; ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 11.0.

<HEADLINE> Supplements Might Help Arthritis  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Two popular nutritional supplements won't cure
arthritis but might improve its symptoms with fewer side effects
than traditional treatments, an analysis of 15 studies concludes.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the research on glucosamine and chondroitin
compounds is flawed and probably overstates their benefits so more
study is needed to determine if they really help achy joints,
according to the analysis in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The supplements are marketed as treatments for osteoarthritis,
the degenerative joint disease that afflicts about 21 million
people nationwide. They are sold over the counter in health food
stores and became popular after being recommended in a 1997 book,
''The Arthritis Cure.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Overall, it seems probable that these compounds do have some
efficacy in treating osteoarthritis symptoms and that they are
safe,'' the authors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Timothy McAlindon, a Boston University rheumatologist and
lead author of the analysis, said his conclusions are ''a little
more positive'' than the ''profound skepticism which has existed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not actively recommending'' chondroitin and glucosamine,
''but I certainly don't discourage people from trying them provided
they're cognizant of the available data,'' McAlindon said.
</P>
<P>
   Both supplements are synthetic versions of body substances that
help build cartilage, the tough tissue that lines the joints.
Laboratory studies have suggested they might promote cartilage
growth, though whether they do in humans remains to be seen,
McAlindon said. The studies he analyzed compared the supplements
with a placebo's effects on pain and mobility rather than measuring
any changes in joints.
</P>
<P>
   The authors evaluated six studies on glucosamine and nine on
chondroitin published between 1966 and 1999. All involved patients
with arthritis in the hip or knee.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the studies showed moderate to large benefits from the
supplements. Chondroitin seemed to be the most effective.
</P>
<P>
   But studies showing the biggest benefits were also the most
flawed, McAlindon said.
</P>
<P>
   Many failed to detail how the authors hid the identity of
substances given to subjects -- a crucial element in
placebo-controlled studies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We also found evidence of publication bias,'' McAlindon said,
referring to selective publication of the most positive results.
</P>
<P>
   Most, if not all, of the studies were sponsored in some way by
the supplements' makers.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the most common conventional arthritis treatments
-- aspirin, acetaminophen and ibuprofen -- can cause gastrointestinal
bleeding or liver damage, none of the studies showed significant
side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis is ''an important contribution'' because the
authors deciphered hard-to-interpret studies and provide a useful
assessment of the latest research, said Dr. John Klippel, medical
director of the Arthritis Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis was funded by the National Institutes of Health.

<HEADLINE> House Aims To Ease First Home Buyers  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Banking Committee approved sweeping
legislation Tuesday designed to make the dream of home ownership
more attainable for millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Expected for a House floor vote this spring, ''The American
Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000'' would allow
for reduced down payments for FHA home loans for teachers, as well
as police, fire and other uniformed municipal employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''This completes the last piece of the housing agenda,'' said
Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y. as the committee unanimously passed H.R.
1776 amid an air of bipartisanship. Democrats and Republicans
thanked each other for working through their differences on the
proposed legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have produced a very good bill,'' said Rep. John LaFalce,
D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would authorize 1 percent down for FHA mortgage loans
and defers the 2.25 percent up-front FHA premium charged for such
loans until the loan is repaid.
</P>
<P>
   A first-time borrower purchasing a $130,000 home would see their
down payment reduced from $6,300 to $1,300.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm excited about this bill and the homeownership
opportunities it will create,'' said Rep. Darlene Hooley, D-Ore.
''In a lot of communities, teachers and police officers can't
afford to live where they work.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also make it easier for seniors to purchase
long-term care insurance through an FHA reverse mortgage home
program by waiving an up-front fee usually charged by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the bill would allow public housing authorities to
provide low-income housing residents one-time grants for home
purchase down payments instead of monthly Section 8 for rental
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   While the strong economy is credited with boosting home
ownership rates to an all-time high of more than 66 percent,
stubborn gaps exist between sectors of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The rate for whites is at 72.5 percent compared with 45 percent
for blacks and 44 percent for Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the African American and Hispanic communities, for example,
many working families are priced out of the real estate market,''
Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also authorize $25 million in grants for
Homeownership Zones, programs targeted to help low and middle
income people buy homes in large developments to revitalize poor
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require the Department of Housing and Urban
Development to offer some underutilized properties to local
governments or community groups at below market rate prices.

<HEADLINE> Russian Plane Had Not Been De-Iced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The private jet that crashed last week in Moscow,
killing nine people including a prominent journalist and an oil
executive, had not been treated with de-icing liquid before
takeoff, investigators said Tuesday, the news agency ITAR-Tass
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The chartered Yak-40 crashed shortly after taking off from
Moscow's Sheremetyevo-1 airport on March 9. The victims included
noted investigative journalist Artyom Borovik and Ziya Bazhayev,
president of the Oil Alliance company.
</P>
<P>
   Initially there was wide speculation that the plane had been
sabotaged, and a security services spokesman said there was an
indication that the Chechnya-born Bazhayev had been resisting
pressure to give support to Chechen rebels fighting Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Monday that they had ruled out bombing as the
crash cause, but had not excluded sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   ITAR-Tass cited Rudolf Teimurazov, deputy chairman of the
Interstate Aviation Committee, as saying investigators found the
plane had not been de-iced, and that it took off with a
''nonstandard flap position.''
</P>
<P>
   He said these factors may have caused uncontrollable listing
after takeoff.

<HEADLINE> White Farmers Sue Zimbabwe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Farmers' leaders have filed a lawsuit
seeking to force the Zimbabwean government to evict black squatters
who have seized land on white-owned farms, their union said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Commercial Farmers' Union has been urging the government to
remove the squatters, but so far has been ignored, said union
director David Hasluck.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit puts the decision in the hands of the High Court, he
said. The union was awaiting information on when its case will be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   The squatters, led by former guerrillas in the country's
independence war, were angered by last month's defeat of a national
referendum that would have empowered President Robert Mugabe to
speed up the seizure of farmland without paying compensation to the
mostly white owners.
</P>
<P>
   Hasluck said squatters were camping on 433 white-owned farms
late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with spears, axes, knives and guns, squatters have invaded
549 farms since the beginning of the month, but have since
abandoned 116.
</P>
<P>
   ''There continues to be an escalation in threats against
landowners and demands they sign over land ownership'' or face
death, Hasluck said.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 white farmers own a third of the nation's productive
land.
</P>
<P>
   Though police have promised to remove the occupiers, Mugabe
announced Friday on state television that the squatters could stay.
</P>
<P>
   He said the invasions were a political protest against land
ownership imbalances dating back to the colonial era in Rhodesia,
as Zimbabwe was known before independence in 1980.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Reaching Nominating Goal  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, and
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore and George W. Bush, their chief rivals already
conquered, cruised Tuesday through six Southern primaries that
ensured them the delegates needed to clinch the Democratic and
Republican presidential nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to a November matchup with the GOP governor of
Texas, Gore said, ''This election is a real choice between two
different ways'' of governing.
</P>
<P>
   Republican John McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley abandoned their
campaigns Thursday, ending an exciting primary season that tested
the front-runners and spurred record-breaking voter turnout. Former
ambassador Alan Keyes remained on GOP ballots, but was not a threat
to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   With suspense drained from the race, turnout was low in Florida,
Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's just no interest in this election,'' said Michael
Garner, a Democratic poll worker in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The limited choices didn't impress voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I'm just going to have to vote for Gore, though I'm
not really happy about it,'' said Dennis McHale, a Democrat from
New Orleans who was drawn to the polls by a city council election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush entered Tuesday's races with 752 of the 1,034 delegates
needed to seal the nomination. The six states had 341 delegates up
for grabs, including 124 from Bush's home state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had just 239 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president began the day with 2,014 of the 2,170
delegates needed. Bradley had 313.
</P>
<P>
   In a hopeful sign for the Republican candidate, exit polls
suggested that Bush ran stronger among Democratic voters than Gore
did among GOP voters. Just 6 percent of voters in Republican
primaries said they would for Gore in November; twice as many
Democrats said they would defect to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's home state of Tennessee, Republicans showed an intense
dislike of their native son: only 4 percent of the GOP voters said
they would vote for the vice president in November, and more than
80 percent had an unfavorable opinion of their one-time senator.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, half the Republicans as well as half the Democrats
said Bush was more conservative as presidential candidate than he
was in 1998, when he won a landslide re-election as governor.
</P>
<P>
   After voting for himself in Tennessee's primary, Gore promised
to help Americans who don't have jobs or health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ''This election is a real choice between two different ways of
approaching those problems and I want to be president to make sure
we solved these problems the right way,'' the vice president told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He promised ''no let up at all,'' even with the nomination fight
settled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever energy I might feel like putting into celebrating I
am putting into the general election instead,'' said Gore, who like
Bush is appealing to the political middle and voters outside their
own party. ''I'm going to reach out to Republicans and
independents.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting ahead of himself, the vice president outlined his
accomplishments ''as president'' and quickly corrected the error:
''As vice president, I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush dabbled with state business in Austin, Texas, and met with
Secret Service officials about their plans to take over for state
police who have been protecting him. He had already voted for
himself by absentee ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's parents, former President Bush and first lady Barbara
Bush, voted for their son in Houston. The elder Bush had trouble
expressing his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gets down to family and how lucky we are,'' the former
president said.
</P>
<P>
   Politics runs in both families. Gore is the son of the late Sen.
Albert Gore Sr., a critic of the Vietnam War and early convert to
civil rights who lost his Tennessee seat in 1970. The elder Gore
once bragged that his son was raised to succeed in presidential
politics.

<HEADLINE> Dow, Nasdaq Close Lower  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index sustained its
second-worst point drop in history Tuesday, as losses for
pacesetting biotechnology companies spilled over to a broad range
of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq fell 200.61, or 4.1 percent, to close at 4,706.63.
With Monday's 141-point loss, the Nasdaq has shed 6.8 percent in
two sessions; Tuesday's drop was second only to a 229.46-point
slide on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrials followed the Nasdaq, giving up early
gains and closing down 135.89 at 9,811.24. Selling pressure
accelerated in the final half-hour of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Broader market measures also surrendered early gains to finish
lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 24.47 to 1,359.15 and the
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies plunged 17.15 to 572.99.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech stocks plunged, pulling the rest of the Nasdaq, after
the United States and Britain agreed to openly share data from a
project to decode the human genetic pattern. The agreement halts
several companies' plans to sell genetic data to drugmakers and
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Incyte Pharmaceuticals skidded 53{ to 143{ and Human Genome
Sciences fell 29 3/64. PE Corp.'s Celera Genomics tumbled 47 to 142
on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that while some companies will struggle to find
other sources of revenue, most biotechnology business are involved
in a wide range of projects and won't be adversely affected by the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a bit of an overreaction,'' said Dr. Joseph
Zammit-Lucia, president of Cambridge Pharma Consultancy. ''It's a
little bit of correction in a frothy market.''
</P>
<P>
   Biotech stocks have been among the strongest performers in the
Nasdaq's sharp rise this year, leaving them especially vulnerable
to profit-taking, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get something that's gone up to that extent, you're
going to get violent shakeouts,'' said Don Selkin, chief investment
strategist at Joseph Gunnar in New York. ''This year, people are
going to have to get used to the volatility.''
</P>
<P>
   As biotech stocks fell, other technology groups succumbed to
profit-taking. Applied Materials, a leading maker of equipment used
in the semiconductor industry, fell 9 3/16 to 178}. Apple Computer
fell 7 1/16 to 114\ and 3Com fell 9{ to 54 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's losses highlighted the extraordinary fluctuations in
the technology-dominated Nasdaq. In the year to date, the index is
up 16 percent, while both the Dow and the S&AMP;P are down. Yet eight
of the Nasdaq's 10 biggest point drops have occurred this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not saying it's straight up, but overall, I think (the
Nasdaq) is the place to be,'' Selkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were not significantly affected by the latest evidence
that the economy continues to grow rapidly. The Commerce Department
reported retail sales rose by 1.1 percent in February. With
Americans continuing to spend freely, feeding the surging economy,
many analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates
when they meet next week.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Vitner, economist at First Union Securities, noted that the
retail sales report is less crucial to the Fed than a pair of
reports due out later this week: the Producer Price Index and the
Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   Fears that those reports will show signs of renewed inflation
may be keeping investors off-balance this week. If the Fed does
raise rates at its meeting, it would be the fifth increase since
last June, and the market expects company profits to start showing
the effects of higher borrowing costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's weakest component was Alcoa, which fell 6 13/16 to 61\
after agreeing to buy Cordant Technologies Inc., a major supplier
of aluminum airplane parts and solid-fuel rockets, for $2.3 billion
in cash. Analysts said investors were afraid Alcoa was paying too
much for Cordant.
</P>
<P>
   Cordant shares rose 25{ to 55 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
NYSE, where composite volume totaled 1.33 billion shares, compared
with 1.24 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.3 percent,
narrowing its losses from Monday, when it fell 2.8 percent on the
news that the nation's gross domestic product declined for a second
consecutive quarter. The report, which meant Japan's economy is
officially back in recession, has contributed to weakness on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 0.6 percent, Britain's
FT-SE 100 rose 0.3 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Aid House Buyers  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Banking Committee approved sweeping
legislation Tuesday designed to make the dream of home ownership
more attainable for millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Expected for a House floor vote this spring, ''The American
Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000'' would allow
for reduced down payments for FHA home loans for teachers, as well
as police, fire and other uniformed municipal employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''This completes the last piece of the housing agenda,'' said
Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y. as the committee unanimously passed H.R.
1776 amid an air of bipartisanship. Democrats and Republicans
thanked each other for working through their differences on the
proposed legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have produced a very good bill,'' said Rep. John LaFalce,
D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would authorize 1 percent down for FHA mortgage loans
and defers the 2.25 percent up-front FHA premium charged for such
loans until the loan is repaid.
</P>
<P>
   A first-time borrower purchasing a $130,000 home would see their
down payment reduced from $6,300 to $1,300.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm excited about this bill and the homeownership
opportunities it will create,'' said Rep. Darlene Hooley, D-Ore.
''In a lot of communities, teachers and police officers can't
afford to live where they work.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also make it easier for seniors to purchase
long-term care insurance through an FHA reverse mortgage home
program by waiving an up-front fee usually charged by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the bill would allow public housing authorities to
provide low-income housing residents one-time grants for home
purchase down payments instead of monthly Section 8 for rental
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   While the strong economy is credited with boosting home
ownership rates to an all-time high of more than 66 percent,
stubborn gaps exist between sectors of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The rate for whites is at 72.5 percent compared with 45 percent
for blacks and 44 percent for Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the African American and Hispanic communities, for example,
many working families are priced out of the real estate market,''
Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also authorize $25 million in grants for
Homeownership Zones, programs targeted to help low and middle
income people buy homes in large developments to revitalize poor
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require the Department of Housing and Urban
Development to offer some underutilized properties to local
governments or community groups at below market rate prices.

<HEADLINE> Shaw's Supermarkets workers authorize strike  </HEADLINE>
dsfonsho
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Cashiers, clerks, butchers and other
workers at 21 Shaw's Supermarkets around the state Tuesday
authorized a strike over a contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,000 workers will not walk off the job, but their 2-to-1
vote for a strike will be used in a grievance against the company,
union leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   The contract with the United Food and Commercial Workers Union
local 371 expired Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
   A new contract was ratified two weeks later, with wage increases
and more benefits, including pensions and health care for full- and
part-time workers.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, the company and the union have differed on
exactly what the new contract provides.
</P>
<P>
   The company initially agreed the new contract would mean raises
of up to $2.50 an hour for some lower-paid part-time workers and up
to $2 for some full-time workers, said local union president Brian
Petronella.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the company told the union the raises would not
be that large under the new contract, Petronella said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to file a formal grievance on behalf of all
members regarding the company's failure to implement what was
negotiated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's spokesman Bernard Rogan, however, said the company is
interpreting the contract correctly, while the union is not.
</P>
<P>
   ''The union officials apparently misunderstood the proposal,''
Rogan said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's strike authorization vote is a violation of the
current and former contract, Rogan said. He did not say what the
company would do about the alleged violation.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes to sit back down with the union to ''help them
better understand, since they missed it the first time. It's still
a very good contract,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The union planned to file the grievance with the American
Arbitration Association in Hartford. The case will go to
arbitration if no resolution is reached in 30 days, Petronella
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm prepared to strike, but I'd rather have them go by what
they said in the contract,'' said 20-year-old Adam Ripka of
Stratford, a part-time produce clerk at Shaw's in Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's is based in East Bridgewater, Mass. Its Connecticut
stores are in Bridgeport, Bristol, Clinton, Enfield, Fairfield,
Glastonbury, Hamden, Manchester, New Britain, New Haven, Newington,
Orange, Shelton, Southington, Stratford, Vernon, Wallingford,
Waterbury, Waterford, West Hartford and Willimantic.

By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- America's forgotten war will be
forgotten no longer -- at least not in New Jersey. Construction on a
Korean War Memorial is underway.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 Korean War veterans, survivors and friends turned
out Tuesday for the groundbreaking for the $2.5 million memorial to
nearly 800 New Jersey men and women who were killed or lost in the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers plan a brisk construction schedule: A dedication
ceremony is set for July 27.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be a magnificent edifice, a magnificent
tribute to the sacrifices you've made,'' Mayor James Whelan told
war veterans during a sun-splashed ceremony in Brighton Park.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial, which is being built at the intersection of
Boardwalk and Park Place, will feature a 12-foot statue of a
mourning soldier, clutching dog tags. To his left, two soldiers and
a nurse will be seen emerging through a sheet of water that
cascades into a reflecting pool.
</P>
<P>
   Also planned is an eternal flame above a wall featuring the
names of the New Jersey people who died or were missing in action
during the conflict, which lasted from 1950 to 1953.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great that they'll be remembered, especially at such a
prominent location. People from all over the world are going to see
this monument,'' said Bob Moore, 69, of Estell Manor, who served in
the U.S. Navy in the war and was on hand Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some veterans from northern New Jersey had lobbied to have the
memorial built somewhere closer to them. But supporters said the
location, just off the world-famous Boardwalk, was better because
it guarantees pedestrian traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like it right here,'' said Jim Skramovsky, 68, of Elizabeth,
a Korean War veteran. ''More people visit this Boardwalk than go to
Disney World, they tell me. This is the place for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The city donated the land and the casinos, through the state
Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, gave $1 million for the
project. Donations are still being collected to make up a $500,000
shortfall, according to Col. Mike Warner, deputy commissioner of
the state Department of Military and Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are always asking me why we wanted a memorial,'' said
Larry St. Laurent, chairman of the Memorial committee. ''I didn't
want a memorial. I've got it in my head. I wanted it for the
families of those who never came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Maj. Donald Driscoll of Egg Harbor Township, who
disappeared in Korea in December 1950.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, sister-in-law and nephew attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always been known as the forgotten war, but I don't think
it will be forgotten now,'' said Roland Driscoll, his 80-year-old
brother.
</P>
<P>
   For many victims' family members, though, the recognition comes
too late.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad we're finally getting one, I just wish it had
happened sooner, so the mothers and fathers could've seen it,''
said Hector Cafferata, 70, who won the Medal of Honor. ''It's a
little late.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Defends Occidental Link  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MILLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTHAGE, Tenn. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore defended his
family's ownership of stock in an oil company that plans to drill
on land near a Colombian Indian reserve, saying Tuesday ''there
certainly is not'' anything wrong with the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign for the presidency, Gore has been dogged by
protesters upset about his connection to Occidental Petroleum Corp.
His father, the late former Sen. Albert Gore Sr., had served on the
board, owned stock in the company and served as chief executive of
a subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters with Amazon Watch and other groups have urged Gore to
divest his family of the stock, worth as much as $500,000, which
was among the elder Gore's assets when he died last December.
</P>
<P>
   ''According to his will, that was put into a trust fund to
benefit my mother for the remainder of her life and I was named
executor of his will,'' Gore told Tennessee reporters. He was asked
about the subject after voting at an elementary school near his
farm.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have legal obligations as executor that are very stringent.
I have to comply with the provisions of the will,'' Gore said. ''If
you can find anything wrong with that, please tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said he once leased mineral rights on his Smith County
farm to Occidental but that they have been resold several times to
other companies. He was asked whether it was true he received 10
times the normal reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, it's not true,'' Gore said, adding that the original lease
was signed four years before he ran for Congress and three years
after his father was defeated in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a free market arrangement and it doesn't even involve
Occidental Petroleum,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his family's involvement with Occidental began after his
father's 1970 defeat when Gore Sr. opened a law firm and Occidental
became a client.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's government last September granted Occidental the
right to conduct exploratory drilling a few miles outside the legal
boundaries of the U'wa reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The U'wa believe oil exploration would bring violence and
destroy their culture. In 1997, the group threatened mass suicide
to discourage drilling.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, police used tear gas on U'wa members who were
blocking a rural highway near the eastern border with Venezuela to
protest Occidental's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was asked whether he thought there was anything wrong with
his family's relationship with Los Angeles-based Occidental.
''There certainly is not,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Occidental also is a major contributor to both political
parties, giving $418,164 to the Democrats and $404,350 to the
Republicans since 1993.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Files Complaint Against EU  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States filed a complaint against
the European Union Tuesday, claiming it is unfairly discriminating
against engine mufflers that help older American passenger jets
meet noise standards.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy State Department spokesman James Foley said the complaint
and a request to resolve the long-standing dispute was filed with
the International Civil Aviation Organization in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said the United States remains ready to negotiate to
resolve the issue if the EU suspends its rules and seeks new
international noise standards at the aviation organization.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint seeks the repeal of the EU's noise rules, which
have been adopted but are not slated to take effect until May 4.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States encourages EU member states to join us in
the commitment to uniform global environmental standards for civil
aviation,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the dispute is the use of engine mufflers known
as ''hush kits.''
</P>
<P>
   EU officials say the kits, which reduce noise pollution, do not
meet standards set by the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say the EU rules discriminate against the U.S.
aircraft industry and that Europeans have spurned attempts at
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   If the European regulations are not relaxed, American officials
contend, the U.S. industry faces the potential loss of more than $2
billion, in part because U.S. aircraft equipped with hush kits that
don't meet the European standard won't sell in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   John W. Douglass, president and chief executive officer of the
Aerospace Industries Association, called the government's action
''an essential step in ensuring that agreements reached in ICAO
will provide a reliable basis on which the aviation industry can
make investment decisions that will shape the air transport system
for years to come.''

<HEADLINE> Conservative PAC to launch anti-Hillary Clinton ads  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A conservative activist from Utah said
Tuesday that his political action committee is about to launch
television ads in New York attacking Senate candidate Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not like Hillary Clinton,'' said Howard Ruff, a ''free
enterprise'' investment guru who has previously helped financed
conservative political causes through his Virginia-based Ruffpac
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a liberal ideologue ... I don't want her to have a power
base in the United States Senate,'' Ruff added.
</P>
<P>
   According to the weekly New York Observer, which reports on the
Ruffpac ads in its Wednesday editions, one of the ads features a
shot of babies and puppies frolicking in New York's Central Park
with a Hillary Clinton-like figure glowering down at them.
</P>
<P>
   ''What do these babies and puppies have in common?'' the ad
asks. ''They have all lived in New York longer than Hillary Rodham
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is running against New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani for the Senate, moved into a house in suburban Westchester
County in January. She had never lived in New York before that.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said Giuliani should
''tell his right-wing friends to stay out of this election.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Right-wing, special-interest groups from around the country
are determined to elect Rudy Giuliani to the Senate because they
know he will be a reliable vote,'' Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said the ad campaign would be run independently of the
Giuliani campaign because coordination would illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on his fund-raising success, Ruff said he hoped to
keep the anti-Clinton spots running throughout the Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's very, very smart and she's tougher than nails,'' Ruff
added.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Giuliani's suppport for abortion and gay
rights, and for gun control, Ruff said there are issues he does not
agree with Giuliani on.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not Hillary Clinton -- that's the best thing about him.''
Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   Several other conservative groups have already aired
anti-Clinton TV spots in New York.

<HEADLINE> N. Ireland's Peace Deadline Dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- A May deadline in Northern
Ireland's peace agreement for paramilitary groups to disarm is
effectively dead, the leader of the Irish Republican Army's
political allies said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant unionist politicians quickly accused Sinn Fein
President Gerry Adams of throwing away the only explicit deadline
in the landmark Good Friday agreement reached two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he had little hope that the impasse over disarmament
would be resolved. The IRA's refusal to make any commitment or
gesture on arms prompted Britain to suspend Northern Ireland's new
government on Feb. 11 to avoid a walkout by the pro-British Ulster
Unionist Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears very, very obvious that that May 22 deadline no
longer exists,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Other parties were responsible for the deadlock by having
''totally and absolutely confused and subverted the entire
process'' by making demands that were not part of the agreement,
Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McGimpsey, a senior member of the Ulster Unionist Party,
responded that May 22 was ''the only firm date'' included in the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the republican movement is abandoning this important date,
then they must be abandoning their support for the Good Friday
agreement,'' McGimpsey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Good Friday agreement had pleaded with all the parties ''to
use any influence they may have'' to get paramilitaries to dispose
of their arms by May 22, the second anniversary of the referendum
on the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein is under the most pressure on this issue, because of
its close links to the IRA. No other party linked to a paramilitary
group won a seat in the new Northern Ireland assembly.

<HEADLINE> Study: Cab Drivers Have Big Brains  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Anyone who's ever taken a taxi in London must have
wondered how the city's cabbies know how to reach even the most
obscure destination without a street map or a hint from their
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   A new study indicates cabbies are working their brains so hard
they become enlarged in the zone associated with navigation -- the
rear hippocampus.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that the drivers' brains adapted to help them store a
detailed mental map of the city, shrinking in one area to allow
growth in another, according to the study, published Tuesday in the
journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that the brain is physically able to change according
to the way it is used could have important implications for people
with brain damage or brain diseases such as Alzheimer's, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in size of parts of the brain have previously been
linked to brain exercises in monkeys and rats. Scientists also have
reported differences in the structure of the brain between
musicians and non-musicians.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest study, researchers at University College, London
University compared the brains of 16 male taxi drivers with those
of 50 other men of a similar age. They found that among the
cabbies, the back of the hippocampus, the part of the brain
associated with spatial memory, was larger than it was in the
comparison group.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed the expansion came at the expense of the front of the
hippocampus, which was smaller than normal. Scientists do not know
exactly what that part of the brain does.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very interesting because we now see there can be
structural changes in healthy human brains,'' said the study's lead
author, Dr. Eleanor Maguire, a neurologist at University College.
</P>
<P>
   London taxi drivers are renowned for their encyclopedic
knowledge of the capital's streets. They spend an average of two
years learning the layout of the city's roads by heart before
taking a test to get their licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The study tried to determine whether the drivers' brains were
different because they had to tap their navigation ability more
than other people, thereby causing their brain to change, or
whether they are good at remembering streets because that part of
their brain is enlarged.
</P>
<P>
   ''There seems to be a definite relationship between the
navigating they do as a taxi driver and the brain changes,''
Maguire said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings indicate it is more likely that exercising that
part of the brain heavily can lead to changes in its size, because
cabbies who had been on the job 40 years had a larger rear
hippocampus than those who had started more recently, said Malcolm
Brown, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at England's Bristol
University, who was not connected with the study.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the implication down the line would be that an
inactive brain may well eventually lead to loss of brain
function,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire noted it has long been thought that if damage occurs to
the brain, there is only a limited amount of adaptability in an
adult brain that can help people recover.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now direct things in the environment, like navigation, appear
to show changes in the brain so we could in the future see some
rehabilitation programs that use that kind of knowledge,'' Maguire
added.

<HEADLINE> Greek Stock Exchange Plunges  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK QUINN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Hundreds of angry investors chanting ''We
want our money back'' gathered Tuesday outside the Athens Stock
Exchange after shares took another plunge in a crisis that is
growing increasingly political ahead of elections.
</P>
<P>
   Riot squads stood ready to protect the exchange and stock
brokers fled out the back door of the building after the market's
general index dropped 6.6 percent, or 320.90 points, to close at
4542.65 -- its lowest point since August.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lost not only my money, but the money of my clients who will
one day kill me,'' said Lambros Yannoulis, a 57-year-old investment
adviser with a major insurance company who joined about 350
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the crowd chanted ''they are robbing us'' and ''they
turned us into Albania,'' a reference to failed pyramid schemes
that in 1997 led to widespread chaos in Greece's northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The plummet of the once-booming exchange came as President
Costis Stephanopoulos ordered parliament dissolved to prepare for
general elections on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago, Athens was one of the world's hottest markets.
Premier Costas Simitis called early elections last month to take
advantage of the healthy economic climate. Nearly 1 million Greeks
-- about one-tenth of the population -- are thought to own shares.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been at a loss to curb the slide, which comes
as other regional stock markets remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition parties accuse the government of harnessing the
market for political gain by promoting stocks during a boom in
early and mid-1999. Thousands of investors suffered huge losses
when the exchange suddenly began deflating late last year, a result
of the government's earlier enthusiasm for the market, the
opposition says.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Aids House Buyers  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Banking Committee approved sweeping
legislation Tuesday designed to make the dream of home ownership
more attainable for millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Expected for a House floor vote this spring, ''The American
Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000'' would allow
for reduced down payments for FHA home loans for teachers, as well
as police, fire and other uniformed municipal employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''This completes the last piece of the housing agenda,'' said
Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y. as the committee unanimously passed H.R.
1776 amid an air of bipartisanship. Democrats and Republicans
thanked each other for working through their differences on the
proposed legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have produced a very good bill,'' said Rep. John LaFalce,
D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would authorize 1 percent down for FHA mortgage loans
and defers the 2.25 percent up-front FHA premium charged for such
loans until the loan is repaid.
</P>
<P>
   A first-time borrower purchasing a $130,000 home would see their
down payment reduced from $6,300 to $1,300.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm excited about this bill and the homeownership
opportunities it will create,'' said Rep. Darlene Hooley, D-Ore.
''In a lot of communities, teachers and police officers can't
afford to live where they work.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also make it easier for seniors to purchase
long-term care insurance through an FHA reverse mortgage home
program by waiving an up-front fee usually charged by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the bill would allow public housing authorities to
provide low-income housing residents one-time grants for home
purchase down payments instead of monthly Section 8 for rental
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   While the strong economy is credited with boosting home
ownership rates to an all-time high of more than 66 percent,
stubborn gaps exist between sectors of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The rate for whites is at 72.5 percent compared with 45 percent
for blacks and 44 percent for Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the African American and Hispanic communities, for example,
many working families are priced out of the real estate market,''
Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also authorize $25 million in grants for
Homeownership Zones, programs targeted to help low and middle
income people buy homes in large developments to revitalize poor
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require the Department of Housing and Urban
Development to offer some underutilized properties to local
governments or community groups at below market rate prices.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Denounce IMF Meetings  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Opponents of globalization of the world
economy threatened Tuesday to try to shut down meetings of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank next month, but said
they wanted to avoid the violence that paralyzed Seattle during
last year's World Trade Organization session.
</P>
<P>
   Both institutions said they were prepared to talk with the
protesters but were drawing up contingency plans to prevent
disruptions of their sessions here on April 16 and 17 that draw
finance ministers, central bank governors and other officials from
182 nations.
</P>
<P>
   The activists said they expected tens of thousands of people
from around the United States and abroad to come to the capital for
demonstrations that will include blocking streets or buildings in
an effort to prevent officials from attending their meetings.
</P>
<P>
   They will also hold teach-ins, parades with giant puppets
ridiculing the IMF and World Bank from April 9-17 to build on the
momentum they said they established in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   They will lobby members of Congress on their opposition to the
globalization of the world economy, as well on issues such as debt
forgiveness for the world's poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   The protest groups view the IMF and the World Bank, both based
in Washington, as institutions whose programs have failed these
countries while enriching corporations and degrading the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators, including U.S. labor unions, will use the
occasion to fight the Clinton administration's efforts to secure
congressional approval of normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   One of the organizers, Nadine Block of the Mobilization for
Global Justice, the umbrella group for more than 250 organizations
involved, said, ''nonviolence and no property destruction are
guidelines being emphasized in training sessions'' for those who
will lead the protests.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a news conference if officials would be blocked in
their hotels as they were in Seattle, Block replied, ''It's
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Graylan Hagler, a minister at the Plymouth Congregation of the
United Church of Christ in Washington, said he was concerned about
reports District of Columbia police had received riot control
equipment and training.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are committed to nonviolence but we hope the police are
equally committed to protecting the rights of free speech,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   District police said they have put together a team to prepare
for the demonstrators and will not allow the capital to be shut
down. Police Chief Charles Ramsey has attended a recent FBI seminar
on the lessons of the Seattle disorder.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the National Press Club, World Bank President
James Wolfensohn defended his organization's record, admitting some
mistakes had been made but a lot of good had been done as well.
</P>
<P>
   Replying to a question about the planned protests, he said
''Demonstrating is useful but I would prefer sorting things out in
discussions.'' He has met several times in the past with
nongovernment organizations critical of the bank.
</P>
<P>
   IMF spokesman Thomas Dawson said, ''We are reaching out and look
forward to talking to anyone who wants to talk to us. We have
attempted to maintain a dialogue and some (groups) do respond.''
</P>
<P>
   He said these efforts would continue but as a precaution the
IMF, which organizes the spring meetings, had held talks with local
authorities to develop contingency plans if protesters try to shut
down the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson and other IMF officials have declined to go into detail
on security arrangements but said they have to be sensitive given
what happened in Seattle.

<HEADLINE> EU, U.S. Reach Deal on Data Privacy  </HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union and U.S. negotiators
reached a breakthrough in the data protection negotiations Tuesday,
making it possible for a trans-Atlantic deal on the contentious
issue to be concluded over the summer, EU officials said.
</P>
<P>
   EU chief negotiator John Mogg said he will recommend that the EU
parliament and member states back a so-called safe-harbor agreement
that would allow U.S. industry to conduct business with Europe
under strict data privacy conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once definitively agreed by all the parties concerned, this
package will facilitate trans-Atlantic information flows by
providing legal certainty for operators and the safeguards
consumers demand to protect their privacy,'' Internal Market
Commissioner Frits Bolkestein said.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 data-privacy law gives EU nations the right to halt
certain information from being sent to countries that do not have
adequate data protection. The United States relies mainly on a
self-regulating system.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed accord, U.S. companies that agree to the safe
harbor guidelines would be regarded as being in compliance with EU
privacy concerns, Mogg said. U.S. companies would guarantee
''adequate protection'' standards when dealing with data from the
15-nation EU.
</P>
<P>
   During the talks, one key problem was solved, namely the way in
which the principles of data protection will be enforced in the
United States. Agreement was also found on the possible sanctions
for non-compliance, EU officials said, though they did not provide
details.
</P>
<P>
   ''Safe harbors now looks set to become a reality,'' Mogg said.
''Companies are free to join as soon as this goes into effect,
around July or August,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The EU had agreed to postpone the data-privacy law's
implementation during the negotiations and Mogg said that he did
not anticipate any problem in data flows until the accord gets
final EU approval.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the general agreement on data flows, the two sides did
not include financial services in the safe harbor accord because
new U.S. legislation on data privacy in the sector was not in
place.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're reserving judgment on financial services until the
legislation is sorted out,'' Mogg said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government is still drafting rules protecting consumer
information under landmark banking legislation enacted last
November.
</P>
<P>
   David Aaron, U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce for International
Trade, said the two sides will continue talks on financial services
once new data privacy rules, which are part of the Financial
Modernization Act, are in place later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The safe harbor guidelines, including the ''adequate
protection'' principle, needs the support of a qualified majority
of member states. Formal approval procedures are expected to be
launched in May, the EU Commission said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Law Limits Space Station Funds  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed a bill Tuesday that
would stop putting American money into the International Space
Station if Russian firms are found to have helped Iran develop
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Russia remains, he said, a ''valued partner'' in the space
program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he signed the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000
because it was ''less problematic'' than an earlier version that he
felt would harm global efforts to block Iran's nuclear weapons
programs. In 1998, he vetoed a stronger sanctions bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to make it clear that Russia continues to be a valued
partner in the International Space Station,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation bars ''extraordinary payments'' to Russia's
space agency for the space station unless the United States
confirms that Russia has not transferred missile technology or
nuclear, chemical or biological weapons to Iran during the previous
year. The Clinton administration had proposed paying $650 million
beyond the original amount pledged for Russia's space station.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also demands biannual reports to Congress identifying
those who transfer to Iran ''goods, services or technology'' for
nuclear weapons and gave the president the authority to deny export
licenses, government procurement and foreign assistance to those
entities.
</P>
<P>
   ''This issue remains at the top of the agenda with Russia as
well as with other countries whose companies may be providing such
assistance to Iran,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States has taken administrative action
against 10 Russian companies for transferring weapons materiel and
technology to Iran ''and stand ready to apply them again whenever
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he signed the legislation, Clinton said it duplicates
existing law in many ways. The administration will work with
Congress to reconcile the duplications, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president signed the nonproliferation bill a day after he
extended punitive sanctions against Iran for another year.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Congress, Clinton said he extended the sanctions
because Iran's support of terrorism, efforts to develop destructive
weapons and attempts to undermine the Middle East peace process
''continue to threaten the national security, foreign policy and
economy of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration, also trying to encourage reform in Iran, is
said to be considering an easing of a U.S. ban on imports of
carpets, caviar and pistachio nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sanctions can be modified at any time,'' deputy State
Department spokesman James Foley said Tuesday. ''We believe there
are important changes in Iran, and we are considering ways to
respond to those changes.''
</P>
<P>
   An announcement is expected Friday, when a senior U.S. official,
possibly Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, addresses a meeting
in Washington sponsored by the American-Iranian Council, a private
group based in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   At Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York, spokesman
Hossein Nosrat said his government had heard from press reports
that some sanctions would be lifted. ''We do not have any
information on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Foley and other administration officials declined to
confirm specifically the selective lifting of the ban on imports.
He stressed that ''important changes are occurring in Iran, and we
are considering ways to respond to those changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has offered a government-to-government
dialogue with Iran, but the Islamic government has not responded.

<HEADLINE> Man Gets $1 After Police Dog Bite  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Biting a suspect has landed a canine cop in the
doghouse with a federal jury.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors on Monday awarded $1 to Jerome Jarrett after finding that
Shadow, a Belgian Malinois, used excessive force when it made the
collar during a 1994 chase.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, then 27, had sped through Yarmouth in an unregistered
and uninsured car. He eventually crashed into a post and ran from
police. Shadow bit Jarrett on his knee, which required 12 stitches.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett eventually served seven months behind bars for violating
terms of his probation on a robbery sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Leonard Kesten, who represented the Yarmouth Police
Department, said Tuesday he would either ask the judge to overturn
the verdict or appeal it. He said it is about the principle, not
the money.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no K-9 police officer in the country or the world
that would not release a dog to chase a suspected felon, like he
was, after the guy disregards warnings,'' Kesten said. ''We can't
let these guys get away.''

<HEADLINE> Union Cited in Election Fraud Plan  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The political director for ousted Teamsters
President Ron Carey was sentenced Tuesday to three years in prison
by a judge who credited him for good deeds done prior to his
embezzlement and fraud conviction.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas P. Griesa said it would be
''unreasonable and unmerciful'' not to credit William W. Hamilton
for his devotion to public service and civil rights throughout a
30-year career.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he strayed somewhat from the federal sentencing
guidelines calling for a nearly four-year prison term as he is
permitted to do for extraordinary public service.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was convicted of authorizing $885,000 in contributions
to four political organizations in 1996 in exchange for
contributions to Carey's 1996 re-election campaign. Prosecutors
said the contributions were staggering considering the union was
nearly broke.
</P>
<P>
   Carey narrowly defeated James P. Hoffa in the election, which
was overturned after investigators found Carey's campaign
improperly benefited from donations the union made to
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Hamilton did not initiate that concept but he agreed to
play a role in it and his role was crucial,'' Griesa said. ''He
was, in effect, the gatekeeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, 57, was convicted in November of embezzlement, mail
and wire fraud and perjury. He told Griesa that his crimes were
meant to help keep the union out of the hands of those who had
corrupted it in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes when you try to do something you believe in deeply,
you do dumb things, you cross the line, you overreach,'' he said.
''I am ashamed and deeply angry at myself,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Lawmaker Attacks Forest Service  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican lawmaker sharply criticized a
memo from two environmental groups that she said indicates the
Forest Service planned to use the groups to help implement
President Clinton's plan to bar development of millions of acres of
forests.
</P>
<P>
   ''That has not merely crossed the line, it totally obliterates
the line'' between government and outside interest groups, Rep.
Helen Chenoweth-Hage, R-Idaho, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chenoweth said a Jan. 24 memo shows the Forest Service was
developing an agreement that would allow the World Wildlife Fund
and the Conservation Biology Institute to develop a process for
mapping and assessing roadless national forests, a key step in
carrying out Clinton's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members for Chenoweth's House Resources forests and forest
health subcommittee found the memo in documents the administration
handed over to satisfy the panel's request for materials related to
the president's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Through the Forest Service, the Clinton administration is
drafting a sweeping regulation to protect from development
permanently about 50 million acres of already roadless federal
forests. Congressional Republicans, recreation groups and the
timber industry want to sidetrack the initiative to keep access to
the forests.
</P>
<P>
   The memo Chenoweth's staff found is a draft of a proposal for a
$650,000 grant from the Wildlife Fund and the Biology Institute to
the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. In the memo, the groups
say they are eager to sign an agreement that would have the Forest
Service and the groups ''work together to create a sound,
science-based roadless areas assessment.'' At the Forest Service's
urging, it said, the agreement ''will be national in scope.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a huge opportunity to influence the Forest Service and
perhaps other agencies to move progressively on the roadless areas
issue and perhaps others,'' the memo says.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck said he never would sign such
an agreement and he cannot be held accountable for a memo written
by two environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's basically a suggestion on the part of someone,'' Dombeck
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dominick DellaSalla, director of the Klamath-Siskiyou regional
program for the Wildlife Fund, confirmed the authenticity of the
document. But he said the groups ultimately requested only $400,000
from the Packard foundation.
</P>
<P>
   DellaSalla said the groups were ''exaggerating for the purpose
of trying to get a foundation grant'' when they wrote the essence
of the proposed agreement was to help the Forest Service create a
sound, science-based roadless areas assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Rehmus, an associate program manager at Packard, said no
final decision has been made on the groups' request.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco To Buy Burmah Castrol  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- BP Amoco PLC has agreed to pay $4.7 billion for
one of Britain's oldest oil companies, Burmah Castrol PLC, in hope
of bolstering its share of the world market for lubricants.
</P>
<P>
   The combination announced Tuesday is expected to generate annual
savings of around $260 million by 2003, mainly through elimination
of overlapping supply services and other operations.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would result in the loss of about 1,700 jobs worldwide.
A BP Amoco spokesman said it was too soon to say where those cuts
would be made.
</P>
<P>
   London-based BP Amoco has 80,400 employees, while Burmah Castrol
has about 18,000.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco's offer of 16.75 pounds ($26.47) per share represented
a 74 percent premium over the closing price for Burmah Castrol
shares on Friday, the last day before the two companies announced
that they were in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Burmah Castrol's share price jumped 24 percent to close at 15.45
pounds ($24.41). BP Amoco shares finished trading at 536.5 pence
($8.48), down 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Burmah Castrol's board has unanimously recommended the offer to
its shareholders, although regulators in Europe and the United
States still must approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   For BP Amoco, the biggest prize of the acquisition is the
Castrol name.
</P>
<P>
   Castrol's sales have outpaced growth in the lubricants market,
especially in developing countries in Asia and Latin America, said
BP Amoco chief executive John Browne. It would become BP Amoco's
leading brand of lubricants.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies plan to merge their existing lubricants
businesses to form a new division based at Burmah Castrol's
headquarters in Swindon, England. David Baldry, now in charge of BP
Amoco's business development group, has been named to head the new
business.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco aims to sell off Burmah Castrol's chemicals division
upon completion of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco said the acquisition would result in a onetime charge
against earnings of around $390 million, to be taken this year.
Browne said he expected to complete the deal by the end of
September.
</P>
<P>
   Burmah Castrol has a colorful history, and its acquisition by BP
Amoco would be an unlikely end to a career that dates back to 1886.
</P>
<P>
   Founded as Burmah Oil, the company discovered the first
commercial quantities of oil in the Middle East. In 1909, it helped
form Anglo-Persian Oil Co. -- the precursor of British Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   Burmah acquired Castrol in 1966 but went bankrupt after fighting
in the Middle East War the following year wrecked its oil tanker
business. The Bank of England bailed the company out, and by the
1980s it had recovered and was earning most of its profits from
Castrol sales.
</P>
<P>
   BP, meanwhile, went from being a poorly managed state-owned
company to a heavyweight of British capitalism. It bought
Chicago-based Amoco Inc. in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On a separate matter, a BP Amoco spokesman declined to comment
on a report in Tuesday's Financial Times that the company was
talking with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission about the possible
sale of its Alaskan oil holdings.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco needs FTC approval to complete a planned $30 billion
buyout of Atlantic Richfield Co. The combined company would control
70 percent of Alaska's crude oil production, and the FTC worries
that it would have too much control over the supply of Alaskan
crude to West Coast refineries.

<HEADLINE> Mich. School Shooting Hearing Starts  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH ALTMAN Jr., Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- The boy accused of fatally shooting a
6-year-old girl in an elementary school told a policeman that a
classmate told him to do it, the officer testified Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As Kayla Rolland lay wounded in her first-grade classroom at
Buell Elementary School, Mount Morris Township Police Officer
Walter Greenhill asked where the gun was.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged shooter blurted out ''something to the effect of,
'(The classmate) told me to load it up and point it,''' Greenhill --
the first officer at the scene -- testified.
</P>
<P>
   Greenhill was the only person who testified before a preliminary
hearing for Jamelle A. James was adjourned. The hearing will allow
a judge to decide if there is enough evidence to try James, 19, on
an involuntary manslaughter charge in Kayla's death.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say James gave the 6-year-old boy access to the
semiautomatic handgun Kayla was shot with Feb. 29. Prosecutors have
said they will not charge the boy because he is too young to
understand his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Arthur Busch said investigators believe the
.32-caliber gun used to shoot Kayla had been left under James'
blankets in a bedroom at the house where the alleged shooter stayed
with his uncle. Authorities believe the boy took the gun to school
to scare Kayla but ended up killing her with one shot.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, defense lawyer Jeffrey Skinner
questioned why Greenhill picked up the gun instead of leaving it in
the desk. He also forced the officer to admit he did not know if
anyone else handled gun before he found it.
</P>
<P>
   No date was set for the hearing to resume.

<HEADLINE> Look At Voter Thinking in Primaries  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   A look at voter thinking in Tuesday's Southern primaries,
according to interviews at polling places conducted by Voter News
Service:
</P>
<P>
   REPUBLICANS:
</P>
<P>
   --BUSH SWEEP: As virtually the only candidate still in the race,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush took every demographic group there was to
take -- old, young, rich, poor and every religion. He took liberals,
moderates and conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   --INDEPENDENTS: Even though he's no longer running, Sen. John
McCain got votes from more than 20 percent of independent and
Democratic voters. He had similar support from liberal and moderate
voters.
</P>
<P>
   --BUSH SMARTS: About one in 10 voters said Bush does not have the
knowledge needed to serve as president, a much lower figure than in
earlier primaries when more independents were voting. Among
independents voting Tuesday, about one in five said he did not have
the necessary knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   --BUSH IN TEXAS: Bush did particularly well in his home state,
with nine in 10 GOP voters holding a favorable view of their
governor. Half of voters, both Republicans and Democrats, said Bush
was more conservative as presidential candidate than he was in
1998, when he won a landslide re-election as governor.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS:
</P>
<P>
   --GORE SWEEP: As the only candidate in the race, Vice President
Al Gore won with every group -- old and young, men and women, rich
and poor. He did particularly well among the nearly one-quarter of
voters who are black, taking 95 percent of their votes.
</P>
<P>
   --THEY REALLY LIKE HIM: Across the South, eight in 10 voters had
a favorable view of Gore. He faced his toughest road in Oklahoma
and Louisiana, where a fourth of voters said they had an
unfavorable view.
</P>
<P>
   --BRADLEY IN LOUISIANA: In Louisiana, Bill Bradley was taking
nearly three in 10 votes, running particularly strongly among
whites, conservatives and the poorest voters. Those Bradley voters
said they favored Bush over Gore in November, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   --GORE IN TENNESSEE: Gore walked away with nearly unanimous votes
of every group in his home state. And virtually all the Democratic
voters said they would support him in November.
</P>
<P>
   --CLINTON BACKLASH: Nearly four in 10 voters in the Democratic
primaries disapproved of President Clinton as a person, and about a
quarter of those voted for Bradley, though he had already dropped
out of the race. Just 15 percent disapproved of the job Clinton is
doing, and they split their votes between Gore and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   NOVEMBER MATCH-UP
</P>
<P>
   In each state, voters were asked whom they would support in the
fall Bush-Gore matchup. Across the board, exit polls found Bush in
a stronger position than Gore:
</P>
<P>
   --More than one in 10 Democratic voters said they would vote for
Bush, twice the portion of Republicans who said they'd cross over
to support Gore.
</P>
<P>
   --More than 20 percent of Democrats said they had a favorable
view of Bush. Half as many Republicans had a favorable view of
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   --Bush was attracting nearly a third of conservative Democrats.
Gore was attracting less than a fourth of the liberal Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   --Half the Democrats who voted for Bradley said they would vote
for Bush in the fall. Fewer than four in 10 of McCain voters said
they would vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   --Democrats who said they would vote for Bush tended to be
wealthier, more conservative and younger than the typical
Democratic voter. They were more likely to be white and more likely
to dislike Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   --Republicans who said they would vote for Gore tended to be
younger, poorer, more liberal and more likely to be Hispanic than
the typical GOP voter.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls were conducted by the Voter News Service, a
consortium of The Associated Press and the television networks, at
selected precincts in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma,
Tennessee and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 3,572 voters in the GOP primaries had an error
margin of plus or minus 2 percentage points, and the poll of 2,855
voters in the Democratic primaries had an error margin of plus or
minus 2.5 points. Margins of error are larger for subgroups,
including individual states.

<HEADLINE> Consolidated Looks To Boost Stock  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Consolidated Stores Corp., parent of the
K-B Toy store chain, said Tuesday it has hired an investment
banking firm to analyze its strategic alternatives to boost its
stock price and increase shareholder value.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make sure we're looking at the right things
strategically to get the best value possible,'' Michael Potter,
chief financial officer, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston will review the structure of
Consolidated's businesses and recommend ways to improve operations.
Possibilities include restructuring, divestitures or combinations
or a stock buyback, the company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it still intends to go forward with an initial
public offering of shares in its KBkids.com unit.
</P>
<P>
   Potter stressed that Consolidated Stores is not struggling
financially but needs to examine operations because the company's
management believes its stock price is undervalued.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not an expression of weakness, it's an expression of
strength,'' Potter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbus-based company specializes in toys and close-out
merchandise and operates K-B Toy stores, Odd Lots and Big Lots.

<HEADLINE> NY Governor To Plan Gun Legislation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki said Tuesday he will
propose sweeping gun-control legislation, including mandatory
trigger locks for guns sold in New York state and the ballistic
''fingerprinting'' of firearms by manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he would also call for the minimum age for handgun
purchases in New York to be raised from 18 to 21, a ban on assault
weapons and for instant background checks of gun buyers at flea
markets and gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a crime scene people don't leave the gun very often but
they do leave bullets or shell casings,'' Pataki told ABC News
Tuesday, ''and what we would have now is a tool where the police
could check the ballistic DNA of that bullet or shell casing
against every gun that would be sold here in New York state.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki scheduled a news conference Wednesday in New York City to
propose the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's proposals would require gun makers to fire all guns
before they are sold and to record the telltale markings the
barrels make on bullets. That information -- likened to fingerprints
in humans -- would be stored in a state computer that authorities
could use to match against bullets and shell casings found at
scenes of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association has been opposed to the taking of
bullet samples for the government, contending that it is a
preliminary step toward national gun registration. A spokesman for
the NRA did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   All the provisions the Republican governor will propose have
been supported in the past in some form by the Democrat-dominated
state Assembly. But the Republican state Senate, despite proposals
from some of its majority members, has not approved any of the
anti-gun measures.

<HEADLINE> Accused Nazi Camp Guard Seeks $5M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Alleged Nazi death camp guard John Demjanjuk
has filed a lawsuit claiming the federal government's investigation
of him dating back to the late 1970s is torture.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed Friday in U.S. District Court, seeks at least
$5 million in damages from the Justice Department and its
Nazi-hunting Office of Special Investigations, and asks that the
case against him be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations being made against him amount to ''torture upon the
person of John Demjanjuk by harassing him and his family,'' the
counterclaim contends.
</P>
<P>
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk lost his U.S. citizenship in 1981
then regained it in 1998. In May, the Justice Department filed a
civil complaint seeking to revoke the 79-year-old Demjanjuk's
citizenship again because he allegedly failed to disclose a past as
a guard at Nazi concentration camps during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Demjanjuk's counterclaim alleges he never assisted the Nazis.
Demjanjuk has said he was forced by the Nazis to work as a laborer
after being taken prisoner by the Germans in May 1942.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the retired autoworker was sentenced to die in Israel
after being convicted as the Treblinka death camp guard ''Ivan the
Terrible.'' He was freed five years later when evidence indicated
he was a victim of mistaken identity.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bush Winning McCain's Backers  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush holds a slight advantage among
likely voters in the presidential race against Al Gore and is
drawing more of the John McCain supporters that both he and Gore
are aggressively trying to attract, according to a poll released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor has 49 percent to 43 percent for Gore in the
CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll. Other recent polls have shown the race
very close or with the vice president slightly ahead, but many of
them polled registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   Narrowing the poll to likely voters often improves the numbers
of the Republican candidate, but in this poll the margins for
registered voters and likely voters were very similar.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore effectively wrapped up the Republican and
Democratic nominations for president last week. Bush bested Sen.
McCain of Arizona, who has suspended his campaign, while Gore
defeated former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who has withdrawn
and endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The poll taken Friday through Sunday of 1,006 people had an
error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points for the entire
sample, plus or minus 5 percentage points for the sample of 502
likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   If Reform Party contender Pat Buchanan is included in the mix,
Bush has 47 percent and Gore has 43 percent, while Buchanan draws 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Likely voters were about evenly divided on whether they would
support a Democratic or Republican candidate for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appeal was strongest among men, whites and suburban
dwellers. Gore was strongest among women, minorities, voters over
age 65, urban residents and those with family incomes less than
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll found Bush picking up more of the McCain
supporters:
</P>
<P>
   -- McCain Republicans went 80 percent for Bush to 14 percent for
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   -- McCain independents broke 46 percent for Bush to 37 percent
for Gore -- a slight Bush advantage.
</P>
<P>
   -- McCain Democrats favored Gore by 76 percent to 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bush were viewed favorably by about six of 10
Americans. Both were seen as having the knowledge necessary to
serve as president by more than seven in 10 people.
</P>
<P>
   They were evenly matched on the question of who would do the
best job of handling the economy, foreign affairs and the gun
issue. Gore was given better marks on the environment, education,
heath care, Social Security, campaign finance reform and
representing the interests of women. Bush was given the nod on
taxes, improving the country's moral climate, crime and the rising
price of gasoline and fuel oil.

<HEADLINE> Magazine Co. Fined For Van Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A magazine subscription company that
employed seven young people killed in a van crash was fined $15,050
for child labor violations involving a survivor who was paralyzed,
the Labor Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Still pending is a state agency's recommendation for more than
$200,000 in fines against the company as a result of the crash on
March 25, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Forgues, 15, an employee of Subscriptions Plus, was
paralyzed in the accident just after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''This young woman should not, by law, have been in that van at
that hour,'' Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman said in a statement.
''One of the department's priorities is to ensure that when youth
work, they do so safely and legally.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen- and 15-year-olds are prohibited from working later
than 7 p.m. during the school year or later than 9 p.m. in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Seven people were killed and five seriously injured in the crash
filled with 14 young people selling magazine subscriptions door to
door.
</P>
<P>
   Driver Jeremy Holmes of Clinton, Iowa, didn't have a valid
driver's license in Wisconsin and panicked when he saw a police
officer about to pull him over for speeding, police said. He tried
to switch places with a passenger and lost control of the van,
according to a criminal complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide and was sentenced to
seven years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Weather System Pushed in Africa  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- In the wake of devastating floods, the
leaders of seven southern African nations on Tuesday urged creation
of a regional system to forecast and deal with natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   While the hardest hit, Mozambique is just one of the nations in
the region that has been battered by heavy rains and flooding.
Relief efforts in the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar gained
momentum Tuesday as food-laden French military helicopters and
other aircraft delivered aid to flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
   Floods have also chased hundreds from their homes in South
Africa, and have washed away more than 10,000 homes in Botswana.
</P>
<P>
   The heads of state said the region's economic development was at
risk unless an early-warning system was established to alert
residents of storms. They appealed to international donors to fund
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Competent disaster management must be an integral part of
common efforts for development,'' Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano said.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains in the past two months have devastated southern
Africa, particularly central and southern Mozambique, where
flooding together with two cyclones have killed at least 492
people, left 330,000 homeless and caused an estimated
quarter-billion dollars in damage to roads, bridges and public
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   While international aid groups say thousands of people may have
been killed in flooding, the final death toll might not go that
high because South African military helicopters rescued more than
14,600 stranded people.
</P>
<P>
   The heads of state appealed to the international community to
cancel all foreign debts owed by Mozambique to enable it to channel
its money into rebuilding the southeast African country.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique's own problems were compounded by its location. Nine
of Mozambique's 15 rivers originate in neighboring countries, where
overgrazing and other poor land management has sapped the soil's
ability to absorb water, leading in recent years to more flooding
downstream.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. special envoy Ross Mountain said Tuesday the United Nations
and the Mozambican government would issue a new appeal later this
week for reconstruction funds for Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly $65 million raised from a joint U.N.-Mozambique appeal on
Feb. 23 has already been spent, Mountain said.
</P>
<P>
   Donors have pledged at least $108 million in relief aid for
Mozambique. The amount excludes the cost of aid operations by the
militaries of South Africa and at least six Western nations,
including the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appealed to donor countries to
give Mozambique ''as much help as possible, and as soon as
possible.'' He said Mozambique had a been an ''inspiring example''
of progress in Africa before the disaster struck.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's summit in Maputo was held under the aegis of the
Southern African Development Community. Presidents Thabo Mbeki of
South Africa, Bakili Muluzi of Malawi, Sam Nujoma of Namibia,
Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania, Frederick Chiluba of Zambia and Festus
Mogae of Botswana were among those who attended.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the U.N. Development Program and the National
Institute for Mine Clearance in Mozambique announced an emergency
plan to help clear land mines that may have been displaced by the
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 2 million mines were left over from Mozambique's 16-year
civil war, and authorities fear that areas previously considered
safe may now be littered with mines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The flooding has changed the whole basis for our demining work
in the affected areas,'' the UNDP representative in Mozambique,
Emmanuel de Casterle, said in a statement released at U.N.
headquarters in New York.

Parliament Gives Aboriginals Say
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Aboriginals will have a say on whether referendum
results give Quebec or any other province the right to secede from
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament passed two amendments Tuesday to Bill C-20, Ottawa's
clarity bill, allowing aboriginals to be among political actors to
pass judgment on the result of any future secession referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The two amendments, proposed by New Democrats, were among 403
changes the Commons has been considering since Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   All but eight amendments came from the Bloc Quebecois, which has
kept the Commons working around the clock to stall passage of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Aboriginals will be among those who will consider whether a
referendum question is clear and whether the result indicates a
clear expression of will to secede by a clear majority of the
population of a province.

Judge: Ludwig Trial Witness Tainted
</P>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- The judge in the Wiebo Ludwig oilpatch
vandalism trial has described a key Crown witness as ''tainted''
and warned prosecutors they'd better have much better evidence if
they hope to secure a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sterling Sanderman made the comments Tuesday after
defense lawyer Paul Moreau became frustrated with the lack of
response from Robert Wraight when asked about the money he received
for becoming an RCMP informant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I quickly came to the conclusion within the first week of this
trial that this witness is a tainted witness, and nothing I've
heard removes this notion from my mind,'' Sanderman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''His primary motivation is monetary, and it will take an awful
lot of other corroborating evidence from Mr. Combe (Crown
prosecutor George Combe) to dispel that.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig and his friend Richard Boonstra face a series of charges
related to sabotage of oil and gas wells in northwestern Alberta.
Wraight is a former friend of the two who said he sympathized with
their environmental concerns but turned against them when he feared
they might use violence to make their point.

Quebecers Get $4.5B Income Tax Cut
</P>
<P>
   QUEBEC (AP) -- After enduring years of bad-news budgets,
Quebecers were handed cuts of a different kind Tuesday -- $4.5
billion in income tax reductions over three years.
</P>
<P>
   The tax break was just one of several goodies promised by
Finance Minister Bernard Landry as he presented the 2000-2001
budget.
</P>
<P>
   While on paper the $48.3-billion budget is expected to be
balanced, Landry said the province could eventually post a surplus
of $3.3 billion over the year.
</P>
<P>
   Landry made several references in his speech to sovereignty,
saying the strong economic performance could encourage Quebecers to
be more open to leaving Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-class taxpayers and families will reap the most from the
tax reductions, which include $1 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a family of four with two incomes totaling $50,000
will see an overall tax reduction of $532 in 2000, $1,123 in 2001
and $1,733 in 2002.

Chretien Team Stacked With Loyalists
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Prime Minister Jean Chretien announced a campaign
team for the next election Tuesday, reaffirming his intent to run
again a day after some Liberal MPs had mused publicly about whether
it was time for him to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Although he described his team of backroomers as ''a fine mix of
old friends and new voices,'' the old friends were clearly in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   David Smith, a Toronto lawyer who was co-chairman the last
campaign in 1997, will do so again. His partner this time will be
Labor Minister Claudette Bradshaw of New Brunswick, whose Atlantic
roots send a signal the Liberals are determined to regain lost
ground in that region.
</P>
<P>
   Others filling key roles include John Rae, a vice-president of
Montreal-based Power Corp. and longtime Chretien confidant, Gordon
Ashworth, a veteran organizer from Toronto, party president Stephen
LeDrew and party executive director Terry Mercer.

Drugs Give Cancer Researchers Hope
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. (AP) -- A new treatment being developed by
researchers at the British Columbia Cancer Agency could allow most
cancer patients to take drugs that will stop the disease in its
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs -- which are still about six years from being marketed
-- are a potential breakthrough because they will target and
''switch off'' a gene that plays a blockbuster role in allowing
cancer cells to survive, spread and form a blood supply to keep
them nourished.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're discovering so many genes now and there isn't a single
one that does all three,'' Dr. Shoukat Dedhar said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dedhar and his cancer agency colleagues are collaborating with
Kinetek Pharmaceuticals, a Vancouver drug company.
</P>
<P>
   The gene, called integrin-linked kinase, or ILK, is hyperactive
in cancer cells when another gene that would normally switch it off
is missing, Dedhar said.
</P>
<P>
   The future drugs will be a substitute for the missing gene which
would normally keep ILK in check.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Leader Doubles As Porn Star  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)-- A leftist politician may face expulsion
from his party because of his side career acting in pornographic
movies, a party spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The local branch of the Leftist party, which has supports
feminist and anti-pornography views, was reacting to a report in
the daily newspaper Goteborg-Posten that councilor Goeran Eurenius,
47, had acted in 14 pornographic movies.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old actor/politician said his leftist political
beliefs were intact and he had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to work both with politics and pornography,'' Eurenius
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The party plans to discuss the future of Eurenius, who could be
expelled, party secretary Lars Ohly said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the local branch decides to expel him, he can appeal to the
national party, which then has a final say,'' Ohly said.
</P>
<P>
   Eurenius, who was elected in 1998 for a four-year term, said the
party has known about his acting career for at least a year and he
has no plans to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ''No I am not planning to resign. If they expel me, I will
remain as an independent throughout the term,'' he said. ''I am
elected by the people. My leftist views are no different because of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Eurenius is a local councilor in Haerryda, 310 miles southwest
of the capital, Stockholm.

<HEADLINE> Texas Executes Ponchai Wilkerson  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GRACZYK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A defiant condemned killer who had
tried to escape from death row at least twice spit out a handcuff
key as lethal drugs began taking effect during his execution
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The key fell from Ponchai Wilkerson's mouth onto the side of his
face, where a shocked warden picked it up. Wilkerson was pronounced
dead at 6:24 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Larry Fitzgerald
described the inch-and-a-half key as a universal handcuff and leg
restraint key. It's unknown how Wilkerson got it.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson declined a final statement. But as the drugs began
taking effect and spit out the key he mumbled: ''The secret, as of
Wilkerson,'' according to James Brazzil, a chaplain who stood next
to Wilkerson in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not uncommon to find keys in prison,'' Fitzgerald said.
''Our major concern is how the inmate came in possession of it.
It's going to be the focus of an investigation beginning tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said he didn't think it was intended to be an escape
attempt by Wilkerson.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the nature of Ponchai -- always messing with the
system,'' he said. ''It didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson, 28, had struggled with prison guards all day. He
refused to leave his holding cell near the death chamber and guards
had to use additional restraining bands to bind him to the gurney.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the execution, guards had to use a Mace-like gas on
Wilkerson when he refused to leave his cell at the Terrell Unit
prison near Livingston for the 40-mile trip west to the Walls Unit
in Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson was convicted of the 1990 murder of Chung Myong Yi,
43, a Houston jeweler.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Wilkerson, armed with a sharpened piece of metal
fashioned from a typewriter part, slipped from his death row cell
Feb. 21 and with another inmate held a female prison guard hostage
before surrendering. The guard was not harmed.
</P>
<P>
   On Thanksgiving night 1998, Wilkerson and six other condemned
prisoners fled their cells in another escape attempt. One of the
convicts drowned after scaling a pair of tall fences that
surrounded the Ellis Unit northeast of Huntsville. Wilkerson and
five others gave up after guards began shooting at them.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson was 11th convicted murderer to be executed in Texas
this year and the first of two scheduled this week.

<HEADLINE> Judge To Stay in McVeigh Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A judge on Tuesday denied a request by convicted
Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh to disqualify himself from
hearing motions for a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch ruled there was insufficient
evidence to support claims that his previous statements about the
defendant's trial attorney showed partiality and could jeopardize
McVeigh's bid for a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, McVeigh asked the court for a new trial,
claiming his previous lawyer leaked inflammatory stories about him
to the media, including a purported confession.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, McVeigh also accused lawyer Stephen Jones of
promoting a questionable theory about foreign terrorists to stoke
interest in his book about the case.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time that McVeigh has appealed his conviction
and death sentence on murder and conspiracy charges in the April
19, 1995, bombing that killed 168 people. A year ago, the U.S.
Supreme Court refused to hear arguments that his trial was tainted
by jury misconduct and news reports that he confessed.
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh's current attorney, Dennis W. Hartley, requested that
Matsch, who presided over the trial, disqualify himself from
considering motions on the effectiveness of McVeigh's trial
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit, Hartley asserted that statements made in a
memorandum opinion and at two hearings showed ''a clear
predisposition'' regarding any claim about ineffective trial
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   He also filed copies of three letters from Jones to the court
suggesting that they might be construed as an attempt ''to
influence or manipulate the Court'' and ''lend an appearance of
partiality to the proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his ruling Tuesday, Matsch said, ''Nothing in those
letters reflects any views, opinions or statements of the court
with respect to the performance of counsel, and at the times of
their writing, Mr. Jones had completed his representation of Mr.
McVeigh in this court.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, Matsch said, '' ... the court concludes that the
affidavit is insufficient to warrant disqualification.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks fell early Wednesday following
sharp drops on Wall Street. The dollar was lower against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 156.41 points,
or 0.82 percent, to 18,985.43 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Tuesday, the average fell 48.09 points, or 0.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 105.12 yen, down 0.02 yen from late Tuesday in
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 105.05 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, high-priced high technology issues and
telecommunication stocks were leading the market down, dampened by
the Nasdaq composite index's plunge Tuesday on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Nasdaq fell 200.61, or 4.1 percent, to close at
4,706.63, its second-worst point drop in history. The Dow Jones
industrial average closed down 135.89, to 9,811.24.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market looks set to test the downside,'' said Hiroichi
Nishi, an equities manager at Nikko Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 1.87 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,580.10.
The TOPIX closed up 23.82 points, or 1.5 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar's slip came after major
Japanese banks sold the greenback and amid some profit-taking in
early Tokyo trading.
</P>
<P>
   The yen's strength in recent days has been based on some
positive factors such as rising machine orders and capital
expenditure, despite a 1.4 percent contraction in gross domestic
product in the October-December quarter.
</P>
<P>
   GDP is a major indicator representing the total goods and
services produced in a given period.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 101.70 yen, up from
101.22 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was
unquoted in early trading. On Tuesday, it settled at 1.7950 percent
and its price stood at 100.04.

<HEADLINE> 10-year-old charged with stabbing father who goaded him into it  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) -- A 10-year-old boy stabbed his father
to death during an argument after the father handed him a kitchen
knife, goading him into it, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The fight was over a missing container of chocolate cake icing
that Andrew Harms, 38, accused the boy of taking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something so stupid, and now a whole family's lives are
wrecked,'' said neighbor Carol Lightbody, 39.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, a fourth grader whose name wasn't released because he
is a juvenile, has been charged with manslaughter and illegal
possession of a weapon. He was being held without bail Tuesday in
the county's juvenile detention center.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean County Prosecutor E. David Millard said it was unlikely
the boy would get jail time for the killing, because of his age and
the circumstances of the slaying. A judge will decide how long the
boy is held.
</P>
<P>
   A welder by trade, Harms and three of his children lived
together with Harms' fiancee and three of her children in a modest
one-story home located just off Route 37.
</P>
<P>
   The argument occurred about 8:45 p.m. Monday after Harms accused
his son of taking the frosting. Harms, who is 5-foot-11 inches tall
and weighs 175 pounds, led the boy out to the family's detached
garage so they could talk without being heard by the other people
in the house, Millard said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The discussion became heated and emotional. At that point, Mr.
Harms picked up a knife and placed it in the juvenile's hand and
stated that if he hated him that much, then he wanted him to stab
him,'' Millard said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy then plunged the five-inch long kitchen knife once into
Harms' chest. He died an hour later at Community Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy conducted by the county medical examiner, Dr. Hydow
Park, determined the cause of death to be cardiac tamponade, a
condition resulting from the accumulation of excess fluid in the
pericardium around the heart. It commonly results from injuries to
the heart or to major blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Millard would not discuss the prior relationship between the boy
and his father except to say that there had been ''some emotional
turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There had been some buildup,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One person who had been in the house witnessed the slaying,
Millard said. He wouldn't identify them or say what their relation
was to Harms or the boy. The boy's mother, who is separated from
Harms, lives in Manalapan. She was notified about the killing
Monday night, Millard said.
</P>
<P>
   The knife, which has been recovered, had a three-quarter-inch
wide blade.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was arraigned before Family Court Judge Barbara Ann
Villano. He is too young to face charges as an adult -- 14 is the
minimum age in New Jersey for juveniles being waived up to adult
court -- but could get three years if convicted as a juvenile,
according to Millard.
</P>
<P>
   ''The focus with very young offenders like this is usually
toward rehabilitation,'' Millard said.
</P>
<P>
   No one answered the door at Harms' home Tuesday. Two four-wheel
drive vehicles were parked in the driveway, which had a basketball
hoop in front of the garage. Neighbors said Harms and his children
moved in about a year ago but never attracted attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never had a problem with them,'' said one man, who was
walking his dog nearby Tuesday. He didn't want to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   ''What could be so bad in the household that it could come to
this?'' said Lightbody, looking off her porch at the house.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Team Leaving For Cambodia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A seven-member U.N. team was heading to
Cambodia on Tuesday for talks on setting up a U.N.-backed tribunal
to prosecute the surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   The team was expected to arrive on Thursday and begin talks on
Friday, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said. U.N. officials in Phnom
Penh said they would stay until March 22.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has been negotiating for months with Cambodia
over international participation in a tribunal to judge Khmer Rouge
chieftains, blamed for the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million
Cambodians in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. blessing is crucial to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen for
the tribunal to be viewed as legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   But the United Nations wants to make sure it has enough control
over the proceedings to ensure that the trial isn't manipulated by
Cambodia's corrupt and politicized judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan was dispatching his top legal and
political aides for the negotiations. He has expressed hope the
talks will produce a final agreement.

<HEADLINE> Burger King Ad Angers Muslims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Burger King agreed Tuesday to pull a radio
commercial featuring a character with a Muslim name promoting the
fast-food chain's bacon-cheddar sandwich after receiving
complaints, an Islamic advocacy group said.
</P>
<P>
   The Council on American-Islamic Relations said Tuesday it was
contacted by six American Muslims over the weekend who complained
about the advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were offended that someone with a Muslim name would be
praising a sandwich that contains pork,'' said Ibrahim Hooper, a
spokesman for Washington-based CAIR. Islam prohibits the
consumption of pork products.
</P>
<P>
   The council sent a letter to Burger King on Monday asking that
the commercial be withdrawn. The company responded Tuesday by
agreeing to take the ad off the air, Hooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left after business hours at Burger King's headquarters
were not immediately returned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A letter from Burger King spokesman Robert Doughty to the
council, excerpts of which were provided by the group, stated that
the ads were ''not meant to refer to any religion.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are making these changes so there is no confusion,''
Doughty wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King officials will withdraw the commercial and rewrite
it to delete the references that Muslims found objectionable,
according to the council.
</P>
<P>
   In the ads, a character using the Muslim name ''Rasheed'' reads
a poem listing the virtues of Burger King's bacon-cheddar Whopper
sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   The character also greets others with ''peace'' and is
introduced to ''brothers and sisters'' in a coffee house. Muslims
greet each other by saying ''peace to you'' in Arabic and refer to
each other as ''brothers'' and ''sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That crossed the line,'' Hooper said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed in Colombia Missile Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Suspected leftist rebels fired two
homemade missiles at a military base in Medellin on Tuesday,
missing their target but killing two civilians and injuring 14,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen cars parked just outside the 4th Brigade
headquarters were partially destroyed in the 4:45 p.m. attack.
</P>
<P>
   The base escaped damage, but one projectile slammed into the
offices of a security company about 400 feet away, killing a male
and a female employee, said a brigade spokesman, Maj. Oscar Anzola.
</P>
<P>
   The injured included other security company officials and local
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Anzola said the missiles were launched from a truck that was
badly mangled.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's military commander, Gen. Fernando Tapias, blamed
leftist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only people launching explosives in (propane) gas
cylinders in the country are the FARC,'' he told reporters in
Bogota, refering to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia by
its Spanish initials.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first attack on 4th Brigade headquarters. In
November, another homemade missile attack injured six passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   The brigade is responsible for Medellin, the country's
second-largest city, and the surrounding state of Antioquia. The
region is among Colombia's most turbulent, with leftist rebels and
right-wing paramilitary units vying for control of the countryside
and the highest rate of massacres. '

<HEADLINE> Polls: Bush's Support More Intense  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush got more intense support from
Southern voters who turned out in Tuesday's GOP primaries than Al
Gore got on the Democratic side, and Bush appears to face less of a
threat of crossover Southern voters in November, according to exit
polls.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of
the TV networks and The Associated Press, also gave a glimpse of
voter attitudes in the candidates' home states.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, half the Republicans as well as half the Democrats
said Bush was more conservative as a presidential candidate than he
was in 1998, when he won a landslide re-election as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he would make a great president,'' said Fritzie
Faulkner, a 67-year-old resident of Lubbock, who wasn't troubled by
conservatism. ''He's got conservative views and I think you can
trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in Texas, however, were not convinced by Bush's claims that
he has successfully reformed education in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   About four in 10 voters in the Texas GOP primary said the state
has had no significant school reforms in the past six years, and
more than six in 10 voters in the Democratic primary felt that way.
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee, voters in the Republican primary showed a clear
dislike of native son Gore: only one in 20 among GOP voters said
they would vote for Gore in November, and more than four in five
had an unfavorable opinion of their one-time senator.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in several of Tuesday's primary states expect the
Gore campaign, which has been heartened by recent national polls
showing the presidential race is close, to make a determined effort
to carve several Southern states away from the Republicans in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls suggest Gore has plenty of work to do in the region
to compete effectively with Bush. One in eight voters in the
Democratic primaries say they would back Bush in November, while
one in 20 voters in the Republican primaries say they would back
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Margo, a Democrat from Oklahoma City, said he ''voted
against Gore'' in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm for Bush but I couldn't vote for Bush because I'm a
registered Democrat,'' he said, referring to the closed GOP primary
that only allowed party members to cast ballots. But Margo said he
would vote for Bush in November.
</P>
<P>
   One of every 10 voters in the GOP primaries said they had a
favorable view of Gore, while more than one in five voters in the
Democratic primary had a favorable view of Bush. About one in 10
voters said Bush does not have the knowledge needed to serve as
president. Among independents voting in the GOP primaries Tuesday,
about one in five said he did not have the necessary knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he's no longer running, Arizona Sen. John McCain got
votes from more than 20 percent of independent and Democratic
voters. He had similar support from liberal and moderate voters.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls were conducted at selected precincts in the
states of Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and
Texas. The poll of 5,501 voters in the GOP primaries had an error
margin of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points and the poll of 4,683
voters in the Democratic primaries had an error margin of plus or
minus 2 points.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in the Democratic primaries who said they would vote for
Bush tended to be more conservative, white, younger, Bradley
supporters and people who dislike President Clinton personally. In
states where Bill Bradley got his strongest support from Democratic
primary voters, such as Louisiana and Oklahoma, those voters said
they would vote for Bush by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in the GOP primaries who said they would vote for Gore
tended to be lower income, self-described liberals, younger, and
Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will rely heavily in Florida on the support of his brother
Jeb, the governor, whose appeal seems to run along partisan lines,
according to exit polls with a big majority of Republican voters
favorable and a big majority of Democrats unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of the voters, seven of 10 independents, in
the Democratic primary had an unfavorable view of President Clinton
personally and a fourth of that group said they would vote for Bush
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Athaleen Watson, a 76-year-old resident of Carthage, Tenn. -- the
same community where Gore cast his presidential primary vote -- said
she's backed Gore ''for as far back as I can remember.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got good times, she said, ''and I'd like to see that
continue.''

<HEADLINE> Sunbeam Closing Mr. Coffee Plant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Sunbeam Corp. on Tuesday confirmed it plans to
close its Mr. Coffee assembly plant in the Cleveland suburb
Glenwillow, eliminating 339 jobs there.
</P>
<P>
   The small-appliance maker from Delray, Fla., planned to close
the plant in February 1998 as part of a plan to cut costs, but
workers and community leaders campaigned to save the jobs that pay
about $9 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Then in December 1998, Sunbeam and the Teamsters agreed on a
three-year contract that seemed to indicate the jobs were secure.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam spokeswoman P.Y. Rockingham said Tuesday the decision to
close the Mr. Coffee plant followed the company's assessment of its
household products manufacturing and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on those results, the decision was made to integrate the
Glenwilow operations into other company owned facilities,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Coffee distribution and filters production will be moved to
Hattiesburg, Miss., and the assembly work is being moved to
Matamoros, Mexico, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The leased Ohio plant will be closed by the end of June, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to have pride in the work force that has been at
Mr. Coffee for many years. We can't continue to afford operations
there,'' she said. The company expects to save $7.5 million in the
first year after the closing while maintaining sales of the Mr.
Coffee machine and filters, she said.

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin To Fight Transplant Rules  </HEADLINE>
By JENNY PRICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin will file a federal lawsuit next
week seeking to block new federal rules intended to change the way
scarce donated organs are distributed, Gov. Tommy Thompson said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said federal rules taking effect Thursday unlawfully
substitute the personal judgment of Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna Shalala for that of medical professionals in making
transplant policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This rule won't save lives; it just allows political
appointees to decide which lives are saved,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Those rules order the nation's transplant network to develop a
new system that would send more organs to the sickest patients.
Wisconsin stands to lose under such a system because its organ
donation rates are high and its patients generally get organs
faster than in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the lawsuit, to be filed Monday will include
several states as plaintiffs, though he could not say how many or
which states would be involved.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to comply with the new federal rules, the United Network
for Organ Sharing on Monday agreed to submit a new plan for
distributing donating livers.
</P>
<P>
   Its plan would create a more sophisticated system for ranking
patients on the transplant waiting list, so that those in most
urgent need of transplants rise faster to the top of the list. It
would also create broader areas to distribute livers, so donations
could travel further to reach a sicker patient.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin, which has developed a nationally recognized organ
donation system, opposes these plans, fearing its organs will be
siphoned to other states.
</P>
<P>
   After the proposed new rules were issued nearly two years ago,
the network and many transplant centers, including those in
Wisconsin, complained they would jeopardize small programs that
might lose locally donated organs to larger hospitals in other
communities with more of the sickest patients.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson contended the new rules do nothing to focus federal
resources on how to save more lives and also could cut down on the
number of organs that are donated in Wisconsin and other states
with successful procurement programs.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Newman, a spokesman for United Network for Organ Sharing,
said he could not comment on Thompson's claims until the
organization could review the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The states will argue in their lawsuit that Shalala is exceeding
the authority granted to her by Congress, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   But policy experts in Congress and others believe it would be
unconstitutional for Shalala to lose her authority to set policy.
Legislation pending in Congress would clarify who has authority to
set the transplant policy.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Louisiana has also tried to stop the new rules in
court in a case now on hold. South Carolina has threatened a
lawsuit as well.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, patients in some parts of the country get transplants
much quicker than those in other areas. That's partly because
donated livers are distributed to local patients first, even if a
sicker patient needs one in a neighboring community or region.
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,800 people died in 1998 waiting for transplants.
More than 68,000 patients are waiting now, including almost 15,000
waiting for livers.

<HEADLINE> 2 Million Muslims Begin Pilgrimage  </HEADLINE>
By BASSEM MROUE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MECCA, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Chanting ''at thy service, my God, at
thy service,'' more than 2 million Muslims began trekking to a
desert plain outside Mecca on Tuesday for an annual pilgrimage that
fulfills one of the most sacred duties of their faith.
</P>
<P>
   On foot and packed in cars, buses and trucks -- some even
clinging to the roofs of vehicles -- the pilgrims streamed toward a
tent city in Mina, where they will spend Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's overwhelming. Especially since this is the first time I
experienced the pilgrimage,'' said George Gorin, a 60-year-old
native of San Francisco who converted from Catholicism to Islam
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hajj, or pilgrimage, is required at least once of every
able-bodied Muslim who can afford it. It involves several rituals
including praying at the desert plain of Mina -- three miles from
Mecca -- where Muslim faithful believe the Prophet Abraham intended
to sacrifice his son Ishmael to prove his faith in God. In
Christian and Jewish tradition, Abraham tried to sacrifice his
other son, Isaac.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no idea that the pilgrimage is totally demanding. But,
God willing, when I finish the hajj I hope I will be closer to
God,'' said Gorin, who was introduced to the Koran, the Muslim holy
book, by his Iranian-American wife.
</P>
<P>
   At dawn Wednesday, pilgrims will pray at Mina and resume their
journey to Mount Arafat, a gentle hill 12 miles southwest of Mecca
where Muslims believe the last passage of the Koran was revealed to
Islam's Prophet Mohammed during his final sermon.
</P>
<P>
   After a day spent praying at Arafat, pilgrims return to Mina to
throw stones at three pillars representing the devil as part of
another ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the pilgrims began arriving in Mecca weeks earlier. In
Mecca, they must circle the Kaaba, a large cubic stone structure
covered with a black cloth made of about 1,000 pounds of silk, and
Islam's most sacred site. Muslims around the world turn toward its
geographical position while praying.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 2.1 million people are taking part in the hajj, one
of the five pillars of Islam, which has 1 billion followers
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's King Abdullah and a host of dignitaries from around the
world will be among the pilgrims, mingling in rituals that are
meant to blur the difference between prince and pauper.
</P>
<P>
   Men must arrive wearing identical two-piece seamless white
robes, and women must dress modestly and cover their hair.
</P>
<P>
   Shaaban Hassan Ahmed of Egypt said that the discomforts of the
hajj, including long hours spent under the desert heat of 97
degrees inspire compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ''During hajj we feel very tired and this makes us remember that
there are people suffering around the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hajj has frequently been marred by tragedy, the most recent
in 1998 when more than 100 pilgrims were trampled to death in a
stampede.
</P>
<P>
   Two women pilgrims from the Russian republic of Dagestan were
killed and four others injured in a bus accident Tuesday and a
Kuwaiti boy and his parents died in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, six Palestinian and Jordanian pilgrims were crushed
to death inside Mecca's Grand Mosque.

<HEADLINE> Tax Cut Plan Said Unconstitutional  </HEADLINE>
By REBECCA COOK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Washington state's version of a tax revolt has
been quashed.
</P>
<P>
   A judge ruled Tuesday that a voter-approved measure scrapping a
progressive tax on automobiles and motor homes in favor of a $30
flat fee was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, passed by 56 percent of voters in November, also
required a public vote for all tax and fee increases.
</P>
<P>
   King County Superior Court Judge Robert Alsdorf said Initiative
695 violated the state constitution's ''single-subject rule'' by
dealing with two topics.
</P>
<P>
   The car registration fee will remain $30, at least until the
state Supreme Court rules on the case. The public vote requirement
was struck down immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a representative democracy, citizens delegate authority to
their elected representatives ... to decide certain questions on
behalf of the citizenry,'' the judge wrote. ''A representative
democracy does not contemplate, let alone necessitate, a direct
vote of the citizens on every act of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision touched off a flurry of activity in the state
capital, with lawmakers rushing to declare their intent to maintain
the $30 car tabs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The voters were very clear that they do not like, they hated,
the high license tab fees that existed in the State of
Washington,'' Gov. Gary Locke said. ''Despite the court's ruling,
$30 license tabs are here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general's office plans to appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think today's ruling was despicable,'' said the measure's
sponsor, Tim Eyman, who runs a mail-order fraternity watch
business.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of groups challenged the initiative. Transit union
workers were the first to file suit on Nov. 18, just weeks after
the initiative's passage.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative tore a $750 million hole in the budgets of state
and local programs, and hit transit programs especially hard. Bus
routes have been cut and transit workers have lost jobs as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Mike Subit, who represented Amalgamated Transit Union
Local 587 in the challenge, said the ruling upheld the integrity of
the initiative process.
</P>
<P>
   ''Judge Alsdorf courageously recognized that whatever the
popular sentiment is, the constitution should be enforced,'' Subit
said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Throws Out Fla. Voucher Law  </HEADLINE>
By JACKIE HALLIFAX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A judge on Tuesday threw out the
nation's first statewide school voucher system, ruling that
Florida's Constitution bars public money from being spent on
private education.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush, who championed the program, promised to find the
money to keep it going despite what happens in court. An appeal is
certain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll raise the money,'' Bush said. ''This is the first inning
of a long drawn out legal battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Meyer, an attorney challenging vouchers for a coalition that
includes Florida Education Assocation/United teachers union, the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the
Florida PTA, the League of Women Voters and a handful of families
and educators, claimed victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won it lock, stock and barrel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-two children attending private schools in Pensacola under
the program can finish the year, but the state can't implement the
law in any other way, Circuit Judge L. Ralph Smith Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tax dollars may not be used to send the children of this state
to private schools,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   School vouchers are likely to surface in the presidential race,
with Bush's brother, GOP contender George W. Bush, in support of
vouchers but Democrat Al Gore flatly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Students at Florida schools rated badly by the state can seek
the vouchers for private school tuition at taxpayer expense.
Voucher values vary based on how much a failing school spends per
student but are generally worth $3,000 to $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of Florida's 2,500 public schools -- both elementary
schools in Pensacola -- qualified this year. Both religious and
nonreligious private schools are eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Mary E. Smith is using vouchers to send her niece and nephew to
St. John the Evangelist School. Smith, who has custody of
11-year-old Angela Atwood and 7-year-old Antonio Held, called the
judge's ruling ''very unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she has seen a major difference in the children since
they started at the parochial school but she can't afford to keep
them there without vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They knew there was a chance that they might stop the program
from the beginning,'' she said. ''I'm just going to tell them like
it is. I'll tell them we're going to pray about it and appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Voucher opponents argued the program violated the state
constitution by spending public dollars on private schools and
violated the separation of church and state clause when used for
parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith didn't take up the religion issue, concluding without
hearing evidence that the law violated the constitution's mandate
of a free education through a system of ''public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine and Vermont have narrow programs to assist students in
rural areas while Milwaukee and Cleveland have citywide voucher
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Berry, a staff attorney for the Institute for Justice, a
nonprofit Washington law firm that has defended vouchers around the
country, said high courts in other states have dealt with similar
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ''This issue the judge ruled on today we dealt with both in
Milwaukee and Cleveland and won in both those state's Supreme
Courts,'' Berry said. ''So eventually we're going to win this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland, a federal judge ruled in December that that city's
voucher program violates the constitutional separation of church
and state. The program, however, remains in place while the state
appeals the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to consider a
challenge to the Milwaukee voucher program, which has more than
8,000 students this year.
</P>
<P>
   But in December, the nation's high court said Maine, which has a
narrow voucher program to assist students in rural areas, can
continue to subsidize children who attend some private schools
while denying vouchers for those who go to religious schools.

<HEADLINE> Mogilny, Barrasso Change Teams  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Ray Bourque and Doug Gilmour already having landed in new
places, the NHL's trade deadline passed with little fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest names to be dealt before Tuesday's 3 p.m. EST
deadline were Tom Barrasso and Alexander Mogilny.
</P>
<P>
   Barrasso was traded by the Pittsburgh Penguins to the Ottawa
Senators for fellow goalie Ron Tugnutt and D Janne Laukkanen.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel Tom Barrasso can help us win,'' Ottawa general manager
Marshall Johnston said. ''In the end, we felt this would help our
hockey club.''
</P>
<P>
   Mogilny, who once scored 76 goals for the Buffalo Sabres, was
sent by the Vancouver Canucks to the Eastern Conference-leading New
Jersey Devils for centers Brendan Morrison and Denis Pederson.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 12 trades were made Tuesday involving 23 players. It
was the fewest deals made on deadline day since 1992-93. Last year,
30 players changed teams in a record 21 trades.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque and Gilmour were both dealt in the days leading up to
the deadline. The Colorado Avalanche acquired Bourque, who played
his first 21 NHL seasons with Boston. Gilmour was sent from Chicago
to the Sabres, who also acquired Chris Gratton in a separate trade
with Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Barrasso, who won the Stanley Cup with the Penguins in 1991 and
1992, has played in only 18 games this season. He hasn't played in
over a month after taking a leave of absence to be with his ailing
father, who died last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins are in a tight playoff race and felt trading the
potential free agent now was the best move. The deal was the last
in a series of five -- in less than 24 hours -- that saw Pittsburgh
turn over its roster.
</P>
<P>
   ''We brought in a group of players we feel could be key
components not just to get us into the playoffs, but for years to
come,'' Penguins GM Craig Patrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Tugnutt will share goalie duties in Pittsburgh with
Jean-Sebastien Aubin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had two or three good years,'' Tugnutt said of his time
with Ottawa. ''It's kind of disappointing. There were some rumors,
but it was continuously said we wouldn't be making a move for a
goaltender.''
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins also acquired goalie Tyler Moss and forward Rene
Corbet from Calgary for defenseman Brad Werenka; left wing Josef
Beranek from Edmonton for left wing German Titov; and defenseman
Dan Trebil from Anaheim for a fifth-round pick in this year's
draft.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Pittsburgh sent Pavel Skrbek to Nashville for fellow
defenseman Bob Boughner.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils and Canucks got together on a trade, but Mark Messier
is still in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilny, who had his best season in 1992-93 with Buffalo when he
scored 76 goals, has 21 goals and 17 assists this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to a good hockey club that has the chance to go all
the way this year,'' Mogilny said. ''It's very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Messier, rumored to be heading to New Jersey, stayed put. He has
a no-trade clause and Canucks general manager Brian Burke did not
ask him to waive it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is a testament to Mark's character that he did not
ask for a trade and he wants to continue to lead this charge, and
I'm thrilled with that,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks are six points behind San Jose for the final playoff
spot in the West.
</P>
<P>
   In another deal Tuesday, Atlanta traded right wing Ed Ward to
Anaheim for a conditional 2001 draft pick. The Thrashers then sent
right wing Kirby Law to Philadelphia for Vancouver's sixth-round
pick in 2000 and a conditional selection in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers, who lost out in last week's bidding for Bourque,
also made a second trade. Philadelphia sent enforcer Sandy
McCarthy, who recently saw his playing time cut, to Carolina for
center Kent Manderville.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville sent right wing Sergei Krivokrasov to Calgary for
defenseman Cale Hulse and a third-round pick in the 2001 draft. The
Predators also traded goalie Corey Hirsch to Anaheim for future
considerations and acquired center Petr Sachl from the New York
Islanders for a ninth-round pick in the June draft.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sillinger relocated in Florida as the Tampa Bay Lightning
sent him to the Panthers for forwards Ryan Johnson and Dwayne Hay.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Vince Carter scored 23 points, including 11 in
the fourth quarter after returning from a sprained left ankle, as
the Toronto Raptors dealt the Golden State Warriors their seventh
straight loss, 85-78, on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy McGrady added 20 points and Kevin Willis had 12 points and
15 rebounds for the Raptors, who have won nine of 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Carter got tangled up with teammate Charles Oakley midway
through the third quarter. He immediately fell to the floor and
laid there for three minutes before a trainer and two teammates
helped him off the court.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to a huge ovation at the start of the fourth
quarter, with the Raptors down by five. Toronto outscored the
Warriors 29-17 in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Carter made a fadeway jumper and three 3-pointers to lead the
comeback. His final shot from beyond the arc gave Toronto an 83-73
lead with 2:06 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hughes had a game-high 25 points for the Warriors, who led
45-39 at halftime.
Notes: Toronto's Antonio Davis (strained right calf) did not play,
and coach Butch Carter gave no timetable for a return. John Thomas
started in his place. ... The Raptors activated forward Michael
Stewart and announced they placed 3-point specialist Dee Brown on
the injured list with an upper respiratory infection.

<HEADLINE> Jurors Hear Tapes in Edwards Trial  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Jurors in the corruption trial of Edwin
Edwards on Tuesday heard tapes of the former governor assuring a
NFL franchise owner that they could get their hands on a
confidential state gambling document.
</P>
<P>
   The document was a state police report on applicants for the
state's final riverboat casino license.
</P>
<P>
   Former San Francisco 49ers owner Edward DeBartolo Jr. was one of
those applicants and hoped the report would give him helpful inside
information, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a four-term governor who had left office, is accused of
extorting $400,000 from DeBartolo, whose involvement in the case
cost him control of the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if you're able to get a copy of this and it might
be difficult but maybe you can find out what'' some of the
questions are, DeBartolo says in the February 1997 telephone
conversation taped by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm already working on that,'' Edwards replied.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Edwards tells DeBartolo, ''Hey, I'll have that
summary in my hands about five this evening. You want me to Fed-Ex
it to you?''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Edwards mailed a copy of the report to
DeBartolo the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and six others -- including his son, Stephen, and state
Sen. Greg Tarver -- are accused in a scheme to extort money from
applicants for valuable casino licenses. They have been on trial
since Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say most of the schemes began during Edwards' final
term in office, which ended in January 1996. However, the DeBartolo
scheme allegedly happened after Edwards left office but retained
considerable political clout.
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, DeBartolo is expected to testify that Edwards
demanded the $400,000 in return for helping him land the riverboat
license. Defense lawyers say it was a legal consulting fee.
</P>
<P>
   On the tapes played Tuesday, Edwards also tells DeBartolo that
he was rounding up support from the state gambling board.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm talking to members of the commission and others that are
interested in this thing to see if I can get them to consider
granting a license,'' Edwards said in an Oct. 18, 1996, telephone
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agent Geoffrey Santini, who took the witness stand to
interpret the tapes, noted that members of the gambling board that
awarded riverboat casino licenses were banned by gambling board
rules from discussing the applications.
</P>
<P>
   Although DeBartolo eventually received the license, he dropped
the project after he was summoned before a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo pleaded guilty in 1998 to one count of failing to
report a felony. He received a suspended sentence, was fined $1
million and agreed to testify against Edwards.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Britain Urge Open Gene Access  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shares in biotechnology companies hoping to
profit from the sale of genetic data were hammered Tuesday after
the United States and Britain agreed to openly share data from a
groundbreaking project to decode the human genetic pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The two governments are the leading players in the nonprofit
Human Genome Project, which plans to publish a full genetic map on
the Internet by 2003. The information, which President Clinton
called ''the scientific breakthrough of the century, perhaps of all
time,'' would be available free to scientists and researchers.
</P>
<P>
   A joint statement by Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said the two countries had agreed to open information from
their joint gene-mapping project, and appealed to other countries
and companies worldwide to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I urge all other nations, scientists and corporations to adopt
this policy and honor its spirit,'' Clinton said Tuesday, during a
White House awards ceremony honoring advances in science.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must ensure the profits of human genome research are
measured not in dollars but in the betterment of human life,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement halts several companies' plans to sell genetic
data to drugmakers and researchers. The news sent biotech stocks
tumbling and dragged the rest of the Nasdaq composite index down
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Incyte Pharmaceuticals skidded 53{ to 143{ and Human Genome
Sciences fell 29 3/64. PE Corp.'s Celera Genomics tumbled 47 to 142
on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that while some companies will struggle to find
other sources of revenue, most biotechnology business are involved
in a wide range of projects and won't be adversely affected by the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a bit of an overreaction,'' said Dr. Joseph
Zammit-Lucia, president of Cambridge Pharma Consultancy. ''It's a
little bit of correction in a frothy market.''
</P>
<P>
   Biotech stocks have been among the strongest performers in the
Nasdaq's sharp rise this year, leaving them especially vulnerable
to profit-taking, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get something that's gone up to that extent, you're
going to get violent shakeouts,'' said Don Selkin, chief investment
strategist at Joseph Gunnar in New York. ''This year, people are
going to have to get used to the volatility.''
</P>
<P>
   The human genome is a biological map laying out the exact
sequence of the estimated 3.5 billion pairs of chemicals that make
up the DNA in each human cell. Those chemicals are arranged in
specific ways to create the estimated 80,000 to 100,000 human
genes, which in turn carry the instructions for all the body's
processes.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the fight over ways to patent, sell and profit from
genetic information and developments.
</P>
<P>
   Celera is the chief rival to the Human Genome Project as the
company races to map the genome more quickly and at a tenth the
cost of the $2 billion publicly funded project.
</P>
<P>
   The company has applied for thousands of patents on genes it has
discovered and critics worry that the patents, if approved, may
prevent other scientists from conducting research while allowing
Celera to profit at the public's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Celera walked away from discussions last week over cooperation
with the government-funded group.
</P>
<P>
   Celera has access to the Human Genome Project's work in progress
but for now its own human research is kept private. The company
said it supports eventually granting open access to raw genetic
data but also wants its investors to profit from its discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Exclusively funded by the capital put at risk by its
investors, Celera unabashedly looks to reward those risks, advance
science and ultimately better the human condition,'' said a Celera
statement released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Patent Office decided long ago that raw data about the
sequence of human genes cannot be patented, and the fight has
shifted to more complicated questions about how that information is
used to predict, prevent or treat illness.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Blair statement does not represent any change in
patent policy, but does reflect government concern that Celera
could monopolize potentially valuable information, said Arthur
Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the government is engaging in a little jawboning
here,'' said Caplan, likening the strategy to the point in labor
negotiations when one side or the other tries to use provocative
public statements to nudge the other back to the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   White House science and technology adviser Neal Lane denied the
Clinton-Blair statement or its timing is intended to ''force
anybody's hand,'' but Wall Street seemed to view it that way.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Genome Project has cataloged about a third of the
human genetic pattern so far. Director Francis Collins said that
within months he expects to have a rough draft of the entire 3.5
billion subunits of human DNA in the genome. That will enable
scientists to start work on the next and potentially lucrative step
-- finding out what each gene does.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Aims For Fast Peace Deployments  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Despite a campaign aimed at speeding up
the deployment of peacekeepers, a U.N. official said Tuesday that
it still takes three to four months to get the troops to world
trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons is that countries are offering foot
soldiers and not enough transport and logistical support, said
Erkki Platan of the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to push toward rapid deployment, which is still
far away,'' he said, adding that the world body has been successful
in getting more countries to put troops on standby.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has never had support for establishing a
standing army. But since 1992, it has been trying to get member
states to make advance commitments of troops so it can respond
quickly to threats to peace.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 88 countries have expressed their willingness, and 32
have made formal commitments -- most importantly, NATO members
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, and
Spain, plus Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the United Nations has commitments for 147,500
personnel, the bulk of them infantry units, some of which have been
deployed. Britain has offered a brigade with about 8,000 troops and
France has offered 5,000 troops -- with major logistical support.
</P>
<P>
   In his annual report on standby peacekeeping arrangements
circulated Tuesday, Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed the
increased participation, compared to December 1998, when 81
countries expressed willingness to take part, 22 made formal
commitments, and some 104,000 personnel could be called on.
</P>
<P>
   But the United Nations is handicapped in its peacekeeping
operation because countries who have made formal commitments still
have the right to say yes or no to any U.N. request for help.
</P>
<P>
   According to Annan's report, some 60 percent of the confirmed
standby resources can be ready to embark within 30 days of a formal
request from the United Nations -- but that leaves the question of
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is the only country with strategic aircraft
that can transport heavy military equipment and large numbers of
troops, Platan said. But the United States has not made a formal
commitment to the U.N. standby program, although it has provided it
with a list of capabilities that could be used.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to go through commercial transportation, and this is
taking a lot of time, and especially sea transportation is very
time consuming,'' said Platan, who heads the peacekeeping
department's one-man Standby Arrangements Unit.
</P>
<P>
   As of the end of January, the United Nations had one brigade
with a command staff based in Denmark ready for deployment. It was
formed by a number of small and medium-size countries participating
in the standby program. Their troops have trained and their
equipment is ready -- minus transport.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is pushing for this model to be used
elsewhere, and Platan cited efforts in central Asia, southern
Africa and the Baltic countries to create combined forces for
possible U.N. deployment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The overall goal is to achieve wider participation in, and
support for, the standby arrangements,'' Annan said. ''While the
United Nations still does not have a true rapid reaction
capability, the standby arrangements have been a positive step.''

<HEADLINE> Accused Killer Urged To Surrender  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX DOMINGUEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOWLEYS QUARTERS, Md. (AP) -- The girlfriend of a man accused of
kidnapping her and killing four people urged him Tuesday to
surrender and end a weeklong manhunt.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Palczynksi's girlfriend, Tracy Whitehead, escaped from
him March 8, a day after she was kidnapped, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other night in the woods you told me how you loved me and
wanted to marry me,'' Whitehead said in a handwritten note signed
with a heart. ''If you really love me, show me by turning yourself
in.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know you have a lot of good in you, so let's bring this to
an end. I know you can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Police are hoping Palczynksi will hear her plea via a
battery-operated television investigators believe he bought, along
with outdoor gear, last week.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski has been the subject of an around-the-clock manhunt
since Whitehead was kidnapped at gunpoint from a co-worker's
apartment. She had moved in with Gloria Jean Shenk and her husband,
George, after Palczynski beat her while she tried to move out of
the apartment they shared, she told police.
</P>
<P>
   Police say he bought a shotgun and rifle and, on March 7,
kidnapped Whitehead, fatally shooting the Shenks and David Meyers,
a neighbor who tried to help.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Jennifer Lynn McDonel, 36, was on her way to
church services with her husband when she was fatally struck by a
stray bullet as Palczynski carjacked another vehicle, according to
police.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime friend of Palczynski, attorney David Henniger, also
read a statement that was broadcast by TV stations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need the killing to cease; don't do anything to make things
worse,'' Henniger said. ''I can do a lot more for you, the sooner
you call.''

   ''I've had two or three good years,'' Tugnutt said of his time
with Ottawa. ''It's kind of disappointing. There were some rumors,
but it was continuously said we wouldn't be making a move for a
goaltender.''
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins also acquired goalie Tyler Moss and forward Rene
Corbet from Calgary for defenseman Brad Werenka; left wing Josef
Beranek from Edmonton for left wing German Titov; and defenseman
Dan Trebil from Anaheim for a fifth-round pick in this year's
draft.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Pittsburgh sent Pavel Skrbek to Nashville for fellow
defenseman Bob Boughner.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils and Canucks got together on a trade, but Mark Messier
is still in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilny, who had his best season in 1992-93 with Buffalo when he
scored 76 goals, has 21 goals and 17 assists this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to a good hockey club that has the chance to go all
the way this year,'' Mogilny said. ''It's very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Messier, rumored to be heading to New Jersey, stayed put. He has
a no-trade clause and Burke didn't ask him to waive it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is a testament to Mark's character that he did not
ask for a trade and he wants to continue to lead this charge and
I'm thrilled with that,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks are six points behind San Jose for the final playoff
spot in the West.
</P>
<P>
   In other deals Tuesday, Atlanta traded right wing Ed Ward to
Anaheim for a conditional 2001 draft pick. The Thrashers then sent
right wing Kirby Law to Philadelphia for Vancouver's sixth-round
pick in 2000 and a conditional selection in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers, who lost out in last week's bidding for Bourque,
also made a second trade. Philadelphia sent enforcer Sandy
McCarthy, who recently saw his playing time cut, to Carolina for
center Kent Manderville.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville sent right wing Sergei Krivokrasov to Calgary for
defenseman Cale Hulse and a third-round pick in the 2001 draft. The
Predators also traded goalie Corey Hirsch to Anaheim for future
considerations and acquired center Petr Sachl for the New York
Islanders for a ninth-round pick in the June draft.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sillinger relocated in Florida as the Tampa Bay Lightning
sent him to the Panthers for forwards Ryan Johnson and Dwayne Hay.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices fell Wednesday morning after
sharp drops on Wall Street. The dollar slipped against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 230.79 points,
or 1.21 percent, to 18,911.05 at the end of the morning session. On
Tuesday, the average fell 48.09 points, or 0.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 105.01 yen at late morning, down 0.14 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of
105.05 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, high-priced high technology issues and
telecommunication stocks were leading the market down, dampened by
the Nasdaq composite index's plunge Tuesday on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Nasdaq fell 200.61, or 4.1 percent, to close at
4,706.63, its second-worst point drop in history. The Dow Jones
industrial average closed down 135.89, to 9,811.24.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market looks set to test the downside,'' said Hiroichi
Nishi, an equities manager at Nikko Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 10.86 points, or 0.69 percent, to 1,592.83.
The TOPIX closed up 23.82 points, or 1.5 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar's slip came after major
Japanese banks sold the greenback and amid some profit-taking in
early Tokyo trading.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the dollar moved as low as 104.96 yen at one point
in the morning, but recovered some of its early losses as players
bought back the U.S. currency amid concern over possible central
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   The yen's strength in recent days has been based on some
positive factors such as rising machine orders and capital
expenditure, despite a 1.4 percent contraction in gross domestic
product in the October-December quarter.
</P>
<P>
   GDP is a major indicator representing the total amount of goods
and services produced in a given period.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, the Bank of Japan intervened on the foreign
exchange market in Tokyo in an attempt to stem the yen's rise.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese government officials have said a strong yen could hurt
the country's already ailing economy by making exports more
expensive, and cutting into earnings of exporting companies.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 101.48 yen, up from
101.22 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.8000 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.7950 percent. Its
price fell 0.04 point to 100.00.

<HEADLINE> 'El Duquecito' Has Admirers  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Wearing a pinstriped Havana Industriales
uniform, Adrian ''El Duquecito'' Hernandez showcased his 93 mph
fastball, a knuckleball and an accomplished curve for scouts from
20 teams Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not nervous. This is what I came here to do, this is what
I've worked for,'' said the 25-year-old right-hander, who was one
of Cuba's top pitchers before he defected Jan. 2. ''I want them to
see what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Arriving dressed head-to-toe in a hooded, white sweatsuit,
Hernandez's entrance at the ballpark Tuesday conjured up images of
a heavyweight boxer headed for the ring, flanked by an entourage of
coaches, ballplayers and TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   After shedding the sweats, Hernandez put on an efficient
90-minute workout complete with an umpire, batters and breaks
between imaginary innings.
</P>
<P>
   From the modest grandstands surrounding one of only two
full-size diamonds in Guatemala City, scouts from the four teams in
last year's league championship series -- the New York Yankees and
Mets, Boston and Atlanta -- joined representatives from teams hoping
to be that good this year, timing pitches with stop watches and
jotting notes.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has potential,'' said Milwaukee Brewers scout Epy Guerrero,
who came from the Dominican Republic. ''I would say that at this
moment he's got a lot of potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is not relation to Yankees pitcher Orlando ''El
Duque'' Hernandez. He was given the nickname ''Duquecito'' or
''Little Duque,'' in Havana because of his similar high-kicking
windup.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's similar to El Duque. He's got different angles and
different arm speed, but the similarities are there,'' said Don
Welke, a scout for the Los Angeles Dodgers. ''He's also got some
good deception in his arm speed which could be very tough on
right-handed hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban players who defect routinely go to Caribbean and Central
American nations. If they went to the United States, they would be
subject to the amateur draft instead of becoming free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's manager and girlfriend, Michelle Aguirre, said she
will accepts offers until March 20.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect the phone to start ringing tomorrow,'' Aguirre said.

<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Monty Williams scored 19 points, and Ron
Mercer added 18 in his return from a five-game absence Tuesday
night as the Orlando Magic beat the Washington Wizards 107-98.
</P>
<P>
   Five players scored in double figures for Orlando, which has won
four of five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic used a 15-3 run to end the third quarter and build an
83-66 lead. Washington didn't get back to within 10 points until
the final minute of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer had six points in the key run. He missed four games with
an ankle sprain and then was suspended by the NBA for a game for
fighting with former Denver Nuggets teammate George McCloud after
the teams played Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Washington reserve Lamond Murray had a game-high 26 points,
while Mitch Richmond added 16 for the Wizards, who have now lost
three straight.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by the play of Williams, a reserve who had 13 points
in the opening 24 minutes, the Magic surged to a 62-55 halftime
lead.
Notes: Don Reid, a Georgetown University product recently cut by
Detroit, made a strong debut with Washington, scoring 12 points and
grabbing eight rebounds. ... Washington's substitutes outscored its
starters 45-43. ... The Wizards outrebounded the Magic 37-31. ...
Washington never led after the 5:16 mark of the first quarter. The
Magic led by as many as 13 points. ...

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rachel Cohen, a young mayoral employee who
helped organize the city's millennium celebrations, died Tuesday of
meningitis. She was 27.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Cohen, who worked on the NYC2000
mayoral committee, contracted meningitis over the weekend and
became ill Monday morning.
</P>

Paul Jolles:
</P>
<P>
   BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- Paul R. Jolles, a Swiss diplomat who
played a key role in postwar economic accords, died Friday. He was
80.
</P>
<P>
   A notice signed by the family in Swiss newspapers Tuesday said
Jolles died unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   Jolles was secretary to the chief of the Swiss delegation in the
negotiations that led to the so-called Washington accord of 1946.
That agreement was meant to wrap up neutral Switzerland's
obligations to the Allies at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview with The Associated Press in 1996 that
Swiss and U.S. officials missed an opportunity at the time to find
a solution to missing Holocaust-era assets.
</P>
<P>
   Jolles is credited with being the most important architect of
Swiss economic foreign policy since the war, culminating with a
1972 free trade treaty with the European Common Market.

   From 1982 to 1988, he served as chairman of the New Jersey
Turnpike Authority and was later appointed finance chairman of the
New Jersey Republican Party. Sullivan also served as co-chairman of

<HEADLINE> Heat 108, Bucks 104  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Heat, sparked by first-time starter Bruce
Bowen's two 3-pointers, tied a franchise record with their 12th
straight home victory, 108-104 over Milwaukee on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Weatherspoon scored all 11 of his points in the fourth
quarter, enabling the Heat to match the franchise record for
consecutive home wins, set from Feb. 15-March 26, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Mashburn scored 28 points, while Alonzo Mourning added 22
points and 17 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Allen paced the Bucks with 26 points. Sam Cassell had 22 and
Glenn Robinson added 20, but the Bucks were unable to hold onto a
15-point lead and they fell behind Orlando by a game for the eighth
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen, who started in place of injured guard Dan Majerle, scored
11 points, including a 3-pointer to give Miami a 99-94 lead with
3:29 left.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's 3 and two free throws helped the Bucks creep within
100-99 with 2:45 remaining. But Tim Hardaway, who had 17 points and
eight assists, nailed a 15-footer.
</P>
<P>
   Then, following a Bucks turnover, Bowen hit another 3 to boost
Miami's lead to 105-99, icing the Heat's first win over Milwaukee
in three tries this season.
</P>
<P>
   Mashburn followed his 13-point second quarter with 11 more in
the third to help Miami outscore Milwaukee 26-12 and take an 80-79
lead into the fourth period.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks shot 63 percent in the first half, with Robinson and
Cassell getting 16 points apiece on a combined 15-of-22 shooting,
helping Milwaukee to a 67-54 lead. It was the most points given up
by the Heat in any half this season.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee shot 65.2 percent in the first quarter to grab a 32-23
lead. Robinson was 4-of-6 for nine points and Cassell was 5-of-6
for 10. Hardaway kept the Heat close with 13, including 6-of-6 from
the foul line.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Heat, already without shooting guard Voshon Lenard
(abdomen strain) lost Majerle to a sprained left ankle. He's
day-to-day. ... Bowen took Majerle's spot for his first start with
the Heat and 11th of his much-traveled four-year career. ...
Reserve foward Otis Thorpe also didn't play because of inflammation
in his left knee. ... For the Bucks, guard Vinny Del Negro was out
with a sore right leg and forward Mirsad Turkcan was sidelined with
an injured left foot. ... When Mashburn missed a free throw in the
second quarter, it ended a streak of 24 made, matching a Heat high
this season. Mourning also did it.

<HEADLINE> Bush Attacks Gore After Primary  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Nomination in hand, George W. Bush had two
victorious words for his home-state supporters Tuesday night:
''Mission accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he quickly added that he was only halfway there.
</P>
<P>
   After sealing the Republican presidential nomination in a sweep
of Southern primaries, including his home state, the Texas governor
celebrated his triumph but said he knew he faced a tough battle
with Vice President Al Gore, who also wrapped up the Democratic
nomination Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his comments during an evening rally that was briefly
interrupted by death-penalty protesters. Earlier in the evening,
Texas put to death a killer who spit out a handcuff key as lethal
drugs took effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I filed for president, I pledged I'd come home to Texas
with the nomination of my party. Well, tonight we can say: Mission
accomplished,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, whose father lost the White House to Bill Clinton in the
1992 election, said, ''Tonight we are halfway to our goal -- but
only halfway -- halfway to ending the Clinton-Gore era in
Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   ''To get there, we must face one more Clinton-Gore campaign.
This last week has been a preview. It's been a preview that the
Gore campaign will say anything to try to win at any cost. We will
confront their tactics one more time, and this time, we will
prevail and they will fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing ahead to the general election campaign, Bush used part
of his victory speech to criticize Gore for focusing on an
education plan that centers on building more schools and hiring
more teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed phasing out federal funding of failing schools
and giving the money to parents in the form of vouchers so they can
seek alternative schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in his approach is student testing devised and
administered by local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to solve our education problems; Al Gore wants to
subsidize them. I will work for children and their parents; he will
work for the entrenched interests that funds his campaigns,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   He had other criticism of the vice president, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore can't solve campaign finance problems when he
symbolizes them. He can't talk about rebuilding the military when
his administration has dismantled our military. And he can't
distance himself from the president when, for eight years, he's
served as cheerleader-in-chief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was joined on stage by a bevy of Texas politicians,
including Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. As the crowd waited for him to
come on the stage, it booed heartily when a large-screen TV showed
Democratic former Gov. Ann Richards, whom Bush defeated in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's big day started at 6:30 a.m., when his cats
scratched at his bedroom door and he went downstairs in the
Governor's Mansion to feed them.
</P>
<P>
   He later ran three miles, before spending the rest of the
afternoon with his wife, Laura, at the Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   As he concluded his speech, he used a line that brought a huge
ovation from the crowd and put a smile to his face: ''I'm proud to
stand before you as Republican nominee for president of the United
States.''

<HEADLINE> 76ers 98, Cavaliers 97, OT  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Lamond Murray missed an off-balance 15-footer
just before the overtime buzzer and Allen Iverson scored 28 points
on a dreadful shooting night Tuesday as the Philadelphia 76ers beat
the Cleveland Cavaliers, 98-97.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson went just 10-for-29 from the field, but scored four
points in OT as the Sixers completed a four-game sweep of the Cavs
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron McKie scored 20 points and made three huge 3-pointers, and
George Lynch added 15 points and 10 rebounds for Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   McKie's final 3 with 1:17 left put the Sixers up 98-95, but
rookie Andre Miller countered for the Cavs with a short jumper 14
seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Kukoc missed a 3-pointer on Philadelphia's next trip, but
Danny Ferry, whose 3-pointer late in regulation helped force
overtime, missed a 3-pointer with 28 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson, who forced shots all night, was way off on a 14-footer
with 3.6 seconds left and the Cavs called a quick timeout.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland ran an isolation play on the left side for Murray, who
dribbled toward the middle of the lane and got a good look at the
basket. But his shot bounced off the front rim just before time
expired.
</P>
<P>
   Miller had 14 points, eight assists and seven rebounds for the
Cavs, who dropped their fourth straight. Murray had 16 and Ferry
15.
</P>
<P>
   George Lynch's two free throws gave the Sixers an 84-73 with
3:41 remaining in regulation, but the Cavs scored seven straight.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, which had gone on an 18-3 run earlier in the
period, appeared in control when Iverson made two free throws with
1:03 to play, but Bob Sura's layup off a nice feed from Miller
brought the Cavs within three.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson missed with 36 seconds left and following a timeout,
Cleveland tied it when Ferry drilled a 3-pointer from the left wing
with 22.4 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers had time for one last shot, but Eric Snow missed a
20-footer just before the horn.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson, the league's leading scorer who scored 50 points here
as a rookie, was frustrated most of the night and was forcing shots
when he began to find his range in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Following a sequence in which he was twice elbowed by Sura,
Iverson hit a long floater in the lane, then buried two straight
jumpers to put the Sixers up 75-72 with 6:48 left.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson was called for his second personal late in the first
quarter and began the second period on the bench. But with McKie
scoring seven points, the Sixers went on a 15-6 run to take a 39-31
lead.
</P>
<P>
   However, after Iverson went out again after picking up his third
foul, the Cavs closed the half with an 8-0 spurt, capped by Ferry's
3-pointer to take a 50-47 haltime lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rick Majerus, Miller's college coach at Utah, was at the
game along with the entire Utah team. The Runnin' Utes are in town
to play in this week's NCAA Midwest Regional. They play Saint Louis
in the first round on Thursday. ... Offensive tackle Orlando Brown,
whose suspension for shoving a referee was recently dropped by the
NFL, was one of several members of the Cleveland Browns on hand.
... Philadelphia activated F Tyrone Hill and placed guard Ira
Bowman on the injured list before the game. Hill, who got 12
rebounds in 24 minutes, is now 9-0 this season against his three
former teams: the Cavs, Milwaukee Bucks and Golden State Warriors.

Detroit, on a season-best eight-game unbeaten streak (6-0-2) also
got three assists from Nicklas Lidstrom and two from Tomas
Holmstrom.
</P>
<P>
   The win seemed unlikely after the Predators forced overtime
behind the solid play of goalie Tomas Vokoun and two short-handed
goals that rallied Nashville from a 2-0 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   But Shanahan parked himself to Vokoun's right in time to take a
Lidstrom rebound off the end boards and fire it into the net for
his third career overtime goal.
</P>
<P>
   Vokoun had 32 saves, including several spectacular stops late in
the game. He denied point-blank chances from Fedorov and Shanahan
in the final minute of the third period and made a pad save on
Vyacheslav Kozlov in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Osgood made 24 saves for Detroit, but was caught out of
position on goals from Tom Fitzgerald and Robert Valicevic.
</P>
<P>
   Fedorov scored 11:53 into the first with a shot through traffic
from between the circles that beat Vokoun on his glove side.
Holmstrom made the play with a pass out from behind the Nashville
net before setting a screen in front of Vokoun as Lidstrom fed
Fedorov for the shot.
</P>
<P>
   Another good play from Holmstrom set up Shanahan's power-play
goal that gave Detroit a 2-0 lead 12:57 into the second. Holmstrom
got the rebound of Lidstrom's shot from the right point and quickly
passed it to Shanahan, who was open on the left side of the net and
put a blast past Vokoun.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald got one back with a short-handed goal when he beat
Osgood to a loose puck near the right circle and flipped it over
the goalie at 14:34.
</P>
<P>
   Valicevic's short-handed goal tied it 4:12 into the third.
Osgood again came out of the net to make a pass to Kozlov near the
Detroit blue line, but Valicevic tipped the puck away from Kozlov
and it skidded into the goal before Osgood could recover.

<HEADLINE> Toronto's Berard Leaves Hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- It is still too early to tell if Bryan Berard
will regain sight in his right eye.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto defenseman, who was struck in the face Saturday
night by the stick of Ottawa's Marian Hossa, will require more
surgery before a prognosis can be made. It is unlikely that Berard
will lose the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ''His chances are slim but not impossible,'' said specialist Dr.
Rob Devenyi, who examined Berard on Tuesday morning. ''At this
point it is just conjecture until the extent of the injury is known
and we won't know that until we remove the blood surgically and see
exactly how damaged the retina is.''
</P>
<P>
   Berard, 23, was released from the hospital Tuesday night, but
will return for exploratory surgery -- possibly within a week -- once
the risk of infection has passed.
</P>
<P>
   ''As ultrasound has shown, though, he has numerous other
injuries to his eye,'' Devenyi said. ''And at this point, it's
really not possible to definitively make a statement what his
visual recovery will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Berard was hit as Hossa was following through on a slap shot.
The 1997 NHL rookie of the year, had surgery following the game and
returned to Toronto by air ambulance on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The blow by Hossa's stick caused a significant cut in the eye --
nearly one inch.
</P>
<P>
   Devenyi said, however, that Berard was feeling quite
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Using a giant model of an eye, Devenyi said that Berard's eye
cavity is filled with blood. The extent of the tearing and damage
to the retina is the key factor affecting the vision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have a lot of optimism, but I have hope,'' Devenyi
said at Air Canada Centre.
</P>
<P>
   Berard can only see the difference between light and dark, but
the doctor added that it is not surprising given the amount of
blood that is present.
</P>
<P>
   ''That (seeing light) doesn't really say anything about the
extent of the damage,'' Devenyi said. ''If you take a normal eye
and fill it with blood, that's all you see.''
</P>
<P>
   Devenyi has seen players with similar injuries play again,
although he acknowledged it took many months. He stressed he still
does not know the exact nature of Berard's injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still in a mode of maintaining hope that something will
be found when they finally get in to have a straight look at it,''
Leafs coach and general manager Pat Quinn said. ''He believes he's
going to beat this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if a visor would have helped, Devenyi said ''Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   He said in 28 years there has not been a hockey injury such as
this to a player wearing a shield.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the easiest question in the world, everyone should wear a
full visor. Period,'' Devenyi said

<HEADLINE> Gore Vows To Halt Soft Money Ads  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Al Gore promised to hold off on ''soft
money'' TV ads in the general election as long as George W. Bush
does the same, issuing a fresh challenge to his rival after barely
a moment to celebrate Southern victories that assured the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore put Republican Bush on notice for ''a very tough fight''
between now and November -- especially in Florida, a state some
Democrats had once written off because Bush's brother, Jeb, is the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the night that we crossed the delegate threshold and I
wanted to symbolize by my presence here that Florida is a key
battleground state in November,'' Gore said. The former senator
from Tennessee declared himself a grateful ''son of the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring previous calls for banning unregulated soft money
campaign donations -- a stance Republicans suggest is merely an
attempt to neutralize Bush's money advantages -- Gore said he was
instructing his party to hold off on ''issue ads'' on his behalf
unless the Republicans start them first for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Such ads, paid for with the unlimited interest-group
contributions called soft money, have been used by the parties as a
way of aiding their presidential candidates without technically
violating campaign finance rules.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in a playful mood all day, had aides find him a computer
at Leon High School in Tallahassee so that, before his Election
Night victory speech, he could type the challenge in an e-mail to
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In the message's subject line, which Gore read aloud from the
screen, he typed, ''Hello and congratulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Texas governor and son of the former president, also
secured enough Republican delegates in Tuesday's balloting to
guarantee him the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will take the first step,'' Gore wrote. ''It's up to you and
your party whether you want to start the ad war arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush proved his fund-raising clout last year with a record $70
million haul and, even though he spent most of that during the
primaries, can doubtless raise more. Gore is accepting federal
matching funds and must therefore abide by fund-raising and
spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Gore reached out to Bush, he slapped him for advancing
what Gore habitually calls a ''risky tax scheme'' assembled by
special-interest campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally of supporters in the Leon High gymnasium, Gore
contrasted his agenda -- ''using our prosperity wisely,'' he said --
to what he saw as Bush's approach: ''putting (the budget surplus)
into that special-interest roulette wheel from the 1980s that drove
our economy into the ditch.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Gore voted for himself in rural Tennessee,
where he and his wife, Tipper, keep a small farm. After 2{ grueling
months of virtually nonstop travel, Gore promised to keep up the
pace.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's a falloff of attention in the news media, that's
fine,'' Gore told a reporter at the Forks River School where he
cast his vote in the Tennessee primary. ''But in terms of my effort
to communicate directly with voters, there will be no letup at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Gore would contest not just Florida, which he visited
twice in as many days this week, but other Southern states
considered traditional Republican strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   As if to symbolize his commitment, Gore was fortified throughout
the day Tuesday by Southern home cooking -- bacon and eggs for
breakfast, fried chicken for lunch, ribs and barbecue for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he was spending this momentous day, the man who ran
for the Democratic nomination in 1988 and has been angling for the
presidency at least that long, responded with a jokingly exhaustive
accounting:
</P>
<P>
   ''I got up early, read my CIA briefings, the newspapers, went
for an hour-long run back in the hills behind my house and then I
showered and shaved and got dressed and put on my boots, visited my
mother.''

<HEADLINE> E. Timor Refugees Head Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- More than 1,000 mostly anti-independence East
Timorese refugees have left camps in West Timor, raising hopes that
many more will soon decide to go home, the U.N. refugee agency said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The movement from three West Timor camps was the biggest since
aid agencies started returning refugees to the east in October,
said Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the group served in the Indonesian army, are related to
people who did, or are otherwise associated with Indonesian rule in
East Timor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This may be an early sign of some sort of a breakthrough on
the return of this most difficult group from West Timor,'' Janowski
added.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 250,000 East Timorese fled over the border last
year to escape violence from Indonesian troops and their militia
allies who opposed a vote for East Timor's independence. Some
150,000 people have returned to East Timor since peacekeepers
arrived Sept. 20 to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   In East Timor's capital Dili on Tuesday, the U.S. ambassador to
Indonesia, Robert Gelbar, said elements in Indonesia's army, known
as TNI, continue to directly help anti-independence militias.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is TNI involvement. We were told all the militias had
been disarmed, suddenly and magically they seem to have come up
with arms,'' Gelbard said, adding that aid probably came from
individuals within the TNI and was not official army policy.
</P>
<P>
   Militia activity and propaganda is blamed by U.N. officials for
the slow return of the remaining 100,00 refugees still in squalid
camps in West Timor, which is still part of Indonesia. UNHCR has
said it believes about half that number eventually will return.

<HEADLINE> Spurs 94, Hawks 79  </HEADLINE>
By KELLEY SHANNON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Sean Elliott completed his comeback to the
NBA on Tuesday, returning to play for San Antonio seven months
after a kidney transplant as the Spurs defeated Atlanta 94-79.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who played 12 minutes and shot 1-for-3 from the field,
missed a 22-foot jumper and a layup in the third quarter. Then,
with a quick step around defender Roshown McLeod, he brought wildly
cheering Alamodome fans to their feet with a dramatic dunk five
minutes into the period.
</P>
<P>
   He drove the lane and slammed the ball down with his right hand.
Spurs teammate Mario Elie joined in the applause, clapping as he
ran back down the court. Hawks center Dikembe Mutombo simply
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's basket sparked a 6-0 scoring scoring spurt for San
Antonio, though Atlanta quickly recovered and pulled ahead 66-64 by
the end of the third.
</P>
<P>
   The score remained close as the fourth quarter got under way,
but the Spurs moved ahead 76-75 on a basket by David Robinson with
7:21 left to play. Robinson followed by scoring the next five
points, upping San Antonio's edge to 81-75 with 3:40 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta could get no closer the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson led San Antonio with 26 points and eight rebounds,
while Avery Johnson had 22 points and 10 assists and Tim Duncan had
21 points and 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jackson scored 22 points for the Hawks, and Mutombo had 14
points and 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   As the final seconds of the game clocked ticked away, the fans
shouted, ''We want Sean! We want Sean!''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott became the first pro athlete in a major sport to return
to competition after a kidney transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Although Spurs coach Gregg Popovich had been saying he would use
Elliott as a reserve, he started at small forward and played the
first five minutes, grabbing a defensive rebound and recording one
assist.
</P>
<P>
   On the Spurs' first possession, he slipped slightly as he passed
to Johnson. Later on, he fell again as he drew rough contact from
Mutombo under the Spurs' basket.
</P>
<P>
   But Elliott seemed unfazed and played on until he was replaced
by Jerome Kersey. Elliott started the third quarter, playing seven
minutes that period.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, 32, now in his 11th season, received a kidney from his
older brother Noel in transplant surgery Aug. 16. He said from the
start he hoped to resume his basketball career.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott wanted to make his comeback at a home game in front of
family, friends, his doctors and San Antonio fans. A total of
26,708 spectators showed up to watch, filling some upper sections
of the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs got off to a quick start, leading 23-14 by late in the
first quarter. But the Hawks closed to 25-22 by the end of the
period and, thanks to a barrage of jumpers by Jim Jackson and
LaPhonso Ellis in the second, led 47-44 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The National Kidney Foundation announced Tuesday that
Elliott will serve as spokesperson for its 2000 U.S. Transplant
Games to be held June 21-24 in Orlando, Fla. The Olympic-style
competition is for athletes who have had all types of organ
transplants. ... San Antonio shot 51 percent compared with 42
percent for Atlanta, but the Hawks outrebounded the Spurs 42-39.
... Steve Kerr (right knee) and Terry Porter (left knee sprain)
were on the injured list for the Spurs. The Hawks had no one on the
injured list.

Nominations Clinched, Bush With Advantage
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As both presidential candidates clinched their party's
nominations in the Southern primaries tonight, a new poll shows George W. Bush
with a slight advantage among likely voters in the presidential race against Al
Gore. Bush is also drawing more of the John McCain supporters that both he and
Gore are aggressively trying to attract, according to the poll released today.
The Texas governor has 49 percent to 43 percent for Gore in the CNN-USA
Today-Gallup poll. Other recent polls have shown the race very close or with the
vice president slightly ahead, but many of them polled registered voters.
Narrowing the poll to likely voters often improves the numbers of the Republican
candidate.

<HEADLINE> Part of Tivoli Gardens For Sale  </HEADLINE>
By JAN M. OLSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Part of the famed Tivoli gardens,
Copenhagen's landmark amusement park and an inspiration for
Disney's theme parks, was put on sale Tuesday by the Carlsberg
breweries.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a professional corporate decision'' to put Carlsberg's
43 percent share in the park on sale, said Carlsberg chief
executive Flemming Lindeloev. ''We wouldn't have done so if we
should have acted with our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindeloev, whose company is seeking to sell of non-core
operations to concentrate on beer production, said he already had
several foreign and Danish bidders, but he declined to identify
them.
</P>
<P>
   Potential buyers include the Disney group, pop singer Michael
Jackson and the Oklahoma City-based Premier Parks, which owns some
30 amusement parks in the United States and in Europe, Danish media
said.
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1843, the 100,000 square-yard park with hundreds of
trees and thousands of flowers is an oasis in the heart of
Copenhagen. Its roller coaster dates from 1914, the merry-go-round
turns to old-fashioned hurdy-gurdy music and the pantomime theater
is one of Europe's last stages keeping Commedia dell'Arte
traditions alive.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 3.7 million people visited the park -- one-third of
them foreigners -- making it the third most-visited amusement park
in Europe, behind Disneyland Paris and Britain's Blackpool Pleasure
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney visited Tivoli in the 1950s and took away some ideas
for his theme parks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Denmark's largest banking group, Den Danske Bank, controls the
remaining shares of the park and said it would be willing to part
with some.

<HEADLINE> Knicks 91, Rockets 85  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Uninhibited by a microphone and unburdened from
controversy after a late compromise by the commissioner's office,
Jeff Van Gundy and the New York Knicks had everything go their way
Tuesday -- on and off the court.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell scored 27 points, reserve John Wallace added
17, and Marcus Camby returned from the injured list and made a big
defensive play as the Knicks beat the Houston Rockets 91-85.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours before tipoff, the Knicks learned the league
office had temporarily dropped its requirement that coaches wear a
microphone for nationally televised games. It was good news to Van
Gundy, who had been one of the most outspoken critics of the
league's policy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Van Gundy wearing a microphone, a boom microphone was
positioned near the Knicks' bench. The only time Van Gundy was
closely miked was during timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's much less intrusive,'' said Van Gundy, who thought that a
wave of negative publicity had something to do with the league's
shift on the microphone matter. Teams had been facing fines
beginning at $100,000 for coaches refusing to be miked. The matter
will be revisited Wednesday by the league office and the coaches'
association after they review how well the compromise worked in
this game.
</P>
<P>
   TNT used just one snippet of sound from Van Gundy as he exhorted
his team to protect the ball better and take quality shots late in
the third quarter as the Rockets were making a run.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace gave the Knicks a quick lift when he came in early in
the first quarter after Allan Houston picked up two quick fouls.
Wallace scored nine points in less than three minutes, making all
four of his shots, to help the Knicks pull ahead for good.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing by as many as 17 early in the third quarter, the
Rockets made a run in the fourth and pulled to 64-63 on an
alley-oop dunk by Kelvin Cato with 9:40 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks missed two shots on their next possession, and Walt
Williams was leading the fast break when Camby prevented the
Rockets from getting a shot that could have put them ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Camby, activated earlier in the day after missing more than five
weeks with a strained knee ligament, reached in and poked the ball
away from Williams, leading to a steal by Sprewell, who then turned
downcourt and hit a jumper. Kurt Thomas followed with a layup for a
five-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Houston pulled within two points with 5:15 left on a three-point
play by Cuttino Mobley, but Sprewell had a steal and jumper to end
the threat. The Rockets got no closer the rest of the way as
Patrick Ewing scored six of his 16 points in the final three
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Francis led Houston with 32 points and Shandon Anderson
had 17. The Rockets lost their fourth straight.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich wore a microphone and wasn't
inhibited, unleashing a stream of vulgarities at his players as
they left the court following the first quarter. ... Team doctor
Norman Scott advised Camby to rest the knee for a couple more days
after it swelled following the team's morning shootaround, but
Camby ignored the advice. He had two points and two rebounds in 15
minutes. ... Houston's Hakeem Olajuwon sat out the first 9:49 of
the fourth quarter and spent one late timeout clipping his
fingernails. He finished 0-for-7 from the field. ... The Knicks'
Allan Houston scored just six points before fouling out with 4:58
left.

<HEADLINE> No Arbitration Decision on Starks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- An arbitrator heard arguments for 2{ hours
Tuesday night but didn't reach a decision on whether Chicago Bulls
guard John Starks can leave the team and join a playoff contender.
</P>
<P>
   Arbitrator Roger Kaplan said he would inform the NBA and the
players' union at a later date when he will announce his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan held a conference call Tuesday night that included
lawyers Rick Buchanan for the NBA and Jeff Kessler for the players'
association.
</P>
<P>
   Starks has offered to forfeit the rest of his $4 million salary
-- about $900,000 -- if the rebuilding Bulls would waive him,
clearing the way for him to sign with a team headed for the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the union argued that if Starks was willing to give up
his salary, the league shouldn't stand in his way of joining a team
with a shot at a championship.
</P>
<P>
   The league countered that there is no provision in the
collective bargaining agreement for such a move, so it shouldn't be
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Dam, a systems arbitrator, agreed with the league
earlier this month, ruling that the NBA didn't circumvent the
collective bargaining agreement. But he said a grievance arbitrator
should hear the case and that's what Kaplan did.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls could still release Starks and let him sign with
another team, but they'd have to pay the remainder of his salary.
That would also make Starks ineligible for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Players released after 11:59 p.m. on March 1 who then sign with
another team are not eligible to compete in the playoffs. Starks
wanted his release retroactive to before the deadline so he would
be eligible for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Starks returned home to Tulsa, Okla., earlier this month to
await the decision. He's missed nine straight games with the Bulls,
played in just four games for Chicago and averaged 7.5.
</P>
<P>
   Starks came to Chicago from the Golden State Warriors last month
as part of a three-team trade that sent Toni Kukoc to Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Group Complains of Attacks on Press  </HEADLINE>
By ELOY O. AGUILAR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANCUN, Mexico (AP) -- A leading press group on Tuesday said it
was ''open season'' on journalists in the Americas, citing the
killings of eight journalists in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing declaration of a conference here, the
Inter-American Press Association said five journalists had been
killed in Colombia, and one each in Guatemala, Uruguay and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the assassinations, the IAPA said, journalists
face ''new forms of manipulation or muzzling that have appeared in
presumably democratic countries.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In Peru, the government appears to be prepared to remove any
vestige of legitimacy from the upcoming elections with constant
attacks on journalists and newspapers,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
   The IAPA also said the press faces attacks from drug
traffickers, guerrillas and paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   It also said that certain court decisions were violating free
press ideals: In Costa Rica, the Supreme Court required the daily
La Nacion to publish the full text of a ruling against the
newspaper that took the first ten full pages of the edition; in
Peru, the newspaper El Comercio of Lima ''has been the object of
verbal abuse that presages ostensibly legal actions ... to silence
the independent press.''
</P>
<P>
   The IAPA also said that in Colombia, ''murders, threats,
kidnappings and exile continue to haunt journalists. Courage is
called for to work as a journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization also criticized the Mexican government's
decision to use its government news agency Notimex to distribute
the advertising of federal agencies. After a heated debate, IAPA
approved a resolution asking the government to dissolve or sell
Notimex.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, the government reversed itself and said Notimex
would not distribute advertising. It said it reached its decision
after meeting with media leaders and hearing their ''legitimate
concerns.''

<HEADLINE> Ernst &AMP; Young Hires Ex-Adversary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Accounting giant Ernst &AMP; Young has turned to a
former adversary to help the firm win back a $185 million
settlement paid to a client last year.
</P>
<P>
   The small Pikesville law firm of Snyder, Weiner, Weltchek,
Vogelstein &AMP; Brown was on the other side of the table when the Big
Five accounting firm agreed last April to settle a lawsuit with the
now-defunct Merry-Go-Round clothing chain.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ernst &AMP; Young has hired the firm to recover the $185 million
from Swidler, Berlin, Shereff and Friedman LLP, the Washington,
D.C., law firm that served as Merry-Go-Round's legal counsel in its
efforts to reorganize under Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,400 store clothier, which was liquidated in 1996, had
blamed Ernst &AMP; Young's accountants for its failed turnaround bid
and said the firm concealed a business relationship with Swidler &AMP;
Berlin that represented a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young filed a lawsuit Monday in Baltimore Circuit Court,
blamed Swidler Berlin managing partner Roger Frankel for failing to
disclose the ties between the law firm and the accounting firm when
he recommended that Merry-Go-Round hire Ernst &AMP; Young.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm had received more than $4 million in fees from
Ernst &AMP; Young, the suit contends, and Swidler Berlin was afraid the
disclosure might prevent Ernst &AMP; Young from winning the
Merry-Go-Round assignment, the suit claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Federal bankruptcy law requires that such relationships in a
bankruptcy be disclosed, the lawsuit alleged.
</P>
<P>
   When Ernst &AMP; Young agreed last year to settle claims it provided
incompetent and fraudulent advice to Merry-Go-Round, the accounting
firm said it believed ''other parties bear substantial
responsibility for the failure of Merry-Go-Round to survive'' and
that it would ''look to these parties for contribution to the
settlement.''

<HEADLINE> Frequent Binge Drinking on Rise  </HEADLINE>
By TOM KIRCHOFER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Binge drinkers on college campuses are likely to
be white, live in a fraternity and have a history of binge drinking
in high school. And the percentage of frequent bingers is on the
rise, according to a study released Tuesday by the Harvard School
of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted last year, was based on responses to
written questionnaires from 14,000 students at 119 colleges around
the country. The survey, sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation, was published in the March issue of the Journal of
American College Health. The margin of error was plus or minus 1
percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   The study found the population of frequent binge drinkers rose
last year to 22.7 percent of the student population, up from 19.8
percent in 1993 and 20.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of students going on binges stayed roughly the
same through the 1990s, but American campuses grew more polarized
between students whose binges are severe and students who don't
touch alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Binge drinker was defined as a man who drank at least five
drinks in a row, or a woman who drank four, at least once in the
two weeks prior to the survey. A frequent binge drinker had binged
three or more times in the two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''To make the situation harder for college administrators, most
of these students do not feel they have a problem, and the large
majority consider themselves moderate drinkers,'' said Henry
Wechsler, a social psychologist and Harvard researcher who led the
study.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith Petrin, a 20-year-old Harvard junior, said while many
of her peers would probably be classified as binge drinkers by
Wechsler, she thinks they generally have a healthy attitude towards
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see a problem with it,'' she said. ''It's a good
release and it's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found the overall portion of binge drinkers has stayed
at about two out of five students since a study was done in 1993,
while the proportion of frequent bingers -- and nondrinkers -- rose.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of students who don't drink at all has been
rising steadily, from 15.4 percent in 1993 to 18.9 percent in 1997
and finally, 19.2 percent in 1999, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Wechsler said it was unclear why campuses were being
increasingly polarized between frequent binge drinkers and
nondrinkers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may be that the drawing off of nondrinkers and light
drinkers from the drinking scene are making it a much heavier
drinking scene,'' he said. ''But that's just speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   The people most likely to binge drink tend to be white and male.
The study found that 78.9 percent of students who lived in
fraternity or sorority houses were binge drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   The students least likely to be binge drinkers were black or
Asian, over the age of 24, married, and had not been binge drinkers
in high school.
</P>
<P>
   While the study found binge drinkers have increased risks of
missing class, falling behind in schoolwork, getting in trouble or
getting hurt, it also found that such drinkers create ''secondhand
effects'' on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Students who did not binge drink and lived on campuses where
bingeing was common were twice as likely to report being assaulted,
awakened or kept from studying by drinking students than were
nonbinge drinkers and nondrinkers at campuses where bingeing was
less common.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Wiegert, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln senior who
described himself as a former binge drinker, said he quit drinking
to excess when he realized he often said stupid things while drunk,
disrespected people and once broke a table.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a cost-benefit analysis for me,'' the economics major
said. ''I have yet to come up with one benefit to high-risk
drinking.''

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 4, Mighty Ducks 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Ray Bourque scored his 398th career goal and Joe
Sakic added a goal as the Colorado Avalanche beat the Anaheim
Mighty Ducks 4-2 Tuesday night for their sixth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque scored his third goal for the Avalanche, 4-0 since the
March 6th trade that brought the veteran defenseman to Colorado
from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic tallied for the seventh time in as many games as the
Avalanche extended their lead in the Northwest Division to four
points over Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, who played with the Bruins for 21 seasons, broke a 1-1
tie with his 13th goal at 2:20 of the third. He also added an
assist. Sakic also set up a goal and has 16 points in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Forsberg scored his first goal in 12 games and added an
assist. Chris Drury broke a nine-game goal drought for the
Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Tverdovsky and Ted Donato scored for Anaheim, winless in
three games (0-2-1).
</P>
<P>
   Dominic Roussel started in place of Ducks goalie Guy Hebert, who
was injured Saturday when hit by teammate Paul Kariya in a tie with
St. Louis. Roussel made 19 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim controlled play for all but the final four minutes of
the first period, but trailed 1-0. The Avalanche, outshot 10-6 in
the period, turned a seemingly harmless clearing pass by Roussel
into Drury's ninth goal.
</P>
<P>
   Roussel sent the puck along the boards from behind the net, but
Drury picked it off in the right circle and fired a shot over
Roussel's glove side at 17:13.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, Patrick Roy turning aside Donato on a
2-on-1 break after Jon Klemm turned the puck over in the neutral
zone. Two minutes later, Roy denied two shots after defenseman
Sandis Ozolinsh turned the puck over.
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky tied the game at 1, deflecting a shot past Roy 35
seconds into the third. Teemu Selanne had taken the shot from the
slot and Tverdovsky got enough stick on the puck for his 12th goal.
</P>
<P>
   Roy stopped 26 shots for his 27th victory this season and 439th
career, closing within eight wins of Terry Sawchuk's NHL record.
</P>
<P>
   The tie lasted long enough for Colorado to convert on two power
plays against the worst penalty-killing team in the NHL. Ruslan
Salei was sent off for holding and Bourque sent a slap shot past
Roussel.
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg got a gift goal at 5:47 after Pavel Trnka was whistled
for high-sticking. Forsberg made a pass from the left point that
went off the stick of Anaheim defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski and past
Roussel.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic got his 22nd goal at 12:38. Donato made it 4-2 at 14:29.

<HEADLINE> Doug Swingley Wins Third Iditarod  </HEADLINE>
By MARY PEMBERTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NOME, Alaska (AP) -- Montana musher Doug Swingley successfully
defended his title Tuesday in the 1,100-mile Iditarod Trail Sled
Dog Race, breaking his record by more than an hour and joining an
elite group of Alaskan mushers.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gebhardt of Kasilof followed more than five hours later to
take second place.
</P>
<P>
   By driving his team first across the finish line in this Gold
Rush town, Swingley, of Lincoln, Mont., won $60,000 of a record
$525,000 purse and a new pickup truck worth more than $37,000.
Gebhardt won $52,500. Race money was to be awarded to the first 30
finishers.
</P>
<P>
   Swingley is the only non-Alaskan ever to win the race over its
28 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if they want me,'' Swingley said of the other
three-time winners, all Alaskans. But he wasn't going to be scared
off.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going anywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Swingley, of Lincoln, Mont., passed under the burled arch
marking the finish line on Front Street 10:58 a.m. AST. His team of
11 dogs trotted into the chute as a brisk wind blew and hundreds of
cheering fans crowded the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great team, they just kept getting better and
better,'' Swingley said, patting the dogs. ''I think camouflaged in
this team was the same magnificent dog team I had the year
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the 11 dogs that crossed the finish line were on last
year's team, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Swingley completed the race in 9 days and 58 minutes. The
previous race record, set by Swingley in 1995, was 9 days, 2 hours,
42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was fortunate this year that temperatures were balmy,
resembling conditions in Montana where he trains. During the race,
skies were often sunny and temperatures frequently climbed into the
upper 30s. He joked that he should have packed sneakers and sweat
pants instead of thermal wear.
</P>
<P>
   If the team had encountered a foot or two of fresh snow, the
outcome of the race could have been different, Swingley said. Eight
of the 11 dogs on his team were females and not as strong as males
at breaking trail.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have been a race with more snow. I would have had a
tough time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Swingley was planning for this year's race, he calculated
that, if everything went perfectly, it would take him 8 days and 17
hours to get from Anchorage to Nome.
</P>
<P>
   ''The run times were awful close to 'perfect world' stuff,'' he
said. Swingley had hoped to be the first musher to finish the race
in less than nine days.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have been a milestone in Iditarod history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Swingley joins Jeff King of Denali Park, who finished third this
year, and Martin Buser of Big Lake in the three-time winners
circle. Susan Butcher of Manley, who last competed in 1994, has won
four times. Rick Swenson of Two Rivers is the race's only five-time
winner.
</P>
<P>
   His second straight victory makes him the third musher to
successfully defend his title. Butcher had consecutive victories in
1986, 1987 and 1988. Swenson had consecutive victories in 1981 and
1982.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hasn't been done for a long time. So it gave me a lot of
motivation,'' Swingley said of his repeat win. ''With the
competition that's out there, it's really difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Gebhardt crossed the finish line at 4:04 p.m. It took him nine
days, six hours and four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Gebhardt, who finished sixth last year, led during the early
part of the race and stayed close after relinquishing the lead just
in case something went awry with Swingley's race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I figured I'd go out front and see what it was like,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Gebhardt reached White Mountain, 77 miles from the
finish line, he was more than five hours behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''From day one he knew his team was faster than mine,'' Gebhardt
said of Swingley's team.
</P>
<P>
   A record 81 teams began the race, which had its ceremonial start
in Anchorage on March 4. By the time Gebhardt finished, 67 teams
remained on the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Swingley broke out of the pack early in the race, pushing
himself far ahead of the other frontrunners before taking his
mandatory 24-hour break. It's a strategy that helped him win the
race in 1995 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first musher to arrive in the Interior village of
Ruby, the halfway mark on the trail, and he never relinquished his
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Gebhardt said second place was good enough this year but next
year could be a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time you run a race you learn something,'' Gebhardt
said. ''I'm not sure I learned enough to win it yet, but I'm
close.''
</P>
<P>
   Swingley said good dog breeding and a serious training regimen
helped his team win. Swingley has a 150-mile training run near his
Montana home to condition the dogs to go long distances.
</P>
<P>
   He breeds dogs that have super endurance and when he trains, he
doesn't hold the dogs back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just let them go wide open,'' he said. ''They are really
resilient.''
</P>
<P>
   Swingley decided to try breaking his own record finish when he
reached the Koyuk checkpoint, 171 miles from the finish line. He
drove his team for more than 10 hours Monday to reach White
Mountain, where teams are required to take an eight-hour rest.
</P>
<P>
   Swingley said he never considered Gebhardt a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm way faster than he is,'' Swingley said. ''He didn't chase
me very hard. I didn't even see him.''
</P>
<P>
   The ever-confident Swingley didn't have much sympathy for the
other mushers he left behind on the Iditarod trail.
</P>
<P>
   ''I gave them all an opportunity when the race started. We all
had an even shot.''
