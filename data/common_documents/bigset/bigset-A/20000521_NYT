<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Revolution's youth movement could be paying off.
They held off the Chicago Fire, 1-0, and finished the night tied
for first place in the Eastern Division with a lineup averaging 25
years old.
</P>
<P>
   They again used a set play, which is becoming their best
offensive weapon, to provide the difference as Wolde Harris headed
in a Mauricio Ramos corner kick in the 31st minute, then held off a
desperate Chicago attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution kept their composure and remained compact as they
protected the lead, in sharp contrast to last Wednesday, when they
squandered a two-goal advantage in a 4-3 loss to Colorado. They
also benefited by the absence of Hristo Stoitchkov, who made a
92d-minute unofficial appearance by running onto the field in his
warmup jacket and receving a caution from referee Kevin Stott, and
Lubos Kubik, who left with a left knee strain in the seventh
minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what we needed to do,'' Revolution coach Fernando
Clavijo said. ``We needed to minimize their space and minimize our
mistakes. We made four crucial mistakes against Colorado and they
cost us. If they score on a great play, fine, but we wanted to make
sure we didn't give away anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy was solid. As the visiting team, the Revolution
absorbed pressure in an attempt to frustrate the home team. They
did so with a three-man back line of Brian Dunseth, 23, Joe
Franchino, 24, and Rusty Pierce, 20. Defensive midfielders Mike
Burns, 29, and Ivan McKinley, 30, who took the places of Leonel
Alvarez (left ankle sprain) and John Harkes (calf), held the Fire's
Peter Nowak in check.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago controlled the pace and kept possession for most of the
first half, but had two goals disallowed for offside, and Jeff
Causey made a solid save on a breakaway by Dema Kovalenko in the
20th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution scored against the run of play as Harris's
dribbling set up a loose ball in the penalty area, and he slammed a
shot off C.J. Brown, who was standing in the goal area. Ramos then
curled a corner kick to the near post, and Harris headed it past
Jesse Marsch, who appeared to step to his right, vacating the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost whoever was marking me just by running around,'' Harris
said. ``And I was wide open for the header.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played to the last second of the game and we were aware of
what was going on. After watching 2 1/2 hours of video of the last
game, we knew what to do when we took the lead. And with 15 minutes
left, we knew we had to kill the clock and kill the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we surprised ourselves because we knew we could
do this. We might have surprised some people but this shows the
depth of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good mix of youth and experience and we had
experienced players in the middle of the pitch. Mike Burns and Ivan
McKinley worked really hard to win the ball back and they stayed
pretty compact.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution again failed to play through midfield, but this
time Mauricio Ramos remained on the field until the final minutes.
And, though Ramos was seldom involved in the offense, he and
McKinley made some vital touches to keep possession in
counterattack. Imad Baba and Ted Chronopoulos neutralized the
Fire's outside threats.

COLD WAR STILL RED HOT IN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Commissar Hull:
</P>
<P>
   Excuse, please. I mean to say, of course, Governor Hull. I write
now to be telling you that I am pleased as borscht that in state of
Arizona the law still treats communists in a way to make late Sen.
Joseph McCarthy most proud.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a teacher I never met before is showing me loyalty
oath dat each person employed by gov ernment in Arizona must sign,
no matter if they are working for state or city or county or
schools or commissions or even Politburo. Ex cuse, please. I mean
to say, of course, governor's staff.
</P>
<P>
   This oath goes, ``I do solemnly swear that I will support the
Constitution of the United States and the Consti tution and laws of
the State of Arizona; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to
the same, and defend them against all enemies, foreign and domestic
. . .'' And so on.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher is telling me that she asks comrade bosses what law
this oath comes from and they say it is Arizona Revised Statutes
38-231.
</P>
<P>
   Is most bee-utiful law I'm seeing since Bolsheviks decided to
rewrite books in Russia back in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Paragraph E describes for workers what oath means and what
happens to them if oath they sign is violated.
</P>
<P>
   Person signing oath cannot ``commit or aid in the commission of
any act to overthrow by force or violence the government of this
state or any of its political subdivisions . . .''
</P>
<P>
   (Excuse, please, but this causes me wondering why Rep. Karen
Johnson from Mesa, who introduced bill to secede from union, has
not been arrested and banished. Or, is ``Mesa'' English translation
for ``Si beria''?)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, here is best part.
</P>
<P>
   Law also says person violates oath if he or she ``knowingly
becomes or remains a member of the Communist Party of the United
States or its successors or any of its subordinate organizations .
. .''
</P>
<P>
   Even better, law says violation is ``Class 4 felony'' and
``employee shall be deemed discharged.''
</P>
<P>
   This means it is still possible in this state to send Cossacks
and have political dissident dragged to gulag.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, teacher is telling me she has trouble signing oath. She
is saying it is difficult to sign when her job is teaching children
that, in America, free persons can join any political party they
choose. She says this is kind of oath communists force peo ple to
sign.
</P>
<P>
   She asks me if I tink she should sign. Being good American, I
say, ``Quit your Stalin and Trotsky over to boss' office and
sign.'' (Is leetle communist humor.)
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, I call Kremlin _ excuse, please, I mean state Capitol
_ to congratulate fearless leaders on keep ing witch hunt law on
books. Only, instead of responding to me with courage they give me
Chicken Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why bring this up?'' they ask. And, ``Nobody enforces it.''
And ``It's just holdover from a bygone era.''
</P>
<P>
   Law is on books, I remind them. Some people say it is
unnecessary. Some say it is evil. Some even ask what will be next
political party Arizona makes illegal? Democrats? (Or are they
outlawed already?)
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong, comrades. I'm no refusenik. I'm no Red. When
people call me ``pinko,'' is only because I am blushing with pride
to be livink in land of free, home of brave.

BLAZERS' PLAN WORKS _ SORT OF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some say the Portland Trail Blazers have 10
players who could start, and sometimes Saturday it seemed like all
10 of them were on the court together.
</P>
<P>
   How else to account for a triple-team on Shaquille O'Neal and a
simultaneous double-team on Kobe Bryant?
</P>
<P>
   The strategy produced mixed results for the Blazers. They held
down Bryant to just 13 points in Game 1 - his lowest output of the
postseason - but O'Neal still scored 41.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' role players used the extra breathing room to hit a
barrage of outside jumpers in the Lakers' 109-94 win.
</P>
<P>
   The double-teams on O'Neal are expected, but it's rare to see
teams smother Bryant the way the Blazers did, often using 6-11
Rasheed Wallace to crowd him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that they had to do that, because if they didn't, you
have Kobe down low on the block with (5-10) Damon Stoudamire on
him,'' said the Lakers' Brian Shaw. ``So when they were doubling,
Kobe was doing a good job of kicking the ball back out, finding the
shooters on the perimeter, and guys were knocking down the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bryant also collected six assists, tying his
postseason high. Foul trouble also limited him, and Bryant took
just nine shots, making four.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've faced every different kind of way that you can play us
throughout the year,'' Shaw said, ``so it just depends on if we're
hitting the shots. Today they pretty much gambled and said, `Hey,
we're going to see if these guys are hitting shots.' Robert (Horry)
came out and started hitting them right away, and that opened it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Turn back the clock: Lakers coach Phil Jackson referred to
Portland's hack-a-Shaq tactics, which produced 25 O'Neal free
throws in the fourth quarter, as ``dredge'' and ``dreariness'' but
didn't question the strategy behind it.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't profit from fouling,'' he said. ``That's
basically what basketball is about. And in the original rules by
our god who created this game, (James) Naismith, the player that
fouled had to go out and sit out of a basketball game when he
fouled. So he had to leave the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that was what fouling was all about when basketball
started. But the game has changed, and you foul for profit now, and
that's an interesting aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheaper than airfare: The Lakers are inviting fans to view Games
3 and 4, televised from Portland, at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Free tickets will be distributed beginning Monday at 10 a.m. at
the Staples Center box office and Ticketmaster outlets located at
the Wherehouse, Tower Records, Robinson's May and Ritmo Latino. No
tickets will be distributed via the Ticketmaster phone center or
online.
</P>
<P>
   The two games will be played May 26 and May 28 at the Rose
Garden, and Staples Center will broadcast them on the four
Diamondvision scoreboard screens and 1,200 television monitors.

SCIOSCIA HAS BEEN IN DiSARCINA'S POSITION 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Gary DiSarcina is still mulling over a course
of action to remedy his sore left shoulder. MRIs have shown nothing
outside the normal wear and tear, but the Angels shortstop is
contemplating surgery that would end his season.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia said he understands what DiSarcina is
going through.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, after coming to the Padres, he tore the rotator cuff in
his right shoulder on the first day of spring training. An MRI
revealed little damage, so he tried rehab for six to eight weeks
before eventually deciding to undergo surgery during which doctors
discovered a large tear.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia tried to play the next season with the Rangers, but
never did and retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough, tough decision,'' Scioscia said of undergoing
surgery. ``It had to be done, but it was tough to get the words
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference, Scioscia noted, is that he was in the twilight
of his career, while DiSarcina is 32 and figures to have several
productive seasons left.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think you can play three or four more years, it's
easier to sacrifice one year. The tough thing is he already feels
like he missed a year last year (when he missed nearly three months
with a broken arm.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult situation for all of us. We can give him
all kinds of advice, but Gary has to make the decision. He's talked
to a number of doctors and athletes. It's all where he wants to be
a year from now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have four starting pitchers on the disabled list (Ken
Hill, Tim Belcher, Jason Dickson and Kent Mercker) and another in
the minors (Ramon Ortiz) as the organization's pitching depth has
been stretched near its limits.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that won't get stretched, Scioscia said, is its
patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it takes a lot of discipline not to react on need,''
the manager said. ``But we're not going to bring Ortiz back or rush
Belcher (or Dickson). I don't think you can rush a player (back
from injury) or take him out of a developmental situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Belcher, who's recovering from off-season elbow surgery,
threw for 15 minutes in the Angels bullpen before Saturday's game
and pitching coach Bud Black said the 38-year-old right-hander
reported no discomfort during the 50-pitch workout.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, on the 60-day disabled list retroactive to March 27,
will throw again Tuesday in Minnesota. If all goes well, he'll
could make a rehab assignment in 10 days, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Mercker, hospitalized for the past 10 days since he was
diagnosed as having a cerebral hemorrhage, could be released from
the hospital early this week, Scioscia said. But whether the
left-hander pitches again this season is a matter the manager isn't
even willing to consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get him healthy,'' Scioscia said. ``Right now, he's
getting stronger. We'll take it one step at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's game: Chris Fussell (3-2, 4.24) vs. Kent Bottenfield
(3-4, 3.92), 1:05 p.m. TV: Fox Sports Net. Radio: KLAC/570 AM,
XPRS/1090 AM.

HERSHISER IN LIMBO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI - When last seen, Orel Hershiser was walking off the mound
at Arizona's Bank One Ballpark having allowed five runs in
one-third of an inning and wondering what he needed to do to pitch
successfully out of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   That was 12 days ago. His last pitch was Damian Miller's
12th-inning grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   It was rosy and nostalgic when Hershiser inked a free-agent deal
during the offseason, and the organization adores him, but finding
a role has become problematic and the time the Dodgers are trying
to buy is running out.
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of the road trip, the Dodgers have been
carrying 25 players but using 24. It hasn't been a huge issue
because they're winning, but as the situation lingers, the more
glaring it could be.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dodgers figure out what to do - though the answer
partly lies with how Carlos Perez pitches - Hershiser threw a
simulated game Saturday at Pro Player Stadium before the
Dodgers-Florida Marlins game. It's the closest Hershiser has come
to an actual game since May 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I'm reluctant (to use Hershiser in relief), it's
that at this time I don't feel it's his strong suit,'' manager
Davey Johnson said. ``On the occasions I've used him, I was a
little short or had to go with him or wanted his experience
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading Hershiser, at this point, isn't an option, especially
with a lack of starting depth. Figuring out how to get him more
work is the answer, but by now it was supposed to work itself out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer to be quiet about the whole situation and let
it work out, whichever way it does,'' Hershiser said. ``The last
thing I want to do is create controversy and be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez's contract (he's owed $12.5 million through next season)
and circumstance, along with a few solid outings, has kept him in
the rotation and left Hershiser in this unaccustomed role.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Dodgers bought time when they agreed
with Perez to let him refuse a minor-league assignment until May
31. The idea was if he pitched poorly, he would be sent to the
minors. Perez is 2-1 with an 7.06 ERA in four starts since the
agreement was made public May 1.
</P>
<P>
   But the room in which the Dodgers gave Perez to fail is almost
gone, yet Perez is still around. He's 4-2, but he's getting 8.62
runs of support per nine innings and opponents are batting .316
against him. Also, because of an off day Thursday, the Dodgers
won't need a fifth starter again until May 30.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hershiser, after starting and winning the home
opener, is 0-1 with a 15.18 ERA in four relief appearances. His
fifth outing will only take place under unusual circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to figure out what's the best thing for Orel,'' Johnson
said. ``This exercise is to get him to where his mechanics and
mindset is right so he can pitch out of the bullpen or the
rotation, any way I use him.''
</P>
<P>
   Elster in, Cora out: After the game, the team activated
shortstop Kevin Elster and sent Alex Cora, despite hitting .297
with three RBI and playing well defensively, to Triple-A
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the situation,'' Cora said. ``I knew from the
beginning. I thought about it (Friday). I knew it was the end right
here. I understand. They have their hands tied right now. I know
who the shortstop is. I know some day (Elster) had to come off the
disabled list.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Right-hander Mike Fetters (inflamed right elbow)
is scheduled to throw another bullpen session today. ... Marlins
bullpen coach Tony Taylor was ejected during Florida's sixth-inning
pitching change for arguing.

   &QL; 
Faith House, a domestic-violence shelter that is one of the Phoenix
area's oldest charities, is on the brink of insolvency because of
apparent financial mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   The Glendale charity opened an elaborate $2.8 million shelter
for abused women in January. But three months after it opened, the
shelter ran out of money. The shelter was shut down and its
longtime director was fired.
</P>
<P>
   An interim director was brought in to sort out Faith House
finances. What he found: an organization so poorly managed that
some of its books may never be reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing's been out of control,'' said Herb Paine, a former
United Way executive who came to Faith House in February after its
board asked the United Way for help.
</P>
<P>
   Paine said that while he has no evidence of illegal activity, he
is concerned about potential misuse of funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things are this sloppy, it opens the door to abuse,'' he
said. ``It stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, the shelter raised more than $1 million
in dona tions from Phoenix-area residents who were moved by appeals
to help abused women and their children.
</P>
<P>
   All told, $1.7 million in private donations and $855,000 in bank
loans were ponied up over two years to build the 20,000-square-foot
Vic torian-style shelter near Glendale Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Among the donations, ``The Arizona Republic'' contributed
$570,000.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``People with good intentions got caught up in this, no
question,'' Paine said. ``These things have ripple effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith House's troubles won't signifi cantly affect services to
victims of domestic violence _ about 200 new beds are opening
statewide. But it does raise questions about how a charity could go
so long collecting so much money with so little scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; It's not an unusual story, said Paine and others associated
with charitable fund-raising. Charities frequently spring from the
sweat and conviction of charismatic founders only to falter when
they outgrow the abilities of their founders and governing boards.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, donors are interested in the cause, not the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``You dazzle people with a cause and you make an emotional plea,
and it can cover up a lot,'' said Cindy Silverman, executive
director of an other center for abused women in the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   Faith House is exploring a merger with Prehab of Arizona, a
Mesa-based human services charity that runs the Autumn House
shelter. Prehab is helping Faith House's temporary management team
untan gle the troubled charity's finances. RECORDS REVIEW A review
of financial records and interviews with Paine and others familiar
with Faith House reveal problems ranging from sloppy bookkeeping to
a confusing and troublesome corporate organiza tion.
</P>
<P>
   Some specifics:
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to tell how much the charity spent building the
new shel ter near downtown Glendale. A construction spreadsheet by
Faith House's finance office shows a cost of $2,559,866, while the
charity's general ledgers show $2,573,460. An audit completed last
week indicates a total expense of $2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The shelter ran operating deficits dating to 1996. Often, money
was shifted between corporate entities and funds were co-mingled to
cover costs.
</P>
<P>
   The charity continued expanding and spending money despite signs
of financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when construction on the new 80-bed shelter started
in March 1999, Faith House managers and directors had information
that the organization was in financial trouble and needed as much
as $500,000 more to cover the full cost of construction. Neither
did the charity have enough money to oper ate the shelter once it
was built, records show.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Faith House's board bought a new bingo
facility in Surprise that was supposed to gener ate cash to feed
the expanded Faith House. The bingo parlor opened eight months
behind schedule and is operating at a loss. The board is
considering shutting it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They built the Taj Mahal and this big bingo facility at the
same time, without the funding to finish them,'' said Ken Jones,
former finance direc tor for Faith House. ``If you are going to
build a house, you make sure you have cash in hand or financing in
place before you start. You don't say, `I'm going to pray that the
cash will come in later.' '' WHO'S TO BLAME? Faith House's
financial plummet has spurred a debate over who pushed the popular
charity over the cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Some point to Betty Ryan-Della Corte, the shelter's charismatic
founder and director for the past 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the board of directors should have been paying closer
attention, or that businesses, govern ment agencies and
organizations in the community should have asked more questions
before investing in the charity.
</P>
<P>
   Paine said it may have been all of those factors and more.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Betty Bergstrom, a respected consultant for
non-profits, was hired by Faith House to raise money. She told the
board the shelter was outgrowing its management struc ture.
</P>
<P>
   Faith House, she said, needed a new administrative structure in
order to grow from a small charity to a large organization. The
board of directors followed one of her suggestions to hire two
development directors to raise $800,000 for administrative ex
penses.
</P>
<P>
   But Ryan-Della Corte fired the direc tors, and Bergstrom decided
to quit.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1999, Jones, an account ant, was hired as finance
director to take control of the shelter's fund-raising effort. The
board let him go in a cost-cutting move this year.
</P>
<P>
   Former board members say part of the problem was that Ryan-Della
Corte insisted on keeping a tight rein on all financial decisions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``A lot of what she wished would happen would suddenly become
the objective of the people who worked around her,'' said Gerald
Kern of Scottsdale, who left the board after a three-month stint in
1997. ``If she had wished (Faith House) to be a 500-bed facility,
then everyone would immediately jump on the bandwagon and say,
`Let's help Betty get a 500-bed facility.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ryan-Della Corte said she relied on the agency's
finance committee _ made up of employees and board members _ to
guide her in financial matters that were not her strong point.
</P>
<P>
   And she relied on faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the first time anything like this has happened,''
she said. ``We just had faith that Faith House would pull through.
There was never any doubt in our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan-Della Corte started fund-rais ing for the shelter in 1997.
The effort picked up steamed in 1998, when Laura Munoz, an abused
Phoenix mother was killed by her husband after being turned away
from full shelters. Swayed by Ryan-Della Corte and community
outrage, Phoe nix arealenders and corporate donors _ including
``The Republic'' _ failed to ask rigorous financial ques tions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republic'' made the largest single contribution to the new
shel ter, raising $570,000 through its ``One Bed, One Life''
series, which documented a shortage of beds for victims of domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale committed $200,000 to the new shelter, while Phoenix
put up $333,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even the banks, which agreed to lend or invest more than $1
million in the shelter, could have looked closer, Paine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could there have been better man agement, oversight, control?
Yes,'' Faith House board Chairman Gary Mirich said. But he added
that the board relied on Faith House's man agers to oversee
day-to-day opera tions.
</P>
<P>
   Mirich said the board gradually realized that the financial
crisis was severe and took action by cutting salaries and expenses,
trying to sell properties, bringing Paine on board and firing
several people, including Ryan-Della Corte. COMPLICATED STRUCTURE
Part of the difficulty in untangling Faith House's finances lies in
its complicated organizational structure.
</P>
<P>
   Faith House consisted of three non-profit organizations:
</P>
<P>
   Villa de Fidelis (Latin for ``House of Faith'') ran the original
shelter in southeast Glendale, a second shelter in Prescott, and
the new shelter near Glendale Community College.
</P>
<P>
   A second oversaw a domestic-vio lence counseling arm called
Faith House, the same name used for the overall organization.
</P>
<P>
   The third, Valley Youth Organiza tion, which recently closed,
provided youth counseling.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For decades, all three organizations relied on bingo games at
35th Avenue and Thomas Road to supply operating cash.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tidy way for the charity to exist without grabbing for
govern ment grants that Ryan-Della Corte said would force her to
abandon her faith-based religious approach.
</P>
<P>
   Bingo revenues allowed Faith House 20 years ago to invest
$180,000 in a Prescott property that became north ern Arizona's
shelter for abused women. The shelter was recently closed and part
of the property sold.
</P>
<P>
   The charity leased bingo facilities from Phoenix National Inc.,
a for-profit company, until 1981 when bingo regulations changed.
Phoenix National was forced to sell under a new regulation that
barred private companies from running bingo par lors. Faith House
partnered with another charity to buy Phoenix National for $1.5
million to keep the games going. Faith House's new for-profit arm
also kept the name Phoenix National.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, bingo became less profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the other charity, a non-profit swim club, got out,
and Faith House borrowed $400,000 to take over the business.
Phoenix National became the financial backbone for all three of
Faith House's non-profit ventures. ENTANGLEMENTS Paine said he is
puzzled by the relationship be tween the for-profit corporation and
the non-profit charities, each of which owns a third of Phoenix
National. The agencies could have dissolved Phoenix National and
sim ply operated the bingo games them selves, he said. Instead,
Phoenix National remained an independent entity with the same
leadership as the charities, including Ryan-Della Corte.
</P>
<P>
   There was a practical flaw, Paine said: The finances of the
for-profit and non-profits became entangled. Funds were co-mingled;
staffs were shared.
</P>
<P>
   Documents show that when Faith House developed cash-flow
problems in 1995, Phoenix National started funding operations.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1997, when the idea of a new shelter began picking up
steam, Phoenix National was paying part of Ryan-Della Corte's
$61,000 annual salary and had hired consultants to help make the
new shelter a reality.
</P>
<P>
   One fund-raiser was to be paid $1,000 a day, according to board
minutes. From late 1997 to late 1999, the Faith House agencies
together spent more than $300,000 on public relations and
fund-raising consult ants for the new shelter, financial documents
show.
</P>
<P>
   But as pledges and grants started rolling in, the financial
fault lines were beginning to show.
</P>
<P>
   The charity had money _ or at least promises of money _ for a
building, but was severely short of operating cash. There wasn't
enough to make the monthly payroll or mortgage payments on charity
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he understood the prob lems but felt the charity had
no choice but to proceed with building a new shelter.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Faith House had entered into a complex web of
lending agreements with Bank One CDC in Ohio and Bank One of
Arizona. The banks would provide more than $1 million in loans and
equity payments, but with some strong strings attached requiring
the facility to open in January and pay back most of the loans
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One CDC had obtained from Faith House $977,000 in state tax
credits for low-income housing pro viders. The credits, sold to
Bank One for $752,000, required the shelter to set aside 64 of its
beds as low-income transitional housing for abused women, as
opposed to emergency shelter beds. DIE WAS CAST Had the financiers
known then what they know now, they might have thought twice. The
shelter closed just three months after opening when Faith House ran
out of operating cash.
</P>
<P>
   Government grant payments were suspended, and Bank One cannot
currently claim its tax credits. Since no revenues are coming in,
Faith House can't repay its loans and could be foreclosed, Paine
said.
</P>
<P>
   The strings attached to the tax credits nearly stopped the deal
two years ago, board Chairman Mirich said. But in the end,
``stopping shelter beds that were needed was not a consideration.''
The plan moved ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Yet internal Faith House documents back Paine's assertions that
charity executives and board members over looked questionable
financial prac tices and warning signs against taking on large new
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had been there, I would have said, `Stop!' '' Paine said.
</P>
<P>
   The signs included:
</P>
<P>
   Faith House was running annual operating deficits totaling
$200,000 that were carried forward from 1996 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in mid-1998, bookkeepers signaled the board that cash
was drying up. Board minutes show it often discussed ways to keep
credi tors at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Bingo revenues were way down at the agency's parlor at 35th
Avenue and Thomas Road _ from $198,000 in 1996 to $122,000 by 1999.
The board nevertheless bought a Prescott building in summer 1998 to
operate a thrift store for the shelter there. A move also was afoot
to buy a complex of buildings in Surprise that everyone hoped would
become a bingo mecca for northwest Phoenix area retirees.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1998, Faith House borrowed $875,000 to buy and refurbish
River boat Acres, 18324 W. Bell Road. The 10-acre Surprise spread
includes a 10,000-square-foot building, shops, an outdoor pavilion,
three houses and tennis and volleyball courts.
</P>
<P>
   The board wanted to start bingo there in January 1999. Instead,
it spent thousands of dollars and eight months trying to bring it
up to code.
</P>
<P>
   ``Significant dollars were put into the new bingo facility,''
said Paul Reynolds, a board member from 1995 until January. ``In
retrospect, we shouldn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Several people questioned it, but they didn't stand in front
of the train.'' FULL SPEED AHEAD Fund-rais ing continued full tilt
in 1999. Yet board minutes during the same period note that Faith
House's book keeper ``is having to use the (chari ty's) assets in
order to meet the everyday operating expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   By February 1999, the operating deficit was $121,000.
Bookkeepers told board members they could shift up to $50,000 from
other accounts to make payroll. At a pivotal meeting in March 1999,
the same month ground broke on the new shelter, the board was told
that Faith House's mort gage payments were in arrears and the old
bingo property was for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Prescott shelter and thrift store were closed,
and the youth counseling operation shut down.
</P>
<P>
   By summer, the house of cards began to collapse. Faith House
took out a one-year, $200,000 loan from Bank One to meet its
construction obliga tions.
</P>
<P>
   Jones warned the board at a July meeting that Faith House was
still $90,000 short of what it needed to keep the new shelter
project on track.
</P>
<P>
   The board pressed ahead with efforts to open the Surprise bingo
parlor. When it opened in September, Faith House had already sold
the Phoenix parlor and was $79,000 over budget for the year.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Ryan-Della Corte sent out a confidential letter
urging sup porters to help raise $108,000 to get Faith House
through the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the letter went out, the board voted to curtail
her duties, and she was directed to quit fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan-Della Corte now says some money raised for the new shelter
was used to cover operating expenses during a critical period in
1999. She says she protested that it was unethi cal, but that the
board ``discounted'' her opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Jones acknowledges the use of con struction funds to cover
operating costs, but says they were ``loans'' and Ryan-Della Corte
signed the checks. &UR; The loans were repaid, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably wasn't the thing to do, but we had no options _ we
were broke,'' Jones said. ``Without those loans, there would be no
Faith House, no bingo hall, no shelter to open.'' EXTRA CASH NEEDED
The new shelter will not be able to reopen without more funds,
Paine said.
</P>
<P>
   It will take extra cash to address safety and construction
issues, plus about $90,000 a month to operate. Once the shelter
opens, Bank One can claim some of its tax credits and free up money
it committed to the project.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Faith House is exploring a merger with Prehab,
another char ity that operates domestic violence shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a road to recovery here,'' said Mike Hughes,
director of Prehab. ``It's not all doom and gloom.''

DODGERS ROUT MARLINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI - Carlos Perez started, so it meant the Dodgers were going
to score runs. The real question was whether Perez was going to
make the lead hold up.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that always the question with Perez?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Perez did his part and got the kind of support to which
he's accustomed as the Dodgers, led by Gary Sheffield's grand slam,
whacked the Florida Marlins 12-6 Saturday at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Every Dodgers starter, save Perez, had at least one hit and
scored a run as they battered starter Brad Penny (3-6) and the
Marlins bullpen for 15 hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the batting order) flows really well,'' right fielder
Shawn Green said. ``It seems likes there's always guys on base. It
all feeds off each other. Not only are guys in front going to get
hits and guys behind you going to get hits, but you have to worry
about guys stealing and that opens holes. There's so many different
levels it helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, always teetering on the brink of being yanked from the
starting rotation, is 4-3 and tied with Chan Ho Park for the team
lead in wins. That Perez gets 8.62 runs of support per nine innings
is an enormous help, but he's already doubled his win total of last
season in half the starts (eight).
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the Dodgers (23-17) have won four straight and
six of seven, have secured a winning road trip (6-4) with today's
game remaining and are six games over .500 for the first time since
the final game of the 1997 season, when they finished 88-74.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good as a starting pitcher when you see your team wake-up
early and get runs,'' said Perez, who's ERA dropped to 5.74. ``I
kept throwing a first-pitch fastball for a strike, and when you
have the first pitch for a strike you can control the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive assault continued from the potent middle of the
order. Sheffield, booed by many in the crowd because of his days
with the Marlins, had his seventh career grand slam, a 442-foot
blast to center field in the seventh inning, which made it 12-3.
</P>
<P>
   Green was a homer short of the cycle and scored three times;
Eric Karros hit his 12th homer, a two-run shot, and walked twice;
and Todd Hundley singled in a run and scored.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are averaging 7.2 runs per game during the road
trip, and that foursome is doing most of the damage. They're a
combined 48 for 136 (.353) with 13 homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheff took a little frustration out on that one ball,''
manager Davey Johnson said. ``He unloaded on that one. He had a
little frustration building. That was about the hardest hit ball
I've seen in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Green had two chances to become the first Dodger in 30 years to
hit for the cycle, but walked on four pitches and then struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Green finished 3 for 4 with an RBI and three runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Parker remains the lone Los Angeles Dodger to hit for the
cycle. He did it May 7, 1970, and at the time it ended a 21-year
drought. Before Parker, Brooklyn's Gil Hodges did in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The feat has been accomplished eight times in franchise history.
By comparison, there are have been 20 no-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to hit one out,'' Green said. ``The last at-bat,
I had a good pitch and missed it.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense is customary for Perez, but he had to fight to
survive six innings. Perez allowed three runs on nine hits, and the
Marlins either scored or had a runner in scoring position in each
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Perez was able to get the big out when he needed it
until the Dodgers broke it open with three runs in the fifth off
lefty reliever Ron Mahay. Karros' two-run homer and Alex Cora's
RBI-single increased the Dodgers' lead to 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Perez) kept us in the ballgame, pitched out of a few jams,''
Karros said. ``He's struggled in the first inning, and we put some
runs up for him.''
</P>
<P>
   DODGERS VS. FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   Time: 10:05 a.m., at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Channel 5; 1150-AM, KWKW-AM (1330 Spanish).
</P>
<P>
   Matchup: The longest road trip of the season, covering four
cities and lasting two weeks, ends with Dodgers right-hander Kevin
Brown (2-1, 2.49 ERA) pitching against the club he led to the `97
World Series title. Brown is 20-8 with a 2.17 ERA here. He held the
Marlins to one run in eight innings in his only outing against them
a year ago. Brown is second in the N.L. in opponents' batting
average (.197) and ERA. Marlins lefty Jesus Sanchez (4-2, 5.98)
makes his seventh appearance against the Dodgers. He's 3-0 with a
4.43 ERA against L.A., but has pitched mostly in relief. Back in
the rotation, the 25-year-old has allowed a team-leading 11 homers.

COUPLES' SHAKEN AFTER TEE SHOT ON NO. 7 HITS SPECTATOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Fred Couples split eight of Colonial's 14
fairways and _ unfortunately _ one unsuspecting spectator's
forehead during Saturday's third round of the MasterCard Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   Couples prevailed despite his wayward blows from the tee, but
the errant drive on No. 7 shook the former Dallas resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never hit anyone and drawn blood, and it happened to be a
lady, which makes it even worse,'' Couples said. ``I don't know
why, but I'd rather it been a boyfriend or husband at 6-foot-4.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Garber was treated and released at Harris Methodist Fort
Worth, but this was no purple bruise where ``you kind of walk away
and actually don't feel bad,'' Couples said after shooting a
2-under-par 68.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lady is lying on the ground, not blood everywhere, but
there's enough blood to make you kind of feeling like quitting,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vision lingered, and Couples settled for a bogey at No. 7
despite the ball caroming into the fairway for his approach shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say it was the cause for a bogey because it
wasn't an easy second shot, but I hit it just off the green and
chipped to about 4 feet,'' Couples said of his only bogey. ``I was
thinking about it on the second shot, the chip shot and the putt,
but then I also thought about it on a lot of other holes, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples recorded three birdies before and none after his errant
drive at No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was walking down the street and some guy called me a name
and I slugged him in face,'' Couples said, ``I wouldn't think about
it for another second _ unless he went and got six of his friends.
But when you're out there and hit somebody, I just couldn't shake
that off.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples, though, made his charge before No. 7 and will begin
Sunday's final round trailing the leader, Stewart Cink, by five
strokes after birdies at Nos. 1, 5 and 6. Couples reached the par-5
No. 1 in two and two-putted from 30 feet, and he later drained
putts of 20 and 10 feet at Nos. 5 and 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very nice thing to be under par after five holes, and
the fifth hole is the hardest hole that maybe we play on tour,''
Couples said. ``I've gone par, birdie, birdie. So I don't know what
to expect (Sunday).''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's rain forced Couples to resume his second round on No.
8, but it allowed him to play 29 holes under ideal conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have that many people to leapfrog, but it's going to
take a very good round _ better than a 66 _ I think,'' Couples said
of a potential victory. ``If the weather stays like this, I feel
like I can do it.'' nn

TOMS' FAST START QUICKLY GIVES WAY TO FADE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ David Toms began a 31-hole day Saturday at
the MasterCard Colonial believing he would be among those chased.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Toms finished 13 holes to complete a postponed
second round from Friday, he was neck-and-neck with tournament
leader Davis Love III. Toms' afternoon start for the third round
began strong, and he was among the favorites.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, he ambled into the clubhouse as the one doing the
chasing.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in the final group proved difficult for Toms, who went
from leading at 8 under after seven third-round holes to the last
man showing on the board at 5 under. Toms' 72 that followed rounds
of 67 and 66 ties him with four others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky to get in at 2 over,'' Toms said. ``I had a couple
of three-putts. Maybe I got tired. It just wasn't a very good day.
I had no rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Toms couldn't find the beat beginning at Nos. 3, 4 and 5 _ the
hallowed Horrible Horseshoe. After finishing his delayed second
round with four birdies and adding another to begin Round 3, Toms
bogeyed Nos. 3 and 5.
</P>
<P>
   On the latter, his uphill-lie bunker shot stayed in the sand,
but he recovered nicely on a second try to avoid a double bogey.
From there, Toms fought back to 8-under with birdies on Nos. 6 and
7.
</P>
<P>
   As Love kept pace, Stewart Cink went on a back-nine tear that
saw him move to 11 under for the tournament lead.
</P>
<P>
   Toms said that as Love and Cink stayed their course, he became
less focused on what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're playing with Davis and he's just bombing it,'' Toms
said. ``I started pressing. You're walking up every fairway and
people are going crazy for them, and they deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Toms said he attempted to ``block out'' the day his partners
were having. The more he struggled, the more it was difficult to do
so, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Toms bogeyed five of the last 11 holes, finishing with birdies
on Nos. 16 and 17 to salvage a share of eighth place. He wasn't the
only hopeful to fall off in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson (5 under) and Rocco Mediate (6 under) both sat in
second place at some point in the day. Mediate gained a stroke on
the day but would lose two over the final four holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was off to the races,'' Toms said. ``Even after
the bogey at 5, one shot and one hole should have no bearing with
13 left. Cink was out there a long time (31 holes) too, and he did
a good job. I've got to find something tomorrow that will work.''
</P>
<P>
   More than likely Toms will do a lot less looking over his
shoulder when he begins Sunday's final round. nn

WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE, LOVE'S ON FAMILIAR GROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Davis Love III is no stranger to the top of
a leader board.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he has been on them almost his entire professional
career, recording 106 top-10 finishes since joining the PGA Tour in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed familiar with the leader board during Saturday's third
round of the MasterCard Colonial. In fact, he yo-yoed up and down
the board, seeing basically every position on it before finishing
with a 1-under-par 69.
</P>
<P>
   That put the second-round co-leader at 8-under-par 202 for the
event, three strokes back of leader Stewart Cink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it's not where I want to be,'' Love said. ``I made
four bogeys from the middle of the fairway, two on the front and
two on the back, and those really killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   What hurt Love most was inconsistency. His roller-coaster ride
began with a birdie on the par-5 No. 1 and continued with bogeys at
Nos. 3 and 5, two of Colonial's toughest holes. He did answer with
a birdie on No. 6, getting through the front nine at even par.
</P>
<P>
   But that's when his round really got interesting. Starting at
No. 12, Love went from 7 under to 9 under in two holes, only to go
back to 7 under on the next two before getting back to 8-under with
a birdie on the par-3 No. 16. For the confused, that's a stretch of
birdie, birdie, bogey, bogey, birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not hitting the ball close to the hole when I have
opportunities,'' he said. ``It makes it frustrating. I hit two good
shots at 12, a good shot at 13, two good shots at 15, a good shot
at 16, and I make two bogeys in there. That just kills you.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of his ride, Love is anything but out of this
tournament _ something else with which he is familiar. Just a week
ago, he was leading entering the final round before finishing
second in a playoff at the GTE Byron Nelson Classic. He trailed by
three strokes entering Sunday at the MCI Classic on April 16 and
finished tied for third behind Cink. He also finished second at the
Bay Hill Invitational and has three fourth-place finishes this
year.
</P>
<P>
   He's there again. And if he can put up five birdies, this time
without the four bogeys, he might just get his first victory since
the 1998 MCI Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what I wanted,'' he said, ``but no one else, except
Stewart, made much of a move.'' nn

AS USUAL, KITE MAKES CUT AT COLONIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLES CLINES AND JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Tom Kite's record of making cuts at Colonial
remained perfect after his second-round 72 left him with a 1-over
141 for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Kite has made 28 cuts in 28 years at Colonial. His first was as
an amateur, so he will receive an earnings check in Fort Worth for
the 27th consecutive year, though he has never won the event.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Kite was poised to finish the second round at 1 under
or better until he bogeyed two of his last three holes following
tree trouble along two fairways. His third-round 73 put him at 4
over for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Despite finishing in the money the most times at Colonial, Kite
is 46th all-time on the event's earnings list with $153,675. Corey
Pavin ($737,833) is No. 1. MISSED THE CUT
</P>
<P>
   Defending MasterCard Colonial champion Olin Browne led a list of
notable golfers who missed yesterday's cut (3 over), set shortly
before the delayed third round began.
</P>
<P>
   Browne finished 4 over with a two-round 144 (71-73) but did
share $5,000 with Peter Jacobsen after the pair teamed to win the
Colonial Shootout on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a defending champion missed since 1995
champ Tom Lehman failed in '96, when he also missed by a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Other notables to miss the cut included Lee Janzen (6 over),
Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks (6 over), Gary Nicklaus (7 over),
past Colonial champions Bruce Lietzke (8 over), Corey Pavin (9
over) and Ben Crenshaw (10 over), and amateur and Fort Worth
resident Hunter Haas (9 over). ACE FOR APPLEBY
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Appleby recorded the 17th hole-in-one in tournament
history since Colonial began play in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby aced No. 13, a par-3, 178-yard hole with a 7-iron. The
ace put him at even par before he bogeyed No. 14 to slip to 1-over.
Brad Faxon recorded Colonial's previous ace, in 1996 at No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask my caddie,'' Appleby said when asked the last time he aced
a hole. ``I don't remember.'' It was at the Bob Hope Chrysler
Classic in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby's fortune went sour a hole later when his approach found
a muddy groove between the cart path and grass. His drop landed on
a sprinkler head, so he dropped again.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby's chip rolled to within 5 feet. About to putt for par,
he backed off when a mosquito bit his hand; he then two-putted for
bogey. REALLY HORRIBLE
</P>
<P>
   Holes 3, 4 and 5 at Colonial have been dubbed the ``horrible
horseshoe'' for obvious reasons _ it's easily the toughest stretch
on the course with Nos. 3 and 5 being monster par-4s and No. 4
being a 246-yard par-3.
</P>
<P>
   The stretch was especially difficult for Phil Mickelson
yesterday. The tour's most famous left-hander entered No. 3 at
6-under-par and walked off No. 5 green 2-under after two bogeys and
one double bogey. IT'S A BEACH
</P>
<P>
   David Toms, who had to take two shots out of a greenside bunker
at No. 5, said Colonial's reconditioned sand traps are ``definitely
a hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Toms bogeyed the hole after back-to-back bunker shots and later
said ``80 percent of the balls that fly into'' Colonial's traps are
``plugging in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sand's too deep,'' he said. ``They keep getting buried in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   For the tournament, Toms has made 6 of 9 sand saves. He made 2
of 4 in the third round. COUPLES' BACK BETTER
</P>
<P>
   Fred Couples' ailing back prevented him from competing during
last week's GTE Byron Nelson Classic in Irving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK, but I could get on a plane flight or hit one shot,
and then it will stiffen up to where I can't really do anything,''
he said. ``I just felt like if I went to Dallas, I would play and
would probably really do something bad. So, I just let it rest, and
that's why I think I'm feeling better.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples said his back began troubling him while carrying luggage
upstairs after returning from the Compaq Classic of New Orleans. It
prevented him from playing for four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say it doesn't dictate my golf,'' Couples said,
``but a lot of times, if I don't feel well, I don't play.'' NICE
BREAK
</P>
<P>
   For once, Colonial Country Club actually gave a player an extra
chance rather than taking one away.
</P>
<P>
   Irving's Joel Edwards, in the middle of his 5-under-par 65, hit
his worst shot of the day on the tee of the 470-yard, par-4 No. 5.
The shot was going well right, headed for the Trinity River, but
somehow stayed in play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably in somebody's boat at one time,'' Edwards
said. ``But it hit something and came out in the fairway. It was in
the river, it was well in there, but I got a break.'' FAMILIAR
POSITION
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sluman is lurking near the top of the MasterCard Colonial
leader board _ again.
</P>
<P>
   Sluman fired a 3-under-par 67 yesterday and is 6 under for the
tournament, tied for fourth with three other players. Last year, he
shot a final-round 66 to tie for second, a stroke behind winner
Olin Browne, with four other players.In 1998, Sluman finished
third, four strokes back of winner Tom Watson. COURSE DRAINS WELL
</P>
<P>
   After about three-fourths of an inch of rain Friday afternoon,
Colonial course superintendent Scott Johnson said water wasn't a
problem on the course yesterday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The bunkers, which had new drainage systems installed in the
more than $3.5 million renovation the past year, had no standing
water, and Johnson said the sand didn't wash away from the tops of
the traps.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, he said, the traps just needed raking to get them
ready for the morning rounds when 53 golfers had to complete second
rounds that were delayed because of rain and lightning.
</P>
<P>
   He said the greens were dry enough to mow after the morning
competitors finished and before the third round began at 12:30 p.m.
EXTRA WORK NO PROBLEM
</P>
<P>
   David Toms tied Davis Love III for the second-round lead at 7
under after resuming his round yesterday morning and playing his
remaining 12 holes in 3 under par to finish with a 66.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was no big deal to have to play so many holes in the
morning and then come back in the afternoon to play 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was going to be here all day, so I went to bed early
and tried to get a good night's sleep. It's no big deal. We're
supposed to be athletes, aren't we?'' CITY CHAMPS CADDYING
</P>
<P>
   Andy Fuller and Phil Dyson, former Fort Worth Men's City Golf
champions, are caddying this week. Fuller is toting Brian Watts'
bag, and Dyson is carrying Brandt Jobe's clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Both have been carrying the bags for several years, here and in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be back here,'' Dyson said yesterday. ``It's just
a lot different here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuller said his caddying career might be coming to an end
because he recently married.

BIRTHDAY BOY CINK CASTS EYE ON BIG PRESENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Until Sunday, perchance, the most memorable
birthday of Stewart Cink's life came when he turned 16 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents were out of town,'' Cink confessed. ``And we had a
party _ 40 people, maybe, all under age.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents don't know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oops. Well, they do now.
</P>
<P>
   But if Cink, who turns 27 on Sunday, survives the risky business
of the MasterCard Colonial's fourth round, his best birthday party
figures to come tonight.
</P>
<P>
   With mom, dad and wife Lisa all in attendance, Cink cast a spell
on Colonial's muggy fairways and byways Saturday. Beginning the day
with 13 rain-delayed, second-round holes still to play, Cink picked
a grand day to show his ``best stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he negotiated the course's telltale corner _ holes
3, 4 and 5 _ Cink had made so many birdies in a row, ``The hole
looked like a big bucket.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alabama native is not just another young pro with a funny
name. In 1996, Cink _ pronounced ``sink,'' as in kitchen _ was
named the Buy.Com Tour's player of the year. In the very next
season, he was named the PGA Tour's player of the year, the first
to win the honors in successive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Cink won at Hartford in '97 and had what he felt was a
breakthrough weekend at the MCI Classic in Hilton Head, S.C., four
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first victory means a lot,'' Cink explained. ``But the
second one means at least as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes yourself out of the he's-only-won-once group of guys.
It seems there's always something else that the public is ready to
label you as.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cink's case, even before Hilton Head, he was winning money
and being labeled as one of the game's bright young stars. In his
first nine tournament starts this season, Cink finished in the top
10 four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about really everything going in my game right
now,'' Cink said after his third-round 65.
</P>
<P>
   The one stumble in his season may have come after the win at
MCI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took three weeks off and kind of relished the victory,'' he
said. ``And then I realized when I came back that I wasn't as ready
to play as I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Cink shot 70-74 at last week's GTE Byron Nelson Classic and
missed the cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good wakeup call for me,'' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   He opened here, however, with an even-par 70 under gusty
conditions and has been a model of consistency ever since. In 31
holes of golf Saturday, Cink carded exactly one bogey.
</P>
<P>
   So what's his secret?
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm good at,'' Cink answered, ``is that I know myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really tall (6-foot-4), and my swing is a little weird.
But I know what's going to happen. It's something I've had since I
became a decent player _ based more on observation than anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Cink, as it turns out, is a meticulous note-taker. Every shot he
takes, every move he makes, Cink notes for further study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned it from Ben Hogan and, of course, he was `the man'
here,'' Cink said. ``I never talked to him, but I read about him.
He wrote down every shot he hit. I liked his swing, and I read how
he used to play, and he was a perfectionist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, well, if he did it, it ought to be good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He won't change Sunday, Cink said, even if it is his birthday.
After rounds of 64 and 65, there is no need to change anything, no
need to run scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go out there and think that 18 pars are going to win,
though,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His mom and dad, Rob and Anne Cink, are in town from Florence,
Ala. Shhh _ don't tell them about that 16th birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   But tradition-rich Colonial, with its Wall of Champions, would
be a grand place, Stewart said, to celebrate his 27th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed on the first tee that you can see yourself in the
wall, almost like a mirror,'' he said after his long day of
birdies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to see your reflection in the wall, but it'd be a
lot nicer to see your name on the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider it, perchance, a birthday present. It might even beat
turning 16. nn

A GUY IN A POLO CORSET STARTED IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE COCHRAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Lest we forget, it all really began 59 years
ago with a guy wearing a polo corset winning what the
``Star-Telegram'' modestly touted as ``golfdom's gaudiest
carnival.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Fort Worth's 1941 U.S. Open, the forerunner of the
Colonial National Invitation, now the 2000 MasterCard Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   The guy was Craig Wood, the gaudy carnival was the first Open
south of the Mason-Dixon line and the long-ago competition included
Ben Hogan, who would eventually put his stamp on Colonial as no
other. That historic field also embraced the likes of Sam Snead,
Gene Sarazen, Byron Nelson, Lloyd Mangrum, Denny Shute, Jimmy
Demaret, Johnny Bulla, Lawson Little, Dutch Harrison, Henry Ransom,
Clayton Heafner and Ralph Guldahl.
</P>
<P>
   Wood hit town that June suffering from a bizarre injury suffered
when he dropped a razor while shaving, then sneezed as he stooped
to pick it up. It dislocated a vertebra. Thus the polo corset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I can make it or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Wood, 39, was golf's reigning bridesmaid, despite
winning a Masters championship. He had lost playoffs in the British
Open to Shute in 1933, the Masters to Sarazen in 1935 and the Open
to Nelson in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing Shute after 36 holes, Wood closed with a pair of
even-par 70s and his 284, although four shots over regulation, was
three better than Shute and five better than Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   The $1,000 payoff was precisely $593,000 less than today's
champion earns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '41 Open was so popular with both players and fans that
Colonial officials vowed to start a tournament of their own,'' said
Dennis Roberson, Colonial historian and tournament manager.
</P>
<P>
   But precisely five months later, the Japanese attacked Pearl
Harbor, and World War II would prevent Colonial from fulfilling
that vow until 1946.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Star-Telegram'' had pronounced the '41 Open the ``greatest
athletic event'' in Fort Worth's history, but Hogan would torpedo
that claim pretty much by himself, starting with the very first
Colonial, in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hogan captivated the city and the event by charging from three
shots back for a thrilling one-stroke victory and $3,000
first-place check,'' Roberson recounted in a 50-year Colonial
reminiscence.
</P>
<P>
   ``His incredible final-round 65 stood as the course record for
24 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan won four of the first seven Colonials and captured his
fifth and final title in 1959, although he would be a legitimate
challenger up until 1967, when he tied for third, three strokes
behind champion Dave Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   The 1959 title was also his last PGA victory. Course founder
Marvin Leonard's pride and joy would become known around the world
as ``Hogan's Alley.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan's victory here in 1953 was historically significant,
coming as it did four years after his near-fatal car wreck and
sandwiched between triumphs at the Masters and the U.S. and British
Opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``His remarkable comeback from those life-threatening injuries
would become one of the greatest stories in all of sports
history,'' Roberson recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, there have been countless memorable Colonial
moments, inevitable with a great golf course and a Wall of
Champions decorated with names such as Snead, Middlecoff, Bolt,
Sanders, Nicklaus, Palmer, Crenshaw, Trevino, Boros, Casper,
Crampton, Watson, Souchak, Zoeller, Pavin, Price and on and on and
on.
</P>
<P>
   But Colonial and Hogan are simply inseparable:
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, the Hogan-Snead rivaly was in full bloom, but Snead
eagled the first hole the first day and led from start to finish,
beating Hogan by five shots.
</P>
<P>
   When he won in 1952, Hogan closed with a 67 _ hitting all 18
greens in regulation. That was the year Colonial's plaid jackets
made their debut.

   After 36 holes of the 1954 tournament, Hogan was tied for third
but two strokes ahead of eventual winner Johnny Palmer when illness
forced him to withdraw. Ten years later, Palmer set a scoring
record unchallenged to this day. His 87-81-82-79_331 was 51 over
par.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, Arnold Palmer led after the first round, but Hogan was
within a shot of the lead approaching the 18th green Sunday. He
carded an extremely rare double bogey, and Tommy Bolt won by three
strokes. The weather conditions were so horrible that year they
produced one of my favorite all-time Colonial quotes. Byron Nelson
said it after the first round: ``The course is too wet to be muddy,
and somehow, it's the driest wet I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Colonial can do that to you.

RED BULLET PUTS STOP TO PEGASUS' BID FOR TRIPLE CROWN

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ It looks as though Fusaichi Pegasus slipped up on
his way to the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky Derby winner couldn't get the job done at Pimlico
Race Course on Saturday, which turned out to be the big banana peel
on the way to history. Instead, he let things get away from him in
the final turn and never threatened, while Red Bullet pulled away
in the stretch to win the Preakness Stakes by almost four lengths
at damp Pimlico.
</P>
<P>
   The track was rated as ``good'' after rain showers passed
through Maryland before the races. It was rated sloppy earlier in
the day. The people surrounding Fusaichi Pegasus, who was heavily
favored at odds of 2-5, said the inability of their colt to handle
the track was the reason for the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big, heavy horse,'' said jockey Kent Desormeaux, who
held on to second, barely, over Impeachment and Captain Steve.
``He's so heavy going around those turns that he was slipping and
sliding. That certainly could have made the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the track wasn't to his liking. But no one could tell that
before the race. The last time Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet met
each other on the track, Fusaichi Pegasus beat that colt by four
lengths in the Wood Memorial Stakes on a wet track five weeks ago
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus won the Derby two weeks ago over Aptitude,
while Red Bullet skipped the Derby and headed toward the Preakness.
Red Bullet had beaten Aptitude twice, and now he breaks a streak of
71 horses that failed to win the Preakness after skipping the Derby
during the past 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Solis rode Red Bullet in the Wood, and trainer Joe Orseno
believed the rider made a mistake by going out early with the
pacesetter and chasing a fast pace in his first effort around two
turns. So when Hall of Fame rider Jerry Bailey became available
after War Chant departed the Triple Crown chase following the
Derby, Orseno had no trouble convincing him to take the mount.
</P>
<P>
   And he let Bailey do whatever he pleased on the colt. Red Bullet
had only raced four times in his career, and Bailey was aboard for
his second victory in February at Gulfstream Park in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Orseno and owner Frank Stronach talked with each other on what
instructions they should give to Bailey as the race card progressed
at Pimlico. The Preakness was the 10th race on the card.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had out-thought ourselves at that point,'' Orseno said.
``So when we got down there with him and the horse (before the
race), we just told him `Good luck.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet's talent was formidable enough _ he was second in the
wagering at 6-1 _ so maybe the move to Bailey made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet took an awkward step out of the gate _ he actually
jerked his head around seconds prior to the start _ and he was
ahead of one horse heading into the clubhouse turn.
</P>
<P>
   But Bailey put the colt on the move. Before they left the
backstretch, he was on even terms with Fusaichi Pegasus about two
lengths from the lead when the first three-quarters of a mile went
in 1 minute, 11 1/5seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, however, had guided Red Bullet to a path inside of
Fusaichi Pegasus, and Red Bullet was able to avoid traffic trouble
all the way through the turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to wiggle my way through the crowd,'' Bailey said.
Desormeaux ``had to go around.''
</P>
<P>
   It cost him. Red Bullet was running behind Snuck In, but when
jockey Cash Asmussen was able to get Snuck In to make his move,
Bailey followed and was able to pass Hal's Hope and head for the
top of the stretch. Desormeaux had to take Fusaichi Pegasus around
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was no more than a half a length off my flank
turning for home,'' Bailey said. ``But I thought if my horse was
good enough to beat him to that point, I knew he could probably
beat him overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red Bullet really showed what he was made of today. He
exploded on that turn, and when we straightened out, he just left
the other horses. He was just a better horse today.''
</P>
<P>
   When the field entered the stretch, Red Bullet was a length in
front. Bailey slapped the colt three times with the stick
right-handed, then put it in his left hand and swatted him twice
more. Mission accomplished, he tucked away the whip and stopped the
clock in 1:56 for the 13/16 miles. That's the slowest winning time
since Tabasco Cat won in 1:562/5 on a fast track in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet and Fusaichi Pegasus have met each other two times
and won one race apiece. It sounds as if they could have a rubber
match in three weeks at the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Drysdale, trainer of Fusaichi Pegasus, said he intends to
send the colt to New York tomorrow. Orseno said he would make a
decision based on how the colt is doing, but did not rule out the
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   When they get there, they could meet up again with Aptitude.
Lexington Stakes winner Unshaded, fifth-place Derby finisher
Wheelaway and Lone Star Derby winner Tahkodha Hills may be a part
of the field, as well.

TRAINERS POINT TO BELMONT

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Unlike pro wrestling, horse racing is not a sport
where threats are exchanged as freely as dot-com stocks on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   But a battle of words might be forming between the people
handling Fusaichi Pegasus and the people handling Red Bullet after
the Preakness Stakes. Maybe the Triple Crown is history, but both
horses are the leading candidates for champion 3-year-old _
possibly Horse of the Year _ now that Fusaichi Pegasus won the
Kentucky Derby and Red Bullet won the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Drysdale, trainer of Fusaichi Pegasus, stopped short of
saying Red Bullet was a better horse despite Red Bullet's victory
of nearly four lengths Saturday in the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   And Drysdale, usually a cautious type who wouldn't make a firm
commitment to the Preakness until a week following the Derby, now
appears raring to go. He's already announced plans to leave for New
York tomorrow in order to prepare for the Belmont Stakes on June
10.
</P>
<P>
   He might get a rematch with Red Bullet. It would be a rubber
match because Fusaichi Pegasus defeated Red Bullet by four lengths
in the Wood Memorial prior to the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to be taken away from Red Bullet's victory''
Saturday, Drysdale said. ``But I don't think Fusaichi Pegasus
handled the track. I just feel he was slipping and sliding. He
couldn't go when the other horse came with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The track at Pimlico Race Course was rated as ``good'' after
rain showers passed through the area for two days leading up to the
races. That was a disappointment to Red Bullet trainer Joe Orseno.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping for a sunny day because I knew how well my horse
was training up to this race,'' Orseno said. ``I just wanted to win
the race and not have any excuses from anybody. Red Bullet is a
talented horse, and I wanted the chance to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Orseno blamed the colt's loss to Fusaichi Pegasus in the Wood on
the fact he made an early move to chase a fast pace under jockey
Alex Solis. Orseno replaced Solis on Red Bullet with Hall of Fame
rider Jerry Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   But with the approval of owner Frank Stronach, Orseno skipped
the Derby with Red Bullet and pointed for the Preakness. It was a
risky move. In the past 17 years, 71 horses have skipped the Derby,
run in the Preakness and lost.
</P>
<P>
   It looked even more shaky after Fusaichi Pegasus won the Derby
by 11/2 lengths with the sixth-fastest time in the history of the
race. The colt came to Pimlico at odds of 2 to 5, the heaviest
Preakness favorite since Spectacular Bid at odds of 1 to 10 in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought going in (to the Preakness) that there were
seven horses to beat, not just one who happened to be almost 1 to 5
and came to town as the next Triple Crown winner. People thought we
were running for second money, and I didn't believe any of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to have a champion horse, not a one-race
wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they'll figure out who's the one-race wonder at the
Belmont. nn

VICTORIOUS TRAINER FLYING HIGH WITH STRONACH'S STABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Life is getting good, real good, for trainer Joe
Orseno. When Red Bullet won the Preakness Stakes on Saturday at
Pimlico Race Course, he became the first trainer since 1996 to
train the winner of the Preakness and the Pimlico Special _ the two
most prestigious races at Pimlico _ in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   People can even ask things of Orseno that they were forbidden to
ask Fusaichi Pegasus trainer Neil Drysdale _ those ``touchy-feely
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, I'll answer those,'' Orseno said. ``I feel great, a
real high. I won't need an airplane to get home.''
</P>
<P>
   A 44-year-old native of Philadelphia, Orseno has been the
leading trainer at Atlantic City Racecourse, Garden State Park,
Meadowlands and Delaware Park. But Orseno thought about getting out
of the game when he no longer was winning training titles.
</P>
<P>
   Orseno became the private trainer for Frank Stronach when
Stronach and Patrick Byrne parted ways following 1999. Byrne
eventually sued Stronach to collect training fees.
</P>
<P>
   Orseno got his hands on some nice horses when Stronach hired
him. Before Orseno was trainer, Stronach had won races such as the
Belmont ('97 with Touch Gold) and the Breeders' Cup Classic ('98
with Awesome Again).
</P>
<P>
   The stable is still powerful. Orseno won the Pimlico Special
with Golden Missile, the Beaugay Handicap with Tap To Music and
other stakes races with Perfect Sting. STRONACH ON RETAMA
</P>
<P>
   Frank Stronach, who owns Red Bullet, has been in talks with
officials at Retama Park near San Antonio about buying that
racetrack. But those talks have bogged down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has a price,'' said Andy Stronach, son of Frank
Stronach and heavily involved in the Stronach business empire.
``Some things fall into place, sometimes they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stronachs would not comment regarding ongoing negotiations.
Several sources contend the owners of Retama's debt have upped
their price. Retama was purchased in 1997 for a price between $12
million and $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Through his Magna Entertainment Corp., Stronach owns Santa Anita
Park, Gulfstream Park, Golden Gate Fields and Remington Park. He
just announced he's buying Bay Meadows Racecourse near San
Francisco. SNUCK IN FIFTH
</P>
<P>
   Snuck In, trained by Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie-based Steve
Asmussen, finished fifth in the eight-horse field of the Preakness.
Asmussen leads the trainer standings at Lone Star, but this was his
first Triple Crown race.
</P>
<P>
   Snuck In, who had won the Rebel Stakes and finished second in
the Arkansas Derby, was battling for the lead heading into the turn
before Red Bullet flew past him. After that, Fusaichi Pegasus,
Impeachment and Captain Steve went past as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good trip. Lovely trip,'' said Cash Asmussen, brother of Steve
Asmussen and Snuck In's jockey. ``He traveled well, happy following
High Yield''toward the final turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the other horse (Red Bullet) quickened next to me, I just
kind of stayed on it.'' TRACK GOT `GREASY'
</P>
<P>
   Kent Desormeaux, rider of Fusaichi Pegasus, has firsthand
knowledge of the racing surface at Pimlico. He rode in Maryland
before he moved to the Southern California circuit. He believes the
surface contributed to Fusaichi Pegasus' loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``This track has a limestone bottom,'' Desormeaux said. ``When
it gets greasy, it's hard for a big, heavy horse like mine to not
slip around on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The base is the part of the track that's built first, then the
other layers of the track _ sand, loam, clay and other materials _
are laid on top of it. nn

GOOD VIBES: RAY TAKES INDY POLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Texan Greg Ray was driving so fast at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Saturday he couldn't see straight.
</P>
<P>
   And that's how Ray won the pole position for the 84th
Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   Driving while blind.
</P>
<P>
   Battling a tire vibration problem he said blurred his vision
throughout his 10-mile qualification run, Ray held his breath and
ripped off four consecutive laps of 223-plus mph for an average
speed of 223.471 mph. Ray, the reigning Indy Racing Northern Light
Series champion, relegated rookie Juan Montoya _ reigning champion
of the rival CART FedEx Series _ to No. 2 among the 23 drivers
completing attempts on the first of two days of qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Champions Ray and Montoya will be joined by open-wheel
journeyman Eliseo Salazar in the three-car front row for the race's
traditional flying start May 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the pole here is as big as winning any race anywhere
else,'' said Ray, the Plano resident who had qualified No. 2 for
the previous two Indy 500s. ``After starting second the last two
years, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a big focus for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya had gotten Ray's attention _ and sent a buzz through the
grandstands _ when he put together a four-lap average of 223.372
mph to take the provisional pole from Salazar (223.231), who is
driving for Texan and four-time Indy 500 champion A.J. Foyt.
Montoya, who warmed up with a screaming lap of 221.626 mph, went
out approximately 10 minutes after Ray had waved-off his first
attempt because of a pushing condition in his car going into Turn 1
of the 2.5-mile oval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time by I fully committed to turning into Turn 1 at
233 mph, and the car went straight,'' said Ray, driver of the No. 1
Team Conseco Dallara/Aurora. ``I had to back off the gas to keep it
off the wall, and there was no need to continue that attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya's number stood atop the Speedway's scoring pylon
approximately 21/2 hours. Both Ray and teammate Robby Gordon worked
on their cars during that period before mounting second bids for
the pole. Ray hit the track at 3:50 p.m., facing relatively the
same cloudy and cool conditions he and Montoya had dealt with
earlier in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   When Ray warmed up at 218.140 mph, Montoya's speed appeared
safe. But Ray hunkered down for consecutive laps of 223.658,
223.397, 223.503 and 223.325 mph and a time of 2:41.095.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car was definitely on the edge when I practiced,'' said
Ray, who had run off a lap at 224 mph moments before heading out
for his second attempt. ``But I think we slung a (wheel) weight on
the backstraight the first time I accelerated, and there was a huge
vibration in the car. We didn't have a chance to come back in
because that was my second attempt. I just decided to drive it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had sets of tires before where you had a vibration, but
this is the first time at Indy. I just couldn't believe it. I was
almost laughing in the car. Here I am driving this car with
absolutely no downforce, 65-degrees track temperature, it's cold
and slippery and now we've got a vibration. It's like, you just
suck-it-up and go.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said the vibration prevented him from ever shifting into
sixth, or top gear, during the four laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was vibrating so bad, it was fighting itself,'' said Ray,
who nevertheless bagged his third pole in four events this season
and the seventh of his Indy Racing League career. ``It was very
difficult to see because the vibration goes up through the whole
car. You'd see a flat wall one second and then it'd be fuzzy. All I
know was I was happy to see the checkered flag because I could
breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I know for a fact that I can hold my breath for 160
seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray presented team owner John Menard with his third Indy 500
pole and 16th in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (run) is a testament to Greg's stamina and focus,'' said
Menard, who fielded the cars that the late Scott Brayton put on the
pole here in 1995 and 1996. ``That was a great drive. I can't
remember a more awesome run.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya and his car owner, Chip Ganassi, were fully aware that
Team Menard had the savvy to blast them off the pole late in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought maybe we could get the pole, or front row,'' said
Montoya, the Colombian who qualified his backup No. 9 Target G
Force/Aurora _ and made it look easy. ``I don't think it's easy. I
set it up the way I do my Champ Car. I like the car. It's a really
friendly car. Fast and friendly.'' nn

<TEXT>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, the presumptive pres idential candidate for the
Reform Party, on Saturday said he supports in theory a work-permit
program that would give some kind of tempo rary legal status to
migrant workers who now cross the border illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not an idea I would throw out on principle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was in town to address the Arizona convention of the
Reform Party, which elected eight members and eight alternates to
attend the national convention in Long Beach, Calif., in August.
The group of about 250 met at the Chaparral Suites in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   The former Republican delivered an impassioned speech that
touched on the main tenets of the Reform Party, including severe
limits to legal immi gration, an end to illegal immigra tion, an
end to campaign soft money and an end to U.S. participation in free
trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where my hand goes up,'' he said to roaring applause, ``The
new world order goes down.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bulk of his message, and of the dialogue through the
rest of the convention, addressed illegal immi gration and the
problems of Arizona border ranchers who have detained thousands of
border crossers they find on their property.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview before his speech, Buchanan harked back to a
similar guest worker program called brace ros that allowed Mexican
workers to temporarily work in the United States from 1942 to 1964
and guar anteed them at least minimum-wage salaries and humane
living condi tions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the program we had in the 1950s,'' he said. ``I
wasn't opposed to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would support a similar program today, he said
he might, but he has not yet worked out a detailed proposal. With
this tenta tive support, Buchanan joins the camp of Arizona Gov.
Jane Hull and Douglas Mayor Ray Borane, both of whom have urged the
federal govern ment to work out a new bracero program that they
believe would alleviate the problems caused by thousands of illegal
immigrants who cross the U.S.-Mexican border daily. &QL; 
WANTS BORDER SEALED Still, Buchanan said that before any such
program can become a reality, the United States needs to close its
porous borders. Buchanan suggested bulking up U.S. Border Patrol en
forcement in all high-traffic areas at the same time, rather than
slowly and gradually, as the Border Patrol has done since the early
1990s with operations like El Paso's Hold the Line, San Diego's
Gatekeeper, and Arizona's Safeguard.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he would use troops if necessary to stop illegal
immi grants. The sheriff of Cochise County has twice asked Hull to
send in the National Guard in support and administrative
capacities, but she has resisted.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the military on the border is not new. It last occurred
during the Reagan administration's war on drugs, when Marines
helped the Border Patrol with scouting and reconnaissance work, as
well as actual enforcement of the border. The 240 military
personnel were stationed all along the U.S.-Mexican border, though
most stayed near El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   But the May 20, 1997, killing of Ezequiel Hernandez Jr., a
Redford, Texas, youth, by a Marine brought those efforts to an
abrupt end. Two months later, the Pentagon recalled the soldiers
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he was not aware of the Hernandez shooting. The
main thing to remember, he said, is that the current policy has not
worked.
</P>
<P>
   He said he understands why Mexi can workers cross American
borders in search of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motivations of those folks coming over here, there's
nothing wrong with them,'' he said. ``The problem lies with an
administration that is not willing to enforce the laws of this
country.'' &QL; 
SUPPORTS RANCHERSBuchanan criticized U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and U.S. Attor ney General Janet Reno, who con
demned the ranchers and what they called ``vigilante justice'' last
week. Albright made a joint statement with Mexican Foreign
Secretary Rosario Green. Reno pledged to help gather evidence for
possible criminal prose cutions of the ranchers, but later backed
away, saying she merely promised to enforce the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said both are putting their personal relationships with
the Mexi can government ahead of the prop erty rights of American
citizens and of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ranchers simply are protecting their property rights
because the U.S. government has literally abdicated its
responsibilities,'' he said. ``You only have vigilante justice
where real justice doesn't exist.'' &QL;

`LITTLE AL' QUALIFIES FOR INDY 500 AFTER FIVE-YEAR ABSENCE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Two-time Indianapolis 500 champion Al Unser Jr.
needed 2 minutes, 43 seconds and change to complete some unfinished
business at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after he failed to qualify for the Indy 500 as the
reigning champion, Little Al secured a spot in the 84th edition of
the race that has become his family's birthright.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can safely say we're back now,'' said Unser, who will start
18th in the 33-car field after compiling a four-lap qualifying
average of 220.293 mph. ``We're in the show. We definitely had
butterflies we haven't had for five years. There's been a lot of
buildup and hype, and we're officially back now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It relieves a lot of tension that's been festering for five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Unser and Marlboro Team Penske teammate Emerson Fittipaldi both
failed to make the race in 1995 on speed. The political split
between the Championship Auto Racing Teams and IMS president Tony
George's Indy Racing League has prevented Little Al from competing
here since '95.
</P>
<P>
   The Unsers have enjoyed tremendous success at the Speedway. Al
Unser, Junior's father, is a four-time winner of the Indy 500.
Uncle Bobby won the race three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still `The Greatest Spectacle in Racing,' and it's a
great thing for me, my family and my team,'' said Unser, whose No.
3 ECR Racing Tickets.com G Force/Aurora is owned by Rick Galles.
Unser Jr. and Galles won the 1992 Indy 500, and the longtime
residents of Albuquerque, N.M., reunited in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Unser Jr. said his visit here last May convinced him it was time
to leave CART and Team Penske.
</P>
<P>
   ``You betcha,'' Unser Jr. said. ``What I saw last year on Race
Day looked exactly like I saw in '94. It's the Speedway, and it's
bigger than all of us.'' MONTOYA ANOTHER MANSELL?
</P>
<P>
   Juan Montoya, the reigning CART champion, drew comparisons to
heralded Indy 500 rookie Nigel Mansell after qualifying No. 2 at
223.372 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``That little sucker is pretty quick,'' said Jimmy Vasser, the
1996 CART champion and Montoya's teammate at Target/Chip Ganassi
Racing. ``This isn't the only place he's made look easy. And
believe me, it's not easy. Juan is out there like this (on the
edge), and he's got his car working really good. He's got a lot of
talent, and he's pretty much taken to any place we've gone to. I'm
looking for advice from him half the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mansell, the 1992 Formula One World Driving Champion, started
third and finished eighth as an Indy 500 rookie with Newman/Haas
Racing in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Vasser, meanwhile, marked his return to the Speedway for the
first time since the CART-IRL split with a four-lap qualifying
average of 221.976 mph. Vasser will start seventh. FISHER IN THE
SHOW
</P>
<P>
   Teen-ager Sarah Fisher qualified for her first Indy 500 with an
impressive four-lap average of 220.237 mph. She was fourth-fastest
among the five rookies completing attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wide-open on the straightaways, so that was all she
had,'' said Fisher, 19, sounding like a veteran. ``It's been a big
thrill. Al Unser Sr. and I have worked a lot together this month.
He showed me the line around this place, and who better to learn
from than a four-time winner?''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who made her series debut at Texas Motor Speedway in
Fort Worth in October, is driving Derrick Walker's No. 15 Cummins
Special Dallara/Aurora. nn

STARS WILL NEED THEIR SUNDAY BEST TO DIG OUT OF HOLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Tunnel vision doesn't even begin to describe last
season's Stars. They were so hellbent on winning the Stanley Cup,
they didn't need any other motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Well, your 2000 Dallas Stars suffer from a bit of motivational
attention deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   They seem to be motivated only after getting embarrassed,
needing their worst to bring out their best. Which is a good thing,
because their worst peeked its ugly head out in Game 3 and their
best needs to make an appearance if they're going to win Game 4 of
the Western Conference Finals at 2 p.m. Sunday at the Pepsi Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the thing that bothers us a little bit as
coaches. Are we a situation-motivated hockey club? That's what
we've been all year,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We seem to
have to dig ourselves right into a big hole before we dig ourselves
out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   If a hole is what the Stars need, they've certainly got one.
</P>
<P>
   They trail the best-of-seven series 2-1. They're playing Game 4
in Denver, where the Avalanche has yet to lose in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, they can't seem to find their offense either. The Stars
have been shut out in two of the first three games. All of their
goals have come from either Mike Modano or Brett Hull. Nary a peep
has been heard from the likes of Joe Nieuwendyk and Jamie
Langenbrunner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only line that has really been scoring for us is Mike's
line,'' Langenbrunner said. ``We know as good as anyone it doesn't
work that way. You have to have more than that going.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to remedy the situation, Hitchcock juggled his
lines at practice Saturday. He had Scott Thornton on a line with
Modano and Hull. He had Nieuwendyk with Jere Lehtinen and Mike
Keane, while his bottom two lines consisted of Aaron Gavey-Jon
Sim-Grant Marshall and Roman Lyashenko-Kirk Muller-Langenbrunner.
</P>
<P>
   They won't be like this for the game, at least not exactly.
Stars center Guy Carbonneau, who didn't practice, will be in there
somewhere. But Hitchcock said he's likely to play either Sim or
Lyashenko, who have yet to see action in this series, if for no
other reason than to inject some life.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, your attitude is you can either sit and hope you make a
turnaround or you can make it happen. We've always been a group
that's made it happen,'' Hitchcock said. ``We can always go back
right away. But if we're not willing to make changes, if we're not
willing to make adjustments, then we're not trying to get on the
right edge of winning, because right now, when you get shut out two
of three games, you've got to look at yourself in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, we're not going to win with one line scoring.
We're not going to win with one line being dependable defensively.
We're going to need more. We're going to need a lot more. Why not
spread the wealth and see where it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   The players seemed impervious to the line changes. The problem,
they insisted, won't be remedied by whom they're playing with,
rather how they are playing.
</P>
<P>
   Which wasn't too well in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically feel that we more or less gave them the game,''
Stars captain and defenseman Derian Hatcher said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars don't believe they played that bad five-on-five. The
problem was they were hardly ever five-on-five. They were in the
penalty box for almost 20 minutes of Game 3. Hitchcock said the
penalties were a symptom of an uninspired performance. Stars winger
Mike Keane thought they were the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what me and Hitch had a talk about,'' Keane said. ``I
think we agreed but disagreed. It's something where, yeah, we had
too many penalties, but we weren't in the game mentally. We had a
talk this morning, a team meeting, and I think you'll see a better
outing (Sunday). We got something out, and we'll be better.''
</P>
<P>
   They usually are. You don't have to look any further than this
series to see that. They were whipped by the Avs in Game 1 and came
back with an inspired performance to win Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the Stars is they seem to need the bad to get
the good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately for us, we have to have a game like that in
order for us to realize how desperate we have to play and how
mistake-free our game has to be,'' Stars center Mike Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt how desperate the Stars must be now. If they
lose Sunday, they would have to defeat the Avalanche in
back-to-back-to-back games to get back to the Stanley Cup Finals.
Not a likely feat considering how well Colorado goalie Patrick Roy
is playing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Stars aren't willing to say this is a must-win game
for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a huge game. I don't want to say it's not,''
Carbonneau said. ``But if we lose, we're not out of the playoffs.
The only game you can't afford to lose in the one that knocks you
out.'' nn

BORDER CROSSERS WILL KEEP TRYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY MARK SHAFFER AND JERRY KAMMER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGUA PRIETA, Sonora _ Cesar Juarez was in a quandary as he
scurried about town Saturday morning, a heavy, dirty backpack slung
over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Juarez, 32, had heard and read the horror stories in the Mexican
media all week as he rode the bus from his home in Morelia,
Michoacan, to this dusty border city with the anticipation of
illegally crossing the border and finding construction work in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Vigilante ranchers in southeastern Arizona were hunting Mexicans
like they were animals. They shot at the feet of some, the heads of
others, and some had been killed. Those that they didn't shoot at,
they were siccing packs of dogs on, the press accounts went.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? There was no turning back now with a wife and two
young children to feed.
</P>
<P>
   Juarez wasn't the only one confused at the end of an eventful
week: The Mexican government had threatened to sue the ranchers
with U.S. lawyers for human rights violations, both governments
condemned ``vigilante justice'' on the Arizona border, the Border
Patrol added 150 agents in southeastern Arizona and the U.S. House
of Representatives approved an amendment seeking the use of
military troops on the border.
</P>
<P>
   Groups of ranchers, saying their land is being ruined by the
human flow northward and the trash it leaves behind, began
patrolling their land with weapons last year and detaining groups
of illegal immigrants for the Border Patrol. Eyebrows were raised
last month when a brochure invited winter visitors to Arizona to
join in the patrolling activities while ranchers allied themselves
with anti-immigrant activists in California.
</P>
<P>
   But Juarez didn't plan on becoming a victim. He had a plan as he
waited for cover of darkness.
</P>
<P>
   He would walk alone, rather than with a group, in an attempt to
avoid detection. He would stay off private property, if he could
make out where it was at night.
</P>
<P>
   He would eat garlic, soak pieces of it in water and splash the
water on his body to try to keep rattlesnakes from biting him. He
would walk 80 miles past farm fields and through the desert
mountains near the community of Dos Cabezas to the train tracks
parallel to Interstate 10.
</P>
<P>
   From there, he would jump a train and catch a ride to Phoenix,
just in case the ranchers also were stopping suspected vehicles of
illegal-immigrant smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   And, if Juarez's luck was bad, he hoped it was the Border Patrol
doing the capturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what the ``migra'' is going to do to you,'' Juarez
said. ``But who knows what these racist gringos with guns would
do?''
</P>
<P>
   Mario Hernandez Olivas, a supervisor at the Mexican office of
migration in Agua Prieta, wonders the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pure racism at its worst,'' Hernandez said. ``All the
Mexicans do is walk on the land. They don't even take bread or
tortillas from those people, yet they are being treated like they
are criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez shook his head at the perceived injustice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has always been a racist country,''
Hernandez said, vigorously typing a visa for a U.S. tourist. ``I
only go there to buy things.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanca Diaz, who owns a new motel across the street from Agua
Prieta's bus station that caters to immigrants, said the ranchers
have been the talk of her cafe for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz said a trip to Sonora by Mexican presidential candidate
Vicente Fox on Friday had been closely watched on television by
many of her clients.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said that the ranchers should be prosecuted like criminals
for their ``hunting'' of the immigrants and that the border should
be open for free movement of people in the next five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand this. The United States has a great economy
built on the backs of Mexican workers. But some people full of hate
do things like these to our people,'' Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
   But Eduardo Peralta of Jalisco, who said he had immigrated
illegally through Arizona seven times in 10 years and was about to
try again Saturday night, said he couldn't care less about the
ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who worry me are the criminals from Mexico near the
border who steal everything from you,'' Peralta said. ``I was in a
group one time where $1,000 was stolen from one man, $600 from
another and $400 from another. I fear that a lot more than these
ranchers.''
</P>
<P>
   The furor over the ``hunt for illegals'' is receiving enormous
attention in Mexico, where it was front-page news all last week and
has been given dramatic coverage on television.
</P>
<P>
   It was the lead story Thursday on the Televisa network's
national news broadcast, with announcer Joaquin Lopez Doriga
calling it ``one of the most lamentable expressions of racism in
Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Televisa's coverage of trouble on the border included reports of
violence not only in Arizona, but also in Texas and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human-rights organizations agree that the Border Patrol in
California acts with impunity on a daily basis,'' Lopez Doriga
said, introducing a report from California.
</P>
<P>
   That report included an interview with a young Mexican who said
he and several companions were punched and kicked by Border Patrol
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by the Mexican and U.S. governments to calm the rising
tensions along the border were front-page news again Friday. While
most of the coverage was dispassion ate and objective, some of it
expressed the indignation that is widespread here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico demands that the United States stop the hunting of
immigrants,'' one Mexico City daily reported in a front-page
headline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It damages our pride as Mexicans to learn that this is
happening,'' said Juan Ramon Fuentes, 23, a law student in the
southern state of Oaxaca. ``We have heard a lot about the racial
discrimination that Mexicans and other Hispanics suffer in the
United States, and it causes us great concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes said he has several friends who have crossed illegally
into the United States, where they have found work that pays them
as much in a day as they can earn in two weeks of work at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to leave, and they don't want to separate
themselves from their families,'' Fuentes said. ``But they are
looking for a way to earn money to help their families. Our
salaries here just don't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   About a half-hour drive west of Oaxaca City, Justino Vasquez
said the news from Arizona would affect his plans for returning in
September to Arizona, where he and his brother have worked in
construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't cross the border at Douglas,'' said Justino, 22, who
has spent the past several months at his parents' home in the small
town of Zaachila. He and brother German, 19, worked most of Friday
in their parents' 2-acre field that provides corn in September and
beans in February.
</P>
<P>
   Justino said the $500 he and German sent home every month is
vital to his family's survival in an economy where there is little
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same for a lot of families here,'' he said,
estimating that 45 percent of them depend on the money orders that
flow from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Hunting' is a vulgar word to use about human beings,''
German said. ``It is a word to use about animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Justino said he worries about the outbreak of hostility in
Arizona but said he intends to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some racists, but most of the people there know that
we come only with the intention of working hard.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is hoping that the U.S. government will grant an
amnesty similar to that which was granted in the 1980s and allowed
millions of Mexicans to legalize their presence in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico City, Juana Maldonado talked angrily about the border
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is it possible that such things can happen to human
beings?'' she said, chopping a slab of beef at the street-side taco
stand where she and two others work all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't they know that Mexicans are human beings?'' she
demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Maldonado, 37, conceded that the United States has a right to
control its borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't mean that people have the the right to take
the law into their own hands.'' &QL;

STARS NEED A BETTER FORECHECK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER_ There is a reason the defending Stanley Cup champions
have three goals in three games.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado goalie Patrick Roy has something to do with it.
Penalties have something to do with it. The Stars' forecheck, or
it's untimely disappearance, has almost everything to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the problem,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``The
forecheck is one thing. But, the forecheck is no good if you don't
have proper positioning. Our positioning was terrible (Friday).''
</P>
<P>
   In a series where goals have been sparse, the Stars need to
forecheck better to begin scoring and win Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it all starts with our forecheck,'' Stars
defenseman Darryl Sydor said. ``We have to dump the puck better.
Game 2 we had a great forecheck and got opportunities. We didn't
have that going (in Game 3), and defensively we were out of
position a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   For four periods, the third in Game 1 and all of Game 2, Dallas
had its forecheck going. During that stretch, they outshot
Colorado, 47-24, and spent 42 percent of the time in the Avs zone.
As a result, the Stars were scoring, and winning: Three goals and
one win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our forwards allowed them too much speed; we weren't
skating,'' former Stars and current Avs forward Dave Reid said.
``We were standing around, and we let them blow by us on
dump-ins.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a key because for the other five periods, the first two in
Game 1 and all of Game 3, Colorado had its forecheck going. The Avs
enjoyed a plus-24 shooting margin and had the puck in the Dallas
zone 45 percent of the time. The result was four Avalanche goals
and two wins.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Colorado playing without Adam Foote, its most physical
defenseman who could return Sunday, the Stars were outshot, 40-21,
in Game 3. Of course, the Stars serving almost 20 minutes in
penalties had something to do with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have to start staying out of the penalty box, too,
so we can get into that flow of getting a good first-man forecheck
and bottling them up in their own end,'' Stars center Joe
Nieuwendyk said. ``That's going to be a big key (Sunday).''
</P>
<P>
   More telling than penalties, however, was the way Colorado
prevented Dallas from dumping the puck in, chasing defenders and
pressuring Roy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did to us what we want to do to them,'' Stars defenseman
Richard Matvichuk said. ``They clogged the neutral zone very well.
When you are slowing guys down like (Mike) Modano and Nieuwendyk,
they have to get the puck in.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, when you are held up, it's tough to get the forecheck
going. In Game 2, we got the puck deep, we had room to skate, and
it was going, and we were banging and hitting, and it makes a big
difference. ... Penalties are the big deal. You can't get any
momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but history has shown that this isn't always penalties.
And, the Stars know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with our competitive level and us playing better,''
Stars captain Derian Hatcher said. ``It's a lot like Game 1. We
weren't playing well. But, it's hard to get a forecheck going when
you are in the box for 20 minutes.'' nn

HERNANDEZ HURT, BUT GALAXY WINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- Considering he arrived from Monterrey, Mexico 24
hours earlier, hadn't trained a lick with his new Galaxy teammates,
Mexican superstar Luis Hernandez's MLS debut was going smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   That is until Hernandez walked out after 72 minutes holding his
right shoulder in pain. Hernandez fell to the turf earlier after a
collision with D.C. United's Carlos Llamosa. It didn't appear
serious, but MLS' biggest foreign acquisition, whom the league paid
nearly $5 million to purchase his contract from Tigres, was taken
to St. Luke's Hospital in Pasadena for precautionary X-Rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feet came out from underneath me,'' said Hernandez. ``I
have a little pain, it hurts when I move it. I hope it's nothing
more than sharp pain.''
</P>
<P>
   But before he left, Hernandez showed a glimpse of why the Galaxy
parted with nearly a third of their starting lineup to acquire him.
Hernandez played a big part in both goals that gave the Galaxy a
2-1 victory over MLS champion D.C. United in front of 40,303 at the
Rose Bowl -- the biggest crowd of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez chased Carrey Talley on a Mauricio Cienfuegos pass
deep in United territory. Hearing Hernandez give chase, Talley
accidentally headed in an own goal to give the Galaxy a 1-0 lead in
the 35th minute.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, a three-touch combination from Cienfuegos to
Hernandez to Jones, forced United defender Carlos Llamosa to foul
Jones from behind in the penalty box. Greg Vanney converted the
penalty, giving the Galaxy a 2-0 lead in the 75th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's touch was off a little, but he was pleased overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking into consideration not having practiced with the team,
it went well,'' said Hernandez. ``Once I train they will understand
me better. They will know when I run up the sideline or take a
cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Judah Cooks scored for United in the 75th minute, but the Galaxy
held on to improve to 6-0-5 while United dropped their fourth
straight to fall to a league-worst, 2-9-1.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Hernandez, the Galaxy received more disheartening
news when captain Robin Fraser turned his ankle sliding into
United's Jeff Agoos. He will miss Wednesday's game with New England
and is listed day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Hernandez was scheduled to miss Wednesday's game and
fly back to Mexico to take care of personal issues and check on his
wife, who is seven months pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was a big win, and a better-than-expected debut from
Hernandez, but it came with a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was reading a story saying what would happen if Luis gets
injured and is out for a long time,'' said Schmid. ``I hope that's
not a predictor. And with Robin, he's out for Wednesday, so it's
just a further test of our character and depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering everything, Schmid was pleased with Hernandez's
debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing him in the locker room before the game, you saw the
adrenalin build up in him as the game got closer,'' said Schmid.
``Even after the introductions, you see him sort of ball his fists
together and say c'mon let's go'.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was also obvious his touch was off a little bit. He
hasn't played the last two weeks. But as we move forward, we're
going to see better and better things from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy defender Danny Pena had mixed emotions about the victory.
With Fraser out and Hernandez already off to Mexico, he's worried
about the constant lineup changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in serious trouble if we lose Robin for an extended
period of time,'' said Pena. ``He's our captain and our voice back
there. Now, Hernandez will not be here for a midweek game. It's
frustrating. I was hoping when he got here he was here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a tough road ahead, we are losing all kinds of
national team players with World Cup qualifying commitments in a
few weeks. We're going to be a serious depleted team. We have to do
something.''

79-YEAR-OLD MAN ARRESTED AFTER WIFE IS SLAIN WITH AX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLES F. BOSTWICK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LITTLEROCK, Calif. _ A 71-year-old woman, long physically
abused by her husband, was found Saturday beaten to death with an
ax in her bed, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy called the case a
``terrible case of domestic violence'' after arresting her husband,
79-year-old Hollis Medford, on suspicion of murder.
</P>
<P>
   After Medford called authorities to report he had assaulted his
wife, deputies found Vonia Medford bludgeoned to death in her home
in north Los Angeles County about 4:30a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what we understand there has been a history of abusive
behavior,'' said Lt. Tom Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Vonia Medford had confided some of her marriage history to
friend and neighbor Audrey Rose, who lives near the couple's
single-story stucco home in the 8800 block of East AvenueT-2.
</P>
<P>
   Rose said Medford told her about five years ago she wanted to
leave her husband but that she never did. She said she gave Medford
a key to her home and told her to come in whenever she needed to
get away from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was scared to death of him,'' said Rose, noting Vonia
Medford would not call the police on her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who cared for the couple's three dogs at her Doggie Wash
grooming shop, said occasionally she would see Medford with bruise
marks on her arm or marks on her face.
</P>
<P>
   When Rose questioned the marks, ``She'd just say, `You know
father and his temperament.' She called him father. He was very
controlling. He wouldn't allow her to have control of any money,''
Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   Six or seven weeks ago, Rose said, one of her employees
threatened to call sheriff's deputies on Hollis Medford after he
started screaming and cursing because his dogs weren't ready when
he arrived to pick them up.
</P>
<P>
   After Rose told Vonia Medford her husband was banned from the
shop, he called back to apologize, saying he had had a bad day,
Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   Medford's violent death stunned other neighbors in this quaint
city, dubbed the ``Fruit Basket of the Antelope Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   One resident said the Medfords bought a house in Littlerock, a
town of 9,000 people located north of Devil's Punchbowl, 15 years
ago after moving from Santa Clarita. The resident described the
couple as quiet neighbors who waved when they drove by.
</P>
<P>
   ``To meet the guy, you would never in a hundred years believe he
could do that,'' the neighbor said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said Hollis Medford -- also known as Glenn -- had once
been an engineer and later worked in real estate. His wife had been
a registered nurse. The couple had three grown children, none
living locally.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators would not say how large or heavy the ax was or
whether the Medford was killed in her sleep, said Deputy Bruce
Thomas. Thomas did not know whether the victim had ever complained
to authorities in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Medford was being held without bail at the Lancaster sheriff's
station, Thomas said.

PASSIVE APPROACH ALMOST COSTS LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Was that an eyesore of a quarter or what? Yes,
indeed. There can be no ignoring it.
</P>
<P>
   The way the third quarter unfolded Saturday at the Staples
Center, the Lakers should consider themselves lucky to hold a 1-0
lead over Portland in their best-of-seven Western Conference Final.
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand: We wholeheartedly agree the final 12
minutes of the Lakers' 109-94 win over the Trail Blazers was
basketball at its most abominable - ``The NBA: It's Foul-tastic!''
</P>
<P>
   But the Trail Blazers would have thought twice about chasing
Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal all over the court so they could put
him on the foul-line on a dirty dozen possessions in the fourth
quarter if the Lakers had buried the Trail Blazers when they had
the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Any way you look at it, the Lakers pieced together a marvelous
first half, effectively shooting down the Trail Blazers' strategy
of doubling down on O'Neal and Kobe Bryant and daring some bit
player to step up and beat them.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry let it be known he was ready for his close-up. Did
he ever. He made three of four shots from beyond the arc on his way
to 12 points in eight second-quarter minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice also was primed for his star turn. He contributed 10
first-half points. Two of his baskets were three-pointers, which
means in 18 minutes he matched his success from beyond the 3-point
arc in 134 regular-season minutes against the Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Horry, who throughout the postseason has been the Lakers' MVP
(Most Valuable Perimeter shooter), scored two more points than all
of the much-ballyhooed Portland bench in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   His fellow Laker reserves Rick Fox and Brian Shaw outscored the
Trail Blazers' starting center Arvydas Sabonis 8-0 and Bryant and
O'Neal each had five assists, one more than Portland starting point
guard Damon Stoudamire, as the Lakers roared to a 63-42 lead at
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission in the second half was clear. It was to take that
21-point lead they had built in the second quarter and grow it like
an Internet stock in a bull market. NBA championship-caliber teams
tend to be awfully bloodless that way. Today's day traders would
appear downright sentimental next to Magic Johnson's Lakers or
Michael Jordan's Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers had taken care of business properly, O'Neal would
have been on the bench in the fourth quarter watching John Salley
log garbage minutes instead of parading to the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, the Lakers are at the ``terrible twelves'' of their
development. That's the phase where you build a big lead and then
turn all undisciplined and impatient for a quarter, just long
enough to give your opponent a boost of confidence and renewed
life.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers grew so enamored of their dazzling 66.7 percent
shooting from beyond the 3-point arc in the first half, they came
out in the third quarter and forgot their offense works best when
they give O'Neal a touch or 20.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, Horry and Bryant all were guilty of taking quick shots
instead of letting the shot clock be their ally. They misfired on
three of four shots from beyond the 3-point arc, their defensive
intensity waned and next thing they knew they had lost the quarter
30-22.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got happy feet,'' Horry said. ``We were trying to shoot
more 3s instead of getting it inside to Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers' path suddenly illuminated by that flicker at
the end of the tunnel, they managed to draw to within nine points
of the Lakers with five minutes remaining before their hack-a-Shaq
strategy blew up in their faces.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers forged their comeback without power forward
Rasheed Wallace, who provides a monster of a match-up problem for
the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that's consistently been able to stop him is his
own temper. It got the best of him again Saturday when he drew a
second technical foul for glaring at the referee after he had been
warned not to and was ejected with 6:43 remaining in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   How Wallace managed to collect two technicals before Sabonis,
the poor sap strapped with the primary responsibility of stopping
O'Neal, collected his second foul is something for Portland coach
Mike Dunleavy to ponder.
</P>
<P>
   How the Trail Blazers managed to outscore the Lakers 42-36 after
Wallace repaired to the visitors' locker room is something for the
Lakers to think hard about before Monday's Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a huge lead and after that we weren't as aggressive
defensively,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked him about the foul-filled fourth and Fox's eyes
narrowed to the size of an assassin's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pissed us off,'' he said. ``I'm sure it makes the big fella
even more perturbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Perturbed is good. It definitely beats passive.

DRAGON SLAYED BY LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The villagers were terrified, cowering in the
Staples Center, listening for the roar of the nine-headed dragon
that laid waste to Minnesota and Utah on its way to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland Trail Blazers, the monster that ate Kevin Garnett
and Karl Malone, were thundering into town, supposedly to make a
main course of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   But when they arrived Saturday they looked less like the
creature of NBA myth that we'd heard so much about, and more like
an ill-tempered poodle.
</P>
<P>
   They whined (before the Western Conference Finals series even
began). They nipped at O'Neal's ankles, repeatedly and futilely.
They rolled over at the very point in Game 1 when those nine heads
were expected to come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   With their subs outshot by the Lakers' subs, the Blazers fell 24
points behind in the second quarter and had to employ an ugly
tactic in the fourth to make the 109-94 game interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we don't look forward to doing all the
time,'' Brian Grant said of the decision to foul O'Neal
intentionally 12 times in the final 5 minutes, putting the pressure
on the league's most prolific bad free-throw shooter. ``It might
have worked if we'd put the ball in the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   While O'Neal was making 12 of 24 foul shots, including seven in
a row, to keep the Lakers afloat, the Blazers were missing 7 of 8
shots from the floor, not denting their deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Dunleavy's Hack-a-Shaq strategy seemed to take the
Blazers right out of their offensive flow, or so somebody suggested
to him after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did it look like we had any flow (before that)?'' Dunleavy
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, no.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers had let this one get away in the first half, just
when it appeared the Lakers were in for an afternoon-long fight. It
was tied at the end of the first quarter when the benches began to
stir.
</P>
<P>
   The bench was said to be Portland's big edge. The Lakers had two
heads, Shaq's and Kobe's, and the Blazers had nine. That's how they
ended up with the NBA's second-best record, without placing an
individual among the top 40 scorers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the subs came into play Saturday, it was all Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   It was 24-24 when Grant went in for Rasheed Wallace, 26-24
Lakers when Robert Horry replaced A.C. Green, 33-28 when Detlef
Schrempf replaced Arvydas Sabonis and Greg Anthony replaced Damon
Stoudamire, and 35-28 by the time Wallace returned in place of
Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   See a trend?
</P>
<P>
   Derek Fisher gave Bryant a rest, and Bonzi Wells went in for
Steve Smith when it was 44-28 - and Portland continued to dig its
hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had new guys coming in, myself included,'' Grant said,
``and I don't think we were in the flow right away. We wanted to
let Horry show he could make shots, and he made some 3's, and then
everybody got a little 3-crazy. ... It was a momentum thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, our bench didn't play very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The stake through the forehead was delivered by Horry and Rick
Fox, who'd come in for Glen Rice between quarters, with 3-pointers
on either side of Anthony dribbling a ball off his foot at
mid-court. That completed a 14-0 run that made it 44-28.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers had challenged the lesser Lakers to beat them,
double-teaming not only O'Neal but Bryant as well, only to watch
Horry respond with 12 first-half points, Brian Shaw step up with
five first-half assists and the L.A. bench outscore the Portland
bench 15-2 during the pivotal 22-2 run.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers had challenged the officials, too.
</P>
<P>
   During the buildup to this quarterfinal matchup of the NBA's
best teams, Dunleavy had issued a pre-emptive complaint about the
referees' treatment of O'Neal, saying the Lakers center is
``allowed to push guys out of the way'' and to ``zone up'' on
defense. ``I think I counted 57 times,'' Dunleavy said, that O'Neal
should have been whistled for zone defense in one game.
</P>
<P>
   The officials might have responded, just not as the Blazers
hoped. Shaq was called for just two fouls all day despite some of
Sabonis' best flops (one of which looked something like the
backstroke). The Lakers weren't warned for a zone until midway
through the second quarter (56 to go!). And Wallace was hit with
two technical fouls and was ejected midway through the third
quarter, the second T apparently coming because Wallace defied ref
Ron Garretson's warning not to glare at him from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officials seem to be a little quick with him,'' Pippen said of
Wallace. ``He speaks with a different aggression than the average
person.''
</P>
<P>
   He must glare with a different aggression as well.
</P>
<P>
   Prognosticators from here to Portland were taking the Blazers to
win the best-of-seven-game series in six, but you get the
impression they weren't quite so confident.
</P>
<P>
   Fussing, flopping, fouling - that's not the work of a dragon.
</P>
<P>
   The dragon slinked back out of town with its heads down, to work
on a better plan for Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us look at the tapes,'' Pippen said when asked what might
be different next time. ``Right now we'll just be happy to get out
of the building and forget about this game.''

WALLACE'S PLIGHT OF STARES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hey, you looking at me?
</P>
<P>
   Not a good idea, not if you're Rasheed Wallace and have a court
history just this side of Bobby Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Not if the one being stared at is Ron Garretson, the official to
last join Lakers' lore when Nick Van Exel tried to toss him over a
scorer's table.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace is the Trail Blazers' leading scorer and the NBA's No. 1
hothead. During the regular season, he was ejected by officials a
league-high six times.
</P>
<P>
   Add an overall No. 7 after Wallace was tossed out in the third
quarter of Saturday's playoff opener against the Lakers for ...
drum roll, please ... staring.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's come to this for the wild-eyed, 6-foot-11 forward. He
kept looking at Garretson wrong, which was one of the best things
the Lakers saw all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a first,'' said Blazers forward Brian Grant. ``I ain't
never heard of that before. We'll have to be more conscious of
that, be more careful the way we look at the refs.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had already drawn a first-half technical for a verbal
outburst, and when he failed to heed Garretson's repeated warnings
to stop staring at him in the third quarter, he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Much to the surprise of many.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised, too,'' said Wallace, in what was about his
only postgame comment.
</P>
<P>
   To Portland's players, it was all very wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those referees just really don't like Rasheed,'' said Blazer
Bonzi Wells. ``I mean, Rasheed is a great guy. He just plays
intense. Just because he look at you don't mean that he's coming at
you, or cussing at you. I could understand that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a look? That's just so petty. I think they're just trying
to put a meaning out there for Rasheed and let him know they're not
going to take it - but I don't think it's fair.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be a swell guy in the locker room, but he has the way
of looking like he should be driving a taxi with Robert DeNiro to
officials.
</P>
<P>
   For Wallace, this is a very old story. In that special land
where Wallace resides, the officials have gotten the call wrong
against him every time.
</P>
<P>
   And too often Wallace can do the one thing the Lakers never can
- stop Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for us to have him on the floor,'' Blazers
coach Mike Dunleavy said. ``In some point in time, he has got to
understand that. And no matter what the circumstances are - even if
he's right and it's a bad call - it doesn't do us any good, because
he's in the locker room and we're on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say under these circumstances I agree with it, but if
Ronnie Garretson told him not to look at him and he looks at him,
he's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone with 11 points in just 16 minutes. Gone without any Laker
even having to bait him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually did that on his own,'' said Lakers guard Brian
Shaw. ``Nobody really did get into a pushing match with him or a
verbal confrontation. That was just between him and the referees.''

HERNANDEZ HURT, BUT GALAXY WINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- Considering he arrived from Monterrey, Mexico 24
hours earlier, hadn't trained a lick with his new Galaxy teammates,
Mexican superstar Luis Hernandez's MLS debut was going smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   That is until Hernandez walked out after 72 minutes holding his
right shoulder in pain. Hernandez fell to the turf earlier after a
collision with D.C. United's Carlos Llamosa. It didn't appear
serious, but MLS' biggest foreign acquisition, whom the league paid
nearly $5 million to purchase his contract from Tigres, was taken
to St. Luke's Hospital in Pasadena. It turned out to be only a
scare. He was diagnosed with an A.C. joint strain of his left
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feet came out from underneath me,'' said Hernandez. ``I
have a little pain, it hurts when I move it.''
</P>
<P>
   But before he left, Hernandez showed a glimpse of why the Galaxy
parted with nearly a third of their starting lineup to acquire him.
Hernandez played a big part in both goals that gave the Galaxy a
2-1 victory over MLS champion D.C. United in front of 40,303 at the
Rose Bowl -- the biggest crowd of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez chased Carrey Talley on a Mauricio Cienfuegos pass
deep in United territory. Hearing Hernandez give chase, Talley
accidentally headed in an own goal to give the Galaxy a 1-0 lead in
the 35th minute.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, a three-touch combination from Cienfuegos to
Hernandez to Jones, forced United defender Carlos Llamosa to foul
Jones from behind in the penalty box. Greg Vanney converted the
penalty, giving the Galaxy a 2-0 lead in the 75th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's touch was off a little, but he was pleased overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking into consideration not having practiced with the team,
it went well,'' said Hernandez. ``Once I train they will understand
me better. They will know when I run up the sideline or take a
cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Judah Cooks scored for United in the 75th minute, but the Galaxy
held on to improve to 6-0-5 while United dropped their fourth
straight to fall to a league-worst, 2-9-1.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Hernandez, the Galaxy received more disheartening
news when captain Robin Fraser turned his ankle sliding into
United's Jeff Agoos. He will miss Wednesday's game with New England
and is listed day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Hernandez was scheduled to miss Wednesday's game and
fly back to Mexico to take care of personal issues and check on his
wife, who is seven months pregnant. His injury, however, leaves him
day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was a big win, and a better-than-expected debut from
Hernandez, but it came with a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was reading a story saying what would happen if Luis gets
injured and is out for a long time,'' said Schmid. ``I hope that's
not a predictor. And with Robin, he's out for Wednesday, so it's
just a further test of our character and depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering everything, Schmid was pleased with Hernandez's
debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing him in the locker room before the game, you saw the
adrenalin build up in him as the game got closer,'' said Schmid.
``Even after the introductions, you see him sort of ball his fists
together and say c'mon let's go'.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was also obvious his touch was off a little bit. He
hasn't played the last two weeks. But as we move forward, we're
going to see better and better things from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy defender Danny Pena had mixed emotions about the victory.
With Fraser out and Hernandez already off to Mexico, he's worried
about the constant lineup changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in serious trouble if we lose Robin for an extended
period of time,'' said Pena. ``He's our captain and our voice back
there. Now, Hernandez will not be here for a midweek game. It's
frustrating. I was hoping when he got here he was here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a tough road ahead, we are losing all kinds of
national team players with World Cup qualifying commitments in a
few weeks. We're going to be a serious depleted team. We have to do
something.''

HITCHCOCK SHAKES UP FIRST LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The road to victory for the Stars is simple: Their
impact players have to have an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano, Joe Nieuwendyk and Brett Hull combined for only
three shots in a penalty-marred, 2-0 loss to the Colorado Avalanche
in Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals. The Stars' three-headed
monster has to get more shots for them to have a chance of coming
home today with the best-of-seven series tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to us being game-breakers and making a
difference,'' Modano said Saturday. ``...Your key players are
looked upon to have great games. That's going to be the way it has
to be (today) in order for us to give a good chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   With nothing doing in Game 3, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock decided
to make something happen Saturday. He shook up the team's lines.
</P>
<P>
   Modano and Hull are expected to be joined by Scott Thornton on
the first line. Nieuwendyk will have Mike Keane and Jere Lehtinen
on his second line.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking for right now is to spread the wealth,''
Hitchcock said. ``We're trying to get to where we've got 12
forwards that we know that we can throw them in in any situation
and not be afraid to play them.''
</P>
<P>
   The change can't hurt Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk, who had the game-winning goals in Games 2 and 3 of
the Western Conference Finals against Colorado last year, has no
goals, no assists, three shots, a minus-1 and four penalties in the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``It's important to get
the puck to the net, but we were having problems getting it
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk had 11 goals, including six game-winners, and 21
points last year in winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable
player of the playoffs. In 13 playoff games this year, he has four
goals and three assists. Two of his goals, including the
game-winner, came in a 5-4 victory against San Jose in Game 4 of
the Western Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he's got to get going,'' Hitchcock said. ``He knows
he could be a difference-maker in this series just like he was at
the end of the series against San Jose. This is usually the time
when he steps up, and hopefully he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's any secret that when you look at scoring
chances that Modano's line is getting all the scoring chances. From
our standpoint, we've got to get more play from other lines.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have only three goals in three games. All three were
scored in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Modano, who has eight goals and four assists in the playoffs,
scored twice in Game 2. Hull, who has five goals and nine assists
in the postseason, scored the team's other goal.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk still is waiting for his first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about getting confidence,'' Stars winger Jamie
Langenbrunner said of Nieuwendyk. ``When he gains his confidence,
he can get unstoppable. Maybe he's second-guessing himself. It's
like anything else. If you're a second late, it's not going to
happen. But if you have confidence and just go, go, go, it works
better. We were getting it going, but we haven't been playing with
that same confidence this series.'' nn

STARS PLAYERS NOT HAPPY ABOUT DAY GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD, CHAREAN WILLIAMS AND MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Dallas Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said just about
everything that needed to be said after Friday's loss in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated one particular point before practice Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said this to the players this morning, we wasted a helluva
effort by a goaltender,'' Hitchcock said of Ed Belfour, who
finished with 38 saves in Game 3. ``You don't want to waste those,
but we did. That's what's frustrating for us. We needed our
goaltender to be great for us to win on the road, and he was, and
we didn't give ourselves a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour will have to buck a personal trend to deliver another
such performance Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The key word is Sunday. Belfour, a self-admitted night person,
isn't exactly good at day games. The Stars played eight of them
this season. He played in seven, going 2-3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour isn't the only Stars player not so crazy about the day
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go through 82 games playing at 7 or 7:30 (p.m.), you do it
all year and TV comes in and gets to pick and choose when you get
to play,'' Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor said. ``I guess that is
where the money is but I think it's a joke.'' WHERE'S THE POWER?
</P>
<P>
   Penalties, lack of scoring _ there are many things that could be
pointed to as the culprits for the Stars being behind 2-1 in their
best-of-seven series with the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Don't the forget power play.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were 0-for-3 with a man advantage in Game 3, including
failing to capitalize on two early power plays. They're 1-for-13 in
the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we'd like to have our power play a little better,''
Stars center Guy Carbonneau said. ``Power plays and penalty killing
will be important parts of the game. We have to take advantage of
our power play, especially on the road.'' PLAY TIME
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said Jon Sim and Roman Lyashenko could
play Sunday. Sim has yet to make his playoff debut, while Lyashenko
has played in eight playoff games but has been a healthy scratch
for all three games of the Western Conference Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's on the agenda,'' Hitchcock said. ``One or both are
going to come in (Sunday). Obviously, Lyashenko is a real physical
player, very strong on the puck, which looks like it's what's
needed in this series. Sim is an offensive threat. He's a guy who's
hungry around the net. He's a guy who will do anything to score a
goal. We're probably looking like we're going to need some of that
jump right now.'' HOME ICE
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche, who are 7-0 at Pepsi Center in the playoffs, used
their home-ice advantage in Game 3, according to the Stars. The
Stars talked about Colorado ``playing the rink'' better than they
did.
</P>
<P>
   But with a game under their belts, the Stars expect to ``play
the rink'' better Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rink is a 200-foot surface, but it doesn't play as a
200-foot surface,'' Hitchcock said. ``The corners come up very
quickly. They use the glass to their advantage here.
</P>
<P>
   ``...They play this rink very well. They're smart. They know
this rink, and they did a terrific job in playing it the right
way.'' MORROW SKATING
</P>
<P>
   Only eight days after fracturing his right ankle in Game 1 of
the Western Conference Finals, Stars rookie winger Brenden Morrow
was back on the ice Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can put a little bit of weight on it, but it's different in
a skate,'' Morrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow, who was injured when he got tangled with Colorado's Dave
Andreychuk late in Game 1, recently was told that his ankle doesn't
require surgery. There is a remote chance that if the Stars advance
to the Stanley Cup Finals, he could play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something I want to reinjure for just being stupid
and trying,'' he said. ``But, if it feels really good (Sunday)
we'll see.'' GAME 4 QUESTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Game 4s have been good to the Stars in the playoffs. They are
2-0 so far. In their franchise history, they are 21-19 in the
fourth game.
</P>
<P>
   As added reference, they were 1-3 in the 1999 Stanley Cup
playoffs, including losing Game 4, 3-2, at Colorado in last
season's Western Conference Finals. nn

AVS' SAKIC QUIETLY GETTING JOB DONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ If Joe Sakic isn't scoring goals, he's spending his
off-ice time answering why.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's his own fault. Maybe he has been so good over his 12
NHL seasons that he has spoiled his critics. Maybe his 18 goals to
lead all playoff scorers, and 34 points, during the Avs' 1996
Stanley Cup run that earned him the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff
MVP, set the bar entirely too high.
</P>
<P>
   Through 13 playoff games, the Avs are two wins away from a
return trip to the Stanley Cup Finals. Yet, Sakic has only two
goals, and everyone wants to know, ``Where's Joe?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't worry outside the dressing room, the talking that
goes on,'' Sakic said. ``You just have to try your best and help
the hockey team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as he did in a myriad of ways in Game 3, a 2-0 victory that
gave the Avs a 2-1 series lead heading into Sunday's Game 4 of the
Western Conference Finals. He remained goalless in the series, but
Sakic is a major reason the Avs lead the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Joe Sakic is not scoring goals,'' linemate Dave Andreychuk
said, ``he's doing a lot of other things.''
</P>
<P>
   In Game 3, Sakic dominated in the faceoff circle, the biggest
coming with almost 15 minutes elapsed in the second period with the
Avs on the power play and trying to build on a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   He outdueled Stars center Guy Carbonneau, getting the puck to
defenseman Martin Skoula at the point. Skoula launched a shot that
Adam Deadmarsh redirected at the top of the crease and into the net
for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   He won 20 of 29 faceoffs, including key victories late in the
third period when the Stars played desperately in the Avs' zone. He
also turned up the offensive heat. His eight shots in Game 3
doubled his output in the first two games and he led all forwards
in ice time, playing 24 minutes, 29 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we wanted to get more pucks on net and be more
assertive in the offensive zone,'' Sakic said of his line. which
had one-fourth of the Avs' total shot output with 10. ``It's
something we talked about, and we did that.''
</P>
<P>
   On a team loaded with goal scorers, Sakic's greatest asset too
often goes unheralded. Like his Stars counterpart, Mike Modano, he
unselfishly sacrifices
</P>
<P>
   offense for defense. He goes up against the opposition's top
centers. Against Phoenix in the first round he checked Jeremy
Roenick. Against Detroit he faced Steve Yzerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This round it's got to be either (Joe) Nieuwendyk or (Mike)
Modano,'' Avs coach Bob Hartley said. ``His role hasn't changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano and Nieuwendyk were no-shows in Games 1 and 3. And should
Sakic start finding the back of the net again, it makes the
explosive Avs even tougher to defend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe wants to make plays, Joe wants to get points, Joe wants to
score goals, Joe wants to take great pride in his defensive game
and penalty killing,'' said assistant coach Bryan Trottier, a
tremendous goal scorer throughout the 1980s for the New York
Islanders. ``He's one of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sakic, ``As long as we win hockey games, it doesn't
matter.'' nn

COLORADO WON'T TAKE GAME 4 LIGHTLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Avalanche failed to eliminate the Stars on two
occasions in last season's conference finals. Entering Sunday's
Game 4, they have the chance to give themselves three cracks at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to take that game lightly; it is a big game
for us,'' goalie Patrick Roy said. ``Now, we are up 2-1 in the
series and we know that we still have to win two more games to win
the series, and they won't be easy games. If Adam (Foote) could be
back, we would be pretty strong.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance the Avs' injured defenseman could be back
Sunday. He practiced Saturday for the second consecutive day
wearing a full visor. Although Foote declared himself ready for
duty, doctors have not yet cleared him to play. The right corner of
his right eye remains red. He was injured in Game 2 when the blade
of Jere Lehtinen's stick caught the corner of his eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``The face shield felt good. I will get evaluated again today
and every day, and they are going to let me play when they feel
it's 100 percent,'' Foote said. ``I want to play. I wanted to play
(Friday) night. I feel like I could have played four days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche coach Bob Hartley continued to toe the company line,
saying he expects Foote to return during the series. Hartley just
doesn't know when.
</P>
<P>
   The Avs fared well without Foote, limiting the Stars to 11 shots
through two periods and keeping the Stars' top two lines quiet.
Whether or not Foote plays, the Avs want to head back to Dallas for
Game 5 leading 3-1 instead of tied 2-2 and handing home-ice
advantage back to the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we said this morning in the room is probably the
same thing that was said in the Stars' room,'' Hartley said. ``We
know the importance of the game. It should be a great matchup.''
BOURQUE FINE DAY AFTER
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Ray Bourque, 39, felt no ill-effects in his left knee
after logging 35 minutes, 35 seconds of action in Game 3, his first
game time since spraining the knee May 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good last night, and usually you know you're in trouble
after a game if you're cramping up or whatever,'' Bourque said.
``Last night I felt fine, and I knew waking up I would be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque also returned to quarterback a busy power play and play
on the penalty-kill unit. Avs coach Bob Hartley said he was not
concerned about overplaying Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   ``He works so hard to get ready,'' Hartley said. ``There was no
way that I would stop him from running like that. I have said
before I believe a thoroughbred needs to run, and he is one of the
best.'' HOT ROY
</P>
<P>
   Avs goalie Patrick Roy is on top of his game. He has two
shutouts in three games and has stopped 76 of 79 shots. His
goals-against average is a playoff-low 1.52.
</P>
<P>
   He said the biggest key against the Stars has been scoring
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against them it is always key to take the lead. When you play
with the lead it is always a lot easier,'' Roy said. I'm very
pleased with the way the guys are playing right now. The team is
very sharp and very focused.'' nn

MAVS' PICK RESTS WITH BOUNCE OF PINGPONG BALL

<P>
   SECAUCUS, N.J. _ Don Nelson always has fun with the NBA Draft
Lottery.
</P>
<P>
   When he was coaching the Golden State Warriors, the team urged
fans to send their lucky charms so Nelson could carry them to New
York for the lottery. In 1993, Nelson wound up taking a bag full of
trinkets to the Big Apple, but there was one item that stood out
the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one that I carried in my pocket that year was a good luck
charm that a farmer's cow had swallowed,'' Nelson recalled while
laughing. ``It was a big old piece of metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow they cut it out of the cow's belly, and the cow
survived and they sent me that as a lucky charm. That's when we
went from six to three.''
</P>
<P>
   That year, Nelson used his lottery luck to draft Penny Hardaway
with the third pick overall. He subsequently traded Hardaway on
draft day to the Orlando Magic for Chris Webber.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks' billionaire owner, hopes to be
so lucky when he represents the Mavericks in the 2000 Draft Lottery
on Sunday during halftime of Game 7 in the New York-Miami Eastern
Conference semifinal series.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban won't divulge his lucky charms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I am superstitious,'' Cuban said. ``And no, you will
never know what (the lucky charms) are unless they work.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban, buoyed by the Mavs' 16-5 record during the last six weeks
of the season, is not holding out hope that his team will beat the
odds and win Sunday's lottery. And it might not matter where the
team selects.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous lotteries, there is no consensus prize player
available in this year's draft. The top prospects include
Cincinnati power forward Kenyon Martin, Texas center Chris Mihm and
Iowa State forward Marcus Fizer.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks didn't even keep their past two No. 1 draft
choices. Nelson dealt Robert Traylor in 1998 and Kelvin Cato in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have a much better team next year whether we
get the No. 1 pick or the No. 13 pick,'' Cuban said. ``So we expect
to get some help, and we will go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA went to a lottery system in 1985, after repeated
complaints from then-Mavericks coach Dick Motta about the
possibility of the Houston Rockets ``tanking'' games late in the
season in order to receive a favorable draft position.
</P>
<P>
   Before the lottery, the last-place team in the Western
Conference flipped a coin with the last-place in the Eastern
Conference. The winner received the top pick, and the loser
selected No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets won coin flips in 1983 and '84, and capitalized by
selecting Ralph Sampson and Hakeem Olajwuon, respectively. After
that, the lottery was born, although some purists still favor the
previous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather do (the coin flip) where the worst team gets (a
50-50 shot) at the No. 1 pick,'' Nelson said. ``But the league was
worried about teams not trying to win toward the end of the season,
so this is a pretty fair alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13 teams that failed to make the playoffs qualify for the
lottery. The Mavericks, seeded 12th among the 13 lottery teams,
have a 6-in-1,000 chance of winning the No. 1 pick.
</P>
<P>
   In 15 years of the lottery, the highest the Mavericks finished
was second in 1994. The Mavericks drafted Jason Kidd after the
Milwaukee Bucks, who won the lottery, selected Glenn Robinson No.
1.
</P>
<P>
   The highest other lottery finishes for the Mavericks occurred in
1993 and '94, when they drafted fourth overall both years and
selected Jim Jackson and Jamal Mashburn, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The league has restructured the lottery system in favor of the
teams with the worst records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared to draft 12th, and if something crazy happens
it'll be great,'' said Nelson, who will watch the lottery from his
North Dallas home. ``If we do win it I'll get awful excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I sent all of those lucky charms back to the (Warriors')
fans, so I don't have that lucky charm. If I had it, I'd give it to
Mark.'' nn

A LITTLE EXTRA PUDGE ADDS WEIGHT TO DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Confession time: At spring training in March, I took
one look at Pudge Rodriguez's _ ahem _ spreading posterior and
quietly wondered if this would be the year the slide would begin.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, he's sliding all right. Sliding right into such elite
status that it's not at all unusual to hear talk show callers and
hosts debating whether he might be the greatest catcher of all
time.
</P>
<P>
   Or even the greatest player of all time.
</P>
<P>
   I should have known, having seen Rodriguez's dedication to his
workout regimen, that if his tail looked bigger _ as many a
catcher's do after years of squatting behind the plate _ in his
case it was more likely added muscle.
</P>
<P>
   To this point, Rodriguez has given us a glimpse of what may be a
season for the ages. Just when you think he can't get any better,
he takes his game to yet another, higher level.
</P>
<P>
   Now folks are kicking his name around with the greatest ever:
Ruth, Aaron, Mays, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, all that may be somewhat premature, but the fact is, there
have been few players in the history of the game who possessed his
combination of pure, natural hitting ability and incredible
defense.
</P>
<P>
   He may not be the best ever _ only time will tell _ but he has
certainly earned the right to be mentioned with them.
</P>
<P>
   As far as being the best catcher ever, only Johnny Bench is even
close and he's losing ground daily. LUDS TO FORT WORTH?
</P>
<P>
   Former Dallas Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig is on the Fort Worth
Brahmas' short list of head coaching candidates, and _ considering
his long relationship with former Stars teammate Andy Moog, one of
the franchise owners _ it's safe to say the job is his if he
decides he wants it.
</P>
<P>
   There's a holdup, however, while Ludwig considers other options
that might arise with the Stars. He could wind up as part of the
coaching staff at the team's new minor-league affiliate in Utah
(Kalamazoo is shutting its operation).
</P>
<P>
   The Brahmas would love to have a high-profile former NHL star as
their coach, so they'll wait on Ludwig, who probably won't announce
his decision until after the Stars are either eliminated from the
playoffs or win a second consecutive Stanley Cup. GIVE HIM A RAISE
</P>
<P>
   Note to Texas Rangers owner Tom Hicks: Hitting coach Rudy
Jaramillo deserves a hefty bonus and right now. He has the Rangers
leading the league in hitting and on-base percentage despite losing
two-time MVP Juan Gonzalez and the fact that new right fielder Gabe
Kapler was scraping along under .200 before injuring his right
quadriceps muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Jaramillo has been patient with youngsters Mike Lamb and Ruben
Mateo, and he helped second baseman Luis Alicea pull out of an
early season slump. They've all been hotter than a downtown Fort
Worth sidewalk in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy has done a great job,'' manager Johnny Oates said, ``and
the players have been willing to work at it. Lamb and \RTom Evans\S
have actually added a new dimension for us by being able to
hit-and-run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than that, we don't run a lot. Why would you want to run
into an out when you've got a three-run homer a batter away?''
LIARS LEAGUE
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche had injured defenseman Adam Foote on the ice
Friday morning, wearing a full face shield to protect his injured
right eye, even though they had said he wouldn't skate in Game 3
Friday night. Of course, we all know by now that NHL actually
stands for National Hockey Liars.
</P>
<P>
   This might be the only sports league in North America where it's
considered A-OK to stand up in front of the media and tell
bald-faced lies about injuries and whether or not a player might
actually play.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, you can't believe anything you're told and only about half
of what you see.
</P>
<P>
   But consider this: the Stars' Darryl Sydor missed two weeks with
what was apparently an injury very similar to Foote's. With this
kind of eye injury _ though the Avs certainly haven't given details
on just what kind of injury Foote has _ the player cannot afford to
get his blood pressure too high without fear of rupturing a blood
vessel in the eye and risking permanent loss of vision.
</P>
<P>
   There's a good chance Foote won't play again in this series.
</P>
<P>
   That means, of course, he'll probably be back Sunday afternoon
for Game 4. In the NHL, it's all about subterfuge, trickery and
misdirection.
</P>
<P>
   And if the media and fans get faked out in the process, too bad.
MAKE GOALIES FAIR GAME
</P>
<P>
   Suggestion to the NHL: Remove the invisible force field from
goaltenders and make them fair game if they stray out of the
crease. That'll cut down on some of the Meryl Streep theatrics we
keep seeing whenever another player so much as looks in their
direction.
</P>
<P>
   It's really simple: Stay in the crease and nobody is allowed to
touch them. Come out of the crease to play the puck _ like the
Stars' Eddie Belfour and Colorado's Patrick Roy like to do _ and
they take their chances with the big boys.
</P>
<P>
   It only seems fair _ goalies wear more armor than a medieval
knight _ but Stars coach Ken Hitchcock says they still need
protection, even out of the crease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in a playoff series where I've lost a goaltender
\Rto injury\S and it's very traumatic,'' Hitchcock said. ``You
count on a guy all season and then he's gone. That's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   No, tough is watching a player sit in the penalty box because he
had the audacity to get within 10 feet of the opposing goalie, who
can skate from corner to corner with total impunity. BET THE TREY
</P>
<P>
   TCU has launched a search for a new sports information director
_ Rick Covington is leaving _ and here's a tip for athletic
director Eric Hyman: Don't forget to look under your nose.
</P>
<P>
   Best man for the job, hands down, is Trey Carmichael, longtime
assistant SID, who worked closely and successfully with football
coach Dennis Franchione last year.
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael knows the local media and understands the
difficulties and nuances of marketing and publicizing the Frogs in
an avid pro sports market like Fort Worth-Dallas, a daunting
challenge for candidates from your basic College Town, USA, where
the local university team is the biggest story in town. WAS GAILEY
INFLEXIBLE?
</P>
<P>
   Peter King might be slightly overstating the case when he says,
in the latest ``Sports Illustrated'', that former Cowboys coach
Chan Gailey skipped quarterbacks meetings because he got tired of
debating play selection with Troy Aikman and Jason Garrett. Gailey
skipped some meetings because of his coaching duties, not because
he was cowed by his contentious quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   What is true is that the biggest private complaint consistently
heard about Gailey from players last season was his inflexibility
regarding play calling and that he rarely, if ever, used any of the
plays suggested by others.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey insisted, when asked about those whispers, that he did
listen to suggestions regarding play calling and sometimes
implemented those plays.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, there's also no question that the cooling of the
Gailey-Aikman relationship played a large part in Jerry Jones'
decision to fire Gailey after last season.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Gailey, while Cowboys coach, never once to my
knowledge offered any criticism of Aikman, either public or
private. On the contrary, he consistently praised him as one of the
league's best quarterbacks. THE CRYING GAME
</P>
<P>
   Trying to get John Wetteland to complain about his lot in life
is next to impossible, but even the Rangers' closer is disgusted
with baseball's gluttony of offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've still got to deal with it so it doesn't matter what I
think,'' Wetteland said. ``You tell me, when there's seven home
runs every game you stinkin' watch, that the game hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't seem like baseball anymore. There's no
question I'm throwing as well as I did last year. But that doesn't
seem to make a difference in anyone's mind either. I still have to
go out there and deal with it every day and it does no good to
whine about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, you think anything's going to change?''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, John. Not a chance.
</P>
<P>
   REVO'S RIMSHOTS
</P>
<P>
   JUST PARK THE CAR
</P>
<P>
   Stars fourth-line forward Blake Sloan went temporarily
unrecognized by a valet parking attendant one day last week. When
the guy suddenly realized who Sloan was, he was apologetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't recognize you at first,'' the guy told Sloan. ``I think
it was because of this Honda you're driving.''
</P>
<P>
   NO BUNNY HOP
</P>
<P>
   TCU's Heisman Trophy candidate LaDainian Tomlinson is back from
the ``Playboy'' All-American Weekend in Phoenix, where he hung
around with the guys who likely will be his major competitors for
the award, including quarterbacks Michael Vick of Virginia Tech and
Drew Brees of Purdue, and running backs Lamont Jordan of Maryland
and Deuce McAllister of Ole Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson took part in a photo shoot, taped the annual TV show
and had a good time but there was one disappointment: No Playboy
Bunnies.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe disappointment is putting it too lightly.
</P>
<P>
   THE ABC'S OF HOCKEY
</P>
<P>
   Devils winger Claude Lemieux was trying to provoke Philly's Eric
Desjardins last week, so he skated over and asked the Flyers'
captain, ``What's that `C' \Ron Desjardins' sweater\S for,
selfish?''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, spelling is not Lemieux's strong point.
</P>
<P>
   THE POWER OF MONEY
</P>
<P>
   Our Dwain Price had the story and the quote of the week when he
broke the news that Don Nelson, who had insisted that he was
retiring, will instead be returning as the Mavs' head coach next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nellie loves money,'' a source told Price, ``and \RMark\S
Cuban has a lot of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bingo.
</P>
<P>
   NOT TONYA, PLEASE
</P>
<P>
   Three days in jail for Tonya Harding for assaulting her
boyfriend with a hubcap?
</P>
<P>
   Don't put her in my cell.
</P>
<P>
   HELP! HELP!
</P>
<P>
   Don Baylor's been begging for help for his beleaguered Cubs'
bullpen, now he's got it.
</P>
<P>
   One problem: I think he meant pitchers, not extra security
guards.
</P>
<P>
   LEADERS APPLY HERE
</P>
<P>
   If, as shortstop Royce Clayton charged on his Web site last
week, a part-time bit player like Chad Curtis has poisoned the
Rangers' clubhouse atmosphere, what exactly does that say about
team leadership? nn

HEY CRITICS: FOCUS ON PERFORMANCES, NOT CLUBHOUSE THEATRICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What I'm coping with this morning is the failure to find a bad
guy. In case of controversy in the jock kingdom, the first rule of
columnizing-made-easy is to take sides. Identify the rat, set your
trap, then crush the neck. Man, that's fun.
</P>
<P>
   Royce Clayton must have thought so. Royce, all that Web-page
anger _ you got a Bobby Knight complex, or what?
</P>
<P>
   How about Chad Curtis? People don't like you, Chad. Starting
with Royce, apparently. Why don't you lighten up just a notch?
</P>
<P>
   And from the Royce-writes-nasty-things-about-Chad scene at the
ballyard the other day, then comes the latest issue of ``Sports
Illustrated,'' with this quote from an unnamed Dallas Cowboys'
player:
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, Troy's got to make some plays to help us win.
Last year, he was at fault as much as anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wooooo.'' Why was there so much ``wooooo'' being heard locally
over that comment?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, fellows, can't we all get along around here?
</P>
<P>
   Who then is the bad guy? Is it Royce? Not from where I sit. But
one piece of advice for Clayton would be stick to shortstop and
leave the wordy rip jobs to us highly skilled professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Is it Curtis? Absolutely not.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman? Not even close.
</P>
<P>
   The guy who said those things about Troy? No, again. Except why
not use your name, buster? What you said was true. Even Aikman
would agree with that. So why hide, unless your name is Nine-Toed,
and you know your credibility around here is lower than an
armadillo's belly.
</P>
<P>
   Among Clayton, Curtis and Aikman, however, I can't find a weasel
in the bunch. They all play the game the way the game is supposed
to be played. And off the field, they act right and do right, for
those of you who consider that an important part of the jock
kingdom process.
</P>
<P>
   So what was it with a certain segment of local fandom sitting in
the left-field seats on Thursday night at The Ballpark in
Arlington? Why were you people riding Chad Curtis' butt over
something Clayton had said on a stupid Web site? Curtis gives you
nothing but effort, and also production, as he fills in admirably
for the injured Rusty Greer. Leave him alone, and he might also
give you an autographed baseball card.
</P>
<P>
   I got mine the other night. ``Here, take my card,'' Curtis said.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it's not exactly a limited-edition Topps. On the back,
Curtis preaches. His religious message is, well, intense.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball word on Chad Curtis is that playing for six teams
in nine seasons has plenty to do with a religious fervor that grows
tiresome. And also with a combative clubhouse nature when it comes
to ``standards.'' His standards.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know enough about the 31-year-old Curtis to judge. From
afar, however, he seems to be a weird little cat. The flattop. The
laser-beam eyes. On the field, what is there not to like? Off the
field, I might not necessarily agree with one thing Curtis stands
for, but again, I like him. He's definitely unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad, you don't seem to want to make friends in here,'' I say
the other night, meaning among his teammates in the Texas Rangers'
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I do. I really do. That's important to me,'' he answered.
``But at the same time, I made the decision long ago that I will
not compromise my beliefs to do so. Some of that has to do with my
religion, some of that with the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pausing, Curtis grinned, and added, ``I'm not a regular
person.''
</P>
<P>
   I understand.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis just spent three seasons with the Yankees, two on world
championship teams. He's the guy I thought went too far at the
World Series in humiliating NBC's Jim Gray over the Pete Rose
thing. His manager, Joe Torre, even said so publicly. But Curtis'
teammates had voted almost unanimously to stiff Gray as a show of
support for Rose. Curtis got the first chance to do so, having hit
a game-winning home run. This was Chad Curtis being the good
teammate. And he took the fall for it.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, I'm watching ``SportsCenter'' one night and see
film of a Yankees-Seattle brawl. Except off to the side, the
Yankees' Derek Jeter is clowning with Seattle's Alex Rodriguez. I'm
thinking Jeter was wrong here. And a teammate would be letting him
know just that.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Curtis did. He had words for a New York favorite.
Criticism of Curtis followed. So did an off-season trade to the
Rangers. But Curtis was right in doing what he did. ``Except I took
the brunt of that one,'' he said, believing he was traded for
confronting Jeter. ``But then again, it's also printed that I told
Derek he should have punched Alex. No way. If anything, I'd have
stepped up and taken a punch aimed for Derek. I admire him that
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis also wants to know why his ``music'' argument with
Clayton in the first week of this season was reported by some as a
``shoving'' incident. ``That never happened,'' he said. ``Why can't
I read somewhere that shoves never happened?''
</P>
<P>
   Hardcore _ that's Curtis. But in Port Charlotte this spring,
I've never heard a more eloquent plea for compassion after former
Yankees' teammate Darryl Strawberry went down on a cocaine count
for the umpteenth time. Curtis obviously felt for this loser.
</P>
<P>
   Like I said _ shut up out there in left field. There are no bad
guys in all this. Strange ones, maybe. But it's still all about how
they play the game. nn

YANKEES CORONATION PREMATURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Going into the season, it was clear that the Yankees were the
team to beat. They were the two-time defending champions, had won
the World Series three of the past four years, and had their star
players and pitching staff back for another run at a title.
</P>
<P>
   On Mother's Day, it became clear that the Yanks can be beaten.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox pushed the mighty Yankees out of first place a week
ago, defeating the Orioles on the same day their American League
East rivals were losing to the Tigers. That knocked the New Yorkers
out of first place for the first time since last June 8.
</P>
<P>
   The New Englanders, naturally, said all the predictable things
about it being too early and all that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means nothing right now,'' Red Sox outfielder Darren
Lewis said. ``Yeah, we're in first place. That's nice for the fans,
and we're excited about that, but it's still May. We've got to go
out and play good baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox history, though, suggests that the standings in the
middle of May are a pretty good precursor of the standings in early
October. In 1995, the season they won their last division title,
they moved into first place for good with a victory against the
Yankees on May 13. And in 1986, the last time they played in the
World Series, the Sox permanently moved into first place May 15.
</P>
<P>
   Of more importance than the history lesson is how the Red Sox
got to the top of the division and how they held the lead going
into the weekend. They did it with outstanding pitching, clutch
hitting and good defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing well,'' Lewis said. ``When you put everything
together _ the pitching, the hitting and the defense _ it usually
turns into good things.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't enough to get the Red Sox into first, however. The
Yankees did their part by being swept in a three-game series by the
lowly Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit pitchers C.J. Nitkowski, Jeff Weaver and Dave Mlicki
took a combined 1-15 record and 6.44 earned-run average into the
series but went 3-0 with a 1.74 ERA. The Yankees hit a collective
.240 (25-for-104), and didn't get an extra-base hit in the final
two games.
</P>
<P>
   That series wasn't an aberration. Scoring runs has been a
seasonlong problem. The Yankees' .265 batting average heading into
the weekend was 12th in the league, as were their 45 homers. They
had scored 175 runs, more than only one team.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem is at the top of the batting order. Chuck
Knoblauch and Derek Jeter had a combined .415 on-base percentage
last season. This year, it was barely over .300.
</P>
<P>
   Even more ominous than the offensive malaise are the rumblings
coming from The Boss, owner George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not seeing some things I'd like to see,'' Steinbrenner
said. ``I'm not happy with the way some of our guys are playing.
I'm not going to get into naming specific people, but they know who
they are. This is a good ballclub. I will be concerned if they
don't start playing better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' struggles are all relative, of course. Virtually
every other team in the league would love to have the Yankees'
problems. They took a 23-14 record into the weekend, second-best in
the AL. Their 3.97 team ERA also was second.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Sox were first in both categories.
</P>
<P>
   Based on their track record and their talent, the Yankees remain
the team to beat. Their coronation, though, doesn't appear as
inevitable as it once did.
RAISE THE MOUND
</P>
<P>
   A committee of general managers is trying to get the pitching
mound raised from its current height of 10 inches, not necessarily
to curb offense but as a way to reduce injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to throw down from a higher slope,'' Pirates GM
Cam Bonifay said. ``It puts less strain on a pitcher's arm, back
and elbow.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonifay doesn't believe the height will return to 15 inches, as
it was until 1969. He thinks 14 inches is a more realistic target.
He is pushing to experiment with the heightened mound in the
Arizona Fall League and in the low minors, but he also believes the
mound can be raised in time for the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have a problem lowering the mound from one year to
the next,'' he said. ``I think it will gain momentum throughout the
year.'' GARNER NOT BACKING DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Tigers manager Phil Garner was a popular man when his club
visited Cleveland for the first time this season. Garner drew a
crowd because of his spring training comments that the Indians
appeared ``vulnerable'' this season.
</P>
<P>
   Garner admitted he was half wrong. The Indians do appear
vulnerable. They've trailed the White Sox for much of the season
and, after finally climbing back into a tie for first, they've had
to put two of their starting pitchers _ Jaret Wright and Charles
Nagy _ on the disable list.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tigers haven't been able to take advantage. They've got
the worst record in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand where I stood when I first said it,'' Garner said. ``I
didn't say they weren't going to win. I just didn't see it being a
runaway like it has been in the past. As it turns out, the crow I'm
eating is about us. I thought we'd be part of the mix, but we just
haven't played as well as I thought we would.'' LAST LAUGH
</P>
<P>
   It was simply a matter of time before the Mets got rid of Bobby
Bonilla and Rickey Henderson after the two went into the clubhouse
to play cards during a loss to the Braves in the playoffs last
season. Bonilla was released in October, and Henderson got the boot
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The two players, though, are laughing all the way to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla was picked up by the Braves and has been a useful
player. Henderson was signed by the Mariners and will get a chance
to be their leadoff hitter and left fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they contribute to their new teams, they will do it
while on the Mets' payroll because they were released and not
traded. The Mets owe Bonilla almost $30 million over the next 25
years and must pay Henderson the remainder of his $1.9 million
salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice little irony because the Mets are footing the
bill,'' Bonilla said. ``This is like a gift. I'm ecstatic now. Hey,
I'm doing the Macarena.'' DEFENDING FRANCONA
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Francona is bearing the brunt of Phillies' fans
wrath because of the team's slow start. The boos grow louder every
time he steps out of the home dugout at Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   However, GM Ed Wade has given no indication that Francona's job
is in jeopardy, and staff ace Curt Schilling supports the manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't kicked a ball, he hasn't failed to get a runner home
from third base with less than two outs, and he hasn't walked
anybody,'' Schilling said. ``Of all the people who should shoulder
the blame for what has happened, he's probably at the bottom of the
list.'' AROUND THE NL
</P>
<P>
   _ Randy Johnson's first loss of the season brought back bad
memories. Johnson and the Diamondbacks fell to the Expos, 2-0,
Tuesday. He lost four consecutive games in '99 when his team was
shut out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Phillies prospect Pat Burrell could make his big-league debut
this week, possibly as soon as Tuesday in Houston. After Rico
Brogna fractured the ulna bone in his left hand, the Phillies
immediately asked Burrell to move from left field back to first
base at Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. He had been moved from
first to left to prepare to take Ron Gant's place, but Brogna's
injury changed the position and the timetable.
</P>
<P>
   _ When Pirates strength and conditioning instructor Dr. Warren
Sipp made his annual appearance in an exhibition game against a
minor-league affiliate Monday, team members bribed Double-A Altoona
pitcher John Rosengren to bean him. Rosengren hit Sipp in the
ankle, and after the game the Pirates collected a $300 bounty.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sterling Hitchcock, the Padres' No. 1 starter, was winless
before defeating the Marlins on Tuesday. The victory marked his
first in 11 starts dating to September.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cubs were 35-72, a .327 winning percentage, after June
last season, a collapse that caused manager Jim Riggleman to be
fired. In their first 42 games under new manager Don Baylor they
went 15-27, a .357 winning percentage.
AROUND THE AL
</P>
<P>
   _ Athletics' first baseman Jason Giambi was hitting .314 with 16
homers and 47 runs batted in through Thursday. He was tied with
Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez for the AL home run lead, and led
the league in RBI. However, he isn't satisfied. ``It's where you
end up that really matters,'' Giambi said. ``It's nice what I'm
doing so far, but you've got to keep getting better. You can't ever
be happy with where you're at. Every day is a grind out there.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Yankees owner George Steinbrenner has yet to publicly blast GM
Brian Cashman or manager Joe Torre, but he has made it clear that
he was in favor of trading for Jim Edmonds. However, Cashman and
Torre wanted to hold onto left fielder Ricky Ledee and reliever
Ramiro Mendoza. Edmonds is hitting .395 with 13 homers and 34 RBI
for the Cardinals, while Ledee is batting .211 with one homer and
nine RBI.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Indians' Alomar brothers hit for the cycle Wednesday.
Sandy had a homer and a triple. Roberto singled and doubled. ``Just
say Alomar hit for the cycle,'' Roberto said. ``Don't say R. Alomar
or S. Alomar. Just say Alomar.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Keith Foulke has replaced Bobby Howry as the White Sox closer.
He won the job by going 1-0 with a 0.70 ERA and five saves in six
chances and holding opponents to a .163 batting average. ``He is
lights out and has been doing that for the last year and a half,''
Howry said. ``The whole bullpen agrees that we're so versatile it
doesn't matter what role we're in. You can mix and match us any way
you want to. That's what makes our bullpen so good.''

NATIVE TEXAN PREPARED TO SWIM WITH THE OLYMPIC SHARKS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   She has survived a family tragedy. She has stayed the course.
She has swum with the sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Who says that the newest athletes of the Olympics, the
triathletes, don't have a little iron in them?
</P>
<P>
   It was less than six years ago that Jennifer Gutierrez, a native
of San Antonio, competed in her first triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're good at this,'' her now-husband, Bob Utberg, announced.
``We've got to get you a bike.''
</P>
<P>
   What started out as a hobby, therefore, soon became Gutierrez's
personal mission _ to stand at the steps of the Sydney Opera House
for the Olympic Games' inaugural triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   She will. She earned her spot on the U.S. team by finishing
seventh in the Sydney World Cup Triathlon last month. The event was
held on the same course _ and in the same shark-visited waters _
where the Olympic triathlon will be staged in September.
</P>
<P>
   Two more women's spots will be at stake Saturday when Irving
hosts the U.S. Olympic team trials in the waters and roads of Las
Colinas. The men's race is scheduled for next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pursued this because it was an Olympic event,'' Gutierrez
said last week during a stopover in Texas. ``I knew it was a
four-year commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   In high school, like a lot of triathletes, she had been a
talented swimmer, good enough to be awarded a college scholarship
to Pepperdine. She earned a master's degree in early childhood
education in 1991 and has been teaching physical education to
handicapped children in the Denver area.
</P>
<P>
   Through the understanding of her school district, Gutierrez was
able to juggle her work schedule when her father, Tiger, was
stricken with cancer. He died last year at age 68.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Gutierrez had been the driving force behind Jennifer's
athletic career. ``The experience showed me that there is so much
more to life than training every day,'' she said. ``Life, I
realized, is full of obstacles.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the sharks. Sydney officials plan to employ divers with
sonar devices to keep the sharks at bay during the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really worried about that,'' Gutierrez said. ``They
tell us that sharks won't attack anyone in packs. But when I was
warming up for the World Cup, I was out on the Olympic course and
realized I was out there by myself. I thought, `Hmm, I don't know
if I should be out here.'''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the week, as they say, went swimmingly. During the
running portion of the Sydney triathlon, Gutierrez overtook Barb
Lindquist and became the first American to finish, earning the
Olympic team spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still hasn't hit me yet,'' Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, she said, the event in Sydney will indoctrinate the
world on the real Olympic triathlon _ not the 10-hour, staggerfest
known as the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our event is geared more toward the everyday person, to be
honest, the people who don't have 10 hours a day to train,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are going to like seeing this.''

HE FELL FROM TOP OF BOXING WORLD, NOW CURRY SEEKS FIGHTING CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ There was a time when the world was Donald
Curry's playground. As undisputed and undefeated welterweight
champion, he was a perfect contradiction: shy and softspoken with a
choirboy's face and good intentions outside the ring, his
lightning-quick fists and punching power fostered bad intentions
inside it.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the admiration of the people in his hometown of Fort
Worth, Curry helped transform Cowtown into Fight Town during the
mid-1980s. Curry's first world title in February 1983 soon was
followed by those won by his older brother, Bruce Curry, Gene ``Mad
Dog'' Hatcher, ``Little'' Stevie Cruz, Troy Dorsey and more
recently, Paulie Ayala.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going to be the best pound-for-pound fighter, the
biggest money-earner, the successor to Sugar Ray Leonard and
Marvelous Marvin Hagler,'' said promoter Bob Arum, who orchestrated
Curry's dizzying trip to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Curry won the World Boxing Association welterweight title in
front of his hometown fans in February 1983 and then unified the
147-pound division when he knocked out World Boxing Council
champion Milton McCrory in the second round in December 1985.
Curry, ``The Lone Star Cobra'' and one-time Texas Golden Gloves
hero, appeared invincible.
</P>
<P>
   But the bright lights of stardom sometimes can blind, and Curry
now confesses he was not prepared to deal with the expectations and
responsibilities that come with being a champion.
</P>
<P>
   At 38, he has returned to Fort Worth from a self-imposed,
three-year exile in Las Vegas. Nearly broke and living at the home
of his mother, Hazel Sample, he is intent upon starting over as a
boxing trainer and re-establishing himself as someone worthy of
trust. Staring into an uncertain future, Curry freely admits to the
foibles of his star-crossed past as a two-time world champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to be whatever people wanted me to be,'' Curry
said in a monotone voice, barely above a whisper. ``Model citizen,
this and that. I tried to be a role model. It was a lot of
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole time I was champion, it wasn't something I enjoyed.
I wasn't being manipulated, I was just ignorant of a lot of things.
A country boy from Fort Worth. It's a fast business, and I trusted
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Donald once told me, `When you're on top ... time flies. It
just blows by you,' '' said publicist Lee Samuels of Top Rank, who
handled most of Curry's national promotions. ``And he said, `When
you're on top, you're never by yourself ... you've got trainers, PR
guys, press conferences all the time.' I think we knew where Donald
was every waking moment. He was a hot guy. When he was on top of
his game, he was unbeatable. He just lost his focus _ like many,
many fighters do.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Curry is focusing on a second career as a trainer. But thus
far, he hasn't had a lot of success. Earlier this year, he
approached Paul Reyes, his longtime trainer, who now works with
Ayala, about starting a boxing team in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Don, I'm too old (61) to start all over again,' ''
said Reyes, who began training Curry when the fighter was 7. ``And
he said he needed people that had money. He had it one time, had
his chance and he blew it. But if he's serious, he could still do
it. He don't need my help. I tried to give him a little pep talk.
He's got the credentials. I told him I wished him the best. He's
still my friend, even though he did me wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry also approached his former business partner Scott Sherman
about rejoining Boxing Management Inc., which manages Ayala, among
other fighters. Sherman also declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked with Donald about four years ago, when he was still
with us, and asked him if he would train some of our fighters,''
Sherman said. ``And he laughed at me. He said he wasn't a trainer.
So when Donald came to me (in January), I figured he wasn't
interested before and didn't see any reason to upset the applecart.
We don't need another trainer.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate irony would be if Curry were reunited with his
former manager David Gorman, who he fired after his first
successful title defense in 1986. Gorman has started over in
boxing, with a gym on the city's North Side. And he said he would
consider doing business with his former protege.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for Don,'' said Gorman, 58. ``I know he needs
some help. I got my feelings hurt over Curry, but I don't hold it
against him.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gorman and Curry were on top, this was not a scenario
either of them would have envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got into this game, you know, one of the things I
did not want to do is what I'm doing now. Start over,'' Curry said.
``I can tell you my fears, and when I made up my mind to turn
professional, what I feared was to do ``this''. And it manifested
itself.'' THE HARD FALL
</P>
<P>
   When he fell, Curry landed with a thud, battered inside and
outside the squared circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was insecure,'' said Curry, who decided Gorman was
ill-equipped to deal with big-time boxing and demoted him in March
1986. ``I was smart enough to be champion, but I wasn't smart
enough to keep my money.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum once projected Curry among Top Rank's top-five all-time
attractions. Of Curry's downfall, Arum said, ``It's just sad. He
was a tremendous disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   By his own accounting, Curry earned an estimated $5 million
between February 1983 and June 1991. Virtually none of that prize
money remains, much of it consumed when Curry fought to clear his
name in a federal drug conspiracy indictment handed down in April
1994. Some of his fortune was squandered through what he sweepingly
describes as ``bad investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry's reign as undisputed welterweight champion started well
enough. He won the unification bout against McCrory on Dec. 6,
1985, succeeding his hero, Sugar Ray Leonard, as king of the
147-pound division.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he knocked out McCrory, Donald Curry did really look like
the genuine article,'' said Nigel Collins, editor of ``The Ring
Magazine.'' ``He looked like he would dominate the welterweights
and maybe move to the middleweights. There were high hopes
throughout the boxing community, not just from Bob Arum.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry was the toast of Fort Worth when he scored a second-round
KO against Eduardo Rodriguez of Panama on March 9, 1986, before a
standing-room-only crowd of 8,864 at Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum.
The first defense of his undisputed title left Curry at 25-0 with
20 knockouts.
</P>
<P>
   But only two days after disposing of Rodriguez, word leaked that
Curry was about to replace Gorman, with whom he had turned pro in
1980, with Akbar Muhammad, who was resigning as executive vice
president of Top Rank, Arum's company.
</P>
<P>
   With his former executive now serving as manager, Arum was
positioning Curry to be the farewell opponent for Hagler, the
undisputed middleweight (160-pound) champion, tentatively planned
for September 1987. But Curry felt that he was being pressured by
Arum to move up in weight and hired attorney Mike Trainer, longtime
adviser to Leonard, who convinced him to remain in the welterweight
division. Infuriated by Curry's decision to remain a welterweight
and Trainer's interference, Arum announced that a potential
Hagler-Curry megabout was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all fell apart when Donald suddenly became this major
business guy, and decided that nobody was going to tell him what to
do,'' Arum said. ``He dumped Gorman and started dumping
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Curry dumped Trainer and welcomed back Muhammad as
his manager.
</P>
<P>
   Curry's camp and career remained in flux until Arum nailed down
the rights to the Curry-Lloyd Honeyghan world title fight for Sept.
27, 1986, in Atlantic City. A listless Curry surrendered his
championship belts when he failed to answer the bell for the
seventh round. Honeyghan, an 8-1 underdog, was credited with a
sixth-round technical knockout.
</P>
<P>
   After the loss, Curry's style and skills began to deteriorate
noticeably.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCallum knocked him out in the fifth round for the WBA
junior middleweight title July 18, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   With Muhammad now clearly in charge as Curry's manager/financial
adviser and Top Rank nominally in his corner, Curry enjoyed a brief
revival, winning the World Boxing Council's super welterweight
title by stopping Gianfranco Rosi of Italy, which led to a title
defense against Frenchman Rene Jacquot in Grenoble, France, in
February 1989. Jacquot was little more than a club fighter, but he
won a 12-round decision that stunned even the French fans and
media. With his interest in boxing waning, Curry suffered an
eighth-round technical knockout loss against Terry Norris, then the
World Boxing Council's 154-pound champion, on June 1, 1991, and
announced his retirement. SETBACKS BECOME REAL-WORLD
</P>
<P>
   In December 1990, while still active and world-ranked, Curry
entered the boxing management field with Fort Worth businessmen
Scott Sherman and Jon Brumley. They founded BMI, with the idea of
forging another championship-caliber stable in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Curry was entrusted with signing amateur prospects and
overseeing their development in the gym. To that end, Curry was
dispatched to the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, on behalf of
BMI. But Curry failed to sign Fort Worth's Sergio Reyes, a
world-rated amateur bantamweight and another graduate of Gorman's
Gym. Later, Curry was fired by BMI for reasons Sherman declined to
specify.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1994, Curry and former Detroit boxers Darrell Chambers
and William ``Stanley'' Longstreet _ friends from their amateur
days _ were named in a federal drug-conspiracy indictment. Curry's
mistake was taking a trip to the Bahamas in September 1992, when
the other men purchased $150,000 of cocaine from undercover U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration agents.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, who swore he ``never, never, ever had anything to do with
drugs,'' was acquitted by a jury in Detroit after an 11-day trial
in January 1995. In a follow-up news conference in Fort Worth,
Curry said the preceding 10-month ordeal had ``destroyed'' him
financially and emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know how I got there in that situation,'' Curry
said. ``There's good and bad in the world, and I wanted to go see
what the bad looked like. For real. A lot of it was being curious.
I was destructive of myself. I can't blame nobody for where I am
today but myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, Curry was sentenced to a six-month jail term in
Dallas for failing to pay child support for a son born to a Dallas
woman in April 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, I know I did wrong,'' said Curry, whose infidelity
prompted his wife, Valerie Cooper, to later file for divorce. She
has custody of their 7-year-old son, Donovan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, I never (got) divorced,'' Curry said. ``I still
have a great love for Valerie. At that time, I didn't know love. I
thought I did, but I didn't know what love was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fooled myself. Fooled a lot of people. Disappointed a lot of
people. Disappointed myself, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Arum said Curry easily could have placed in the top five of Top
Rank's greatest fighters _ an elite list headed by former
heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali _ if he had stayed with Gorman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had dreams of instant gratification,'' Arum said. ``And
ended up with nothing. If he would have stayed on the program, he
would have been one of the greats.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Arum said he is pulling for Curry to make it as a
trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would recommend fighters to him. Sure. I think he would be
good with some fighters. That's the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry said he remains optimistic someone in boxing _ ideally,
someone in the hometown he once ruled as undisputed hero _ will
offer him one more chance to answer the bell. And Curry bristled at
the suggestion that he has gone from perennial title contender to
perennial lost soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you say that I'm lost?'' Curry said. `` `Lost' is
someone who doesn't know what they want to do. I know what I want
to do. I have goals. I feel I have the skills for a trainer _ to go
back and teach boxing _ and to me, that's a piece of cake. When I
finished fighting, yeah, I was `lost' then. Because I didn't know
what I wanted to put my heart into. And I found God. I've found my
God, and that's just everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm past defeat, whether it's financial or athletic. I'm
looking at tradition and legacy. Looking at making tradition and
leaving a legacy.'' nn

seventh round. Honeyghan, an 8-1 underdog, was credited with a
sixth-round technical knockout.
</P>
<P>
   After the loss, Curry's style and skills began to deteriorate
noticeably.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCallum knocked him out in the fifth round for the WBA
junior middleweight title July 18, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   With Muhammad now clearly in charge as Curry's manager/financial
adviser and Top Rank nominally in his corner, Curry enjoyed a brief
revival, winning the World Boxing Council's super welterweight
title by stopping Gianfranco Rosi of Italy, which led to a title
defense against Frenchman Rene Jacquot in Grenoble, France, in
February 1989. Jacquot was little more than a club fighter, but he
won a 12-round decision that stunned even the French fans and
media. With his interest in boxing waning, Curry suffered an
eighth-round technical knockout loss against Terry Norris, then the
World Boxing Council's 154-pound champion, on June 1, 1991, and
announced his retirement. SETBACKS BECOME REAL-WORLD
</P>
<P>
   In December 1990, while still active and world-ranked, Curry
entered the boxing management field with Fort Worth businessmen
Scott Sherman and Jon Brumley. They founded BMI, with the idea of
forging another championship-caliber stable in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Curry was entrusted with signing amateur prospects and
overseeing their development in the gym. To that end, Curry was
dispatched to the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, on behalf of
BMI. But Curry failed to sign Fort Worth's Sergio Reyes, a
world-rated amateur bantamweight and another graduate of Gorman's
Gym. Later, Curry was fired by BMI for reasons Sherman declined to
specify.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1994, Curry and former Detroit boxers Darrell Chambers
and William ``Stanley'' Longstreet _ friends from their amateur
days _ were named in a federal drug-conspiracy indictment. Curry's
mistake was taking a trip to the Bahamas in September 1992, when
the other men purchased $150,000 of cocaine from undercover U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration agents.
</P>
<P>
   Curry, who swore he ``never, never, ever had anything to do with
drugs,'' was acquitted by a jury in Detroit after an 11-day trial
in January 1995. In a follow-up news conference in Fort Worth,
Curry said the preceding 10-month ordeal had ``destroyed'' him
financially and emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know how I got there in that situation,'' Curry
said. ``There's good and bad in the world, and I wanted to go see
what the bad looked like. For real. A lot of it was being curious.
I was destructive of myself. I can't blame nobody for where I am
today but myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, Curry was sentenced to a six-month jail term in
Dallas for failing to pay child support for a son born to a Dallas
woman in April 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, I know I did wrong,'' said Curry, whose infidelity
prompted his wife, Valerie Cooper, to later file for divorce. She
has custody of their 7-year-old son, Donovan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, I never (got) divorced,'' Curry said. ``I still
have a great love for Valerie. At that time, I didn't know love. I
thought I did, but I didn't know what love was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fooled myself. Fooled a lot of people. Disappointed a lot of
people. Disappointed myself, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Arum said Curry easily could have placed in the top five of Top
Rank's greatest fighters _ an elite list headed by former
heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali _ if he had stayed with Gorman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had dreams of instant gratification,'' Arum said. ``And
ended up with nothing. If he would have stayed on the program, he
would have been one of the greats.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Arum said he is pulling for Curry to make it as a
trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would recommend fighters to him. Sure. I think he would be
good with some fighters. That's the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry said he remains optimistic someone in boxing _ ideally,
someone in the hometown he once ruled as undisputed hero _ will
offer him one more chance to answer the bell. And Curry bristled at
the suggestion that he has gone from perennial title contender to
perennial lost soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you say that I'm lost?'' Curry said. `` `Lost' is
someone who doesn't know what they want to do. I know what I want
to do. I have goals. I feel I have the skills for a trainer _ to go
back and teach boxing _ and to me, that's a piece of cake. When I
finished fighting, yeah, I was `lost' then. Because I didn't know
what I wanted to put my heart into. And I found God. I've found my
God, and that's just everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm past defeat, whether it's financial or athletic. I'm
looking at tradition and legacy. Looking at making tradition and
leaving a legacy.'' nn

VAUGHN LEADS ANGELS PAST ROYALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ High fever. Severe headaches. Dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the symptoms that kept reliever Mark Petkovsek out of
uniform Saturday night, but it's a pretty accurate diagnosis for
the Angels entire pitching staff right now. Everyone's either sick
or tired --- or both.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, thanks to a two homers by Mo Vaughn and a four-run
seventh, rallied to beat Kansas City, 9-8, before 30,689, but just
how long can their hitting cure all that ails them?
</P>
<P>
   In addition Vaughn's two homers and a pair of big hits by Scott
Speizio and Bengie Molina, the Angels needed seven pitchers and 3
3/4 hours to get away with a win, which was secured when Vaughn dug
out Troy Glaus' poor throw for the final out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven pitchers,'' sighed Angels manager Mike Scioscia after a
game in which the lead changed hands six times. ``I don't know if
there's anyone else I could have used?''
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of guys he could use --- all he has to do is look
at the disabled list, which includes Ken Hill, Kent Mercker, Tim
Belcher and Jason Dickson. Or at Edmonton, where Ramon Ortiz and
Lou Pote are because they failed to deliver on the promise they
showed in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Petkovsek, who isn't expected to be available
today either, sidelined with what team officials described as
``viral syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   It's apparently nothing like the fever Vaughn has. His homers
--- both two-run shots --- were his 14th and 15th of the season. In
the 11-game homestand, the big first baseman is batting .391 with
eight homers and 17 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's done it in clutch situations,'' said Spiezio, who hit
a solo homer, drove in the game-tying run with a two-out, broken
bat single and then raced home on Molina's bloop double that
ricocheted off the knee of diving right fielder David McCarty.
</P>
<P>
   Molina also contributed a big two-out, two-strike hit in the
fourth, when he pulled a breaking ball into left field to score two
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the mound, the Angels turned to long reliever Al
Levine, who made the second start of his five-year major league
career. After throwing 53 pitches in the first two innings, he
settled down before leaving in the fifth, trailing 4-3 and having
thrown 81 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   He was followed by a parade of relievers: Mike Fyhrie, Mike
Holtz, Eric Weaver, Shigetoshi Hasegawa, Brett Hinchliffe and
finally Percival, who earned his 11th save. The only arm left in
the bullpen belonged to little-used Derrick Turnbow.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals managed 12 hits, but they rarely came through in the
clutch, leaving 13 runners on base, most of them early.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa, who gave up a three-run double to Mike Sweeney that
gave Kansas City an 8-5 lead in the top of the seventh, has thrown
49 pitches over the past two nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was OK,'' he said. ``But if I'm a little tired I've got
to talk to the coaches. Everybody's a human. You can't pitch every
day. Sometimes you need a day off.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiezio says there's no added burden on the offense while the
pitchers are so tattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were healthy, we'd still have the same attitude,''
Spiezio said. ``You can turn it on and off like a switch. If the
pitchers hold them to no runs and we score eight, that's great. If
they don't and we still win, that's great, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said it's incumbent on the three usual starters ---
Kent Bottenfield today, Scott Schoeneweis and Jarrod Washburn to
work deeper into games, certainly into the seventh and hopefully
into the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, the starters have to do that,'' Scioscia said. ``And
these guys will.''

   NATIONAL _ James Truchard was reading at home one night last
winter when a TV news program in the background caught his
attention. A device developed at MIT was being used to enable
paralysis victims to use thought to move their arms. Though the
program didn't mention it, Truchard immediately realized that
National Instruments' technology was part of the MIT device. But
the company founded by three UT grads in the 1970s will make sure
its carefully selected job recruits hear about the technology,
because making a contribution is one of the lures it employees to
hire and retain young engineers and others. Little known even in
Austin, National Instruments has built a reputation of innovation
among scientists around the world. But the company's carefully
managed growth and stability is being challenged by the Internet,
and Wall Street would be happier if it grew faster. (Mahoney,

 &HT;    How casual is casual?
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's that time of year again.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures are rising, and if your company hasn't already done
so, it may soon relax the dress code around the office.
</P>
<P>
   Some 42 percent of the 750 corporate benefits executives
surveyed last year by the Society for Human Resource Management
said their companies allowed casual dress every day, compared with
36 percent in 1998. Fifty-one percent of corporations employing
more than 5,000 workers allow casual attire during the five-day
work week, the society found.
</P>
<P>
   But how casual is casual is the key question you must ask to
avoid being a workplace fashion ``don't.''
</P>
<P>
   While the precise definition of business casual may vary from
company to company, corporate image consultants can easily rattle
off a list of fashion offenses in most any corporate environment,
including tank tops, flip-flops and ripped jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Any of those items may seem right for summertime fun, and that
is how they should be worn: For fun, not business, sales consultant
Myra McElhaney says.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that happens in the summer is that people tend to
want to dress in summer fashion,'' McElhaney explains. ``The cute
capri pants and the halter tops are not acceptable for business in
most companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Many times, the business casual uniform for men is what
McElhaney describes as your basic golf attire _ khakis and a golf
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``With men, it seems to be a little bit easier because women
have so many more fashion choices. There's more room for error,''
McElhaney says.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeveless blouses, sandals and bare legs are options in women's
attire that are debatable in the workplace, McElhaney says. Again,
there is no one standard that covers all industries and all job
levels. For her part, ``I would never consider myself
professionally dressed without hose if I were wearing a dress,''
McElhaney offers.
</P>
<P>
   McElhaney stresses an important rule of thumb: ``The first rule
to remember is that business is the first word in `business
casual.' '' McElhaney says. ``Secondly, it depends on what your
industry is, as well as what your job is, as to what is acceptable
for you'' to wear to work.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it comes to business casual, bankers and folks who
work in finance industry, for example, typically have a more
restrictive dress code than, say, a dot-com firm. Yet, ``for the
majority of companies, capri pants and even sleeveless tops are not
acceptable,'' McElhaney warns.
</P>
<P>
   That's because image is often at the heart of the dressing-down
trend, says Lisa Secherrer Dugan, vice president, The Professional
Image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies feel like some of their clients have gone to
business casual,'' Dugan says, so they, too, dress down ``to mirror
and match that (client) behavior so that they don't feel
overdressed when they work with them.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the bottom line to corporate dressing is, casual or
otherwise, image and impressions, according to Dugan. ``It all goes
back to how you want to be perceived,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to evaluating your competency, Dugan cites what
she calls an age-old rule: 67 percent of perceptions about us is
accurate, and 55 to 80 percent of what is believed about us is
visual, not verbal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about communication,'' she says. ``What do you want to
say about yourself and your business?''
</P>
<P>
   The best place to begin evaluating the fashion statement you're
making is to have a quick conversation with yourself before you get
dressed, Dugan says. Ask yourself, Who am I going to see today?
What do I want to project about myself? What's going to be the
best, image-wise?
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be a conscientious decision,'' Dugan says.
</P>
<P>
   Further, if your company has guidelines for appropriate work
attire, consult them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies do have a formal dress code that will be
issued to employees when they're hired,'' McElhaney says.
</P>
<P>
   And though ``many companies have gotten away from that as they
move to business casual,'' McElhaney points out, ``several of the
clients I have worked with have found a lot of things were being
worn (to work) that were not appropriate, so they came back and
issued a business casual dress code,'' McElhaney says.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a manager, and you don't like what you're seeing, it
may be time for you to draw up some directions for business casual
dressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for companies to give guidelines to their
employees,'' Dugan says. ``Some companies do put out some sort of,
`This is what we don't want to see' (lists). Clearly it's difficult
for them to identify this is what you have to wear.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of written guidance, ``A lot of times the way
(business casual dress codes) gets established in companies is by
just word of mouth through the human resources department or
management levels,'' Dugan says.

McElhaney says.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeveless blouses, sandals and bare legs are options in women's
attire that are debatable in the workplace, McElhaney says. Again,
there is no one standard that covers all industries and all job
levels. For her part, ``I would never consider myself
professionally dressed without hose if I were wearing a dress,''
McElhaney offers.
</P>
<P>
   McElhaney stresses an important rule of thumb: ``The first rule
to remember is that business is the first word in `business
casual.' '' McElhaney says. ``Secondly, it depends on what your
industry is, as well as what your job is, as to what is acceptable
for you'' to wear to work.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it comes to business casual, bankers and folks who
work in finance industry, for example, typically have a more
restrictive dress code than, say, a dot-com firm. Yet, ``for the
majority of companies, capri pants and even sleeveless tops are not
acceptable,'' McElhaney warns.
</P>
<P>
   That's because image is often at the heart of the dressing-down
trend, says Lisa Secherrer Dugan, vice president, The Professional
Image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies feel like some of their clients have gone to
business casual,'' Dugan says, so they, too, dress down ``to mirror
and match that (client) behavior so that they don't feel
overdressed when they work with them.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the bottom line to corporate dressing is, casual or
otherwise, image and impressions, according to Dugan. ``It all goes
back to how you want to be perceived,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to evaluating your competency, Dugan cites what
she calls an age-old rule: 67 percent of perceptions about us is
accurate, and 55 to 80 percent of what is believed about us is
visual, not verbal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about communication,'' she says. ``What do you want to
say about yourself and your business?''
</P>
<P>
   The best place to begin evaluating the fashion statement you're
making is to have a quick conversation with yourself before you get
dressed, Dugan says. Ask yourself, Who am I going to see today?
What do I want to project about myself? What's going to be the
best, image-wise?
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be a conscientious decision,'' Dugan says.
</P>
<P>
   Further, if your company has guidelines for appropriate work
attire, consult them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies do have a formal dress code that will be
issued to employees when they're hired,'' McElhaney says.
</P>
<P>
   And though ``many companies have gotten away from that as they
move to business casual,'' McElhaney points out, ``several of the
clients I have worked with have found a lot of things were being
worn (to work) that were not appropriate, so they came back and
issued a business casual dress code,'' McElhaney says.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a manager, and you don't like what you're seeing, it
may be time for you to draw up some directions for business casual
dressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for companies to give guidelines to their
employees,'' Dugan says. ``Some companies do put out some sort of,
`This is what we don't want to see' (lists). Clearly it's difficult
for them to identify this is what you have to wear.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of written guidance, ``A lot of times the way
(business casual dress codes) gets established in companies is by
just word of mouth through the human resources department or
management levels,'' Dugan says.

 &HT;    Forester faces tough choices about Chattahoochee
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Regional U.S. Forester Elizabeth Estill manages 13
million acres of our land and a rainforest in Puerto Rico, but the
biggest test of her leadership may be over the Chattahoochee
National Forest in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Estill became the first woman in the forest service's
95-year history to be appointed to a job that was officially
limited to ``able bodied men'' until after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to being named head of the Southern region in 1997, she
served the Rocky Mountain region where there were three acres of
federally owned forest for every person. ``Here, there are seven
people for every acre, which makes our public lands even more
precious,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question about Estill's acceptance in a man's world,
but there's still uncertainty about whether her policy decisions
will differ from the men she succeeded. She faces two such
decisions that will test her public pronouncements about the need
to emphasize recreational uses of the forest over extraction and
logging uses.
</P>
<P>
   First, she will decide how much additional wilderness there will
be in the Chattahoochee and the other 13 Southern forests she
manages. Then she must decide whether Chattahoochee National Forest
officials will be allowed to weaken environmental impact studies
affecting their forest. Southern Environmental Law Center lawyers
have asked Estill not to allow that.
</P>
<P>
   The larger question, according to George Gay, Southeast director
of the National Wilderness Society, is whether Estill will
implement the vision of U.S. Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck,
which is more preservation oriented than that of any chief in
history.
</P>
<P>
   Estill has admirers, both inside and outside the forest service.
David Waller, director of the state Wildlife Division, says Estill
listens and considers state concerns. And she receives high marks
for helping other women move up within the male-dominated agency.
(There are two other female regional foresters, one of whom is
Estill's protege.)
</P>
<P>
   It's clear the 52-year-old forester loves her job and loves the
outdoors. As a child, she preferred toads to dolls. She had pet
kangaroo rats, monkeys and snakes. Her first ecology lessons were
at her father's knee, learning to tell poisonous snakes from
harmless ones. She once kept in her backyard what the Washington
Zoo declared to be the largest known green snake. ``I had to feed
him worms by hand,'' she says gleefully, as if wishing to run out
and do it all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Estill's father was with the FBI, so she lived all over the
country. Her mother was a traditional Southerner from Chattanooga
with a home economics degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother was always asking what I was doing in the woods with
all of those men,'' she recalls with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   As the forest service enters the last phase of a six-year
planning process, the issue is what will happen to the people's
woods over the next decade. Three constituencies are locked in
battle over the uses of the Chattahoochee National Forest:
environmentalists who want more wilderness; loggers and some
hunters who don't (hunting is allowed in wilderness areas but
motorized vehicles aren't), and state wildlife officials who oppose
more wilderness because they don't want to give up leases where
they have feeding areas to attract game. The state agency receives
some of its money from hunting licenses and gun sales.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Estill has avoided making any of the groups angry, but
that can't last. She went along with the tentative designation of
two noncontroversial wilderness areas for the Chattahoochee. But
according to Gay of the Wilderness Society, when a coalition of
environmental organizations asked Estill to designate an additional
15,000 acres, she put the burden on the environmentalists to make
the argument for adding them _ claiming that was the fair middle
ground.
</P>
<P>
   All Estill is saying for now about the hot seat she's in is
nobody ever said public service was easy.

<P>
   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   (Coded i)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CHINA (Washington) _ For seven years now, very little
has gone as planned in Bill Clinton's effort to shape a new
relationship with China. The problem has not been lack of vision;
it has been one of execution. The Chinese have hardly cooperated,
jailing more dissidents even as Clinton argued that economic
freedom would eventually produce political freedom. Nor has there
been much help from the president's fellow Democrats, most of whom
have fought his trade and China policies at every turn. And Clinton
himself tells close colleagues he has let political calculations
lead him into major mistakes in dealing with China. By David E.
Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   LABOR-CHINA (Undated) _ In lobbying House Democrats to vote
against the China trade bill, the nation's labor leaders are
warning of political perils for the Democrats if the bill passes.
In blunt terms, they are warning that Vice President Al Gore and
other Democratic candidates are likely to fare worse in the
November elections if the China trade bill is approved because that
will make union members so angry. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN-CHINA (Taipei, Taiwan) _ The day after hinting at new
flexibility in dealing with Taiwan and its new president, Beijing
hastened to restate that its ``one-China'' principle is an absolute
precondition of progress. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   NUCLEAR-ARMS (Undated) _ It took decades of international
pressure and weeks of intense negotiations, but when a month-long
conference of more than 185 nations ended at the United Nations
this weekend, the five original atomic powers had agreed for the
first time to the ``unequivocal'' elimination of nuclear arms. By
Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   ETHIOPIA-ERITREA (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia) _ Developments in the
fighting on the Horn of Africa. By Ian Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ETHIOPIA-ERITREA-U.S. (Washington) _ President Clinton and a
trio of his aides took a special interest in trying to head off one
of the continent's biggest and costliest wars. But the
behind-the-scenes courting of the Ethiopian prime minister, Meles
Zenawi, and the Eritrean president, Isaias Afewerki, ended in
tatters 10 days ago when Ethiopia rolled into Eritrea with tanks
and artillery and launched trench warfare reminiscent of World War
I. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS (Jerusalem) _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak
ordered Israeli negotiators to cut short peace talks with
Palestinians in Sweden because of a surge of violence in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   HAITI-ELECTION (Port-au-Prince, Haiti) _ Braving threats of
violence, Haitians lined up outside polling stations in a vote that
will restore a democratic government and in the process free a
half-billion dollars in desperately needed foreign aid. By David
Gonzalez.

   COLLEGE-CLOSING (Haverhill, Mass.) _ Bradford College, a small
liberal arts school that had been struggling to find a niche since
it became a four-year, coeducational institution a generation ago,
died Sunday after a bittersweet commencement ceremony that drew
hundreds of alumni from around the country. It was 197 years old.
By Jodi Wilgoren.
</P>
<P>
   ASTHMA-TRACKING (Undated) _ As the number of asthma cases in the
United States rises sharply and researchers scramble to find the
cause, newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention shows that a majority of states have no system to track
the number of people with asthma or monitor what happens to them,
and only a few states have any recent reports on the illness in
their jurisdictions. By Philip J. Hilts.

   GORE-BIO (Undated) _ Part 1: A Boyhood Divided. Even the rawest
and most intimate moments in Al Gore's life are now widely seen as
mere theatrics, all part of a presidential campaign strategy
designed by his ambitious, up-from-nothing parents, Albert and
Pauline LaFon Gore, before he was born, and even unto death. A
special report. (Articles in this series will examine the lives of
the presidential candidates as the campaign progresses.) By Melinda
Henneberger.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-DAD (Undated) _ Born poor in the remote settlement of
Possum Hollow, Tenn., Albert Arnold Gore lived through the worst of
the Depression and spent seven years working his way through
college. He always said he ran for office because as a kid he had
seen the picture of a cousin who was running for the state
Legislature on a utility pole and liked the idea of seeing his own
face up there. But he was also moved by ideas, and was a committed
free trader and New Dealer who believed that, as he said, ``nothing
cures poverty like money.'' By Melinda Henneberger.

immediate acclaim as a photographer. In what was already a much
photographed city, he created iconic images of nighttime Paris that
redefined how it was seen, almost as if darkness were its natural

   ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS (Jerusalem) _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak
ordered Israeli negotiators to cut short peace talks with
Palestinians in Sweden because of a surge of violence in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CHINA (Washington) _ For seven years now, very little
has gone as planned in Bill Clinton's effort to shape a new
relationship with China. The problem has not been lack of vision;
it has been one of execution. The Chinese have hardly cooperated,
jailing more dissidents even as Clinton argued that economic
freedom would eventually produce political freedom. Nor has there
been much help from the president's fellow Democrats, most of whom
have fought his trade and China policies at every turn. And Clinton
himself tells close colleagues he has let political calculations
lead him into major mistakes in dealing with China. By David E.
Sanger.

   AP-KOREA-MEDIA (Undated) _ On Sept. 29, 1999, The Associated
Press provided extensive evidence that GIs killed a helpless group
of civilians in the early days of the Korean War. Since then, its

became a media personality in its own right. It has been praised.
It has been followed. It has been honored with journalism's top
prizes. More recently, it has been pilloried. Some wonder if AP
deserved a Pulitzer for the story? A look at the criticism and the
defense. (News Analysis.) By Felicity Barringer.

 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mary Higgins Clark, the blockbuster mystery writer
who lives in a mansion in Saddle River, N.J., and a Manhattan
apartment with commanding views of Central Park, grew up in the
Bronx, off Pelham Parkway. Her father owned a bar, called Higgins
Bar and Grille, and he died suddenly one Sunday morning while she
was at church.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, my mother had a total of $2,000 and three kids,''
Clark said in a recent interview in her pied-a-terre on Central
Park South, an emerald the size of a Chiclet on the third finger of
her left hand and an oil portrait of herself in rich pastels on the
wall behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's mother, to make ends meet, rented out rooms. ``She put
up a sign that said, `Furnished rooms, kitchen privileges,''' Clark
said. ``But the neighbors thought the second phrase brought down
the tone of the neighborhood, so they asked my mother to cut it off
the sign. So she did. She was terribly enterprising.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clark, 72, has not lost the Bronx-Irish lilt to her voice
or her love of Irish jokes (A favorite: ``You know how an Irishman
proposes? `Nora, would you care to be buried with my mother?'''),
she has come a long way from those early Bronx days. Her latest
contract with Simon &AMP; Schuster, announced last month, is believed
to be a record-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   At five books for a total advance of $64 million, the contract
made her the highest-paid female author in the world, per book,
according to most industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the numbers, Clark is in some ways an intriguing
experiment for Simon &AMP; Schuster. Though the publishing house, a
unit of Viacom, says the author's possible appeal in the digital
world was not a factor in the negotiations, the company this week
will release the electronic version of ``Before I Say Good-Bye'' _
her newest best seller _ and nine of her other books in electronic
versions that will be available for laptops and desktop computers,
electronic reading devices and personal digital assistants.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear if the mass market will find e-books
approachable. But Clark is a proven weapon. Her 22 hardcover books
_ usually critically unacclaimed mysteries that feature heroines
through whom housewives around the world can live out fears and
fantasies _ have all been best sellers. Her first suspense novel,
``Where Are the Children?'' published in 1975, has gone into 70
printings and has sold too many millions of copies for her agent or
publisher to estimate. By 2005, Clark will have received $160
million from Simon &AMP; Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Romanos, president and chief operating officer of Simon &AMP;
Schuster, said that as mass-market paperback sales atrophy across
the industry, one way to reconnect with readers may be to make a
mass-market author like Clark available in electronic formats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, No. 1, if you ask anybody our goal in the next few
years, it is going to be to intelligently guide the predominantly
print-oriented consumer publishing company into the electronic,
digital publishing world that's around the corner,'' Romanos said.
``The potential for the digital future still comes back to words.
The book may have just been a container. And we may now have to try
to reach readers on a screen, not in a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of mass-market paperbacks _ a medium in which the entire
Clark canon has traditionally been available _ are suffering across
the industry, which is struggling to reconcile its musty,
old-fashioned medium with the copyright and distribution issues of
the electronic and digital era.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core audience for the mass-market paperback is shrinking,
and that is something we have to think about every day,'' Romanos
said. ``The baby boomers, the `paperback in your back pocket'
people of the 1960s and 1970s, are now older and more affluent and
are buying hardcovers and walking around with reading glasses in
their back pockets. And that is coupled with the fact that we are
losing ground to the electronic media, which young people are
turning to for their leisure time.''
</P>
<P>
   And Simon &AMP; Schuster itself is also in a state of transition. In
1998, Viacom sold the publishing house's highly profitable textbook
and reference division to Pearson for $4.6 billion. And over the
coming year, the remaining part of Simon &AMP; Schuster, its trade-book
division, will be absorbed into the larger corporate structure of
the merged Viacom and CBS and will become an even smaller slice of
the corporate pie.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The new contract gives Clark advances of $15 million each for
four mysteries, and $4 million for a memoir, which is to be
published in 2001 and which she has tentatively titled ``Kitchen
Privileges'' in homage to her mother. (Her last deal, in 1996, was
for three books at $36 million, or $12 million each.)
</P>
<P>
   Her editor, Michael Korda, and her agent, Eugene Winick of
McIntosh &AMP; Otis, both said that Clark made money for Simon &AMP;
Schuster above and beyond what it paid her. But other editors and
executives at Simon &AMP; Schuster said she was considered more of a
break-even author whose best sellers help ease the rest of the
Simon &AMP; Schuster list into bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Each of Clark's books sells about 700,000 hardcover copies,
which retail for $29 and on which she earns as much as a 15 percent
royalty, and about 1.5 million paperbacks at $7.99 with a 10
percent royalty.
</P>
<P>
   Because publishers do not release sales figures, it is
impossible to gauge how much she contributes to Simon &AMP; Schuster's
bottom line. One factor that adds to Clark's value is what is, to
some, her mystifying popularity overseas: she is, for example, the
best-selling fiction author in France, where the paperback rights
to her books regularly sell for more than 3 million francs (about
$420,000), said a foreign publishing scout based in New York who is
acquainted with her French contracts. Simon &AMP; Schuster retains
world rights to her novels, and sells foreign rights in individual
countries like the Netherlands, Italy, Britain and Germany,
countries where she is also very popular.
</P>
<P>
   John Baker, the editorial director of Publishers Weekly, the
trade journal, compared her books' popularity with foreign readers
to Sylvester Stallone movies that fare poorly in the United States
but generate substantial income in foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``For authors who are enormously successful but generally
critically spurned, as I am afraid poor Mary tends to be, there is
a lot of money to be made overseas,'' Baker said. ``I mean, they
name streets after her in France. It's a sort of Jerry Lewis
syndrome, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark's new books also can spur sales of her backlisted books
around Mother's Day each year, when her novels are published.
Unlike some other blockbuster authors like Patricia Cornwell, for
example, who have switched publishing houses during their careers _
all her books are under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   The one area in which Clark makes very little money, compared to
blockbuster authors like John Grisham or Stephen King, is in movies
or television.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said Clark's books are neither violent enough nor sexy
enough for Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her audience is romance readers who want a little suspense
thrown in,'' he said. ``They are not teenaged boys, which seems to
be the Hollywood market these days.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, given the vagaries, opportunities and threat
of the digital world, a traditional publishing company may be happy
to know that at least one of its blockbuster authors will be
sticking around for at least another half-decade.
</P>
<P>
   David Gernert, the agent and editor for Grisham, who is
published by Doubleday, said: ``In five years, a Clancy or a King
or a Grisham could walk up and say to their traditional publisher,
`I'm going to publish my own books on the Web and I'm going to
charge $20 a copy and of that $20 I will take home $18.' Well,
that's a little different from the model that book publishers are
offering. There's nothing like a long-term contract, because the
future is a little uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   There is usually little left to uncertainty in a typical Clark
book. They usually follow a sleuthing protagonist _ always a
self-made woman with a career that lends itself to investigation,
like an attorney, television producer or reporter _ as a mystery,
such as a murder, a kidnapping or a bomb investigation, unfolds
around her.
</P>
<P>
   There is a symmetry between her plots and her own self-made
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is in each book a heroine, and there are certain
similarities to what we know about Mary,'' said Korda.
</P>
<P>
   After attending secretarial school, Clark worked as a secretary
and then as a Pan Am stewardess before marrying a childhood
neighbor, Warren Clark.
</P>
<P>
   She sold her first short story when she was 29, but interrupted
her writing to raise her children. Her husband _ who had a heart
condition that made him uninsurable _ died when Clark was 37,
leaving her with five children. She went to work writing radio
scripts to support the family, and rose at 5 a.m. every day to work
on a novel. (She remarried several years ago.)
</P>
<P>
   She sold her first suspense novel in 1975 for $3,000. For her
second in 1977, she got more than $1 million for all the rights,
and the first thing she did was buy a Cadillac to replace an
Oldsmobile with 146,000 miles on the odometer. Clark returned to
school and graduated from Fordham University in 1979. The
university gave her an honorary doctorate in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said the secret to her novels was that she explored the
fears of regular women, and used her heroines to reconcile those
fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``My people are never looking for trouble,'' she said. ``The
example I use is this: a young woman is in a see-through blouse and
a black leather miniskirt and walks along Ninth Avenue at three in
the morning. Something happens to her, You say, `My goodness, that
is terrible.'
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, if you take the same young woman, and she's
in her home, and she looks at her watch and says, `Oh gosh, it's
time to pick up the baby from Mother's,' and she gets in the car
and at the end of the driveway, from the floor of the back seat
someone says, `Don't turn right, dear. Turn left,' then she is your
sister or your daughter and you become emotionally involved in it.
I write about nice people whose lives are in danger.''

 &HT;    BARAK RECALLS NEGOTIATORS AFTER RIOTS; LAUNCHES ATTACKS IN
LEBANON

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After a week of riots and the severe burning of a
2-year-old Israeli girl in a firebomb attack, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak Sunday called back negotiators from peace talks
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian rioting appeared to be tailing off Sunday as
Palestinian police restrained protesters. But, Barak delayed a
scheduled land hand-over to the Palestinian National Authority and
closed the West Bank to travel by Israelis and tourists _ a warning
blow to the Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Israel also announced that its air force
struck at a Syrian-allied Palestinian group in southern Lebanon.
That was apparently a signal that Barak demands a peaceful northern
border after he removes his troops from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has promised to remove troops from Lebanon by July 7, but
with the increased fighting he is under pressure to do so sooner.
The Israeli-paid South Lebanon Army reportedly abandoned three
outposts near the Israeli border Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   To tend to the matters Barak, who serves as his own defense
minister, also cancelled a trip to Washington, where he was
supposed to meet with President Clinton to discuss the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   The moves came after a bloody week that saw Israel confronting
violence on two fronts in Arab territories that it occupies _ the
West Bank and southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has occupied most of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
since capturing them in the 1967 Middle East war. It is withdrawing
from them slowly under terms of the Oslo peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Israel has occupied southern Lebanon since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   For several days in a row, Palestinians have marched in protest
of the continued detention by Israel of about 1,650 prisoners.
Though many attacked Israeli civilians, Palestinians consider them
prisoners of war and say they should be released in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   The marches frequently turned into riots against Israeli
soldiers and, on several occasions, erupted into gunfights between
Israeli soldiers and the Palestinian police they are supposed to be
working with in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   About six Palestinians were killed and hundreds injured,
including a 16-year-old boy who reportedly died Sunday from wounds
suffered last week.
</P>
<P>
   Several Israeli troops had also been injured, including one
soldier shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Palestinians hurled firebombs at dozens of
Israeli cars traveling in the West Bank, home to more than 190,000
Israeli settlers amid more than 1.5 million Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   One firebomb hit an Israeli car near Jericho, critically burning
the 2-year-old girl who, relatives said, was trapped in her car
seat.
</P>
<P>
   That was when Barak put the peace process on hold.

</P>
<P>
   After meeting with members of his cabinet Sunday morning, Barak
announced he was closing the West Bank to travel by Israelis or
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The closure, an unusual move, could be meant to put a scare into
the Palestinian economy. Palestinian Bethlehem depends on tourist
dollars and Jericho's Oasis Casino, owned in part by the
Palestinian Authority, makes millions of dollars a month off
Israeli gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Barak demanded that the Palestinians, led by President Yasser
Arafat, control the riots and investigate the police who fired on
Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   He also called back the two Israeli officials who were meeting
with Palestinian negotiators in peace talks in Sweden. The talks
were meant to help draft a framework for resolving all the
remaining issues between the two sides.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators have already missed a self-imposed deadline last
week. Barak had planned to hand over three small Arab villages near
Jerusalem Sunday to ease growing Palestinian frustration. That was
delayed.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, Barak was responding to stepped up attacks against
Israeli troops, and their allied Lebanese militia, by the Hezbollah
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   While Israel has been pulling out of its hilltop forts in
Lebanon, handing them over to the Israeli-paid and trained South
Lebanon Army, Hezbollah has been attacking with mortars and
rockets.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to attacking Hezbollah, Israeli planes this weekend
destroyed 10 tanks that belonged to a Palestinian group allied with
Syria. Syria largely controls Lebanon and Israelis fear it could
encourage attacks over the border
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Barak's office said the attacks were meant to
show Israel's ``future retaliatory ability against whoever might
attack it.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli papers reported that the Palestinian group might have
supplied a tank to Hezbollah and Israel meant to warn Syria not to
supply weapons to Hezbollah.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last thing Al Gore's father told him, a few days before he
died, and just before he lost the ability to speak, was: ``Son,
always do right. Always do right.'' His father, the senator, felt
he had himself done right a lot of the time, and he reliably kept
after his son to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   After the vice president talked about that last conversation,
though, in a eulogy he had worked on without sleeping for two
nights straight, even some friends wondered whether his father had
tacked on a Hollywood ending, scripting his goodbyes at least in
part for the benefit of the papers, and maybe the history books.
This time, nobody came right out and accused Gore himself of
tweaking the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Even the rawest and most intimate moments in his life are now
widely seen as mere theatrics, all part of a presidential campaign
strategy designed by his ambitious, up-from-nothing parents, Albert
and Pauline LaFon Gore, before he was born, and even unto death.
</P>
<P>
   That perception has clearly become a political problem for the
vice president. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas regularly suggests
that Gore is a natural-born phony, and the vice president's every
remark is now fact-checked so scrupulously that when he recently
said he had once dreamed of becoming a teacher, reporters wondered
if he could prove it.
</P>
<P>
   The questions are about more than Gore's claims about the
Internet and ``Love Story.'' What in his life was scripted and what
was real? Could even he know the difference? Where did his parents'
hopes end and his own begin? And do you only get credit for hosing
out hog parlors if you did it without an agenda?
</P>
<P>
   But in separating the facts from the fanciful in Gore's life,
perhaps the most striking discovery is the extent to which the
material that is the most widely doubted is also the most
demonstrably true: Al Gore did do a lot of his growing up in
Tennessee. He did work hard on the farm there _ so hard, in fact,
that the hired help felt sorry for him, and thought his father
should ease up.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, some of what is generally assumed about Gore's
life is not true: He did not, for example, live in luxury back in
Washington during the school year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's parents were both famously frugal, and they were not well
off until after their son was grown and after the senator's
political career had ended. Though they sent their children to
exclusive schools and provided social necessities like ballroom
dancing lessons for their son, they also dressed him in a cousin's
hand-me-downs and lived in a hotel because it was owned by a
relative who gave them a break on the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Some summers, the Gores had to pack up their four-room suite and
put their belongings in storage so the place could be sublet while
they were in Tennessee. And Al shared a bedroom with his sister,
Nancy, who was 10 years older, both before and after her college
years.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason that the contours of Gore's unusual
upbringing are not better known, however, is that he himself has
worked so hard to discredit a lot of authentic stories about his
childhood _ the very stories, in fact, that would probably do him
the most good politically. The problem, for him, are the scenes
from the past that portray Gore sympathetically at the expense of
his hard-driving parents. They suggest an emotionally neglected boy
forced to bear the weight of enormous adult expectations, and Gore,
who is fiercely protective of his 87-year-old mother and the memory
of his father, categorically balks at that.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, a decade ago, after his unsuccessful 1988
presidential campaign and his son's near-fatal car accident the
next year, Gore himself seemed determined to explore the meaning of
his own life story. He made a serious study of family dysfunction _
the subtext of his 1992 environmental manifesto, ``Earth in the
Balance'' _ and passed out copies of Alice Miller's ``Drama of the
Gifted Child,'' a book about how narcissistic parents can leave
their high-achieving children cut off from their own feelings and
hazy on just what they want, other than to make Mom and Dad proud.
Back then, friends said, he was absorbed by the need to figure
things out, to emerge from his father's shadow. To decide.
</P>
<P>
   But today, Gore seems nothing if not decided. He does want to be
president, and if he can never really know exactly how much of that
desire began with his parents, his current attitude seems to be: So
what? ``One of the oldest plots in the human story is child follows
parent,'' he said recently, with what seemed like authentic
boredom. And looking back on his early years did not seem so very
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews about his life, he was relaxed and
appeared at peace with the past. He frankly described a childhood
in which even the usual juvenile scrapes might become part of
continuing political calculations _ maybe the same way writers
often end up milking their families for material. When he got in
trouble for throwing whitewash on trucks as they passed the Gore
farm when he was 12, for example, his father made him send letters
of apology to a number of trucking companies. ``That was also an
election year, I believe,'' he remarked wryly. But, he made clear,
it was also just a kid's life.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE FARM AND THE CITY
</P>
<P>
   ``I was conceived in Tennessee,'' Gore began, drawling for
effect, in a radio announcer voice that poked fun at the whole
biographical exercise. Though his political opponents have
successfully portrayed him as a pure-bred Washington creature, with
only photo-op moments in the heartland, he did have a life there,
on the family farm, and by all accounts a more intense emotional
connection to that place than to the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   His real childhood was in Tennessee; in Washington, he spent his
time with adults _ important adults, in whose presence he was
expected to behave beautifully, and did. Tennessee was, at the very
least, where Al Gore wished he had grown up.
</P>
<P>
   His buddies in Tennessee certainly considered Carthage, the
small community on the Cumberland and the Caney Fork Rivers, where
the Gores spent summers and holidays, as his true home. ``There
were not a lot of kids around the Fairfax,'' the Embassy Row hotel
where the Gores lived while in Washington, ``so he could not wait
to get back home,'' said Steve Armistead, Al Gore's closest
childhood friend, and a good pal still.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went up there'' when Gore was in high school, ``and the
friend he had in the Fairfax was a bellhop,'' Armistead said.
``There were all these dignitaries, but not much for a kid. There
was a dullness, a loneliness about it. He didn't lay around
Washington much when he could have been in Carthage, and that's
where he got his values, working on the farm and growing up around
Smith County people.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Gore is the product of both Washington and Tennessee
_ and of the very fact of having grown up in two places, with two
groups of friends and two ways of looking at the world. He was born
in Washington, lived in Tennessee from the time he was 1 until he
was 4, while his father ran for the Senate, and then moved between
the two places until college.
</P>
<P>
   This back and forth set him slightly apart from those around
him, in season and out, and made him tough to figure. Even his
sense of humor is a hybrid, a little bit corny with flashes of
sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   Gore himself seems to feel that his split-screen view of the
world was a gift, at least in the end. ``Even though I spent more
time each year in Washington, Tennessee was home,'' he said
recently. ``Now I'm sure that part of that was me, as a kid,
absorbing my parents' insistence on the political reality of their
lives, that they were representing Tennessee in Washington. I'm
sure I picked up a lot of that as a child. But it was more than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He described Tennessee as a place where ``the human
relationships were much warmer,'' and where he had his dearest
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I learned a great deal from the, forgive the word, the
parallactic view provided by growing up in two places,'' he says
now, ``because just as having two eyes gives you depth perception,
having two homes allows you to see some things that stand out in
relief when viewed from two different perspectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's father _ who also favored fancy words _ moved between two
worlds, too, and for all his striving in Washington did not believe
in leaving either Tennessee or his farm roots behind, ever, even
after his career in politics ended.
</P>
<P>
   And he and his wife thought that working on the farm would be
good for their son, whom they told friends they hoped would be
president one day. ``It was expected from the time he was little,''
said James Fleming, a Nashville, Tenn., doctor and friend of Nancy
Gore's, who for a time served as the Gore family physician. It was
not so much that the Gores thought cleaning out barns would add
just the right touch of ``log cabin'' to his resume, family friends
said, as that they simply felt it would toughen him up and give him
a proper work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``His daddy used to get him up about 6 o'clock in the morning,''
said Mattie Lucie Payne, who worked for the Gores as a housekeeper
for more than 40 years. ``And Al would say, `Daddy, we have men
working,' and his daddy would say, `I know, and you go on down and
help them.'''
</P>
<P>
   He baled hay, cut tobacco and cleaned out hog parlors along with
the hired help. But the senator also seemed to revel in assigning
his son some of the most backbreaking tasks, like clearing 20 hilly
acres with a hand ax.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd drive him pretty hard,'' said Gordon Thompson, a friend
whose family used to live on the Gore farm, back when his own
father worked for the senator.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Al Gore drove himself hard, too. Even at 4-H camp, as
a 9-year-old, he asked to be given the heavy-lifting kitchen duty
usually reserved for 13- and 14-year-olds. ``He was the only camper
I ever had volunteer for K-P,'' said Jerry Cole, the local 4-H
agent.
</P>
<P>
   For several weeks every summer after school let out, but before
his parents could get away from Washington, Thompson said, Al would
stay with them in a house with no indoor plumbing. ``He never
complained,'' Thompson said. ``I think he was always happiest on
the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Always, he was serious. ``He pretty much acted the same way when
he was 13 as he does now,'' said Donna Armistead, Steve Armistead's
sister and Gore's first real girlfriend, for several years,
beginning when he was an extremely confident 13-year-old and she
was 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a terrific listener,'' recalled Ms. Armistead, now a
nurse and divorced mother of two. And not just to her, she said. He
would pay attention to the old folks at her grandparents' grocery
store, and hold his grandmother's hand in the nursing home for long
stretches several times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's own mother ``was not very touchy,'' Ms. Armistead said,
adding, ``When he came in she just wouldn't come running to hug
him.''
</P>
<P>
   She said his father used an entirely different voice when he
talked with Al. ``He'd talk with authority,'' she said. And nobody,
the way Ms. Armistead remembers it, gave him any breaks for being a
senator's son.
</P>
<P>
   Once, after Gore and Ms. Armistead had done a particularly hard
job on the farm, the senator told him to take her out for a meal at
a certain cafe. ``We were so thrilled,'' she remembered. ``But
after dinner Al gets up to the cash register and said, `My dad said
to charge it to him,' and the guy wouldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's tab was too long already. ``So I had to tell him
I'd be right back, and go get the money from my mom,'' Ms.
Armistead said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A TOUCH OF MISCHIEF
</P>
<P>
   Still, his time in Tennessee was not all boot camp and character
building, and Gore did manage to have some unscripted fun. Thompson
remembers his friend as ``pranky,'' with a love of practical jokes
that endures today.
</P>
<P>
   One New Year's Eve, several of his friends said, their whole
group was snowed in at the Gore farm, so Pauline Gore corralled all
the girls in an upstairs bedroom and the boys in Al's room on the
lower level. The senator, dressed in his bathrobe, sat sentry duty
at the top of the stairs all night long, and every so often yelled
downstairs to his son and the other boys, who were busy sharing one
bottle of beer.
</P>
<P>
   At first light, Ms. Armistead heard a knock on the window,
looked out and saw Al and his buddies, who had slipped out a window
and climbed up onto the deck outside her room, where they were
making snowmen in their underwear for the girls' benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Albert still thought he had everything under control,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother, Steve, describes a pretty mild teen-age rebellion:
``We did all the experimental things kids do. We'd sneak out at
night and pick up Coke bottles off a front porch that probably were
not ours, or go to the lake and maybe do a little water skiing at
night that was not too smart, and occasionally have a party. We
probably did a little bit of alcohol abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were also times, even as a kid, when Gore flouted
authority more frontally. Once, while staying with the Thompsons,
he heard that his father, who was away, was going to be giving a
speech in Nashville, 55 miles east. His parents, though, had
decided that their son should not come to the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was little,'' 12 at most, Thompson said, ``but Al went over
to Carthage and caught the bus and went down there, still dressed
for the farm. That didn't go over too well. His mom called and
wanted to know where he was _ that was a biggie. My mom had to tell
her he wasn't here. Today, you'd be worried about all kinds of
things happening. But they were more concerned about him not being
all cleaned up.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of mothers, Pauline Gore always insisted publicly
that her son was at all times the perfect boy. But was she
embellishing a little? At least at times, she apparently thought
she had reason to worry.
</P>
<P>
   James Fleming, the Nashville doctor, said, ``I remember Donna,
this good-looking girl, running around the house, and Pauline
saying, ``Ohmigod, she's going to get pregnant, I know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was not shy about expressing affection for his girlfriend
in front of his mother. ``I remember Pauline and I drove him to the
airport one time,'' said Ms. Armistead, ``and he kissed her on the
cheek and then he kissed me. I mean, he laid one on me, honey.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Armistead says the two of them were lectured. ``Miss Pauline
said keep busy, don't think about sex, enjoy your time together but
always have something in mind to do,'' she said. ``Cold showers and
lots of exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also says Mrs. Gore need not have worried. ``Sex was sex
even then,'' Ms. Armistead said, ``but Al and I both had goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the vice president seems to enjoy looking back on the
benign pleasures of the summers when he got to be a kid in
Tennessee _ skinny dipping with Thompson in a cattle trough or
hypnotizing chickens, which Gore says is ``a little-known farm
skill passed down from adolescent wizard to adolescent wizard.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also situates himself politically in Tennessee, as heir not
only to his father but to Cordell Hull, whom he describes as ``the
model for public service in our part of the country.'' Hull floated
logs down the Cumberland River with Gore's grandfather, settled in
Carthage and became the congressman in the seat the Gore father and
son later held.
</P>
<P>
   An ardent free-trader, Hull won the Nobel Peace Prize for his
role in founding GATT, now the World Trade Organization, and was
secretary of state during World War II. ``But before that he was a
judge on the circuit, and in 10 counties there, the picture above
the judge's chair in the courtroom is neither George Washington,
Thomas Jefferson nor Franklin Roosevelt,'' Gore said, with the
greatest possible reverence. ``It's Cordell Hull to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name the most important things he had inherited from
his parents, Gore talked for a long time about his father and his
father's ideals. But the first thing he said in answer to the
question was this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of what people perceive as the stiffness and formality I
sometimes lapse into comes in part from my father's habit of trying
to ensure that he always presented a dignified appearance to live
up to the position he felt deserved dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who saw him on the stump and playing the fiddle find
that ironic because they don't remember the formal bearing that he
had in most of his appearances. He had a capacity to enjoy humor
and music and friendship, and he also felt the need to present
himself as a senator in a formal and dignified way.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew the senator say his climb from poverty was still
too fresh and stereotypes of Tennessee hillbillies with dirt under
their fingernails still too prevalent for him to feel he could
afford the luxury of letting his guard down in certain public
settings.
</P>
<P>
   His father ``always raised cattle, he always farmed, he always
found relaxation, even in Washington, by going to the farm and
working with cattle,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he became a statesman,'' too, Gore said. ``I've often
thought in my father's persona he continued to manifest both.''
</P>
<P>
   His friends feel sure Gore would move back to Carthage if, as
Thompson delicately put it, ``worse comes to worst.'' The vice
president laughed at that, but agreed. ``Well, I'll retire in
Carthage for sure,'' he said. ``You know, I hope that's many years
from now.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that still strikes all his Tennessee friends as odd,
though, is that through all the time he spent there growing up he
never spoke a word about Washington. And he absolutely refused to
wear any of the neatly folded T-shirts his mother had packed for
him _ T-shirts emblazoned with the name of his prep school, St.
Albans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably thought we would think he was trying to act like
he was better than the rest of us,'' guessed his old friend Edward
Blair.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, who had his boots up on the table in front of him as
he talked, snorted when he heard this. ``I guess maybe they were
thinking that Washington is such a neat place,'' he said, ``that I
would naturally want to tell them all about the great things
there.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON CHILDHOOD
</P>
<P>
   If the Fairfax was a cold place to grow up, it was not because
there was no family close by. The owner, Grady Gore, was a cousin
of the senator's. Louise Gore, one of Grady's daughters, lived in
the hotel. Her sister, Mary Gore Dean, moved in, too, after her
husband died in a plane crash. For a while, their brother Jimmy
Gore and his family were on the premises, as well. When they moved,
it was just down the block.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president is not sentimental about his time there.
``I came to love the farm,'' he said. ``The hotel I never loved.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's correspondence makes clear that he and his family
were there because the price was right. The Gores looked for a
house in Washington for years, but never found anything they felt
they could afford.
</P>
<P>
   And one thing that seems to bother Gore _ far more, in fact,
than the idea that his 52 years add up to something that is not so
much a life as a story line _ is the perception that ``I was in
this luxury apartment eating room service, sort of like Eloise.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his younger days in Washington were lonely, he sighed.
``Oh, no,'' he said. ``I mean I had good friends and I had my
sister. And it's not as if I didn't have my parents. They went out
frequently, and every six years they had a hard campaign, but they
were great and loving parents, and the times when they were pulled
away I had Nancy and my friends. I wasn't left alone with my
thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   He got pretty creative about making his own fun, sometimes
upending all the furniture in the living room to construct an
elaborate fort. But activity was supposed to be purposeful. ``His
dad was a very, very proud man and believed that old Cordell Hull
thing of you're put on earth for a purpose and it's to improve the
condition of life,'' said Gore's cousin, Mark Gore, who lived down
the block.
</P>
<P>
   His cousin also remembers Senator Gore teaching him to swim by
throwing him into a pool when he was 4, while Al, who was 7, looked
on, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   From fourth grade on, young Al attended St. Albans, the
Episcopal boys prep school on the grounds of the National
Cathedral, where he did well but was not, according to friends,
especially happy. Throughout high school, he wrote his Tennessee
girlfriend, Donna Armistead, twice a day, and called her on a pay
phone every Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Gore's closest Washington friends recall that while Al
Gore was the focus of his parents' fondest hopes, it was his
free-spirited, rebellious sister, Nancy, who took more of their
energy. ``The general topic of conversation over there was what
outrageous thing Nancy did this week,'' said one of these friends.
``She got a lot of attention, and Al was kind of an afterthought,
because he never misbehaved.''
</P>
<P>
   For him, the best times were those spent throwing a ball around
with his father at Grady Gore's estate in Potomac, Md. ``He had
some cattle from the Tennessee farm brought up there,'' Gore said,
smirking as if he thought that sounded kind of crazy. ``And a lot
of times on weekends we'd go up there and he'd work with the cattle
and I'd help him and then we'd take a break.'' Sometimes, too, they
played catch in the Russell building, outside the senator's office,
though if someone walked by, ``he'd duck back into the office until
they passed'' because ``it wasn't very dignified,'' the son
recalled. When Al Gore had real ballgames, though, it was his
sister, not his father, who would come.
</P>
<P>
   More often, his father took him to Senate hearings. He sat
through long stretches of discussion over the bill, co-sponsored by
his father, that created the Interstate system of highways. How
wide would the new roads be? Green or blue for the road signs? As a
kid, Gore followed these developments avidly, keeping track of the
miles of completed highway the way other kids his age followed the
Yankees' box scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also took me on the Senate floor, even though he wasn't
supposed to,'' Gore remembered. And one day, when Gore was 5, he
was invited to come up front to meet the vice president, Richard
Nixon, who was presiding that day: ``He put me on his knee and was
very nice to me, and the experience forever after deprived me of
the more sublime pleasures of Nixon hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, Gore's father let his son listen in on an extension while
he spoke to President Kennedy, who at the time was furious at a
certain steel executive for raising prices after the steel workers
had agreed not to seek a wage increase. ``The family anecdote that
my father always told after that _ like a lot of family anecdotes I
can't really vouch for _ but he said that I said, `Dad, I didn't
know presidents talked that way.'''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president does have strong memories of Kennedy, though.
``I was blown away by his inaugural address,'' he said. ``I
remember so vividly the thick snow on the seats, and listening to
each word bring out such poetic force. Really, it was a remarkable
time. My sister was one of the first volunteers for the Peace Corps
that month, and the whole family was filled with the excitement of
the New Frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   They all wanted, each in their own way, to be part of that
excitement. And the entire family talked a lot about not just the
bills before Congress but the big issues of the day, especially
civil rights. In these discussions, was his mother more liberal
than his father, as some who knew the couple have suggested?
``Mmmmm, my dad was pretty liberal,'' Gore answered. ``She was,
like most moms, the conscience of the family, but they didn't
really disagree. And my sister was more liberal than both of them
put together.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Gore started to laugh, and kept on for a good long time.
``It was a family of many consciences,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   SERIES NOTE: This is the second in a series of articles on the
lives of the presidential candidates. The next article will explore
George W. Bush's prep school experience at the Phillips Academy in
Andover, Mass.

ANALYSIS: PRESS IS DIVIDED ON ACCOUNTS OF KOREAN WAR MASSACRE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Sept. 29, 1999, The Associated Press provided extensive
evidence that GIs killed a helpless group of civilians in the early
days of the Korean War. Since then, its report of the incident at
No Gun Ri, 17 months in the making, has became a media personality
in its own right. It has been praised. It has been followed. It has
been honored with journalism's top prizes. More recently, it has
been pilloried.
</P>
<P>
   On May 12, 2000, U.S. News &AMP; World Report published a 10-page
report on its Web site, four weeks in the making, whose skeptical
gist was summed up in the headline ``Doubts About a Korean
`Massacre,''' followed by ``American soldiers allegedly slaughtered
hundreds of innocent refugees at a place called No Gun Ri. A new
review of the facts challenges that claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Its work relied on archival documents and some interviews with
the GIs quoted by The Associated Press, many of whom, it said, ``do
not support the thesis of the AP story.''
</P>
<P>
   Have U.S. News and other critics seriously undermined AP's
report? Sorting through the various accounts offers a window on how
news judgments about controversial events are made. The evidence
available about No Gun Ri is sometimes contradictory, all the
editors and reporters involved agree. What sets the accounts apart
are editorial choices: how long the reporting should last; how many
people should be interviewed, and in what depth; how the relative
importance of documents should be evaluated; and when it comes to
writing, how the final account should be framed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the world learned of No Gun Ri from AP's report. It led
to widespread coverage, which tended to emphasize the horror of the
killings and the conflicted feelings of some GIs about their role.
Secretary of Defense William Cohen ordered an investigation of the
accusations. Until then, the military had denied responsibility,
rejecting the claims of South Koreans who sought reparations.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-April, the wire service's report was awarded this year's
Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting. Not long afterward,
military affairs writers at three news organizations _ U.S. News,
The Baltimore Sun and the military journalism Web site stripes.com
_ began looking into the background of one of the AP's sources,
Edward L. Daily.
</P>
<P>
   This recent and skeptical coverage of No Gun Ri was set off and
framed by documents that came to light indicating that Daily had
embellished his military record and was not at No Gun Ri. Daily had
told the AP and other news organizations that he had fired on the
refugees under direct orders.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Seymour Topping, the administrator of the Pulitzer
Prizes, said the Pulitzer board had re-examined and reaffirmed its
award. ``The board has reviewed all the documentation and is
up-to-date on all that has been published, he said. ``The board is
taking no further action. There has been no expression of concern
by any member of the board.''
</P>
<P>
   But the round of skeptical reports has left confusion about key
questions in the case. Confusion, in fact, is to be expected when
the source of information is memories and documents that date back
half a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with a story like this is, when all is said and
done you have a lot of gray,'' said Tom Bowman, the military
affairs reporter for The Sun, who was among those journalists
pursuing the new evidence about Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the central questions involved in the report, and the
way various news organizations have handled them.
</P>
<P>
   The Events
</P>
<P>
   Did GIs Kill Civilians at No Gun Ri?
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the AP's findings was that these killings did
occur, at the hands of young soldiers. In its original report, the
AP said, ``Six veterans of the 1st Cavalry Division said they fired
on the refugee throng at the South Korean hamlet of No Gun Ri, and
six others said they witnessed the mass killing.'' They went on to
quote nine of these 12.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. News account said in its second paragraph, ``There is
little doubt that something terrible did happen there, in the
confusion of war some refugees were shot by American soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman said, ``Obviously Korean civilians died and U.S. soldiers
are saying they shot them.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department officials on May 12 told The New York Times
they had confirmed that U.S. troops had fired on unarmed civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Duffy, the executive editor of U.S. News, said the
magazine headline ``Doubts About a Korean `Massacre''' was not
intended to undercut the evidence of civilian deaths, but to raise
questions about the scope and circumstances of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   By the South Korean refugees' accounts, the shooting took place
on and off for three days, beginning on July 26, 1950, in the early
weeks of the Korean War. Some general facts are agreed upon by most
witnesses. There had been a panicked retreat of American forces,
including elements of the 7th Cavalry Regiment, and they feared
that the refugees had been infiltrated by North Korean soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Several units, including H Company and F Company, regrouped near
a railroad trestle where the main road curved underneath a railroad
track. Refugees walking along the track were strafed by U.S.
planes. Looking for cover, the refugees ended up under the trestle.
</P>
<P>
   How many were killed there is a matter of dispute. The fourth
paragraph of the AP report said: ``Ex-GIs speak of 100, 200 or
simply hundreds dead. The Koreans, whose claim for compensation was
rejected last year, say 300 were shot to death at the bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the article, it again cited the Korean contentions, and
added, ``Some ex-GIs today estimate 100 or fewer were killed. But
those close to the bridge,'' the AP said, ``generally put the total
at about 200.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News reported that James Kerns, a member of H Company, 2nd
Battalion _ the unit of men most directly involved _ ``sharply
disputed the number of refugees in the tunnel.'' However, his
estimate (he said ``there weren't over 125 people in there'') is
within the AP's range.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy said, ``If you read the AP account, it certainly leaves
open the possibility that hundreds were dead.'' Kerns, he said,
``is disputing that possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department officials told The New York Times that
hundreds were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Witness
</P>
<P>
   Was Daily Credible? Was He Even There?
</P>
<P>
   If the Koreans are the least visible witnesses in the U.S.
media, Edward L. Daily was easily the most visible.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks to the AP were vivid _ ``On summer nights, when the
breeze is blowing, I can still hear their cries, the little kids
screaming.'' Still, he was one of 50 sources, American and Korean,
for the wire service; the factual points he made in the report were
corroborated by other, named American sources.
</P>
<P>
   The NBC News program ``Dateline'' relied more heavily on Daily.
The network's half-hour segment helped make the eloquent veteran
the public face of GI guilt over No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   This prominence, in turn, made it more likely that reporters
would pay attention when told that Daily might never have been at
No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bowman; Joseph L. Galloway, the writer of the U.S. News article;
and Ed Offley, the Washington bureau chief of the stripes.com Web
site discovered personnel records flatly contradicting Daily's
assertions about his military service: that he was a prisoner of
war, that he had received certain decorations, and, most important,
that he served with H Company, the unit of the 7th Cavalry Regiment
directly involved in the No Gun Ri incident.
</P>
<P>
   How solid is the new evidence?
</P>
<P>
   It has raised serious doubts among some reporters who trusted
Daily. He has responded to very few questioners. When Galloway
reached him, Daily raised the possibility that his memory had been
affected by emotional trauma or his anti-depressant medication.
</P>
<P>
   Charles J. Hanley, one of the AP reporters, said he originally
found Daily's accounts of events convincing, and trusted his
documentary evidence: a driver's license placing him with the
company in March 1950, a letter home naming his company commander,
and an H Company ceremonial Christmas dinner menu from Dec. 25,
1949. Not until recently did Hanley get documentation of the
conflicting personnel records.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley said this past weekend: ``There is a discrepancy in the
sketchy military record of one of our more than 40 sources. We are
trying to get to the bottom of it. But this source provided no
essential information for our report on No Gun Ri.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question, however, that the newly discovered
personnel records cast doubt on Daily's claims, not only about No
Gun Ri but about his entire military career.
</P>
<P>
   How important is Daily? AP's executive editor, Jonathan Wolman,
said in a statement last week: ``Serious questions involve veteran
Ed Daily. We spoke to soldiers who put him at the scene and have
reviewed the documentation he offered for his role.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If it turns out that he and those records deceived
us, we will be extremely regretful, and saddened for him. But the
tale of No Gun Ri does not fall on the words of Daily.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanley points out that Daily is not quoted until the 56th
paragraph of the original account. And he said that several other
veterans confirmed the basic fact of the killing before Daily did.
</P>
<P>
   However, Stephen G. Smith, the editor of U.S. News, describes
Daily as ``the linchpin'' of the wire service's original report.
``He's the one who ties it all together,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the AP account depends on what Smith calls ``a mosaic of
partial quotes,'' the fact that Daily's three quotes were vivid,
full sentences dealing with the event, the orders and the veterans'
feelings of guilt made him more crucial than the other veterans
interviewed, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Few of those skeptical of the overall report mention the South
Korean witnesses, who are also quoted at some length.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these South Koreans are seeking reparations, a fact
mentioned with some irritation by two veterans interviewed by The
New York Times last week. Few journalists have reinterviewed the
South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   But Hanley bristles at the idea that their quest for reparations
casts doubt on their memories. ``Frankly,'' he said, ``it is
analogous to questioning the right of Holocaust victims to seek
some token of reparation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rules
</P>
<P>
   Amid Fear, Were There Orders to Kill?
</P>
<P>
   Aside from being the public face of No Gun Ri, Daily is also one
of three former soldiers who tell the AP _ either in the original
report or in a video on the wire service's Web site _ that their
commanders on the scene ordered them to fire. He told the AP: ``The
command looked at it as getting rid of the problem in the easier
way. That was to shoot them in a a group.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of orders is crucial to determining whether the
killings were simply lethal overreaction by young soldiers scared
that enemy troops were hidden among the civilians, or whether they
constituted a war crime.
</P>
<P>
   A second soldier from H Company, Eugene Hesselman, was quoted as
saying that the company commander, Capt. Melbourne C. Chandler, had
said: ``To hell with all those people. Let's get rid of all of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News points out that H Company's morning report for July
27, the summary of a unit's activity the day before, listed
Hesselman as having been wounded on July 26. But its attempts to
reach Hesselman proved unsuccessful. Hesselman, in an interview
long before the name of No Gun Ri was widely known, had told the AP
that he had a small shrapnel wound and declined to be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway, however, said that the medical battalion's morning
reports indicated that Hesselman had been evacuated to the medical
unit on July 26, the day of the massacre. However, the morning
report of July 27 does not indicate when that transfer occurred _
before or after the shooting, before or after any order might have
been given.
</P>
<P>
   The third veteran to mention orders, George Preece, does so in a
videotaped interview with Hanley. In an interview with The
Lexington (Ky.) Herald-Leader days after the AP released its
original report on Sept. 29, Preece retracted the statement, and he
has since denied that any orders were given.
</P>
<P>
   But Hanley said on Friday that he now has interviews with 10
former GIs confirming that there were direct orders. As for the
retractions and rollbacks of some veterans on the details and even
the existence of the killings, Hanley said he believed that the
former GIs had come under pressure from fellow veterans, or were
worried about possible war-crimes charges.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley also points out that no veteran came to AP volunteering
information for the original article.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``These guys were called cold,'' and remembered details
of the events that in many cases matched the details the South
Koreans had given.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley also says that arguments about on-the-scene orders
overlook two general orders from top commanders. The 1st Cavalry
Division headquarters on July 24 had issued an order saying: ``No
refugees to cross the front line. Fire everyone trying to cross
lines. Use discretion in case of women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News made no reference to these general orders.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would frame his account differently if he had
to do it again, Galloway replied: ``If I had time to do the other
interviews and sit back and ponder, I might have written it
differently. But still, as it stands, not bad. I think we did a
good job in the time that we had. I stand behind it. I think in the
end, when the investigation is over and done, there will be a lot
more holes shot in the AP story.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he meant by ``in the time we had,'' Galloway said he
was trying to get his piece published before Offley and Bowman.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the crucial centerpiece of the AP report, the
American soldiers killed at least 100 Korean civilians _ possibly
under direct orders _ has been chipped but hardly shattered by the
latest revelations.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Patterson, a rifleman in the 2nd Battalion, said in an
interview with The New York Times last week: ``Unfortunately, the
incident took place. Numbers are not known exactly.''

 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last thing Al Gore's father told him, a few days before he
died, and just before he lost the ability to speak, was: ``Son,
always do right. Always do right.'' His father, the senator, felt
he had himself done right a lot of the time, and he reliably kept
after his son to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   After the vice president talked about that last conversation,
though, in a eulogy he had worked on without sleeping for two
nights straight, even some friends wondered whether his father had
tacked on a Hollywood ending, scripting his goodbyes at least in
part for the benefit of the papers, and maybe the history books.
This time, nobody came right out and accused Gore himself of
tweaking the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Even the rawest and most intimate moments in Gore's life are now
widely seen as mere theatrics, all part of a presidential campaign
strategy designed by his ambitious, up-from-nothing parents, Albert
and Pauline LaFon Gore, before he was born, and even unto death.
</P>
<P>
   That perception has clearly become a political problem for the
vice president. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas regularly suggests
that Gore is a natural-born phony, and the vice president's every
remark is now fact-checked so scrupulously that when he recently
said he had once dreamed of becoming a teacher, reporters wondered
if he could prove it.
</P>
<P>
   The questions are about more than Gore's claims about the
Internet and ``Love Story.'' What in his life was scripted and what
was real? Could even he know the difference? Where did his parents'
hopes end and his own begin? And do you only get credit for hosing
out hog parlors if you did it without an agenda?
</P>
<P>
   But in separating the facts from the fanciful in Gore's life,
perhaps the most striking discovery is the extent to which the
material that is the most widely doubted is also the most
demonstrably true: Al Gore did do a lot of his growing up in
Tennessee. He did work hard on the farm there _ so hard, in fact,
that the hired help felt sorry for him, and thought his father
should ease up.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, some of what is generally assumed about Gore's
life is not true: He did not, for example, live in luxury back in
Washington during the school year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's parents were both famously frugal, and were not well off
until after their son was grown and after the senator's political
career had ended. Though they sent their children to exclusive
schools and provided social necessities like ballroom dancing
lessons for their son, they also dressed him in a cousin's
hand-me-downs and lived in a hotel because it was owned by a
relative who gave them a break on the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Some summers, the Gores had to pack up their four-room suite and
put their belongings in storage so the place could be sublet while
they were in Tennessee. And Al shared a bedroom with his sister,
Nancy, who was 10 years older, both before and after her college
years.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason that the contours of Gore's unusual
upbringing are not better known, however, is that he himself has
worked so hard to discredit a lot of authentic stories about his
childhood _ the very stories, in fact, that would probably do him
the most good politically. The problem, for him, are the scenes
from the past that portray Gore sympathetically at the expense of
his hard-driving parents. They suggest an emotionally neglected boy
forced to bear the weight of enormous adult expectations, and Gore,
who is fiercely protective of his 87-year-old mother and the memory
of his father, categorically balks at that.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews about his life, Gore was relaxed and
appeared at peace with the past. He frankly described a childhood
in which even the usual juvenile scrapes might become part of
continuing political calculations _ maybe the same way writers
often end up milking their families for material. When he got in
trouble for throwing whitewash on trucks as they passed the Gore
farm when he was 12, for example, his father made him send letters
of apology to a number of trucking companies. ``That was also an
election year, I believe,'' Gore remarked wryly. But, he made
clear, it was also just a kid's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was conceived in Tennessee,'' Gore began, drawling for
effect, in a radio announcer voice that poked fun at the whole
biographical exercise. Though his political opponents have
successfully portrayed him as a pure-bred Washington creature, with
only photo-op moments in the heartland, he did have a life there,
on the family farm, and by all accounts a more intense emotional
connection to that place than to the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   His real childhood was in Tennessee; in Washington, he spent his
time with adults _ important adults, in whose presence he was
expected to behave beautifully, and did. Tennessee was, at the very
least, where Al Gore wished he had grown up.
</P>
<P>
   His buddies in Tennessee certainly considered Carthage, the
small community on the Cumberland and the Caney Fork Rivers, where
the Gores spent summers and holidays, as his true home. ``There
were not a lot of kids around the Fairfax,'' the Embassy Row hotel
where the Gores lived while in Washington, ``so he could not wait
to get back home,'' said Steve Armistead, Al Gore's closest
childhood friend, and a good pal still.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went up there'' when Gore was in high school, ``and the
friend he had in the Fairfax was a bellhop,'' Armistead said.
``There were all these dignitaries, but not much for a kid. There
was a dullness, a loneliness about it. He didn't lay around
Washington much when he could have been in Carthage, and that's
where he got his values, working on the farm and growing up around
Smith County people.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Gore is the product of both Washington and Tennessee
_ and of the very fact of having grown up in two places, with two
groups of friends and two ways of looking at the world. He was born
in Washington, lived in Tennessee from the time he was 1 until he
was 4, while his father ran for the Senate, and then moved between
the two places until college.
</P>
<P>
   Gore himself seems to feel that his split-screen view of the
world was a gift, at least in the end. ``Even though I spent more
time each year in Washington, Tennessee was home,'' he said
recently. ``Now I'm sure that part of that was me, as a kid,
absorbing my parents' insistence on the political reality of their
lives, that they were representing Tennessee in Washington. I'm
sure I picked up a lot of that as a child. But it was more than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He described Tennessee as a place where ``the human
relationships were much warmer,'' and where he had his dearest
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's parents thought that working on the farm would be good
for their son, whom they told friends they hoped would be president
one day. ``It was expected from the time he was little,'' said
James Fleming, a Nashville, Tenn., doctor and friend of Nancy
Gore's, who for a time served as the Gore family physician. It was
not so much that the Gores thought cleaning out barns would add
just the right touch of ``log cabin'' to his resume, family friends
said, as that they simply felt it would toughen him up and give him
a proper work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   He baled hay, cut tobacco and cleaned out hog parlors along with
the hired help. But the senator also seemed to revel in assigning
his son some of the most backbreaking tasks, like clearing 20 hilly
acres with a hand ax.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd drive him pretty hard,'' said Gordon Thompson, a friend
whose family used to live on the Gore farm, back when his own
father worked for the senator.
</P>
<P>
   But then, he drove himself hard, too. Even at 4-H camp, as a
9-year-old, he asked to be given the heavy-lifting kitchen duty
usually reserved for 13- and 14-year-olds. ``He was the only camper
I ever had volunteer for K-P,'' said Jerry Cole, the local 4-H
agent.
</P>
<P>
   Always, he was serious. ``He pretty much acted the same way when
he was 13 as he does now,'' said Donna Armistead, Steve Armistead's
sister and Gore's first real girlfriend, for several years,
beginning when he was an extremely confident 13-year-old and she
was 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a terrific listener,'' recalled Ms. Armistead, now a
nurse and divorced mother of two. And not just to her, she said. He
would pay attention to the old folks at her grandparents' grocery
store, and hold his grandmother's hand in the nursing home for long
stretches several times a week.
</P>
<P>
   His friends feel sure Gore would move back to Carthage if, as
Thompson delicately put it, ``worse comes to worst.'' The vice
president laughed at that, but agreed. ``Well, I'll retire in
Carthage for sure,'' he said. ``You know, I hope that's many years
from now.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that still strikes all his Tennessee friends as odd,
though, is that through all the time he spent there growing up he
never spoke a word about Washington. And he absolutely refused to
wear any of the neatly folded T-shirts his mother had packed for
him _ T-shirts emblazoned with the name of his prep school, St.
Albans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably thought we would think he was trying to act like
he was better than the rest of us,'' guessed his old friend Edward
Blair.
</P>
<P>
   From fourth grade on, young Al attended St. Albans, the
Episcopal boys prep school on the grounds of the National
Cathedral, where he did well but was not, according to friends,
especially happy. Throughout high school, he wrote his Tennessee
girlfriend, Ms. Armistead, twice a day, and called her on a pay
phone every Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   More often, his father took him to Senate hearings. He sat
through long stretches of discussion over the bill, co-sponsored by
his father, that created the Interstate system of highways. How
wide would the new roads be? Green or blue for the road signs? As a
kid, Gore followed these developments avidly, keeping track of the
miles of completed highway the way other kids his age followed the
Yankees' box scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also took me on the Senate floor, even though he wasn't
supposed to,'' Gore remembered. And one day, when Gore was 5, he
was invited to come up front to meet the vice president, Richard
Nixon, who was presiding that day: ``He put me on his knee and was
very nice to me, and the experience forever after deprived me of
the more sublime pleasures of Nixon hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   SERIES NOTE: This is the second in a series of articles on the
lives of the presidential candidates. The next article will explore
George W. Bush's prep school experience at the Phillips Academy in
Andover, Mass.

GORE'S FATHER'S JOURNEY: POSSUM HOLLOW, TENN., TO THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GORE-BIO, GORE-BIO-ABRIDGED) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Albert Arnold Gore of Tennessee never ran a negative
campaign. In his first senatorial race, against an octogenarian
incumbent, Kenneth McKellar, in the Democratic primary of 1952, he
told friends it would be unseemly to make an issue of his
opponent's age.
</P>
<P>
   That season's hot tag lines: ``Thinking feller, vote for
McKellar'' vs. ``Think some more, and vote for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore won that race, and 18 years later his political career also
ended on the high road. In that last losing race, against Bill
Brock, a Republican, in 1970, he never aggressively answered a
whole range of attacks, including the untrue accusation that he had
personally benefited by routing Interstate 40 through land he
owned, and the unfair suggestion that he had forgotten his roots
while chasing after the Kennedys at Georgetown dinner parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Watergate investigation later showed that Nixon operatives
had poured illegal campaign funds into the race. Some of the money
came from Richard Mellon Scaife, the same conservative who later
spent millions on anti-Clinton investigations and activities.
</P>
<P>
   And the man who defeated Gore eventually apologized for the
divisive tone of the campaign. His slogan, designed to appeal to
disaffected whites supporting George Wallace, was ``Bill Brock
believes in the things we believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Born poor in the remote settlement of Possum Hollow, Tenn., Gore
lived through the worst of the Depression and spent seven years
working his way through college by teaching in a one-room school _
he would spend one year earning money, then the next year spending
it on his studies.
</P>
<P>
   He loved music, played a mean fiddle, and always said he ran for
office because as a kid he had seen the picture of a cousin who was
running for the state Legislature on a utility pole and liked the
idea of seeing his own face up there.
</P>
<P>
   But he was also moved by ideas, and was a committed free trader
and New Dealer who believed that, as he said, ``nothing cures
poverty like money.'' He married a strong woman, a fellow lawyer,
Pauline LaFon, and spent much of his career defending unpopular
stands, like his opposition to American involvement in Vietnam and
his refusal to sign Sen. Strom Thurmond's Southern Manifesto, which
encouraged southerners to defy court decisions on desegregation.
(He did, however, vote against the Civil Rights Act in 1964 _ an
election year for him _ and wrote in his memoirs that that vote was
an enduring regret.)
</P>
<P>
   He felt no Southerner had a real chance at his party's
presidential nomination but hoped to serve as vice president, and
he campaigned hard against Sen. John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts
and a fellow Tennessean, Sen. Estes Kefauver, in an effort to
become Adlai Stevenson's running mate in 1956. Kefauver won.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was hopeful again in 1960, but Kennedy chose Lyndon B.
Johnson. At Gore's funeral, his son joked about the senator's
longtime longing for the No. 2 job: ``Now that's humility.''

LABOR LEADERS WARN DEMOCRATS ON CHINA TRADE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related CLINTON-CHINA) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In lobbying House Democrats to vote against the China trade
bill, the nation's labor leaders are warning of political perils
for the Democrats if the bill passes.
</P>
<P>
   In blunt terms, they are warning that Vice President Al Gore and
other Democratic candidates are likely to fare worse in the
November elections if the China trade bill passes because union
members will be so angry.
</P>
<P>
   But if the House rejects the trade bill, labor leaders say,
union members will quickly forget the episode and will forgive
those Democrats who backed the bill, which would grant permanent
normalized trade relations to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel different if you win a vote _ you're ready to move
on,'' said Steve Rosenthal, the AFL-CIO's political director. ``But
if we lose, it's going to be tougher to put the pieces back
together. It's an emotional issue right now, and it has the
potential of really causing a major problem as we get closer to the
election.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the bill's backers predicting that they will narrowly
triumph in the vote scheduled for this week, some Democratic Party
leaders said union officials were exaggerating the extent of a
labor backlash to make Democratic lawmakers afraid to support the
trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders have repeatedly warned that the China trade fight
could set back the Democrats the way labor's anger over Congress'
approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement hurt the
Democrats in the 1994 congressional elections. After the
Republicans won control of the House that year, many labor leaders
said the Democrats lost largely because many union members,
normally dependable Democrats, stayed home out of anger over NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   The fear that enraged union members will again sit out this
year's election is greatest in the large industrial swing states of
the Midwest, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois and Michigan.
These are states that Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee, may
well need in order to win in November. The three unions lobbying
hardest against the China bill, the Teamsters, the Steelworkers,
and the Auto Workers, are especially strong in these states.
</P>
<P>
   If union members do not vote, or back the Republicans, that
could tip some of those states toward the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush and make it harder for
Democrats to regain control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats need a net gain of six seats to control the House.
Among the Democratic House members that union leaders say will be
more vulnerable this November because they supported the trade bill
are Lois Capps of California, David Moore of Kansas, and Jay Inslee
of Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after Capps endorsed the bill, William D. Elder, the
secretary-treasurer of a Teamsters' local in Ventura, Calif., wrote
her, saying his union was reassessing its support of her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But some Democratic officials asserted that labor's dismay with
the China trade bill would hardly hurt Gore and the Democrats.
These officials predicted that union members would largely forget
the China fight by November and would instead be focusing on issues
like Social Security and a patient's bill of rights that would
persuade them to vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, members of labor disagree with the vice president
and some members of Congress on this,'' said David J. Leland,
chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. ``But overall, these union
members understand that working families are better served by
making sure that Al Gore is the next president.''
</P>
<P>
   One undecided Democratic House member, Gregory Meeks of New
York, said that he was angered at a recent meeting when a labor
leader warned Charles Rangel, the ranking Democrat on the House and
Ways and Means Committee, that the China fight might prevent him
from becoming the committee's chairman because disgruntled union
members might not vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most labor leaders I spoke to don't feel that way,'' Meeks
said. ``They know they'll be cutting off their noses to spite their
face. Once this is all over _ there's a lot of passion for sure _
we'll have to work out a plan together to work together to take
back the House.''

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT A HINDRANCE, NOT A HELP, ON FORFEITURE LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN DILLON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The U.S. Department of Justice is far more
than a silent partner in the mass evasion of state laws by local
police and state patrols. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Justice Department is the main culprit, The Kansas
City Star has found. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department invented the system that allows police to
keep most of the drug money they seize contrary to most state laws.
It then trained police how to use the system and fought efforts to
reform it, The Star found. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The chief sponsor of the 1984 law that created a partnership
between federal agencies and police now wishes he had never opened
the door. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never envisioned that the feds would circumvent state
law,'' says former U.S. Rep. William J. Hughes, a New Jersey
Democrat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials say they never have encouraged
police to avoid their own laws. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A real motivation on the federal side is to reward the help we
get from our brother and sister law enforcement,'' said Jerry
McDowell, head of the Justice Department's money laundering and
asset forfeiture division. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The real motivation here is to knock the socks off the
criminal gangs.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the hand-offs are possible only because the Justice
Department twisted the 1984 law, which simply allowed federal
agencies to share forfeitures with local police who helped in a
joint investigation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to addressing joint investigations, the Justice
Department wrote guidelines that established an ``adoption''
procedure, allowing federal agencies to adopt forfeitures from
local cases when they weren't even involved. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even as they were writing the guidelines, Justice Department
officials had in hand a study showing that adoptions would conflict
with state laws, most of which made some effort to keep seized
money from going directly back to police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The study showed more than half the states specifically
designated the money to go somewhere else, such as to a state
fund. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Justice attorneys determined that state laws did not
specifically prohibit police from turning over a seizure to a
federal agency. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State and local law enforcement quickly began taking their
seizures to the federal government, said David Smith, who worked
with forfeitures in the Justice Department in the early 1980s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody ever anticipated that it would be as
wildly successful as it was in getting the police motivated to do
more forfeitures,'' said David Smith, who left the department in
1986 and now co-chairs a committee on forfeiture abuse for the
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brk:Not a hard sell &QL; 
 &LR; tx:The quick launch of the adoption program came thanks to
training seminars that the Justice Department put on to show police
how to take advantage of it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brad Cates, then-director of the department's Office of Asset
Forfeiture, pointed out in 1988 that training was going especially
well in California. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like 500 police chiefs and whatnot have attended,''
Cates told a House judiciary subcommittee hearing that year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beyond training, federal officials sometimes have recruited
police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, just a few days after the Missouri Supreme Court ruled
that state forfeitures had to go to education in most cases, the
U.S. attorney for the Western District of Missouri wrote a letter
to state and local law enforcement agencies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that all of you in law enforcement are in desperate
need for additional financial resources,'' wrote Jean Paul
Bradshaw. He explained that police could bring seizures to a
federal agency even if the agency had no involvement in the case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As most of you know, the money we share through our forfeiture
program goes directly to the state or local law enforcement
agency,'' he wrote. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not that the federal program has ever been a hard sell to
police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, the North Carolina State Highway Patrol was
reluctant to expand its role and step up seizures from traffic
stops _ until a DEA agent presented the federal forfeiture program
during a meeting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Then everybody's eyes lit up,'' the head of North Carolina's
Department of Crime Control and Public Safety told congressmen in
1989. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In two years, the Justice Department returned more than $117
million in adoptive and joint forfeiture proceeds to state and
local departments across the country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But police were circumventing state laws to take part in the
federal program. For example, in California, where federal agencies
were focusing their program, state law at that time required
forfeited money to go to a mental health fund. But police
themselves got $48 million in just one year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We receive a case which is in every aspect a local case, been
worked on pretty much by the local agencies all the way from
beginning to end, and we put our cover on it,'' Joe Whitley, deputy
assistant attorney general, told the House judiciary subcommittee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then-U.S. Rep. Lawrence J. Smith, a Florida Democrat, was
shocked. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are telling me basically is that the federal
government is complicit with the law enforcement agencies in
California in trying to, in essence, subvert the California state
law,'' Smith said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such revelations led Hughes in 1988 to sponsor an amendment to
prohibit federal agencies from overriding state forfeiture laws.
Congress passed the amendment, which was to take effect Oct. 1,
1989. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Justice and law enforcement lobbied against it. And
unbeknownst to many members of Congress, a repeal of the amendment
had been slipped into a large defense appropriations bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not know about that (provision) until after it was
approved,'' Hughes says today. ``We were all surprised.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Hughes and others say they don't know who was
responsible for the measure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To Hughes, the issue was dead. He said he wrote then-U.S.
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to request a meeting about the
forfeitures but never got a response. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a very serious effort to try to stem what looked like
would become a pretty regular practice of circumventing state
law,'' Hughes said. ``The power of law enforcement was too much.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thornburgh, who is now a Washington lawyer, for the past six
months did not return a reporter's telephone calls requesting an
interview. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Edwin Meese III, who was U.S. attorney general during the
early years of the federal program, said he is worried about the
direction of adoptions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious problem,'' said Meese, who is now with the
Heritage Foundation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for law enforcement leaders not to allow the
money to be the tail wagging the dog.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even Bradshaw, the former U.S. attorney in Kansas City, now
questions the adoption program. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me it is getting far afield from what it was
intended, from what perhaps the federal role ought to be,''
Bradshaw said.

CHANGE IN POLICE SEIZURE POLICY WON'T COME EASY OR SOON 
</HEADLINE>
 SECOND IN A SERIES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN DILLON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For more than 15 years police and federal
agencies have perfected the partnership that allows police to
improperly keep millions of dollars seized in drug busts and
traffic stops. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect change to come easy or soon, a yearlong examination
by The Kansas City Star shows. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few states have tried without success to stop police, leaving
many to conclude that Congress is the only solution. And indeed
Washington could stem the flow of state seizures to the federal
government. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in April Congress lost its best chance in a decade to do
that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed legislation last month curbing some federal
forfeiture powers. But the version that reached the White House was
missing a provision that could have blocked the way police across
the country use federal agencies to circumvent their own state
laws.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a No. 1 problem,'' Rajeev Purohit, director of
legislation for the National Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers, said of circumvention. ``If you got rid of that, you would
be more than halfway toward solving the entire problem.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of liberal and conservative groups plans to push
again to ban the end-run by police, but many agree that it won't be
easy, considering how hard it was to get last month's reforms
passed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything further is going to be very hard fighting,'' said
Julie Katzman, a key aide on the Senate bill for Sen. Patrick
Leahy, a co-sponsor and Vermont Democrat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement has lobbied hard to maintain the system that
allows police nationwide to keep much of the drug money and
property they seize. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The handoff arrangement, in which federal agencies are said to
``adopt'' state seizures, works this way: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When police seize money, they avoid taking it to state courts
because most states have passed laws barring seized property from
going directly back to police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead, police call in a federal agency, which accepts the
seizure under federal law, keeps a portion _ usually 20 percent _
for itself and sends the rest back to police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like they are personally profiting from their
seizures,'' said Gene Zoegtlin, legislative counsel for the
International Association of Chiefs of Police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to this program is to deprive bad guys of the profits
of their crimes. And at the same time, you can take those profits
that were gained illegally and turn them over to law enforcement so
that law enforcement is better positioned to combat other types of
crimes.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the prospect of keeping seized property gives
police an incentive to make illegal searches and avoid state laws,
which generally provide citizens with more protection than federal
laws. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Police have become addicted to seizure money,'' said Joseph
McNamara, former police chief of Kansas City and San Jose and now
an authority on policing at the Hoover Institution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very sad and very dangerous to civil liberties.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's also very difficult to stop. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though the new federal law will curb some forfeiture
powers, which could affect some seizures that federal agencies take
from police, many expect the effect to be muted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The greatest impact is predicted by the Congressional Budget
Office, which estimates that forfeiture money returned to police
would decrease by 20 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But that calculation, which was based mostly on information
provided by the Justice Department, was simplified. For example, it
includes nonpolice forfeitures by Treasury Department agencies,
such as the IRS. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many see police revenues decreasing by a much smaller
amount, if at all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think numerically it is likely to make a
cotton-picking bit of difference,'' said Frank Bowman, associate
law professor at Indiana University-Indianapolis and co-author of
The Federal Forfeiture Guide, a monthly analysis of court
decisions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department did not respond to questions from The
Star about the new law, but it did reassure at least one national
police official that his organization didn't need to worry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department ``is confident that this new law will not
make a great impact on the forfeiture program,'' Zoegtlin said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some state and local law enforcement officials say they
will continue to hand off seizures to the federal government
without any problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen anything in the bill that would harm that
procedure,'' said Neal Childers, deputy director of legal services
for the Georgia Department of Public Safety. &QL; 
 &LR; brk:States hit a wall &QL; 
 &LR; tx:Don't look to the states to control their own police, even
though theoretically they should be able to. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, lawmakers in many states remain unaware of the federal
hand-offs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas Sen. Wayne Dowd, a Texarkana Democrat, explained why
his own state took so long to notice it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody trusted law enforcement,'' said Dowd, chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee. ``They are the good guys.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other states, public officials shrink from angering police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year when we had a hearing on forfeitures, they brought
in 200 officers in uniform and just intimidated everybody,''
recalls Utah Rep. Bill Wright, an Elberta Republican and speaker
pro tem. ``As a matter of fact, I had two ladies who said they were
scared to death. I have never been more intimidated in my life to
look out there and see 200 officers in uniforms with guns on their
hips, staring me down.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to be called anti-crime, said Eric Sterling,
president of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation, a Washington
think tank. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It is dangerous to democracy that nonpolice public officials
feel sufficiently threatened that they will not challenge police
lawlessness,'' said Sterling, who had been an attorney for the
House Judiciary Committee for 10 years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few states have tried to shut down the police//federal
pipeline, but it's difficult: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --In California, tougher forfeiture laws that passed in 1994 to
protect civil liberties succeeded only in sending police even more
frequently to federal agencies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That circumvention reduces state Sen. John Burton to fury.
``There is not a ... thing we can do,'' said Burton, a San
Francisco Democrat and president pro tem of the Senate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A bill that is working its way through the legislature this year
would use criminal penalties to stem the hand-offs, which would
make it perhaps the toughest law in the nation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But when Burton introduced a less severe bill two years ago,
police rallied and helped kill it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- After Arkansas officials discovered police were handing off
large seizures, lawmakers passed a tougher forfeiture law that went
into effect last summer and added financial penalties if police
didn't follow it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dowd said he knows the new law has loopholes ``you can
drive a truck full of dope or money through.'' But he hopes law
enforcement will follow it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least one police agency has not decided how to deal with the
new law. The Arkansas Highway Police feel like they're caught
between the state and federal governments, said Lawrence Jackson,
an attorney for the agency. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really thrown a monkey wrench into the federal-state
cooperative arrangements,'' Jackson said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- The Missouri constitution requires in most cases that
forfeitures go to public education, and in 1993 the General
Assembly tried to rein in police as tightly as possible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That year a law specifically prohibited police from handing off
drug money they seized to a federal agency. Only a judge could make
that decision. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But last year The Star reported that police were handing off
seizures to federal agencies and getting back millions of dollars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials explained that police were not
violating state law: They weren't handing off seizures, because
they really weren't seizing the money _ they were simply
``detaining'' it for a federal agent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {( Begin optional trim )}
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Missouri lawmakers attempted to rewrite statutes
this session to make it clear that a seizure is indeed a seizure,
but the effort died this month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is trying a different approach. In November,
voters may be able to decide whether to divert the proceeds of most
state forfeitures away from police and prosecutors and into a drug
treatment fund. That includes federal forfeiture money that has
been going back to police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But at least one public official thinks police will continue to
find ways around any laws that states can think to pass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the state law mirrors the federal law, you are not
going to stop police from going to the feds, no matter what you
do,'' Claire McCaskill, Missouri state auditor and a former
prosecutor, told a legislative hearing last year. &QL; 
 &LR; brk:Not much help &QL; 
 &LR; tx:Many think the answer has to come from Washington. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But some states that have taken action say they receive little
federal cooperation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before writing their new law, Missouri legislators asked to meet
with the Justice Department to try to resolve the problem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After 10 months, Justice officials finally agreed to meet in
Washington on Dec. 1 with Missouri Sen. Harry Wiggins, a Kansas
City Democrat, and Rep. Jim Kreider, a Nixa Democrat. But as they
were leaving to catch a plane for the meeting, Wiggins and Kreider
learned the Justice Department had canceled it with little
explanation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The simplest solution to this problem at the state level is
for the feds to /{cooperate/} and talk to us,'' said an angry
Kreider. ``Obviously, they don't want to talk to us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department referred questions to U.S. Attorney
Stephen Hill in Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hill said he was supportive of the meeting and tried hard to set
it up. He added that he might have worked even harder had he
realized that the primary reason for Wiggins and Krieder to travel
to Washington had been to meet with Justice officials. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials contend they don't knowingly sidestep state
laws. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It has never been DEA policy to consciously thwart the intent
of state law by adopting seizures contrary to state laws,'' DEA
officials wrote in response to questions from The Star. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the DEA does not even follow Justice Department guidelines,
which say federal officials generally should not accept seized
money from police when the defendant is being prosecuted in state
court. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, The Star found, the DEA accepted a seizure when a
defendant was being prosecuted in state court. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, a Wisconsin State Patrol trooper stopped two men on
Interstate 43 south of Green Bay in 1998 because their car had
temporary plates. In a search, the trooper found 5 grams of
cocaine, a joint and roach clip, and $2,602. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later the patrol mailed a check for that amount to
the DEA, which then paid back about $2,000 to the patrol.
Meanwhile, however, the driver pleaded guilty in state court to
possession of cocaine and received 10 days in the county jail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, DEA officials blame police officials for turning
over forfeitures when criminal cases go to state court. &QL; 
``DEA field personnel rely on the state or local agencies
presenting the adoption to ensure that relevant state law and
policy are being followed,'' they wrote. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department says it is trying to encourage local law
enforcement to follow state laws by offering a new training
curriculum in a couple of states. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We will adopt cases in appropriate circumstances,'' said Jerry
McDowell, director of the Justice Department's money laundering and
asset forfeiture division. ``But the long-term goal is to get them
doing it for themselves when they can.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He added that the training itself _ Justice officials would not
provide the curriculum to The Star _ could take years and may never
be over. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Justice officials at a seminar last winter in Tennessee
were still encouraging police to use adoptions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Justice official ``was letting us know how their asset
forfeiture laws could help the local agencies,'' said Carleton
Bryant, legal counselor for the Knox County Sheriff's Office. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {( End optional trim )}
 &LR; brk:Last chance &QL; 
 &LR; tx:If states can't block adoptions, and the Justice Department
doesn't appear likely to, that leaves Congress. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the construction of the new federal bill offers little
encouragement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican and chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee, had long been concerned about forfeiture
abuses, holding hearings and writing a book in 1995. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year Hyde and his committee took note of the federal
hand-offs after The Star published its Missouri findings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee already was working on a broad
forfeiture reform bill, so Hyde introduced an amendment to prohibit
the Justice Department from returning forfeiture proceeds to state
and local police when that circumvented state law. Some called it
the ``Missouri provision.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's leadership officers were swamped by faxes from law
enforcement protesting the provision, said William T. Waren, until
recently a senior fellow of the National Conference of State
Legislatures who helped the committee with the bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The reform bill passed the House with a large majority, but the
amendment was not included because of a glitch _ a committee
staffer who was supposed to attach the amendment to the bill on the
House floor was called away on a family emergency. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bill moved to the Senate side, where Sens. Leahy and Orrin
Hatch, a Utah Republican and chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, took up Hyde's fight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hyde kept pushing for the Missouri provision, even in a March
meeting with Attorney General Janet Reno and others the day before
the Senate committee voted on the bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Justice officials were strongly opposed because of the cost
to law enforcement, congressional staffers and lobbyists say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes money away from law enforcement, and you'd have to
make up your state funds someplace else or decrease your law
enforcement,'' said James Polley, legislative consultant for the
National District Attorneys Association who was working with the
Justice Department on the bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The reform bill passed the Senate committee without insertion of
the Missouri provision. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Sen. John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican and committee member,
would not comment on the provision. His staff said circumvention
was a state problem, not federal.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several critics praise Hyde for his efforts, and say the Senate
greatly weakened the bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice should come under some criticism for the very
reasonable reforms that were in the original Hyde bill,'' said
Purohit of the defense lawyers association. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Staff for Leahy pointed out that reform supporters had to fight
not only the law enforcement community but also members of the
Senate committee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This reform bill is a major first step, but there is certainly
more to be done,'' Katzman said. ``Reform advocates have done
everything they could do with some amount of consent on the other
side.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Katzman agreed nothing now in the law will prevent police from
continuing to circumvent state laws. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {( Begin optional trim )}
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of states where the money is required to go to
education or just to the treasury,'' Katzman said, ``those can be
totally circumvented by taking it federally, and it will continue
to be that way.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Katzman called that problem ``perhaps the most disturbing part
of federal civil asset forfeiture.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hatch and Hyde would not comment on the reform bill or the
possibilities of passing another one to stem the flow of adoption
money, but in his 1995 book, Hyde wrote this about the lure of
money: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been around Capitol Hill long enough to know that no
legislation has a realistic chance of becoming law that will take
hundreds of millions _ indeed, billions _ of dollars away from the
Justice Department and state and local police agencies _ away from
the war on drugs.''

NEWLY ENACTED FORFEITURE REFORM LAW FALLS SHORT, CRITICS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN DILLON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Congress passed a forfeiture reform bill last
month with great fanfare, promising it would finally protect civil
liberties and property rights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the new law didn't go far enough, but at least it
was an important first step. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A closer look shows the law might not even be that significant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the bill makes some progress, and any progress is
noteworthy in the stubborn area of federal forfeitures, almost
everyone agrees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But when they examine the bill's provisions, many experts now
find that the new law is constructed with back doors and false
fronts that will preclude major change. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty minimal,'' said Eric Blumenson, a law professor at
Suffolk University and author of ``Policing for Profit.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly doesn't change the flow of assets into the
agencies that seize them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star interviewed a dozen law enforcement
officials, attorneys and legal experts, including two who helped
write the bill, to determine what it does and does not do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of key reforms in the bill: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Attorney fees. This much-touted provision purports to improve
the lot of property owners, but that is open to question. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the new law allows a judge to award attorney fees to a
property owner who wins a forfeiture case, that right already was
available. For a decade, attorneys have won fees in forfeiture
cases using existing federal laws. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new law could actually make it more difficult to win them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under existing laws, attorneys only had to win their case. If
the government couldn't show its own case was ``substantially
justified,'' the attorney got the fees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, the government has to prove nothing, and the
property owner must prove that he ``substantially prevailed.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big question: How do you substantially prevail? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What does that mean?'' asked Jimmy Gurule, a Notre Dame
University law professor and author of a book on forfeiture law.
``You prevail or you don't.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some, including Gurule and one assistant U.S. attorney, think
that standard will make it harder to win attorney fees under the
new law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But others think it may not even be necessary to win the case to
substantially prevail. In fact, that was the intent of Congress,
said Julie Katzman, an attorney with Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont
Democrat who co-sponsored the bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It will probably require litigation to settle the issue, several
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One minor improvement: Existing attorney fee law would not award
fees if a property owner's net worth was more than $2 million. The
new forfeiture law does not make that exception. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Burden of proof. Many point to a shift in the burden of proof
as the most significant change in the law. But the change will not
be dramatic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the old law, the government only had to prove it had
probable cause to seize property. If the owner wanted to fight the
forfeiture, it was then up to him to prove by a ``preponderance of
evidence '' that the property was not the proceeds of a crime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now it's the government that must prove that the property was
the proceeds of crime by a preponderance of evidence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Experts point out that even though the burden has shifted to the
government, it won't make a lot of difference for several reasons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, preponderance of evidence is the easiest standard to meet
in a courtroom. To win, it requires only the ``slightest degree''
more evidence than the opponent, as one judge described it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Some congressmen fought to require ``clear and convincing''
evidence, but the standard was lowered during negotiations with the
Justice Department.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Second, that's about as much evidence as law enforcement and
prosecutors usually had under the old law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were a prosecutor, you knew you better have more
evidence than the other side,'' said Brock Stephenson, an assistant
U.S. attorney who handles forfeitures in the Dallas judicial
district. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The change in standards makes the system feel fairer ... and
that perception of fairness is nothing to sneeze at,'' said Frank
Bowman, an associate law professor at Indiana
University-Indianapolis. ``But changing these particular words is
of little more than symbolic importance.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He and others say where the preponderance burden will make all
the difference is when there is a tie _ the owner should win. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there's one important caveat that few have addressed
publicly: The change in burden of proof only affects a fraction of
forfeiture cases. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's because it will only come up when forfeiture cases go to
trial, and only 15 percent of all forfeiture cases are contested. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   True, the Congressional Budget Office estimates, using figures
from the Justice and Treasury departments, the proportion of
contested cases will increase to 30 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But David Smith, a contributor to the bill and a forfeiture
expert for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers in
Washington, D.C., disputes that figure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is ludicrous,'' said Smith, adding that he
thought claims would only increase 5 percent. ``(Justice is)
probably painting a bleaker picture than really exists.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the new law doesn't preclude federal agencies from still
declaring property forfeited without the approval of a prosecutor
or judge. That's called ``administrative forfeiture'' and it's used
in the vast majority of cases. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the new law still does not require a person to be convicted
of a crime to have property forfeited. Under the old law, few
owners who had property forfeited were even charged with a crime,
much less convicted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Cost bond. Under the old law, a property owner who wished to
contest the forfeiture in court had to file a claim of ownership
with the seizing agency and pay a cost bond of $250 to $5,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cost bond became one of the most hotly contested provisions
in the new law. Law enforcement said it was needed to filter out
frivolous claims. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the dust settled, the cost bond had turned into a fine
that's imposed when a judge finds that a claim is frivolous. That's
an improvement that could allow more people into court, experts
say, but it's not without risk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Property owners don't have to pay the money up front, but they
could face a fine at the end. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If a judge determines a claim is frivolous, the owner can be
subject to a fine of $250 to $5,000, much like the old cost bond. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One other concern: The law now requires a person to provide
documentation when possible that the property belongs to him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some law enforcement officials still worry that the new
law could lead to a flood of frivolous claims. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who strongly supports the new law, said he thinks the
Drug Enforcement Administration will try to prevent people who do
not have documentation for property from filing claims. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that is going to be manipulated by the DEA to deny
people their right to go to court,'' said Smith, who expects that
problem to be worked out in litigation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Attorney representation. Another provision that has been
trumpeted provides an attorney for poor persons in a forfeiture
case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But that happens only in two areas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A judge must appoint an attorney for an indigent whose home is
being forfeited. If an indigent already has an attorney in a
related criminal case, the judge may appoint one for the forfeiture
case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, if police seize cash, cars or property other than a
home and there is no criminal case, legal expenses can cost up to
$20,000, defense lawyers have said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions make such changes as: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Setting a time limit for the government to file a forfeiture
complaint while lengthening the time the government can take to
notify interested parties. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Clarifying the ability of a person to prove he is the innocent
owner of seized property so he can recover it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Under certain circumstances, allowing owners to keep property
(not cash) during forfeiture proceedings if loss of the property
presents a hardship, such as not being able to work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to know what all the key players who put together
the bill think about the result _ some now prefer not to talk about
it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The offices of Rep. Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican who
backed a House version of the bill, and Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Utah
Republican who co-sponsored the Senate bill, for the past two
months did not return phone calls or written questions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the Justice Department, which successfully fought to weaken
the bill, did not respond to questions or phone calls about it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But many experts say the bill has one key flaw: It will not
substantially cut into revenue from forfeitures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steven Kessler, a defense attorney and former Bronx, N.Y.,
prosecutor who has written a 900-page book on forfeiture law,
points out that the law was long overdue but that it doesn't go to
the heart of the problem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry it doesn't take the profit motive out of law
enforcement,'' Kessler said. ``If that motive were taken out then I
think we would have forfeiture the way it was supposed to be.''

PARAMOUNT SWIMS AGAINST TIDE BY PUTTING SCHLESSINGER ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A humorous television commercial for the Kia Spectra automobile,
which began running this month, ends with a truck driver asking his
male passenger, ``So you're a Pisces, too, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, viewers of ``Dawson's Creek'' on the WB network
will see what is being billed as the first romantic kiss between
two male characters in a prime-time TV entertainment series.
</P>
<P>
   Come the fall, the linchpin of the NBC Must See TV Thursday
prime-time lineup will be ``Will and Grace,'' a sitcom centered on
a buttoned-down gay man and his life with a straight woman and a
gay pal.
</P>
<P>
   And Fox Broadcasting has high hopes for a sitcom for the
2000-2001 season called ``Don't Ask,'' featuring John Goodman as a
divorced father who is gay.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, Paramount Television is introducing a
syndicated talk show featuring Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the
conservative advice maven whose radio audience has listened to her
stern declarations that homosexuality is a deviation from the
biological norm and incompatible with Scripture.
</P>
<P>
   With timing being a crucial factor in the success of television
programming, a question arises: How confident are Paramount
executives about their abilities to swim against the tide?
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Paramount remains fully committed to the Schlessinger
TV program, saying it has no intention to contribute to ``an
environment of hurt, hate or intolerance.'' In a statement last
week, the company described commercial sales as ``strong.''
</P>
<P>
   However, times have changed and the statement may not be enough
to soothe the offended sensibilities of an increasingly diverse
audience. ``Offending gay people is not acceptable the way it may
have been even five years ago,'' said Paul Poux, principal at the
Poux Co. in New York, an agency specializing in marketing to gay
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers are becoming more aware of all their customers,''
he added, ``so maybe standards for talking about gay people are
being brought into line with those for other groups.''
</P>
<P>
   One advertiser making its position clear is Procter &AMP; Gamble,
which sells packaged goods mainstays like Tide, Bounty and Charmin.
It canceled plans to advertise on the TV program, citing the
controversy generated by increasingly angry protests against
Paramount and Schlessinger by gay advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   Other advertisers like More.com, Toysrus.com and Xerox have
either withdrawn from her radio program, announced they would not
sponsor her TV program or both.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Procter &AMP; Gamble, the nation's second-largest
advertiser, is a hurdle for the TV program to overcome because many
advertisers ``would not go below the standards'' of a marketing
giant like P&AMP;G, said Gene DeWitt, chairman and chief executive at
Optimedia International U.S. in New York. His media services
agency, formerly DeWitt Media, is owned by Publicis.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a hit syndicated talk show can generate enormous
profits. It is estimated that ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' earns $300
million annually for King World Productions. And according to The
Hollywood Reporter, ``The Jerry Springer Show'' was being shopped
around last year for $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems sensible to seek a TV talk show host from the ranks
of popular radio talk show hosts. Schlessinger's radio ratings _
second highest among all national talk programs _ suggests she has
loyal followers across the country. Indeed, in its statement last
week, Paramount Television said it would ``expect that the fans of
Dr. Laura will express their disappointment'' with P&AMP;G for
withdrawing its advertising ``without ever having seen the show or
judging it on its own merits.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, radio stars like Rush Limbaugh and Howard Stern, with
legions of loyal fans, have found television tougher than their
regular gigs. Schlessinger, in a recent appearance on ``Larry King
Live'' on CNN, seemed strident and untelegenic.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Paramount executives would suspend production of
the show at this point, DeWitt replied, ``Not if they can still
make money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Morality may have moved as far west as Cincinnati,'' he added,
referring to the headquarters of Procter &AMP; Gamble, ``but it hasn't
made it to the coast yet.''

``(You're Too Kind) A Brief History of Flattery'' (Simon &AMP;

Stengel provides not only a history of flattery and an analysis of
its uses but also a list of flattering do's and don'ts. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   ``Never offer a compliment and ask a favor at the same time,''
``Don't be afraid to flatter people you think already get
enough,''``Never give the same compliment to different people,''
``Never be candid when a person asks you to be candid'' and
``Locate a weakness and praise its opposite.''

   For those who are catching rather than pitching, the author
gives a handy set of directions for answering flattery, including
deconstruction of the following responses:
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you'll speak at my funeral'' (acknowledges the
compliment but shows you don't take it too seriously), silence
(``as aggressive as one gets in rebuffing flattery''), ``You
flatter me'' (thanks the giver, &LR;  but at the same thing accuses him
of an ulterior motive).
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Twist magazine reports that  &UR; Doreen Cott &LR; , who went to the
home of  &UR; Tommy &LR;  and  &UR; Pamela Anderson Lee &LR;  some time ago to give one
of them a massage, is suing both of them, claiming that the bite
their rottweiler inflicted on her butt caused her nerve damage.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEARST TAKES ACTION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Patty Hearst &LR; , who will be a witness when former SLA member
 &UR; Kathleen Soliah &LR;  (now  &UR; Sara Jane Olson &LR; ) goes on trial in August,
told Talk magazine about her practical way _ heiress' privilege _
of dealing with what she doesn't like.
</P>
<P>
   She was only a little disturbed, she said, when she first
learned of PattyHearst.com, a site that was selling T-shirts and
posters. ``It was pretty unsavory. But it was just something you
could ignore. When it changed into the Free Kathy Soliah link,
that's when I completely flipped. I find everything about it
offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a problem that Hearst believed could have been solved
by lawyers. So she bought the site and shut it down.
``PattyHearst.com is closed'' is all that's there now cq &LR; .

announcement that it would not televise the pageant honoring the
 &UR; Queen Mother &LR; 's 100th birthday this summer angered Conservative
newspapers _ ``sad and surprising,'' said the Daily Telegraph _ and
Prime Minister  &UR; Tony Blair &LR; , who told Parliament last week that he

PUBLISHERS USE SECRECY IN HARRY POTTER PROMOTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Mystery and magic are the magnets that draw fans to
Harry Potter, the fictional British
schoolboy-cum-literary-phenomenon who has made millions of pounds
and dollars for its author and publishers. And now the book series'
publicists are trying a little sorcery themselves, casting a spell
of secrecy that they hope will conjure up the book-selling event of
the year, if not the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth volume in the Harry Potter series is set to be
published on July 8 in both Britain and the United States _ unlike
the last three, in which the American releases came several months
after the British. And this time, a substantial degree of effort is
going into ensuring that as little as possible is known about the
book's contents in advance.
</P>
<P>
   There will be, for instance, none of the advance copies that
usually land on reviewers' desks a few months before publication.
No one is promoting prepublication interviews with the author, J.K.
Rowling. Indeed, according to the U.S. and British publishers,
Rowling will be giving no interviews at all until publication day.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is a secret. So is the cover design. Even the title is
supposed to remain closely guarded. All that the British publisher,
Bloomsbury, is prepared to acknowledge is that this fourth and
latest in a planned seven-book series will be a whopping 600 pages
_ twice the length of previous Harry Potters. (The U.S. publisher,
the Arthur A. Levine Books imprint of Scholastic Books, says its
version will be closer to 700 pages because of a different layout
and illustrations.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This book is really under wraps,'' said Judy Corman, a
spokeswoman for Scholastic.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bloomsbury in London, the reason for the secrecy is
the author's wish that children's enjoyment of the book not be
spoiled by advance word about the plot. ``The author was very
concerned about this,'' said Rosamund de la Hey, head of children's
books sales and marketing at Bloomsbury. Both publishers said that
only a handful of people at either house had been given a peek of
the text itself.
</P>
<P>
   But one result of the secrecy, of course, is to stoke the
fevered imaginations of countless children _ and not a few adults _
about a book that is already in such demand that advance Internet
orders kept it near the top of Amazon.com's best-seller list last
week. (It had earlier been No. 1, but was bumped to second place by
advance orders for a thriller to be released on Tuesday by Tyndale
House, ``The Indwelling: The Beast Takes Possession,'' by Tim F.
Lahaye and Jerry B. Jenkins.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is quite a classic marketing ruse,'' Rita Clifton, chief
executive of Interbrand, Newell &AMP; Sorrell, a brand consultancy,
said of the Harry Potter campaign. ``It's like launching a new car.
There is quite obsessive secrecy. All the news is kept under strict
control. And you create a sense of expectation and anticipation.
Any leaks would dilute the excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but Bloomsbury's soaring stock price may benefit,
too. ``Having a lot of Harry Potter razzmatazz all helps,'' said
Louise Barton, a media analyst with the brokerage firm of Investec
Henderson Crosthwaite, even though the Harry Potter books are an
important but not dominant part of Bloomsbury's attraction for
investors. From a one-year low of 2.55 pounds ($3.79) before the
Harry Potter phenomenon zoomed into the stratosphere last year,
Bloomsbury's stock has risen to a close of 7.35 pounds on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The British and American publishers are clearly calculating that
when the floodgates of pent-up demand burst on July 8 the supply
will be there to meet the expected clamor for a book whose
predecessors have sold a combined 20.8 million copies in the United
States and an additional 7 million in Britain and the rest of the
English-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomsbury's first print order is for a million copies,
retailing at 14.99 pounds ($22.50). Scholastic's is for 3.8
million, selling at $25.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the third book in the series _ ``Harry Potter and the
Prisoner of Azkaban'' _ had first-print runs of 900,000 in the
United States and 275,000 in Britain and the rest of the
English-speaking world, which includes markets like Canada, South
Africa and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   When the moment of publication arrives, the secrecy is to give
way to what the publishers plan as an explosion of stunts to
provide what Clifton called ``the dry ice, the puffs of smoke to
heighten the drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Newton, Bloomsbury's chief executive, said that a train
with a steam locomotive would be waiting at a mock-up of the
fictional platform _ platform 9} _ at Kings Cross Station in
London, where, in all four books, Harry Potter slips between the
real and the magical worlds to travel to the Hogwarts boarding
school.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for four days or so, the train will tour several British
cities: Oxford, Birmingham, Manchester, York, Newcastle and Perth.
``That was supposed to be a secret,'' Newton said in an interview
at Bloomsbury's offices in Soho Square.
</P>
<P>
   The train itself _ the oldest in Britain, Newton said, with cars
dating to 1891 and 1912 _ will figure into a marketing maneuver
that some young readers might recognize from Roald Dahl's ``Charlie
and the Chocolate Factory,'' in which children compete furiously
for scarce golden candy wrappers that gain access to Willie Wonka's
magical chocolate factory.
</P>
<P>
   Booksellers will have vouchers to give to the first children in
their shops to buy the new ``Harry Potter,'' Newton said. The
vouchers will buy access to the train when it halts in the stations
along the route, with the author, Rowling, on board to sign copies.
</P>
<P>
   The handouts could very well create the same kind of stampede
for first copies of the book as happened last year, when the third
book in the series was timed for release at 3:45 p.m. in Britain,
just when schools let out.
</P>
<P>
   Newton said the cost of chartering the train was a secret,
though ``less than you might think.'' A spokesman for the company
that rents it out _ both the train and the company are called the
Queen of Scots _ said the usual price was around $22,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   While both the British and the American publishers deny it,
there does seem to be an element of competition worthy of Harry
Potter's fictional game of quidditch over who gets to sell the
books first.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Corman at Scholastic said, many
booksellers are planning to open at midnight on July 7 to cope with
the anticipated rush. Doing so would give the U.S. publishers a
six-hour start on Bloomsbury, which had initially intended to
publish the books at 11 a.m., London time (6 a.m., Eastern Standard
Time). Bloomsbury is now trying to decide when the bookstore doors
should be thrown open, de la Hey said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Scholastic is running a sweepstakes through its
own magazines to provide 5,000 winners with a copy of the new book
delivered on the day of publication. Corman said planes would tow
Harry Potter fliers above U.S. beaches, and at midnight on July 7 a
Harry Potter news ticker will illuminate Times Square. Packs of
promotional materials are being sent to 15,000 U.S. bookstores.

</P>
<P>
   With the books being published on the same day in the United
States and Britain, the publishers hope to pre-empt the kind of
Internet arbitrage that erupted last year when frustrated American
buyers went to British Web sites to buy the third ``Harry Potter''
book before the release of the U.S. edition two months later.
</P>
<P>
   The title, whatever it is, will be the same in both countries,
too _ unlike the first book, which was called ``Harry Potter and
the Philosopher's Stone'' in Britain but ``Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone'' in the United States. But the American edition,
according to both publishers, will be more lavishly illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   For Bloomsbury, the publication will be a high point along a
trail of planned events that the company hopes will keep its sales,
and stock, aloft.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. is planning to release the first Harry Potter movie
next year. Bloomsbury has an expanding list of new and established
authors of literary novels. It has signed a talent-spotting deal
with the Creative Artists Agency in Hollywood. And Bloomsbury's
reference division is developing a series of databases, including a
recently introduced ``Business Bible'' for executives and
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pipeline is very full of major new projects,'' Newton
said, ``and I think the market has recognized that.''

``(You're Too Kind) A Brief History of Flattery'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster; $25) pictures a posterior emblazoned with a lip print.
Stengel provides not only a history of flattery and an analysis of
its uses but also a list of flattering do's and don'ts. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   ``Never offer a compliment and ask a favor at the same time,''
``Don't be afraid to flatter people you think already get
enough,''``Never give the same compliment to different people,''
``Never be candid when a person asks you to be candid'' and
``Locate a weakness and praise its opposite.''

ANALYSIS: FATE UNCLEAR FOR FTC'S PRIVACY PUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Mass., Va.)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Trade Commission plans to go to
Congress this week to seek tough new privacy rules for Internet
businesses. But the nation's consumer protection agency is likely
to encounter skepticism from key Republicans and from industry
groups about the government's ability to impose regulations without
stifling the innovation fueling the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the opposition began mustering its arguments as soon as
the FTC reversed its previous policy by voting on Friday to ask
Congress for new powers to control the ways Internet companies
collect and use information about consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, when the performance of Web sites was rated less
favorably than they are currently being rated, the commission voted
against legislation,'' said Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of
the House Commerce Subcommittee that oversees Internet privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, with the finding that Web sites have improved
dramatically their privacy policies, they are now recommending
legislation,'' he said. ``It seems to be a contradiction that needs
to be understood.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet while high-technology industry groups continue to insist
that any new rules are unwarranted and premature, companies
themselves have differing views on whether new laws are warranted
and, if so, what type.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insists that no legislation is needed. EBay, the
auction giant, indicated that it could support some sort of minimal
regulation if that curtailed states' rights to impose a patchwork
of differing rules. Bell Atlantic said baseline rules could be
useful.
</P>
<P>
   The only common theme expressed by Internet businesses over the
weekend seemed to be that if Congress proceeds with legislation to
regulate consumer privacy protections online, it should do so
cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all sensitive to this issue,'' said Robert Levitan,
chief executive of Flooz.com, which deals in online gift
certificates. ``We know we are in the spotlight and we are going to
be held to a higher standard.''
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick, which places advertising on Web sites on behalf of
other companies, became a lightning rod for online privacy issues
after it disclosed a plan _ since deferred _ to combine consumer
information gathered online with personal data gathered offline
through direct-mail databases and other means.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to think that industry could self-regulate, but I
think we all have accepted the fact that there will be some
regulation,'' Levitan said. ``We're not jumping up and down
complaining about regulation. We're just saying: Let's do it
wisely.''
</P>
<P>
   If caution means going slowly, companies are likely to get their
wish. Given the complexity of election-year politics and the
fast-changing medium involved, most lawmakers agreed that the
chances of passing Internet privacy legislation this year were all
but nil. But this year's debate could set the stage for action in
the next session.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Internet privacy issue in Congress does not split
along party lines, Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., who supports strong
privacy regulation, predicted on Friday that Republicans would
block the consumer protections.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., co-chairman of the House Internet caucus,
responded with the implication that the administration was behind
the FTC move. ``This is an election year, and I think sometimes the
direction they get from up high is to stir this up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it remained unclear over the weekend whether the White
House would back the FTC effort, which comes after the recent
completion of a survey by the commission that found that only about
20 percent of major companies on the Internet had adequate
standards for protecting the privacy of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, the Clinton administration has pushed a
laissez-faire approach to the Internet. And just last week, a top
Commerce Department official told a House hearing on privacy that
self-regulation appeared to be working.
</P>
<P>
   With both parties trying to attract the support _ and dollars _
of the technology industry, the issue could become a tricky one
politically for Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the FTC's survey findings and its legislative
proposal will not be released until the agency conducts briefings
around Washington on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But a government official who has seen the 60-page
recommendation said it would suggest only moderate legislation to
set baseline rules that could be used in conjunction with
self-regulation efforts like the seal programs that are used by
some Web sites to certify that they follow their stated privacy
practices.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of monitoring the progress of privacy on the
Internet, the official said, the FTC had not seen enough protection
to avoid regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one step forward, not a massive leap into a highly
regulated, draconian bureaucratic structure,'' said the official,
who predicted that Tauzin and others would be less critical after
seeing the details of the Web survey and the FTC's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   But industry groups began pre-emptive strikes over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Direct Marketing Association released its own
survey of Web sites showing that 93 percent of major Web sites
posted privacy policies and that most of those gave customers
notice of how that information was used and the opportunity to keep
that information from being transferred to third parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, self-regulation has taken hold with lightning
speed,'' said H. Robert Wientzen, president and chief executive of
the association.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The Information Technology Association of America issued a
statement from its president, Harris Miller, who called the FTC
report ``a first step down the slippery slope of government
regulation of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet company executives, meanwhile, seemed most concerned
about the effect that new regulations might have on innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after the FTC voted on Friday, Microsoft and several
other companies were demonstrating technologies that are being
developed to protect consumers at a weekend privacy retreat in
Leesburg, Va., that was sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's
National Chamber Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Purcell, director of corporate privacy for Microsoft,
pointed to efforts to incorporate privacy protection technologies
into Web-browsing software. ``This is not the proper time to stop
or chill that very substantial effort that is being made,'' Purcell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, DataTreasury Corp., showed lawmakers technology
that allows consumers and businesses to conduct all of their online
transactions through DataTreasury's secure system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever regulations are implemented today may not be relevant
tomorrow,'' said Michael Hershman, chairman of Decision Strategies
Fairfax International, a security company in Fairfax, Va. ``This
technology creates an entirely different mode of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to predict how these regulations might be written
and how they might be enforced,'' he added. ``Once you start down
that road, you are never sure where you might end up. I've seen
many regulations written that you think say one thing and do
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Tauke, an executive with Bell Atlantic, said some action
might be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be steps taken in public policy that can be very
helpful in creating a climate in which businesses can flourish and
consumers' privacy can be protected,'' Tauke said. ``I don't think
that Congress should slow down in the privacy area. I think
Congress should get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies said baseline federal legislation was better
than the patchwork of laws being considered by states.
</P>
<P>
   Tod Cohen, public policy director for eBay in Washington, said,
``We would work with the FTC, Congress and the administration to
develop a national standard'' _ provided it pre-empted further
action by states to regulate Internet privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan agreed. ``We need a uniform code across the country,''
he said. ``We need a standard law on privacy and taxation. But
let's do it wisely and make it easy for Internet companies to
comply.''

E-COMMERCE: THE DAUNTING GLOBAL VILLAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Falling stock prices are not the only numbers giving e-commerce
executives heartburn these days. Equally unsettling to some
Internet merchants is the flood of statistics suggesting that to
keep their businesses growing, they have to look outside the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   A report to be released Monday by IDC, an Internet research
firm, predicts that two-thirds of all e-commerce spending will take
place outside the country by 2003. In that year, IDC says, consumer
spending on Web sites in the United States will reach $119 billion,
but overseas sites will garner $209 billion of business.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, with the investment community demanding that Web
merchants find a speedier path to profitability, the merchants can
hardly justify the expenses associated with rolling out sites aimed
at other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Those expenses can be substantial. According to Eric Schmitt, an
analyst with the Forrester Research consulting firm, retailers can
spend ``a couple million dollars in the first year of international
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And this is a treadmill,'' he said. ``You don't just build the
Spanish version and walk away. It's a beast that needs to be fed.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Boo.com, a British fashion e-tailer, went out of
business a mere six months after its public stock offering. Boo.com
had quickly become insolvent _ in large part because of the strain
of trying to start up in 18 different countries simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Parr, author of the IDC report, said that even when
e-commerce companies have the money to devote to overseas
expansion, ``these markets can be very difficult to address.'' In
addition to the obvious language hurdles, he said e-tailers faced
regulatory challenges with import and export rules, taxation and
technology issues, and wrinkles in each country's customer service
and fulfillment approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives said that any of these items could, if
mishandled, torpedo a company's international efforts. But
fulfillment issues are particularly problematic. When the
e-commerce trend took off two years ago, some analysts predicted
that Web merchants would overturn traditional retailing, which
tended to be based on customers who shop within 10 miles of their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that revolutionary sentiment partly fueled investors'
enthusiasm for companies like Amazon.com and CDNow, which quickly
found customers throughout the world who were willing to shop on
their sites. But in the last year consumers and businesses have
acknowledged that many customers prefer to do business with
retailers that can serve them both on the Web and in a local store
if they want to return items.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, analysts said, consumers want to shop with an
Internet retailer that can handle customer service problems and
returns from the same continent.
</P>
<P>
   For Web merchants with global aspirations, that frequently means
building and staffing customer service centers on different
continents _ as Amazon did when it set up a phone center in the
Netherlands this year _ as well as working with local distributors
or manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such a daunting list of investment and cultural
challenges, Parr of IDC said globalization plans were imperative
for Internet retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell companies that before they leap into wireless
initiatives, they should figure out their international strategy.
It has to be part of the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   In devising that strategy, analysts say one crucial decision is
how a company manages its foreign Web sites. On one hand, if a
company chooses to manage the global operations from the United
States, its foreign sites are far more prone to make linguistic and
merchandising mistakes _ for instance, selling goods that might be
offensive in certain cultures, or offering product instructions
that are delivered with the wrong tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, you wouldn't say `Don't turn the left knob,' because
that's too direct,'' said Charles Baxter, chief executive of
eTranslate, a consulting company. ``You'd say something like `It
would be much better to turn the right knob.'''

 UNDATED: right knob.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Such mistakes are less likely if companies hire a team in each
foreign market to handle the Web site, analysts said. But that,
too, can lead to problems for companies trying to convey a
consistent brand message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers can spot inconsistencies,'' Forrester's Schmitt
said. ``If you have to deal in multiple countries, you don't want
10 sites with a different look and feel at every one, and companies
don't want to have 10 different backend systems.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest successes in e-commerce globalization was
Dell Computer, which began selling on the Web in 1996 and now has
sites aimed at 85 different countries and territories. According to
Frank Muehleman, senior vice president of Dell's worldwide
division, the company uses a decentralized approach with its
international sites.
</P>
<P>
   Dell created a common technology platform for each of its global
sites, including a template for ordering and product information,
which ensures a consistent user experience across the sites. In
addition, several hundred specialists give advice and training to
the local managers. ``Then we let the local team handle the
rollout,'' Muehleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, Muehleman said, Dell built manufacturing
plants in each of the regions it serves, including Brazil, Ireland,
China and Malaysia. And because the company employs local customer
service staff, he said, ``every time a customer picks up the phone,
they're dealing with someone local.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet companies that have been the most active on the
global front are the so-called portals, like Yahoo, Alta Vista and
Lycos _ which last week agreed to be acquired by Terra Networks,
the Internet arm of the Spanish telecommunications company
Telefonica de Espana. The portals' expansion into other nations,
while not easy, has been a relative snap compared with the travails
of companies that must actually move goods across borders.
</P>
<P>
   And even e-commerce companies that do not sell goods on the Web,
like financial firms, have encountered plenty of obstacles in other
countries. When the online broker Schwab.com started a site for
clients in Britain in 1998, for instance, many customers there
balked at online trading because they were accustomed to exchanging
paper stock certificates in each transaction. Chiefly because
Schwab.com refused to give paper certificates to its online
customers, the site generated just 15,000 new accounts between June
1998 and June 1999, according to Russ Shaw, senior vice president
of marketing for Charles Schwab Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The site then offered 30 days of commission-free trading to new
customers last summer, and generated nearly 30,000 new customers in
about two months. For both the customers and Schwab, Shaw said,
``it's been an education process.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that most e-commerce companies are reluctant to
begin that process, given the already steep learning curve they
have encountered in the domestic market. But some alternatives may
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   American e-tailers, for example, could form partnerships with
retailers in other nations that want e-commerce sites of their own
but lack the expertise to build them. Parr, the IDC analyst, said
that under such an approach, an American e-tailer could lend its
technology, and perhaps its name, to a foreign counterpart, which
in turn would offer its local distribution and customer service
systems and expertise. The companies would then share the revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Martin McClanan, chief executive of RedEnvelope, a gift site,
said he had been approached several times with similar offers, but
so far he had demurred. ``Our plan is to bring this business to
scale in the U.S. first,'' he said. ``Then, when we can dedicate a
20-person team to another country, we'll do that.'' The company
might consider global expansion plans after this holiday season, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy to want to boil the ocean and do everything,'' he
said. ``But in retail it's all about execution. And getting this
business to profitability is still first and foremost.''

   CLINTON-CHINA (Washington) _ For seven years now, very little
has gone as planned in Bill Clinton's effort to shape a new
relationship with China. The problem has not been lack of vision;
it has been one of execution. The Chinese have hardly cooperated,
jailing more dissidents even as Clinton argued that economic
freedom would eventually produce political freedom. Nor has there
been much help from the president's fellow Democrats, most of whom
have fought his trade and China policies at every turn. And Clinton
himself tells close colleagues he has let political calculations
lead him into major mistakes in dealing with China. By David E.

   NATIONAL _ James Truchard was reading at home one night last
winter when a TV news program in the background caught his
attention. A device developed at MIT was being used to enable
paralysis victims to use thought to move their arms. Though the
program didn't mention it, Truchard immediately realized that
National Instruments' technology was part of the MIT device. But
the company founded by three UT grads in the 1970s will make sure
its carefully selected job recruits hear about the technology,
because making a contribution is one of the lures it employees to
hire and retain young engineers and others. Little known even in
Austin, National Instruments has built a reputation of innovation
among scientists around the world. But the company's carefully
managed growth and stability is being challenged by the Internet,
and Wall Street would be happier if it grew faster. (Mahoney,

2 HONORED FOR BALLOON CATHETER AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the eighth grade in the late 1940s, Thomas J. Fogarty, in
order to help his widowed mother make ends meet, went to work at
Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati, cleaning medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he got to high school, the hospital promoted him to
scrub technician. ``So at a very early age I saw a lot of
surgery,'' said Fogarty, who often witnessed the complications
arising from blood clots, which surgeons struggled to remove with
forceps after a large part of an artery had been cut open.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Fogarty was awarded the annual Lemelson-MIT Prize to
inventors for his Fogarty Embolectomy Catheter, an invention that
revolutionized vascular surgery after he published a paper
describing the device in 1963. Still the world's most widely used
catheter for blood-clot removal, the Fogarty balloon catheter was
the progenitor of a family tree of balloon catheters used for a
wide range of surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Fogarty, 66, envisioned his balloon catheter while still a
student at the University of Cincinnati Medical School. Working in
his attic, he fashioned a prototype by snipping the pinkie finger
off a surgical glove and then _ using fly-tying knots he had
learned while fishing as a boy _ attaching it to a catheter.
</P>
<P>
   With Fogarty's invention, surgeons make small incisions and
insert the catheter, with the balloon not yet inflated, into the
artery. After threading the catheter down the artery so that the
balloon passes the clot, the balloon is inflated and retracted,
pulling the clot along with it.
</P>
<P>
   Fogarty, of Portola Valley, Calif., is a professor of surgery at
Stanford University and a practicing surgeon. He is also a
successful entrepreneur who develops medical devices through his
company, Fogarty Engineering, and a venture capitalist who funds
budding medical companies through Three Arch Partners. He also owns
a 325-acre eponymously named vineyard west of Palo Alto that
produces 15,000 cases of wine annually.
</P>
<P>
   The Lemelson-MIT prize, which comes with a $500,000 purse, is
awarded by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the
Lemelson Foundation. The prize is named for the late Jerome H.
Lemelson, a prolific inventor whose mechanisms were used in the fax
machine, the supermarket checkout scanner, the Sony Walkman and
other devices.
</P>
<P>
   Fogarty _ who credits his childhood deprivation with much of his
entrepreneurial drive _ said he planned to give the prize money to
charity. It is the award itself that is important, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that this award is being given to a physician,
particularly one who is in practice, is meaningful,'' said Fogarty,
noting that such awards are usually given to academics who conduct
basic research. ``You can spend your whole life in a basic research
lab,'' he said, ``but until something is implemented and used by
people, it doesn't bring real social value.''
</P>
<P>
   WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another inventor, Al Gross, 82, received the Lemelson-MIT
Lifetime Achievement Award for Invention. And last week the Federal
Communications Commission sent him a letter of commendation.
</P>
<P>
   Gross, a pioneer in wireless communications, has received
patents over the years for technologies that anticipated inventions
ranging from garage door openers to cell phones and paging systems.
Alas, he notes, the patents expired before any of those devices
came into common use. ``Otherwise I'd be as rich as Bill Gates,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gross was introduced to radio transmissions at age 9, when his
parents took him on a Lake Erie steamer cruise. The ship's wireless
operator beckoned him to come into the communications room and give
a listen. He was hooked. By the time he was 12, he had patched
together his own ham radio from junkyard parts. At age 16, he
earned his amateur radio operator's license. But Gross was restless
being anchored to the desk-bound ham radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be able to walk around and talk to other hams,''
Gross said. He experimented with a hand-held radio that made use of
unexploited frequencies above 100 megahertz. By 1938 he had created
a mobile ham radio that worked. He dubbed it the ``walkie-talkie.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon came World War II, and Gross, then 22, was invited down to
Washington to demonstrate his walkie-talkie in front of William J.
Donovan, the founder of the Office of Strategic Services _ the
precursor to the CIA. ``Donovan liked the idea,'' Gross said. ``He
recruited me and converted me from a civilian to a captain.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross' top-secret mission in the OSS was to develop a two-way
air-to-ground voice communications system so that spies in enemy
territory could transmit information to allied pilots flying
overhead. By 1941, Gross had perfected such a system. The Joint
Chiefs of Staff later said the project, code-named
``Joan-Eleanor,'' was among the Allies' ``most successful wireless
intelligence-gathering operations, saving millions of lives by
shortening the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the end of the war, Gross demonstrated the OSS
walkie-talkie to the Federal Communications Commission's chairman,
E.K. Jett, who was so impressed he wrote an article for the
Saturday Evening Post titled ``Phone Me By Air.'' The article
announced the creation of a Citizens' Radio Communications Service
that would allow for private, short-range radio transmissions. In
it, Jett marveled at the possibilities of what he referred to as
``handie-talkies.''
</P>
<P>
   A staged photo accompanying the article featured a milkman
talking into a radio that, minus the antenna, somewhat resembles a
modern-day cell phone, except that it is about the size of a large
loaf of bread. ``Handie-talkies may result in a civilian world
seething with airborne languages,'' the caption predicts. ``Even
the milkman can be reached en route and told to go back and leave
an extra quart of Grade-A for Ramsay.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross, who left the OSS to form his own electronics company, was
the first to get a citizens' band license from the FCC. His target
market was not milkmen but farmers who, while they were in the
fields on their tractors, wanted to keep in touch with their wives
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was developing new ideas, among them a paging system for
doctors that he introduced in 1949, according to Gross, who long
ago gave up running his own company but is still working, as a
staff engineer for the Orbital Sciences Corp. in Chandler, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The pager apparently was an idea way before its time. ``The
doctors hated it,'' Gross said. ``They complained that it would
interrupt their golf games.''
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

 &HT;    AMID DELAYS AND MIX-UPS, HAITIANS HOLD NATIONAL ELECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ This troubled nation lurched toward
recovering its pride and a functioning government Sunday as
national elections were held for the first time in several years.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was marred by delays and bureaucratic mix-ups,
prompting angry criticism from opposition leaders who feared the
results would be tainted by fraud.
</P>
<P>
   A Haitian radio station reported that a policeman was shot and
killed by supporters of a minor party candidate who had been
arrested on election fraud charges, but the report could not be
immediately confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   It was also too early to draw any conclusions about the success
of the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Voting was postponed indefinitely in one of Haiti's nine
jurisdictions because of party squabbling. And with most ballots to
be counted by hand, there was no way to tell what percentage of
registered voters participated or whether the election was free of
widespread irregularities. A firm tally wasn't expected for days.
</P>
<P>
   But after three postponements in the past six months left many
questioning whether Haiti could hold an election at all, some
observers were heartened simply by the sight of people lining up at
polling places and casting their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been lots of complications, but it's a big
improvement over the past,'' said Anne Marie Issa(cq), general
manager of one of the country's radio stations, which had a team of
reporters monitoring the voting. ``The security is good and the
people want to vote very badly. The problem is in the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls were scheduled to open at 6 a.m., but dozens of stations
didn't open until hours later, with some not receiving their
ballots until mid-morning. There were scattered reports of poll
workers refusing to show up because they had not been paid, and
that election monitors from some of the political parties were
barred from watching the proceedings at several polling sites.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leader Gerard Pierre-Charles(cq) called the delays
``sabotage,'' and told reporters that banning monitors from polling
sites could lead to fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   In the teeming slum of Cite Soleil near the Port-au-Prince
waterfront, Beaugil Fenel(cq) waited nearly seven hours to vote,
standing with hundreds of others before a dilapidated fisherman's
hall that served as the polling site. The stench of raw sewage from
scum-filled ditches filled the air, and the decrepit building
swarmed with people, many shouting and pushing, holding their voter
registration cards over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I arrived here at 5 a.m. and they didn't open until about 10
a.m.,'' said Fenel, who finally cast his ballot around 1 p.m.
``Everyone wants to vote because this election is important for
Haiti. Maybe this vote will bring change, and help improve our
economy. But it has been very frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Soleil district is a hotbed of support for former Haitian
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the country's most powerful
politician. His Lavalas Family Party was backing hundreds of
candidates for seats in Parliament and local governments, hoping to
pave the way for Aristide's re-election as president in the coming
fall election.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders have charged Aristide's cronies with trying
to manipulate the vote through violence and intimidation. Some 15
people were murdered in the months leading up to the election, with
most of the victims coming from opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide and his supporters have denied the charges, and police
have been unable to solve any of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of international election observers fanned out across the
country to monitor the proceedings, although they weren't expected
to make any conclusive statements until they had a chance to
discuss their impressions after the polls closed.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Leo, an observer from the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe,
checked several dozen polling stations by mid-day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the stations started late because they didn't have the
ballots,'' he said. ``But everything has been calm and there
haven't been any problems with security, so far.''
</P>
<P>
   During Haiti's tumultuous 1987 election, more than 30 people
were killed, some gunned down in the streets and their bodies left
there for hours. The country's most recent election in 1997 was
tossed out after widespread fraud tainted the results.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti has had no functioning Parliament since early 1999, and
has lost about $500 million in international aid because donor
nations and groups have been unwilling to send money to a country
with no legislature to oversee its distribution. The country of 8
million is the hemisphere's poorest nation, with an annual per
capita income of $200 to $500, and an estimated illiteracy rate of
80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The current president, Rene Preval _ who took office in 1996 as
Aristide's handpicked successor _ has repeatedly postponed the
elections, ruling the country by decree.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the postponements, some observers held high hopes for
the balloting, partly because a U.S.-backed drive drew millions of
new voters to register.
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear how many of the 4 million registered voters
would actually go to the polls, and the long delays in opening the
stations clearly hampered the proceedings. Downtown Port-au-Prince
was eerily quiet early Sunday, with police blocking off many
streets and the city's ubiquitous small taxis, called Tap-Taps,
banned from the roadways.
</P>
<P>
   Lines of a hundred or more voters stood outside several polling
places, although many didn't get to vote until mid-day because of
the snafus over delivering ballots and opening the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Wigens Joassaint(cq), 22, waited several hours to cast his first
ballot as a voting adult. He hoped the election might bring
positive change, but said Haiti's economy is in such a shambles
that it might take more than a single election to turn things
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure the election will really change things because
our leaders have no plan,'' he said. ``There are no jobs here, and
they aren't offering anything to us. I believe the only thing that
can really help Haiti is God.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This past weekend, daytime temperatures only reached the middle
50s along the Northeast Seaboard as a damp flow of air from the
Atlantic delivered chilly air to the region. Another cool day will
cover the coastal Northeast on Monday with plenty of clouds and the
risk for a few showers as low pressure slides off the New Jersey
coast. Farther south, partial sunshine and humid air will cover the
Southeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably warmer air will reach the Middle West and Ohio Valley
as a warm front passes east across the area. The warmer conditions
may be accompanied by a brief thunderstorm in spots.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the West will stay unseasonably hot with afternoon
readings exceeding 100 degrees across interior California and the
Southwestern deserts.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: OZONE POLLUTION
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, an ``ozone'' watch was posted for portions of
Texas as concentrations of the harmful pollutant were expected to
reach unhealthful levels. Ozone in the upper atmosphere is a gas
that protects humans from the sun's ultraviolet radiation. However,
an increase in ozone near the earth's surface can be the harmful
byproduct of hot weather. Sunlight reacts with hydrocarbons and
carbon monoxide emitted by automobiles and industries to produce
ozone. When winds are light, ozone concentrations can increase to
levels that irritate the eyes and throat and damage vegetation. &QL;

NEW ECONOMY: LAW FIRMS SEE A BILL COME DUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider this logic problem: Event A causes Event B. B then
causes C, and C causes D. Now assume A had never happened. Would D
have ever occurred?
</P>
<P>
   This is the multimillion-dollar hypothetical question that the
nation's top corporate lawyers find themselves uncomfortably
pondering after a wild five months that have altered the American
legal industry. If the answer to the question is no _ and there is
some strong evidence to support that conclusion _ then the
country's most prestigious law firms appear to have given
themselves an unnecessary and expensive headache.
</P>
<P>
   In their pain are lessons about the problems that overvalued
equity prices can cause even for businesses that seem to have
little relation to the stocks in question.
</P>
<P>
   The legal world's chain reaction had its beginnings last year in
Silicon Valley. With fast-growing Internet companies desperate for
employees, the Bay Area's law firms became prime hunting grounds.
Dozens of young, well-educated associates were more than happy to
accept the offers, leaving behind legal work that can resemble
drudgery to receive stock options that could be worth millions.
Turnover at the law firms soon hit new highs.
</P>
<P>
   The young lawyers' bosses began responding just before the new
year. Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin &AMP; Hachigian, a
small firm in Menlo Park, Calif., led the way, increasing
associates' salaries as much as 40 percent. Larger Bay Area firms
quickly matched and, to avoid morale problems, extended the raises
to lawyers in offices around the country.
</P>
<P>
   That was the key moment, the one that turned a local problem _
the dot-com talent war _ into a national phenomenon. The biggest
New York firms, which had always paid the highest salaries in the
nation, then had little choice but to match the increases or risk
losing their best lawyers to the East Coast branches of their
California rivals. By the spring, first-year associates at top
firms across the country were earning $125,000 a year, not
including annual bonuses that often exceed $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, however, something ironic was happening. At the
very companies stealing the lawyers, stock prices stopped rising.
Between Jan. 1 and April 1, the Morgan Stanley Internet index fell
5 percent. In April, as everybody now knows, the real drop came.
The index lost an additional 30 percent of its value in the first
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of dot-com companies, running through their cash and no
longer confident of being able to turn to the capital markets for
another infusion, began to conduct business differently. Private
companies had to delay their initial public offerings, making them
less able to offer rich salary packages. Suddenly, the value of
millions of stock options was in question.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rapid change from the two previous years, when many of
the lawyers who left behind law firm life for the Internet quickly
became millionaires, at least on paper. ``It appeared to people for
a while that if you reached for the brass ring, you grasped it,''
said Frederick Muto, a partner who oversees the San Diego office of
Cooley Godward, one of the firms with headquarters in Silicon
Valley. ``That perception has changed already.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is predictable: Turnover at many California law firms
has returned to normal levels. The big raises have surely played
some role in the decrease, but both partners and associates say the
biggest factor has been the technology slump. After all, notes
William F. Lee, the managing partner of Hale &AMP; Dorr in Boston, ``we
could never pay people enough'' to match the upside of stock
options.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what happened in the San Francisco office of Brobeck
Phleger &AMP; Harrison, another big California firm. On April 14 _ the
same day the Nasdaq hit its low for the year _ the lawyers there
held a going-away party for a senior associate who was quitting to
join an Internet company. On Saturday, a venture-capital firm
backed out of a large investment it had been planning to make in
the company. On Sunday, the lawyer called a partner to ask if she
could have her job back. On Monday, she was sitting in her office
again ``as if nothing had ever happened,'' said Tower C. Snow Jr.,
the firm's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Brobeck's turnover rate for associates is running at an
annual pace of about 16 percent this year. Because many fewer
lawyers have left in the last two months than in January and
February, Snow said he expected the final number to be close to 11
percent, the same as in 1998. Last year, by contrast, nearly
one-fourth of all Brobeck associates quit the firm.
</P>
<P>
   So the match that started the brush fire that grew into a forest
fire has now been extinguished. The lawyers who run the large firms
are reluctant to say they regret giving the raises _ which would be
tantamount to saying their own employees are overvalued _ but many
partners agree that had the market downturn come sooner, salaries
might not be at their current level.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the environment would have been
different,'' said Alan S. Jaffe, the chairman of Proskauer Rose in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Snow added: ``A lot of the firms were very, very unhappy to make
the adjustments. I'm sure they're even more unhappy now.''
</P>
<P>
   One could argue that the firms overreacted in the first place
and that the decline of many technology stocks in early 2000 should
have suggested that the associate exodus would soon slow. On the
other hand, any individual firm that did not give raises risked
losing lawyers immediately, as would probably happen if the firms
now tried to scale back salaries to their earlier levels.
</P>
<P>
   For the most profitable firms, the raises may do little other
than cut the partners' annual pay by a hundred thousand dollars or
so. But some firms are already considering steps that include
raising their billing rates, cutting back on hiring, using
lawyer-for-hire agencies more often and even withdrawing from some
areas of the law. The drying up of the market for initial public
offerings and the Federal Reserve's recent interest-rate increases
could make cost-cutting more urgent if the lawyers' revenue begins
to slow, too.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the nation's biggest law firms are learning a
tough lesson about a downside of the new economy. For everybody
else, the moral of the story may be more familiar: Be wary of
accepting investment advice from your lawyer.

 &HT;    National Instruments quietly grows up

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Like many high-tech entrepreneurs, Jim Truchard
dabbled in science as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   But it turned out to be much more than a hobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made little crystal radios because we didn't have
electricity,'' said Truchard, who grew up reading by kerosene
lantern. ``My dad just didn't like the idea of electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   What sets Truchard _ who wound up getting a Ph.D. in electrical
engineering from the University of Texas _ apart from many
successful entrepreneurs, however, may not be his background so
much as his company and its culture.
</P>
<P>
   Truchard, 56, is chief executive of National Instruments Corp.,
a test-and-measurement company that had $330 million in sales last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Profitable since its founding in 1976, the company has increased
sales and earnings by at least 20 percent annually 15 of the past
16 years, a time span that would seem like ancient history to many
of today's technology startups. Its stock, which closed at $8.17 on
its first day of trading five years ago, finished at $38 on Friday.
Truchard, like his company, has managed the growth with steadiness
that is winning kudos from employees and industry watchers.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Fortune magazine named National Instruments No. 77
on its list of top 100 companies to work for. Two months later,
Worth magazine listed Truchard No. 32 among the top 50 CEOs for
increasing company success and wealth. The May 29 issue of Forbes
includes National Instruments in a package that names Austin the
No. 1 place to put a business.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is making strides against its competitors. Its
most successful product, called LabView, has become the de facto
standard software for enabling PCs to imitate test-and-measure
equipment that measures sound and electrical waves. It is an
industry long dominated by Agilent Technologies Inc., formerly part
of Hewlett-Packard Co. and a customer of National Instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a world where ``high tech'' has become a catch-all for
everything from pagers that connect to the Internet to genetic
manipulation, the innovations at National Instruments' Northwest
Austin campus scarcely register beyond a small community of
analysts, scientists and engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Truchard said he was reading at home one night last winter when
a TV news report caught his attention. A national cable channel
showed a paralyzed man who moved his arm with brain waves sent by
wires connected to his skull to equipment strapped to his wrist.
The equipment included National Instruments' technology, yet the
Austin company didn't warrant a mention.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they do,'' said stock analyst Joel Pitt, with Credit
Suisse First Boston, ``is not readily understood by a lot of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   GARAGE STARTUP
</P>
<P>
   What National Instruments does today evolved from a garage in
Austin in the mid-1970.
</P>
<P>
   Truchard and two other scientists, Jeff Kodosky and William
Nowlin, started the company with $3,000 and a $10,000 bank loan.
Kodosky is vice president of research and development. Nowlin
retired in 1996. Both still serve on the company's board.
</P>
<P>
   The three had worked together at the University of Texas Applied
Research Labs, where they measured sound waves and other electrical
signals with Hewlett-Packard oscilloscopes and voltage meters
connected to Hewlett-Packard minicomputers.
</P>
<P>
   H-P's test-and-measurement equipment was the industry standard,
but scientists could only use it with H-P minicomputers. The three
young scientists, working in Truchard's garage, designed a device
that connected H-P's boxes to minicomputers made by Digital
Equipment Corp.
</P>
<P>
   That general-purpose interface bus, or GPIB, is one of about 700
products listed today in National Instruments' 2000 catalog. Most
are manufactured on the company's wooded 20-acre campus in
Northwest Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Pursuing Truchard's goal of measured growth, National
Instruments started writing software that could interpret data.
That lead to the introduction of LabView in 1986. Riding in the
wake of Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp., National Instruments
released LabView for PCs in 1992. Last year, the company adapted
LabView for use in factories to respond to assembly-line problems
immediately without shutting them down.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's a software program, LabView frees scientists and
researchers from writing their own code. They choose the tasks they
want done by pulling down menus on their computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they bring to the table is really a disruptive
technology,'' said Pitt, the analyst, using a phrase from the book
``Innovator's Dilemma,'' a must-read among executives,
entrepreneurs and venture capitalists these days.
</P>
<P>
   Like other ``disruptive technologies,'' LabView has the
potential to force competitors to offer something similar. That is
a major challenge for Agilent, whose business relies heavily on
oscilloscopes and other measurement devices.
</P>
<P>
   But National Instruments is moving too slowly for some. While it
is available on Unix and Macintosh operating systems and the
variety of microprocessors that run them, National Instruments has
focused its efforts on supporting industry standards set by
Microsoft's Windows and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They recognized before long, they were riding the Wintel R&AMP;D
curve,'' said John Barr, an analyst with New York equities firm
Needham &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   That is a shortcoming to some members of the Linux community,
which wants to see more open-source codes from software companies.
</P>
<P>
   Przemek Klosowski is a physicist at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md. He's studying neutron
patterns in compounds such as concrete and plastic, which is a way
of understanding their properties and perhaps leading to
improvements in strength, elasticity and durability.
</P>
<P>
   He said researchers using Linux have been frustrated waiting for
National Instruments to release hardware drivers that allow LabView
and the general-purpose interface bus on Linux. Moreover, the
company is reluctant to release code that enables people like
Klosowski to adapt its hardware themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been releasing some information, but not all,'' he
said. As a result, last year he bought a $400 connector from
another company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always an ongoing challenge in a world with multiple
players,'' said Ron Wolfe, director of strategic marketing for
National Instruments.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company is releasing more drivers for Linux systems,
but it's more profitable to focus on dominant technology such as
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   GROWING TOO SLOWLY
</P>
<P>
   In a time when a high-flying tech company's stock can double or
quadruple in a matter of months, National Instruments has a small
number of shareholders who believe it is growing too slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors tell me, `You're not taking as many risks as you
could,' '' Truchard said. But ``for employees, stability is very
important. We're a safe haven when people look at the
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   With annual growth rates of 20 percent or better, National
Instruments already is growing nearly twice as fast as the
test-and-measurement industry, said analyst Barr, who rates the
company a ``strong buy.'' ``They're in it for the long term,'' he
said. ``If it comes down to choosing between even 1 cent (per
share) in earnings, or investing it in R&AMP;D, you can bet they'll put
it in R&AMP;D.''
</P>
<P>
   And with its stock price up some 450 percent since its initial
public offering, there are plenty of happy shareholders _ including
many of the 300 employees who hold options and the scores of former
workers who are now retired.
</P>
<P>
   Retiree Melodie Sommersett met Truchard in 1982 when she was a
22-year-old intern. She started referring to him as Dr. T, a name
that stuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was calling him `Jim.' I felt strange calling him
`Jim,' '' Sommersett recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Now 40, Sommersett directed one of National Instruments'
engineering projects until the company went public in 1995. Her
return from the IPO enabled her to quit and start a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come back once a year for the stockholders meeting,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Dr. T's 13 million shares are worth almost $600
million. Three years ago, he asked the board to freeze his annual
salary at $195,797. He gets a bonus based on the same formula as
his lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way for the boy from Columbus, Texas, who grew up in
a house without electricity and whose mother made the family's
bread in a wood stove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was jealous of the kids who got the fancy store bread,''
Truchard said.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: NETWORKS GIRD FOR BATTLE WITH `MILLIONAIRE' 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, as the broadcast television networks paraded their
new offerings before their most important constituency, the
advertisers, one question loomed above all others: How much Regis
is too much Regis?
</P>
<P>
   Flush with the staggering and totally unexpected success of its
game show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (a show that was not
even scheduled at this time last year), ABC threw down the gauntlet
to its competitors by spreading ``Millionaire'' and its host, Regis
Philbin, suddenly the biggest star in television, all over its new
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Next fall, ``Millionaire'' will be seen four nights a week, to
the exclusion of most everything else on ABC. The network added
only four new shows, the fewest ever, meaning it had decided to
ride the golden goose of ``Millionaire'' to glory or disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps speaking more from hope than conviction, executives at
the competing networks were whispering a bit more loudly at their
post-announcement parties last week that ``Millionaire'' may have
peaked, that its audience was aging and that some shows, like NBC's
``Frasier,'' were starting to prove that quality programming can
beat it.
</P>
<P>
   The message from ABC's competitors, except CBS, was: the way to
beat ``Millionaire'' is to go for the young viewer. Each network
cited the eye-catching statistic about the median age of the
``Millionaire'' viewer, and how it has edged up from 42, when the
show had its summer run last August, to 51 last week.
</P>
<P>
   Shows are usually considered to be losing their appeal for
younger viewers if the median age climbs by more than one year in a
season. Audience age has always been a closely watched factor with
``Millionaire'' because game shows generally appeal mainly to older
viewers. One reason ``Millionaire'' was dismissed as no threat by
the other networks before it went on the air was for that reason.
</P>
<P>
   But ABC professes to be unconcerned, saying that ``Millionaire''
had maintained its appeal to a remarkable degree and that only the
arrival of Daylight Saving Time has really had an impact on the age
of its audience, because young people tend to stay out later.
</P>
<P>
   Stu Bloomberg, the co-chairman of ABC Entertainment, noted that
the younger audience numbers for other networks had fallen off this
spring far more than the numbers for ``Millionaire.'' ``I'm not
worried at all,'' he said, ``because the 18-to-49-year-old numbers
for this show are still incredibly strong. They may be off from the
show's initial burst, but believe me, I'll take these numbers.'' As
for the first whispered predictions of vulnerability for the show,
Bloomberg was happy to cite how often rumors of demise have been
exaggerated since first evoked by Mark Twain.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most interesting showdown involving ``Millionaire''
will take place on Wednesday nights at 8 next fall. Far from
running from the ABC juggernaut, three networks aim to challenge
the show with new series at that hour. That was unexpected, but
each network has its reasons.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, for example, will introduce ``Titans,'' a steamy new soap
opera from the Aaron Spelling factory, hoping to snare the fans who
are now bereft of ``Beverly Hills 90210.'' Fox is going with
comedy, aiming to steal away younger viewers by bringing back John
Goodman as a gay family man in a show called ``Don't Ask.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS is making perhaps the boldest move by placing its highest
profile new show there, a comedy starring Bette Midler. CBS needs
to get comedy started on a night other than Monday and is convinced
it can establish a beachhead on Wednesday. A number of advertising
and television executives seemed to agree in comments during last
week's round of parties: ``The Bette Show'' was widely cited as one
of the new season's stronger contenders.
</P>
<P>
   As one senior television studio executive _ neutral in terms of
both the show and the network _ put it: ``That was the most
impressive programming play to me. Bette Midler seems like an
electric star who should work big time on television.''
</P>
<P>
   But few shows were receiving consistent support. Among the new
entries that many of the executives seemed to favor were ``Geena,''
an ABC comedy starring Geena Davis, regarded as highly compatible
with the show it is partnered with, ``Dharma and Greg''; ``Gilmore
Girls,'' the latest youth drama from WB, though this one does
feature some adults along with the usual teen-agers; ``The
Fugitive,'' a new take on the television classic, on CBS;
``Fearsum,'' a thriller on Fox from the makers of ``The Blair Witch
Project''; and ``The Street,'' a Fox soap opera about Wall Street
traders, billed as a male ``Sex and the City,'' since it comes from
the same producer.
</P>
<P>
   The network that seemed to inspire the most detractors was
clearly NBC, whose new shows failed to impress. Several of the NBC
shows are already heading back for serious revision, headed by
``The Michael Richards Show,'' which NBC is nevertheless counting
on to start off its Tuesday night schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our shows are pretty horrible,'' one senior NBC executive said
in a moment of candor. ``But worst of all they seem totally
unfocused.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive noted that NBC has always been known for smart,
sophisticated, urban comedies, and said it was sorely in need of
new ones right now. But the comedies NBC introduced last week were
mostly broad in style. Several longtime NBC executives reported
that the new schedule stirred some less-than-favorable reviews from
some of the network's top management.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how good or bad the new shows may be, all of them face
the problem of making a successful debut. That is because this fall
will be the first in television history without a specific premiere
week. It will be the first television season in which no new series
will be introduced in September. Instead, the season will start
officially the first week in October. The reason: NBC will fill the
last two and half weeks of September with Olympics coverage from
Australia, and except for ABC and ``Millionaire,'' no network is
going to use new shows to compete against that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we marketed and launched new shows before the Olympics,
we'd probably have to do it all again after they were over,'' said
Sandy Grushow, chairman of Fox Entertainment. ``So it makes more
sense to keep our powder dry.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that October is not going to provide any better
chance for a clean starting week to the season. The very first week
of October will bring the baseball playoffs, which will interrupt
schedules at both Fox and NBC, and Oct. 3 will be the night of the
first presidential debate. The vice presidential debate will
probably be staged the following Sunday, and the Wednesday after
that is expected to bring a second presidential debate.
</P>
<P>
   The big networks will interrupt their schedules for all those
events. After that comes the World Series and a week later the
November sweeps period begins. There will also be an election night
to contend with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nightmare,'' Bloomberg said.

HOMING IN ON `INTELLIGENT' WEB DESIGN  
 SCENTS OF THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Agilent. Naviant. Novient. Scient. Teligent. Are the new
economy's neologisms starting to blur?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, a certain dot-com conformity appears to be spreading in the
naming and branding of technology companies. Four 26-year-old
partners at a Web design firm in Chicago have put up a parody Web
site that takes you, the e-client, through the process of selecting
a name, logo and motto for your new business.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50,000 different visitors have toured the site since it
opened last month, the creators say.
</P>
<P>
   The site, eNoricom.com, presents 18 slides that depict the
steps, beginning with the ``patented Nametron 3000'' machine to
create a ``best-of-breed name that conveys the essence of your
brand's soul.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Nametron spits out the name Similant, the word is run
up the flagpole of a fictional focus group, a family of four. Dad
finds that Similant evokes a ``very strong customer focus.'' For
Daughter, the name is virtually synonymous with ``global.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, noting that ``nothing says innovation and cutting edge
like having a curved swoosh in your logo,'' the site presents more
than a dozen examples _ from Ameritech, to Gore 2000, to
tickets.com _ before producing a suitably swerving nameplate for
Similant. For focus-group Mom, the Similant logo signifies that
``anything is possible.'' For Son, it cries out ``empowered.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the site observes the popularity of three-word
taglines, like ``Point. Click. Rent'' for apartmentguide.com and
``Beauty. Inspiration. Shopping'' for gloss.com.
</P>
<P>
   For Similant, the concocted tagline is ``Really. Really.
Different.'' (Mom's impression: ``people focused.'' Daughter's:
``frictionless.'')
</P>
<P>
   Matt Linderman, a creator of the parody site, said the point
(besides getting laughs) was to convey his own firm's philosophy
that good Web design helps people communicate and interact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It upsets us when we see these big companies acting Orwellian,
making up words to make themselves sound important,'' Linderman
said. ``Everyone sees logos like that all the time. But it's not
until you see 30 of them together that you say, `Wow, this is kind
of ridiculous.'''
</P>
<P>
   And what name did Lindeman's 10-month-old Web company select for
itself? An arcane one: 37signals.
</P>
<P>
   The name, he explains, alludes to an experiment led by the
astronomer Carl Sagan in the 1980s in which billions and billions
of signals from outer space were analyzed by a radio telescope.
Only 37 were identified as potential signs of intelligent life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked this,'' Linderman said, ``because our goal is to
create and propagate Web sites that show signs of intelligent
life.''
</P>
<P>
   E-Tailer Wants to Bring Aroma of Candy to Internet
</P>
<P>
   James Griffin has been trying to bring smell into the
candy-buying experience since his early days as an executive of
Nestle USA. He recalled an experiment with the scratch-and-sniff
card, a decades-old marketing tool that releases a faint aroma once
the customer has scratched off a thin coating. Trials were a
resounding disappointment. ``If it's sitting next to dog food in
the warehouse it would pick up the smell,'' Griffin said. ``You
couldn't control it.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Griffin is the president of e-Candy
(www.ecandy.com), an online candy store that, among other things,
just signed a deal to distribute Nestle's confections.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, he is trying to let candy customers smell before
they buy, but this time the approach is far more sophisticated.
E-Candy, based in Los Angeles, is working with Digiscents, a small
company that is developing a digital language for recording and
re-creating smells, using a device attached to a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Griffin predicts, customers who call up e-Candy's
site will be able to smell the jelly beans, chocolates and sour
gummies. ``Candy is very much a sensory experience,'' Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   E-Candy is not the only consumer goods maker working with
Digiscents, which is based in Oakland, Calif. Digiscents announced
a deal last week with Procter &AMP; Gamble to collaborate on research
that would take advantage of P&AMP;G's $2 billion research and
development budget.
</P>
<P>
   Although P&AMP;G declined to disclose details, the deal presumably
could lead to new ways for online customers to sample the company's
consumer products, which include Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent,
Pantene shampoo and Pringles potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Digiscents, nearly everything can and will be
``scent enabled'' someday, including computer games, electronic
greeting cards and travel brochures.
</P>
<P>
   Digiscents is creating a registry of thousands of scents that
developers can license, along with a digital language for
recording, re-creating and transmitting the fragrances. The scents
are played back by a tiny device called a scent synthesizer that
will activate various combinations of chemicals to create each
aroma. The company hopes to start selling the device early next
year for $50 to $200.

RENTING SOFTWARE AND THE SKILLS TO GO WITH IT 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last year, Rave Sports, a small, privately-held maker of
inflatable water trampolines that is based in St. Paul, has been
scrambling to keep up with its sales.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing its executives wanted was the expense of hiring a
computing staff to manage the company's accounting and sales
management systems. So as a lot of other small-business executives
do these days, Rave's chief financial officer, Pat Golden, decided
to ``rent'' its main business software from one of a growing number
of Internet companies known as ASPs.
</P>
<P>
   An ASP _ short for application service provider _ uses the
Internet to offer a range of software and technology-related
services that would otherwise be performed by internal departments
at the customer's company.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers are contracting with application providers to
handle a few computing functions, like accounting, while others,
including Rave, are finding that it pays to farm out just about
everything, including e-mail, human resources management and online
travel booking.
</P>
<P>
   By signing up with an application provider, ``we've eliminated
having to spend a lot of cash upfront,'' Golden said.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has caused an explosion of young companies
specializing in the service, with the leaders including Rave's
provider, Agiliti, as well as Corio, Futurelink and Managed
Opportunity. But the demand has also led to hefty investments by
big telecommunications carriers, including Sprint and Qwest, which
plan to expand into the market. Meanwhile, many of the the nation's
Internet service providers, such as the Concentric Network Corp.,
are moving into the business to make themselves more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, there were only a few dozen companies
calling themselves ASPs. By the end of this year, analysts predict,
there may be several hundred application providers clamoring for
the attention of small and midsize businesses, as well as the
information technology departments at bigger corporations.
</P>
<P>
   And the clamor is likely to fall on receptive ears, as
businesses seek to let somebody else deal with the headaches of
operating a computer network, dealing with frequent software
upgrades and running out of data storage space.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rave is now one of only a few thousand small businesses
that use an application service provider, the number is expected to
rise to 136,000 companies by the end of next year, according to
Cahners In-Stat, a market research company. And by the end of 2004,
according to Cahners In-Stat's forecast, more than three million
small businesses will be using application providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fundamentally changing the way information technology
is purchased and delivered,'' said Tom Kieffer, chief executive of
Agiliti, based in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses typically look at application providers as a
way to ``take away all the pain,'' of computing services, Kieffer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, big corporate computing departments are also rushing
to strike deals with application providers to shed at least some of
their applications. National Airlines, for one, has discovered that
it can keep its technology costs down by contracting out not only
basic services, like e-mail, but some of its more complex tasks as
well, like operating its frequent-flier program.
</P>
<P>
   And it may not be long before the trend touches consumers, too.
Instead of buying the latest new calendar software, a customer
could simply subscribe to a calendar program, accessing it over the
Web so that it would hog memory on a server computer rather than on
a PC, Palm hand-held device or, eventually, even a telephone. The
only requirement is a device with a Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Several Web sites already offer consumers scheduling and other
basic software. Still missing is the business model that enables
companies to offer consumers a full range of software services at a
profit.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of all this activity, though, the application
provider business is among the fastest-growing information
technology categories today _one whose growth rate will only
accelerate, analysts predict. In 1998, revenues for application
service providers totaled about $400 million in North America,
according to the research firm Dataquest. Last year, that figure
rose to just over $1 billion, and it is expected to double this
year, to $2.4 billion. And in 2001, revenues will more than double
again, to $5.3 billion, Dataquest predicts.
</P>
<P>
   A major force behind the predicted surge is the expected arrival
in the market later this year of Sprint, Qwest and other
communications carriers. Those companies are investing
substantially in systems that will let them supply application
services, even as they roll out high-speed networks capable of
carrying voice, data and images.
</P>
<P>
   As the carriers enter the market, a rash of partnerships is
likely to break out among the various players. By the end of the
year, in fact, analysts are predicting that some companies will be
offering a package of rented software and high-speed Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, for example, has already signed a deal with
USinternetworking to deliver application services over AT&AMP;T's
planned high-speed networks through an AT&AMP;T program called
Ecosystem. Eventually, analysts predict, buying a business network
computing service will be like choosing a telephone calling plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses aren't going to say, `I want a DSL line,''' said
Kneko Burney, director of markets and computing for Cahners
In-Stat, referring to a type of high-speed Internet connection.
``They'll say, `We want these business services.'''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say another factor driving growth is an increasing
confidence that businesses have with the security of online
communications. Because of that confidence, they are willing to
make the offerings of application providers available to more
employees.
</P>
<P>
   And businesses say they are reaping substantial savings by
renting software remotely rather than buying it and installing it
on site. An e-mail system, for example, can cost a company several
hundred dollars for each employee to operate internally each month.
By contracting with an outsider, some businesses say they can get
the cost down to about $100. Other services, like travel booking
and expense management, are often priced for each transaction.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predict that only the most mundane and basic
computing programs, like word processing, are likely to remain on
the hard disks of office computers as ASPs gain momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Rave, with 55 employees, has contracted with Agiliti to provide
and maintain the company's e-mail, accounting and order management
systems _ all for a monthly per-employee fee.
</P>
<P>
   Golden, Rave's chief financial officer, says the Agiliti
contract has allowed Rave to avoid hiring the additional technical
staff the company would have needed to handle those activities.
Because of the Agiliti deal, Rave's entire internal computing
operations can now be performed by one staff member, working
half-time. Rave's information-technology spending is only 2 percent
of sales, rather than the 5 percent Golden had been budgeting
before signing with Agiliti.
</P>
<P>
   Contracting with an application provider has also meant that
Rave can afford to use the latest accounting software, which would
otherwise have been too expensive to buy for each employee, Golden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among bigger businesses, the construction company Morrison
Knudsen decided to farm out management of its e-mail system after
its acquisition of another company required adding nearly 6,000
e-mail addresses virtually overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine how long it would take to do that ourselves,'' said
Brian Bertlin, information services director of Morrison Knudsen,
based in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison Knudsen also handed off operation of its online travel
booking a few months ago to Unisys and is about to let Unisys take
on the company's travel expense accounting system. The aim, Bertlin
said, is to reduce costs in areas that do not directly generate
revenues for the company.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the application provider business is similar to
the network PC business model that concerns like Oracle and Novell
tried to have companies embrace a few years ago. Under that plan,
stripped-down personal computers were to function as terminals for
software resources stored on remote computer servers. But some
full-scale PCs became available for only a few hundred dollars, and
the network PC model never took hold.
</P>
<P>
   The application provider is also reminiscent of elements of the
mainframe era, when companies paid to time share the resources of
giant systems owned and run by companies like IBM and Digital
Equipment In the time-sharing systems of the 1970s, small and
midsize companies found it more economical to rent the resources of
a mainframe computer company rather than invest in
multimillion-dollar systems of their own, with all the attendant
support and staffing costs.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to the predominance of desktop PCs at most
modern business, as opposed to the few, closely guarded mainframe
terminals of yesteryear, there is at least one other key
difference: in hiring an application provider, the customer is
paying for the knowledge and skill of the supplier, not simply the
software and server computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, it's not about economies of scale but about economies
of skill,'' Burney said. ``It's all about expertise and the right
operating environment.'' &QL;

LAND ROVER CAMPAIGN HIGHLIGHTS SMALL, EVERYDAY ACTS OF COURAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To the British, it is a brand of alcoholic beverage.
To fans of John F. Kennedy, it is the subject of profiles. To the
Cowardly Lion, it is reason to see the Wizard. And to Land Rover
North America, it is the centerpiece of a revamped advertising and
marketing campaign, the first created by the company's new agency,
GSD&AMP;M in Austin, Tex.
</P>
<P>
   The subject? Courage, of course.
</P>
<P>
   And what, pray tell, could be the rationale for associating a
quality like courage with a line of sport utility vehicles? Maybe
the owner of a New Beetle driving on a road crowded with luxury
off-road vehicles is courageous.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, to the company and the agency, courage is shorthand
for a skein of words that begin with ``c'' and serve to flatter the
would-be buyer: character, conviction, creativity and curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we call the maverick mindset,'' said Roy Spence,
president at GSD&AMP;M. That mindset, he said, is prevalent among
``those who in the 21st century will be the builders, the
architects, of the next economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews last week, Spence joined executives at GSD&AMP;M and
Land Rover North America to discuss the campaign, which expands
Monday into television with commercials on local broadcast stations
and national cable networks like A&AMP;E and Discovery (natch). The
initial two spots _ for the Discovery Series II, the best-selling
Land Rover model _ portray courage in unconventional ways.
</P>
<P>
   In one commercial, a demurely clad pregnant woman gamely walks
on a beach populated by younger women in revealing bikinis. In the
other commercial, a couple on the way to the opera stops on a
rain-slicked highway to help a stray dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about describing the attributes and benefits of the
vehicle on-road or off-road,'' said Alicia Kriese, senior vice
president and group account director for Land Rover at GSD&AMP;M.
``It's about taking your own road.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Courage'' theme is continued through the other parts of
the campaign: print, radio, billboards and posters. For instance, a
radio spot describes how the vehicles ``have driven in the harshest
conditions known to man, from the blistering Gobi desert to the
oxygen-deprived Himalayas.''
</P>
<P>
   GSD&AMP;M is a creatively focused shop known for campaigns for
blue-chip brands like Southwest Airlines and Wal-Mart. This is the
agency's first effort for an automotive client.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for an agency with a strong culture and
ability to build our brand equity,'' said Jim Selwa, vice president
for marketing at Land Rover North America in Lanham, Md. ``We
picked GSD&AMP;M because of a cultural connect.''
</P>
<P>
   GSD&AMP;M was selected in late March after a review that had lasted
almost three months. The incumbent agency of 13 years, Grace &AMP;
Rothschild in New York, which introduced Land Rover products to
American consumers, declined to take part.
</P>
<P>
   GSD&AMP;M was one of three finalists in the review along with two
other agencies seeking their initial car accounts: Crispin Porter &AMP;
Bogusky in Miami and Kirshenbaum Bond &AMP; Partners in New York. All
three were give an assignment on Discovery to determine which would
be awarded the creative duties on the company's account, with
billings estimated at $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key insight from GSD&AMP;M was that the brand was not being
viewed as accessible enough,'' said Kim McCullough, model manager
for Discovery at Land Rover North America. ``People thought it cost
$50,000, which is what Range Rover costs.'' That's the more
expensive of the two products sold in North America by Land Rover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to change that price perception,'' McCullough
said, ``and get it in line with where the car is.'' That's why
there are numerous mentions of the Discovery's starting sticker of
``$33,975 MSRP,'' which several ads cheekily define as
``manufacturer's surprising retail price.''
</P>
<P>
   The final work from Grace &AMP; Rothschild was for Range Rover,
Selwa said, adding: ``We're now working with GSD&AMP;M on a campaign
for the 2001 Range Rover, due in fall 2000. Then in the next 18
months we'll introduce Freelander, which is to be priced around
$25,000 to $26,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales for Land Rover North America last year totaled just under
30,000 vehicles, Selwa said, fueled by a 50 percent increase for
Discovery. The goal for 2000 is 31,000, he added, and then a leap
to 45,000 to 47,000 when the lower-priced Freelander becomes part
of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Media duties for Land Rover are handled by Optimedia
International U.S. in New York, part of PublicisSA Land Rover is
part of BMW AG, which agreed days before the review ended to sell
the brand to the Ford MotorCo.
</P>
<P>
   That could jeopardize the GSD&AMP;M hold on the account because the
agency is part of the Omnicom Group, which owns shops like BBDO
Worldwide and Merkley Newman Harty. They handle brands like Dodge
and Mercedes-Benz for a major Ford competitor, DaimlerChrysler.
Ford frowns on working with agencies that are part of holding
companies owning other agencies handling accounts for
DaimlerChrysler or General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see nothing from the creative side of the business'' that
would warrant concerns over conflicts, Selwa said. ``BMW, a strong
rival of Mercedes-Benz, didn't have an issue with GSD&AMP;M.''
</P>
<P>
   Spence offered Ford executives some tongue-in-cheek advice based
on the new Land Rover credo: ``They have to have courage.''

BUSY TIMES FOR OPTICAL SECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judging by sheer buzz, there is nothing in the technology world
hotter these days than ``next generation optical networking.'' And
the temperature may increase today, when Mayan Networks, a start-up
company based in Sunnyvale, Calif., plans to announce the
availability of its first product.
</P>
<P>
   ONI Systems, previously known as Optical Networks, another small
optical communications company, intends to make an initial public
offering of its stock Tuesday. If that offering is successful, it
could throw yet more fuel on the optical sector.
</P>
<P>
   Optical networks convey millions or even billions of bits of
digital information using pulses of light, rather than bursts of
electricity. As demand has increased for these high-speed networks,
dozens of companies have emerged to provide optical communications
gear.
</P>
<P>
   Mayan is nowhere close to an initial public offering, but it has
attracted a blue-chip list of venture capital and private equity
investors, including New Enterprise Associates and Amerindo
Investment Advisors. Intel, as well as Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone of Japan, the world's biggest telecommunications carrier,
have also invested in Mayan.
</P>
<P>
   Mayan's last round of financing, in October, valued the company
at about $200 million, though if the company offers stock to the
public it will almost surely be at a much higher valuation.
</P>
<P>
   Mayan makes complex equipment that helps add flexibility to the
optical networks within cities. The traditional optical networking
format known as sonet, for synchronous optical network, transports
information in ``envelopes'' of 52 million digital bits a second.
Mayan and its competitors hope to crack those envelopes so the
underlying optical communications capacity can be used more
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Mayan's competitors are mostly private companies including
Alidian Networks, Astral Point Communications, Chromatis Networks,
Cyras Systems and Sirocco Systems.

REPORT PROPOSES UPDATE OF COPYRIGHT ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The law meant to protect intellectual property on
the Internet needs to be updated, a Democratic research center says
in a report to be released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report proposes outlawing technologies like the
controversial Napster software that enables Internet users to trade
music files with little regard to copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   The Progressive Policy Institute, which is affiliated with the
Democratic Leadership Council, is releasing its policy brief,
``Napster and Online Piracy: The Need to Revisit the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act,'' ahead of a House Small Business
Committee hearing scheduled for Wednesday to examine Internet music
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is expected to focus on how small recording labels
and lesser-known musical acts are using the Internet and
downloadable music to gain market share. Scheduled witnesses
include Chuck D, founder of Rapstation.com, who has become a vocal
proponent of Napster, which uses a file format called MP3. At
Rapstation.com, music fans can download MP3 files of lesser-known
artists and those who have not yet signed recording contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But the Progressive Policy Institute hopes the hearing, and its
report, will also focus attention on what it says are needed
updates to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
</P>
<P>
   That law, passed in 1998 to extend traditional copyright
protections to digital works, specifically exempted providers of
Internet access services and search services from liability when
their users transmit pirated works.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, a company in San Mateo, Calif., that operates an online
service, has cited those exemptions as a defense against lawsuits
from major record companies, the heavy metal band Metallica and the
rap artist Dr. Dre, who have accused it of engaging in vicarious
copyright infringement. The groups are seeking damages that could
add up to billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's software works like a co-op. It enables users to swap
songs by trading files in the MP3 format _ a data-compression
formula that turns a CD's music tracks into computer files. Record
companies call it a haven for piracy because it enables
distribution of music without any copyright protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that Napster should qualify as an ISP is not what the
law intended, although it is possible the law could be interpreted
that way,'' said Robert D. Atkinson, director of the institute and
a co-author of the report. ``So we just say, let's tighten the
law.'' ``ISP'' is industry shorthand for ``Internet service
provider.''
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends that the digital copyright law be amended
``to hold Napster, its users, and similar services accountable for
copyright violations while maintaining protections from liability
for service providers that are innocent bystanders to digital
piracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The report proposes that services like Napster be required to
collect identifiable and verifiable information from its users,
such as addresses and credit-card information. And it recommends
that the services be required to remove infringing users within a
specific period, perhaps a week, once they are identified.
</P>
<P>
   Napster has argued that it should not be held accountable if its
users illegally trade copyrighted music over the Internet, because
it does not itself store the music on its computers or engage in
trading copyrighted music. Recently, however, Napster did bar
300,000 fans of the rock group Metallica, after the band said the
fans had infringed its copyrights using the service.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson said no legislation had yet been drafted to address the
recommendations in his report. But he said he hoped that
Wednesday's hearing would raise awareness in Washington for the
need to update the digital copyright law to address new
technologies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Any such proposals would likely be met with resistance from the
civil libertarian community, which opposed the original law as
potentially limiting access to works that belong in the public
domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say you are going to take a whole new category of software
and strangle it in its infancy because one of its first uses
resulted in piracy _ that's a bad idea,'' said John Gilmore,
president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online
liberties group based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Other likely opponents are telecommunications companies and
Internet companies that worked for years to reach the compromise
that was passed into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could open a Pandora's box,'' said Peter Harter, a lobbyist
for a company called eMusic, who worked for Netscape when the
digital copyright law was passed. Harter is among the witnesses
scheduled to testify Wednesday.

 &HT;    BIO-TERROR' ATTACK BECOMES FULL-SCALE 'CRISIS'
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The mock ``bioterrorism attack'' on Denver reached a
full-scale crisis Sunday with 1,314 confirmed cases of deadly
pneumonic plague and 255 ``deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Area airports, bus stations and train depots were closed and the
governor ordered residents of the city to remain in their homes _
all in the fictional context of the congressionally-ordered
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``TOPOFF,'' the exercise is the largest-ever test of the
nation's ability to respond to a terrorist attack with biological
and chemical weapons. A similar drill was taking place in
Portsmouth, N. H.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials running the exercise took pains to constantly
say it was simply a drill, several frightened Denver residents
called the public health department here to ask about the terrorism
epidemic they heard was underway.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which the Justice Department-scripted exercise placed
in overall charge of the ``crisis,'' said it had reviewed ``volumes
of information'' on a suspected terrorist, found dead in a motel
room.
</P>
<P>
   And an official of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention was calling for military support for a local hospital
system which he said was ``at the breaking point.''
</P>
<P>
   As a ``player'' in the make-believe attack, Dr. Scott
Lillibridge, chief of the CDC bioterrorism response unit, arrived
in Denver with 30 other disease investigators from the Atlanta
center Sunday morning, around 36 hours after the first ``cases''
began showing up in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been far later than the CDC would have been
involved had the attack been real, Dr. Lillibridge said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The drill, designed by a contractor selected by the Justice
Department's Office of Justice Programs in Washington, actually
began Friday night when ``10 people with pneumonia'' showed up at
several different Denver hospitals, said Dr. Richard Hoffman, the
Colorado state health officer.
</P>
<P>
   The drill caught no one by surprise. However, constantly watched
by ``controllers,' who served as sort of drill referees, players
such as Drs. Hoffman and Lillibridge, FBI special agent in charge
Mark Mershon and scores of Denver area police and firemen, were
required to respond to the fictional conditions as they unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   At times, their responses were dictated to them.
</P>
<P>
   For example Hoffman said he would have contacted CDC immediately
when he learned of the 10 unexplained pneumonia cases in the
hospital. However, the drill script required him to wait until
Saturday, over 12 hours later, by which time ``we had a cascade of
cases coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Attorney General Janet Reno and Health, Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala and White House National Security
Advisor Sandy Berger were players in Washington, taking innumerable
conference calls and approving or disapproving different actions.
</P>
<P>
   One set of players was made up of actors posing as reporters for
``VNN,'' the Virtual News Network, who hounded other players with
questions.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief ``walk-through'' Sunday, controllers called a
time-out and allowed players to answer questions from real world
reporters covering the drill. This made for a surreal exercise of
its own, as players sometimes switched back and forth from talking
about the drill to acting it out.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lillibridge broke off an interview to take a telephone call,
during which he put forth his view that the military should be
called in. Some local hospital workers were ``refusing'' to report
for work and the hospitals were overloaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't take action now, we're not just talking about the
city of Denver,'' he said. ``The outer limits of this thing will be
the Colorado state line.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that the Defense Department and the Department of
Veterans Affairs should be asked to ``peel off entire hospital
staffs and bring them here'' to relieve local personnel, and that
military aircraft should be requested to evacuate victims to other
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the White House playing in this?'' he asked the player on
the other end of the line. ``Look, we've got to move with this.
Lives are at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   He hung up and turned to a reporter to say that he would have
preferred earlier involvement of CDC in the exercise. Then he moved
to a conference call with Dr. James Hughes, director of the CDC
National Center for Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Jeffrey Koplan,
director of CDC, to talk about his proposal for military
assistance. FBI Agent Mershon and Denver U.S. Attorney Thomas
Strickland avoided giving direct answers about why the drill was
scripted to give the FBI the early advantage of ``good solid
intelligence information'' that a terrorist attack was about to be
launched against Denver and the chance discovery of a dead
terrorist in a ``motel room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you are lucky,'' Strickland said, then turned away
to join a conference call with Reno.
</P>
<P>
   One effect of this particular element of the drill's script was
to involve the FBI _ and the Justice Department _ in the exercise
almost at the outset and place the FBI in control. More was at
stake than which official could make the television announcements.
Analysis of the exercise when it is over could have long term
impact on how America responds to a real terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that in a real-world terrorist attack, a
suspicious body and key intelligence information would be available
before medical laboratories had had time to identify the pathogen
responsible for hospital illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, health officials have warned that a bioterrorism
disease would likely spread over large areas of the country before
anyone realized there was a terrorism link and that an ill-prepared
U.S. public health infrastructure would bear the brunt of the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   CDC has a five-year program underway to upgrade the public
health system, including sending some health officials back to
school to learn about bioterrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night, FBI agents and city and fire officials from
suburban Aurora donned ``Class A'' protective suits, complete with
self-contained breathing apparatus, and removed the ``body'' from a
make-believe motel set up on the abandoned campus of Fitzsimmons
Army Medical Center here.
</P>
<P>
   An empty bachelor officers quarters had been converted to the
``Hide-Away Motel'' and a mannequin placed in a room to simulate
the body. Aurora police, who were summoned to the ``motel''
Saturday morning, found the body, amid a great deal of virtual
vomit and some blood. The room also contained equipment that might
be that of a terrorist, said Tom Jacks, a spokesman for the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI was called and a four-block area was closed off with
yellow plastic tape. The police who initially entered the room were
``decontaminated.''
</P>
<P>
   During the ``investigation,'' the dead man's ``girlfriend''
appeared and identified him, a chemistry major at a Denver
university. She also led police to her car, where a search revealed
``circuit boards'' in the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how the condition of the corpse, which had
blood around the mouth, sores and a gangrenous toe, related to the
scores of fictitious patients who have been reporting to Denver
area hospitals in the last several days with symptoms that ``might
be pneumonia.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzsimmons was chosen as the location of the ``crime scene''
because its abandoned streets could be closed off without unduly
alarming members of the public, said Jacks.
</P>
<P>
   That decision had its own poignancy. The hospital was closed
under Defense Department base closings brought on by the end of the
Cold War. Now it was being used as a stage prop in an exercise
aimed at helping to prepare America for a new era of post- Cold War
violence.

COMMUNICATION GEAR MAKER TO SEAL ALLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Cisco Systems agreed earlier this month to acquire
Arrowpoint Communications, a maker of switches for Internet
communications, for about $6 billion, some analysts interpreted the
deal as a blow to Arrowpoint's main competitor, Alteon Websystems.
</P>
<P>
   But in the world of communications equipment, in which the
torrid pace of growth is matched only by the ferocity of
competition among giants like Cisco and Nortel Networks of Canada,
small companies with attractive technology can almost always find
friends. Reacting to Cisco's acquisition of Arrowpoint, Alteon
intends to announce this week that it has enlisted two powerful
allies: Lucent Technologies and Akamai Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   As Dominic P. Orr, Alteon's chief executive, put it last Friday:
``Up to 10 days ago, when Cisco acquired Arrowpoint, we were pretty
neutral and worked with any backbone builder. Now Cisco has gone
directly into our area. So now all enemies of Cisco are friends of
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly no bigger enemy of Cisco than Lucent, the
former equipment arm of AT&AMP;T that has stumbled recently, even as
Cisco, the No. 1 maker of Internet communications gear, has become
one of the world's most valuable companies.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, which has roots in the manufacture of telephone
switches, has spent billions trying to break into the data
communications arena. This week, Alteon intends to announce that
Lucent has agreed to sell Alteon's gear under the Lucent brand.
</P>
<P>
   Alteon and Arrowpoint each make equipment that sits between
communications networks and the big computer servers that support
Web sites and other Internet systems. The gear made by the two
companies helps distribute requests for Internet information among
the various servers within a facility, and helps the owners of
those servers use the computers more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Alteon, based in San Jose, Calif., hopes to benefit from
Lucent's extensive sales force pushing more of its systems into the
market. And Lucent, by putting its brand on Alteon's products, adds
another arrow to its own quiver.
</P>
<P>
   Such deals can be mutually beneficial. But some other small
communications equipment companies have come to believe that such
arrangements favor the bigger player by allowing the giant access
to the start-up's technology, while discouraging the smaller
company from developing its own sales force.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Lucent deal, Alteon also intends to announce this
week that it has struck a partnership with Akamai under which
Akamai will sometimes encourage its customers to purchase Alteon
equipment. Akamai, based in Cambridge, Mass., helps Web sites
distribute information to users more quickly.

`WIZARD OF PHOTOGRAPHY': GEORGE EASTMAN CHANGED PHOTOGRAPHY AND
SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>

York; please check local listings) 
 By NEIL GENZLINGER

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's possible that people were sticking their fingers
in their ears and going ``naaah'' before 1888. But it's also
possible that this and every other gesture humans muster whenever a
camera is aimed at them can be traced to George Eastman, the man
who in that year transformed photography from an elitist art into
an everyman pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Eastman, whose story is told in ``The Wizard of Photography,''
Monday night's installment of ``The American Experience'' on PBS,
did not invent photography. He did, however, put it within reach of
plain folks when he introduced a simple camera called the Kodak,
thereby dooming thousands of shoe boxes to be filled with millions
of blurry, off-kilter or otherwise amateurish snapshots. One of the
things this interesting program does is remind us that the word
``snapshot'' is a borrowed hunting term that means ``to shoot
without aiming.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Eastman, photography was like portrait painting. Subjects
would sit prim and still while a photographer wielding a bulky
camera, glass plates and assorted chemicals caught the moment. The
moment, though, had to last some seconds to allow for exposure, and
the life captured by these early photographers was one without
spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   Eastman changed all that. Yet he might easily have spent his
life as a bank clerk, which is what he was in 1877 when he decided
to dabble in real estate. He wanted to photograph some land he was
considering buying, purchased a camera to do it with, then found he
had to pay someone to teach him how to use the camera. There
followed the exclamation that fueled so much of the industrial age:
``There must be an easier way.''
</P>
<P>
   What is striking about Eastman is that he did not say this only
once; he found an easier way, then kept searching for even easier
ones. First he replaced the wet-plate process, in which
photographers had to cart chemicals around, with a dry-plate
system, so they could just take along Eastman's precoated glass.
Then he replaced the glass plates with paper film, leading to the
Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   The Kodak, though, was relatively expensive, so he changed the
quest slightly, to ``there must be a cheaper way,'' and in 1900
gave the world the Brownie camera, a boxful of visual memories for
only $1. The name was taken from a storybook character in a
conscious effort to appeal to children, a nonlethal Joe Camel.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the going was rough; the program details various
reversals and near bankruptcies. And, like so many giants of the
age, Eastman had his oddities: an overly meticulous streak and
control-freak tendencies. If ``Wizard of Photography'' has a
shortcoming it is in not letting us hear more about and from the
people who had to work for him. His odd end, by suicide in 1932, is
given a retrained and dignified treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Eastman ultimately made a fortune, and he
transformed Rochester, N.Y., site of his company's headquarters.
What ``The Wizard of Photography'' nicely conveys is how much he
also transformed us, the way we think of and document our own
lives. Today, when the debate in many households is whether to
jettison the old-fashioned camera (i.e., the one that uses film) in
favor of a digital one, it is hard to fathom that countless
generations had no easy way of preserving a visual record of
everyday life. Those shoe boxes go back only a century or so;
before that the slate is, by comparison, an elusive blank.

HANG UP _ YOU WON'T WANT TO KEEP THESE PORK TENDERLOINS ON HOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm not sure my doctors have ever confronted my particular
affliction.
</P>
<P>
   I think my fingers are going to have a nervous breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   For years, soothing voices on radio commercials urged us to drop
out of the commercial rat race. ``Let your fingers do the
shopping,'' we were advised.
</P>
<P>
   My fingers are about to grab somebody by the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping by telephone is akin to volunteering for interrogation
by the New York Police Department. You are asked a series of
incomprehensible and possibly incriminating questions, then ordered
to reply by punching buttons 1, 2, 3, 4 or 44.
</P>
<P>
   Did you punch the right one? You are left to wonder, while the
phone goes whir, click and then begins to play a recording of a
requiem written for dead German kings. It seems that all the
operators (or New York cops) are busy dealing with other criminals
or customers.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what area of industry and commerce is the absolute
worst at communicating with their customers? Right, it's the
companies that deal in communications.
</P>
<P>
   The phone companies don't have enough phone lines and customer
representatives, or else all of their employees are out buying
recordings of requiems for dead German kings.
</P>
<P>
   What they don't do is answer the phone. They ignore you even
before they know what you want. And if you punch the wrong button,
you might as well be trying to communicate by semaphore from McNeil
Island.
</P>
<P>
   The wrong number, in my recent instance, was No. 4 as in: ``If
you wish to discontinue our service, please punch 4.'' After that
recorded phone message, I swear I heard insane laughter in the
background. No way were they going to answer my call.
</P>
<P>
   On the first attempt I hung up after six minutes. The second
time I began to scream at a dead phone line after 12 minutes. The
third time I punched the speakerphone connection in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   I chopped five onions and three green peppers, made a large pot
of chili and put it in freezer containers. By the time my call was
finally answered, the blocks of chili were frozen solid as a Baffin
Bay growler.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I outlasted the sorry sons of Marconi. And the response of
the phone representative when I finally confirmed my intent was,
``Mister Owen, how can I talk you out of this?'' At which point my
neurotic fingers tried to strangle the phone line.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have time to play games with the phone company. I've got
clams to steam, pinto beans to soak, beef briskets to bake,
brownies to burn, pork tenders to tend. And when you have pork
tenders to tend, you can't put them on ``hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Long Distance Loins
</P>
<P>
   4 pork loins (about 1 pound each)
</P>
<P>
   4 cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half-inch hunk of fresh, peeled ginger root
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup rum
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced jalapeno pepper
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons hoisin sauce
</P>
<P>
   Into a food processor or blender dump the garlic, ginger root,
soy sauce, rum, jalapeno and hoisin sauce. Hit the button to create
a sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Plunk the loins into a large plastic bag, pour the sauce over
them, then seal and let sit, refrigerated, all day or overnight,
removing from the cooler once or twice to massage the sauce into
the meat.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to cook, either seal the loins and sauce in a large
piece of heavy aluminum foil and bake in a 350-degree oven for 30
minutes, or barbecue on a grill, turning once, for about 25
minutes. The pork is cooked when it is pink in the middle and
browned on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Sliced, and served with rice, each loin should serve two to
three.
</P>
<P>
   Right Number Rice
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half pounds long-grain rice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup butter
</P>
<P>
   3 large onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 large bell peppers, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch celery, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 10-ounce cans cream of chicken soup
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces green pimento olives, sliced
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces slivered almonds
</P>
<P>
   2 cups pineapple juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vinegar
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon seasoned salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon powdered sage
</P>
<P>
   In a large pot boil the rice with water to cover by 1 inch until
almost tender. Don't overcook the rice. It might take less than 10
minutes. Drain rice and fluff it with a fork.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a large skillet and saute the onions, peppers
and celery until tender. Remove from heat and add one can soup
mixed with one soup can of water. Add half the olives and all of
the almonds.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl moosh together one cup pineapple juice, the
vinegar, salt, seasoned salt and sage. Combine this muck with the
soup mixture, then pour this whole schmear in with the rice, mix
then transfer to a large oven casserole or dish. Pour the remaining
can of soup mixed with the second cup of pineapple juice over the
top. Distribute the rest of the olives over the top and cook the
rice 45 minutes in a 350-degree oven. This will serve 16.
</P>
<P>
   I'll put you on hold while I figure out how many servings you'll
get if you halve all the ingredients.

   VODAFONE TO CONSIDER SALE OF SOME FIXED-LINE ASSETS
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone AirTouch, the world's largest wireless telephone
operator, is considering selling the fixed-line assets it acquired
when it bought Mannesmann and speeding up the sale of Orange, the
British cellular operator, to raise $60 billion, executives close
to the company said.
</P>
<P>

   OPTICAL NETWORK MARKET HEATS UP

   Judging by sheer buzz, there is nothing in the technology world
hotter these days than ``next generation optical networking.'' And
the temperature may increase today, when Mayan Networks, a start-up
company in Sunnyvale, Calif., plans to announce its first product.
In addition, ONI Systems, previously known as Optical Networks,

   A DOT-COM LEGAL BILL COMES DUE
</P>
<P>
   When fast-growing Internet companies began raiding law firms in
the Bay Area for employees last year, the firms responded by
increasing associates' salary by as much as 40 percent. That set
off a chain reaction at other law firms nationwide, which followed
suit. But at the companies stealing the lawyers, stock prices
stopped rising, bringing the value of millions of stock options
into question. Turnover at many California law firms has returned
to normal, but the firms are still stuck with the bill for the
higher salaries. New Economy.

</P>
<P>
   A flood of statistics suggests that to keep their businesses
growing, Internet merchants have to look outside the United States.
And yet, with investors demanding that Web merchants find a
speedier path to profitability, the merchants can hardly justify
the expenses associated with rolling out sites aimed at other
nations.

   RENTING-A-COMPUTER DEPARTMENT
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hiring a computing staff to manage a company's
accounting and sales management systems, a lot of small-business
executives are deciding to ``rent'' their main business software
from one of a growing number of Internet companies known as
application service providers, which use the Internet to offer a
range of software and technology-related services. The trend has
caused an explosion of companies specializing in the service.

<P>
   For the last year, Rave Sports, a small, privately-held maker of
inflatable water trampolines that is based in St. Paul, has been
scrambling to keep up with its sales.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing its executives wanted was the expense of hiring a
computing staff to manage the company's accounting and sales
management systems. So as a lot of other small-business executives
do these days, Rave's chief financial officer, Pat Golden, decided
to ``rent'' its main business software from one of a growing number
of Internet companies known as ASPs.
</P>
<P>
   An ASP _ short for application service provider _ uses the
Internet to offer a range of software and technology-related
services that would otherwise be performed by internal departments
at the customer's company.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers are contracting with application providers to
handle a few computing functions, like accounting, while others,
including Rave, are finding that it pays to farm out just about
everything, including e-mail, human resources management and online
travel booking.
</P>
<P>
   By signing up with an application provider, ``we've eliminated
having to spend a lot of cash upfront,'' Golden said.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has caused an explosion of young companies
specializing in the service, with the leaders including Rave's
provider, Agiliti, as well as Corio, Futurelink and Managed
Opportunity. But the demand has also led to hefty investments by
big telecommunications carriers, including Sprint and Qwest, which
plan to expand into the market. Meanwhile, many of the the nation's
Internet service providers, such as the Concentric Network Corp.,
are moving into the business to make themselves more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, there were only a few dozen companies
calling themselves ASPs. By the end of this year, analysts predict,
there may be several hundred application providers clamoring for
the attention of small and midsize businesses, as well as the
information technology departments at bigger corporations.
</P>
<P>
   And the clamor is likely to fall on receptive ears, as
businesses seek to let somebody else deal with the headaches of
operating a computer network, dealing with frequent software
upgrades and running out of data storage space.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rave is now one of only a few thousand small businesses
that use an application service provider, the number is expected to
rise to 136,000 companies by the end of next year, according to
Cahners In-Stat, a market research company. And by the end of 2004,
according to Cahners In-Stat's forecast, more than three million
small businesses will be using application providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fundamentally changing the way information technology
is purchased and delivered,'' said Tom Kieffer, chief executive of
Agiliti, based in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses typically look at application providers as a
way to ``take away all the pain,'' of computing services, Kieffer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, big corporate computing departments are also rushing
to strike deals with application providers to shed at least some of
their applications. National Airlines, for one, has discovered that
it can keep its technology costs down by contracting out not only
basic services, like e-mail, but some of its more complex tasks as
well, like operating its frequent-flier program.
</P>
<P>
   And it may not be long before the trend touches consumers, too.
Instead of buying the latest new calendar software, a customer
could simply subscribe to a calendar program, accessing it over the
Web so that it would hog memory on a server computer rather than on
a PC, Palm hand-held device or, eventually, even a telephone. The
only requirement is a device with a Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Several Web sites already offer consumers scheduling and other
basic software. Still missing is the business model that enables
companies to offer consumers a full range of software services at a
profit.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of all this activity, though, the application
provider business is among the fastest-growing information
technology categories today _one whose growth rate will only
accelerate, analysts predict. In 1998, revenues for application
service providers totaled about $400 million in North America,
according to the research firm Dataquest. Last year, that figure
rose to just over $1 billion, and it is expected to double this
year, to $2.4 billion. And in 2001, revenues will more than double
again, to $5.3 billion, Dataquest predicts.
</P>
<P>
   A major force behind the predicted surge is the expected arrival
in the market later this year of Sprint, Qwest and other
communications carriers. Those companies are investing
substantially in systems that will let them supply application
services, even as they roll out high-speed networks capable of
carrying voice, data and images.
</P>
<P>
   As the carriers enter the market, a rash of partnerships is
likely to break out among the various players. By the end of the
year, in fact, analysts are predicting that some companies will be
offering a package of rented software and high-speed Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, for example, has already signed a deal with
USinternetworking to deliver application services over AT&AMP;T's
planned high-speed networks through an AT&AMP;T program called
Ecosystem. Eventually, analysts predict, buying a business network
computing service will be like choosing a telephone calling plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses aren't going to say, `I want a DSL line,''' said
Kneko Burney, director of markets and computing for Cahners
In-Stat, referring to a type of high-speed Internet connection.
``They'll say, `We want these business services.'''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say another factor driving growth is an increasing
confidence that businesses have with the security of online
communications. Because of that confidence, they are willing to
make the offerings of application providers available to more
employees.
</P>
<P>
   And businesses say they are reaping substantial savings by
renting software remotely rather than buying it and installing it
on site. An e-mail system, for example, can cost a company several
hundred dollars for each employee to operate internally each month.
By contracting with an outsider, some businesses say they can get
the cost down to about $100. Other services, like travel booking
and expense management, are often priced for each transaction.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predict that only the most mundane and basic
computing programs, like word processing, are likely to remain on
the hard disks of office computers as ASPs gain momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Rave, with 55 employees, has contracted with Agiliti to provide
and maintain the company's e-mail, accounting and order management
systems _ all for a monthly per-employee fee.
</P>
<P>
   Golden, Rave's chief financial officer, says the Agiliti
contract has allowed Rave to avoid hiring the additional technical
staff the company would have needed to handle those activities.
Because of the Agiliti deal, Rave's entire internal computing
operations can now be performed by one staff member, working
half-time. Rave's information-technology spending is only 2 percent
of sales, rather than the 5 percent Golden had been budgeting
before signing with Agiliti.
</P>
<P>
   Contracting with an application provider has also meant that
Rave can afford to use the latest accounting software, which would
otherwise have been too expensive to buy for each employee, Golden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among bigger businesses, the construction company Morrison
Knudsen decided to farm out management of its e-mail system after
its acquisition of another company required adding nearly 6,000
e-mail addresses virtually overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine how long it would take to do that ourselves,'' said
Brian Bertlin, information services director of Morrison Knudsen,
based in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison Knudsen also handed off operation of its online travel
booking a few months ago to Unisys and is about to let Unisys take
on the company's travel expense accounting system. The aim, Bertlin
said, is to reduce costs in areas that do not directly generate
revenues for the company.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the application provider business is similar to
the network PC business model that concerns like Oracle and Novell
tried to have companies embrace a few years ago. Under that plan,
stripped-down personal computers were to function as terminals for
software resources stored on remote computer servers. But some
full-scale PCs became available for only a few hundred dollars, and
the network PC model never took hold.
</P>
<P>
   The application provider is also reminiscent of elements of the
mainframe era, when companies paid to time share the resources of
giant systems owned and run by companies like IBM and Digital
Equipment In the time-sharing systems of the 1970s, small and
midsize companies found it more economical to rent the resources of
a mainframe computer company rather than invest in
multimillion-dollar systems of their own, with all the attendant
support and staffing costs.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to the predominance of desktop PCs at most
modern business, as opposed to the few, closely guarded mainframe
terminals of yesteryear, there is at least one other key
difference: in hiring an application provider, the customer is
paying for the knowledge and skill of the supplier, not simply the
software and server computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, it's not about economies of scale but about economies
of skill,'' Burney said. ``It's all about expertise and the right
operating environment.'' &QL;

DODGERS HAVE A GRAND TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI - The Florida Marlins opted not to take batting practice
before Sunday's game. They must've known it wouldn't have mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown had one of those days.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander overwhelmed his former organization, retiring
17 straight at one point, and the Dodgers offense was simply
overpowering as Adrian Beltre and Shawn Green hit grand slams in
completing a three-game sweep of the Marlins with a 12-3 win at Pro
Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (3-1) continued his mastery in his one-time home park,
winning for the 21st time in 29 decisions. In pitching his first
complete game of the season, Brown allowed six hits, two earned
runs, struck out six and didn't walk a batter.
</P>
<P>
   It also allowed the Dodgers to complete a tiresome 11-game road
trip 7-4, quite impressive since it began with three potentially
demoralizing losses to division-leading Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``That incident in Chicago might have brought that team
together,'' Marlins manager John Boles said. ``After the tough year
they had last year, they look like they're getting great chemistry
going over there. When you get great chemistry and talent, you've
got something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre provided Brown and the Dodgers with all the offense
needed. His grand slam, the second by the Dodgers in as many days,
keyed a five-run fifth inning and provided a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Green added his third career slam in a seven-run ninth inning
that was nothing more than window dressing for another rout. Gary
Sheffield, who hit a grand slam Saturday, followed Green's homer
with his team-leading 14th homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to not be the one guy to not contribute,'' said
Green, who was 5 for 12 with a homer and five RBI in the series.
``We don't let anything affect the way we go about our approach.
It's a real professional team.''
</P>
<P>
   The two grand slams tied a National League record, and marked
the third time in Dodgers history (1985 and 1901) it's been
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're more complete (as a team),'' Brown said. ``The
way we started off the long road trip, starting off (with three
losses) and coming back, it shows the character on this team. We
turned it around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (24-17) matched a season-high with their fifth
straight win. They haven't won six in a row since a seven-game
winning streak July 25 to Aug. 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I hit it good and had a chance when I hit it,'' said
Beltre, who was 2 for 23 (.087) in his career with the bases
loaded. ``The whole lineup was hitting, and with guys always on
base, it's good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense had problems in the first inning that led to Florida
scoring an unearned run on three hits, but that was it for the
Marlins. Of course, Brown's been outstanding since returning from
the disabled list April 25 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brownie got a little frustrated in the first inning and didn't
feel like the ball was moving enough and he was berating himself,''
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``On offense, you make some
mistakes and don't make good pitches, we have some guys that'll
kill 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida starter Jesus Sanchez (4-3) found that out. He was wild
in his five innings, but it didn't hurt him until the fifth when
the Dodgers scored five times on two hits. Mark Grudzielanek led
off with the second of his four hits on the day, Green was hit with
a pitch and Sheffield and Eric Karros walked to tie it 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, whose two-run double lifted the Dodgers to a win Friday,
hit Sanchez's 1-1 pitch for a towering home run over the left-field
scoreboard to give the Dodgers a 5-1 lead. It was the Dodgers'
fifth grand slam of the season, and the first of Beltre's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you keep getting guys on, and we did, you're eventually
going to get to him,'' Grudzielanek said. ``It's a mater of time.
Too many baserunners, too many good hitting counts.''
</P>

A YOUNG PRANKSTER AT HOME ON THE ROOF 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GORE-BIO, GORE-BIO-ABRIDGED, GORE-DAD) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Up on the roof of the Washington hotel where he grew up, the old
Fairfax, now a much tonier Westin, Vice President Al Gore was
standing at the edge. There is no railing on the roof of the
eight-story building, and Gore was trying to goad a reporter into
following him there. ``I'd catch you,'' he said, and he seemed
amazed that anyone would decline such a sporting challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had taken a reporter and photographer back to his former
home on Massachusetts Avenue, and while the return visit did not
seem particularly emotional _ no Barbara Walters moments, certainly
_ it did bring back memories of how cranky old Sen. John McClellan
of Arkansas would get, in the suite below the Gores', when Al Gore
dribbled his basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the building, Gore gestured toward a door. ``This woman
down here had great Jell-O, so I'd go down and visit with her,'' he
said, as if he were half-hoping that she might still come out and
invite him in.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores' two-bedroom apartment has been totally rebuilt, but
the view from the roof is still mostly unaltered. ``This was a key
escape route,'' he said, taking the stairs up into the open air.
And on the roof, he was reminded of some of the childish tricks he
used to spend hours there perfecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd lay on my belly on the edge'' and lower a toy duck, tied
to a thread, down slowly, trying to bop those walking into the
hotel on the head just as they went through the door, he said. He
also hurled water balloons at cars stopped at the red light below,
and ``I hate to admit this,'' he said, ``but I would scare the
birds up here, with distressing results for the windshields'' of
cars on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Coming back down the stairs, he spied a small indentation in the
wall where he used to hide ``whatever a 10-year-old didn't want
someone to find.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my stuff may still be in there,'' he said. But no, it
had been sealed off and painted over.

`VERTIGO': EXPLORING A PRESENT THAT IS INVADED BY THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of Proust as the Isaac Newton of memory. Instead of the
possibly apocryphal apple triggering the Universal Law of
Gravitation, a madeleine sets off a universal law of recollection.
</P>
<P>
   Think of W.G. Sebald as memory's Einstein, and his two great
novels, ``The Emigrants'' (1996) and ``The Rings of Saturn''
(1998), as his Special Theory and General Theory, respectively. The
first tells of half a dozen Jews who for one reason or another
escaped the Holocaust; one because he lived before it. (Einsteinian
time runs backwards as well as forward.) All collapse in nightmare
or hallucination after lifetimes of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rings,'' taking the form of a monthslong ramble through the
decayed towns of East Anglia _ interwoven with the narrator's
meanderings through history, literature and his own depression _
makes a more general case. The Holocaust, lethally radiating in
every temporal direction, contaminates in its foreshadowings and
rememberings all human chronicles, not just those of the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Proust, in the seclusion of his famous cork-lined room,
recreated a past free from the interference of the present: a
separate world, mesmeric, endlessly suggestive and utterly
controlled. Sebald, a German writer, has no cork. And his novels,
so very different, give rise to an equivalent sense (I will not say
equal, since weights and measures are for another generation) that
the ground of consciousness has shifted beneath us.
</P>
<P>
   The present that he explores is invaded, governed, sullied and
eroded by the past. In a modern Europe Sebald has created a common
market or free trade zone between memory and the senses, between
then and now, between what we think or do and what the past has
thought and done. There are no boundary markers or customs posts.
</P>
<P>
   Time is not what we employ to measure the distance we have come
or plan to go. It is a mechanism set off in the past and advancing
balefully upon us. It will not simply limit our future _ the
classical notion _ it undoes our present. We resort to futile
devices against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vertigo,'' for example, describes a watchmaker's shop ``in
which a host of long-case clocks, wall-mounted regulators, kitchen
and living room clocks, alarm clocks, pocket and wristwatches were
all ticking at once, just as if one clock on its own could not
destroy enough time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vertigo'' is Sebald's first novel, now rendered into English
by his regular translator, Michael Hulse, whose fine transparency
is the sheerest of silk gloves on the writer's hand. It has some of
the instant bewitchment _ we enter Sebald's discourse like Alice
going down the rabbit hole _ of the other books. Here the
incantations of his style are used for a slighter purpose, as if he
were honing his instruments. The exception may be the last of the
book's four sections; a memoir, beguiling and troubling, of the
Bavarian village where the narrator was raised.
</P>
<P>
   In all of Sebald's writing the narrator's identification with
the author flickers; each leaves the other free. In any case,
identity for Sebald is geological more than personal: the stratum
deposits of history, reading, the imagination and dreams. ``Dream
Is a Life'' would be Sebald's reversal of the title of Calderon de
la Barca's celebrated play.
</P>
<P>
   The first three sections interweave the narrator's travels in
Italy with those of Stendhal, Casanova and Kafka. N (I will call
him) disappears into his subject; at times he is living their
lives, at others it is as if they were living his. None of it makes
a narrative, really; more like a nervous picking up of detail or
incident, as a collector might proceed who is not certain what he
should be collecting. ``Only collect'' could be N's motto; but the
randomness is a statement of human existence.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs are used (as they are to more rending effect in the
other books) to document the uncertainty. The receipt for a park
fee in Verona, a railroad ticket extending the fare when N decides
to go beyond his destination, the snapshot of a boarded-up pizzeria
he once went to (and fled in panic). Life's meaning is uncertain,
but: Look here, I  &UR; have &LR;  been to the park, on the train, at the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The first sketch is delicate but tenuous; a variation on the
memoirs Stendhal wrote years after he went to Italy in Napoleon's
army. More substantial are N's travels touching on Casanova's time
in Venice, where he was imprisoned; and Kafka's visit to Lake Garda
for a hydrotherapy cure.
</P>
<P>
   N makes the stops. At Desenzano he lies down on the grass as
Kafka did; later he has a mild flirtation with the landlady of an
inn on the lake. He gets into an imbroglio with the parents of two
boys he accosts because he thinks they look like Kafka.
</P>
<P>
   He undergoes depressions and fears that seem to mirror Kafka's.
He hallucinates glimpses of Dante, the daughter of James I and mad
King Ludwig of Bavaria. We become what we know, goes the
Aristotelian formulation; and Sebald's N becomes the history and
literature he has read and the paintings he has seen.
</P>
<P>
   In this early book Sebald has not yet found a way to attach his
melancholy and his oddly moving comedy to a convincing vision of
history's fearful workings. ``Vertigo'' floats at times; meanwhile
there is the lovely specificity of the writing: the seen characters
and the unseen wildness, for instance, in the Alpine village where
N grew up. Or the Verona dog.
</P>
<P>
   As N is chasing ghosts: ``A sandy-colored dog with a black mark
like a patch over its left eye, that appeared like all stray dogs
to run at an angle to the direction it was moving in, had attached
itself to me outside the duomo and now kept a steady distance ahead
of me. If I paused to gaze down at the river, it paused as well and
looked pensively at the flowing water.''
</P>
<P>
   N has Kafka and a headful of cloudy connections. The dog has his
modest canine day, and N.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak recalled his peace
negotiators from Sweden on Sunday after a firebomb seriously
wounded a 2-year-old Israeli girl in a car passing through the
sleepy Palestinian-ruled city of Jericho.
</P>
<P>
   The attack prompted Israel to block entrance to the Palestinian
territories, declaring them unsafe for Israelis and tourists, and
temporarily undercut a year of normalization efforts. The incident
also undermined Palestinian attempts to restore order, although the
Palestinians did clamp down on street fighting for the first time
in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials denounced Barak for pushing away from the
peace table. Calling it an ``irresponsible decision,'' Ahmed Abdel
Rahman, general secretary of the Palestinian Authority, said it
would lead to ``further deterioration and increased tensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night, because of surging violence in the West
Bank, Gaza and Lebanon, Barak also canceled a trip to consult with
President Clinton on the U.S.-mediated ``final status'' peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton's advisers said they understood, the
cancellation indicated that Israel was setting its own timetable
despite prodding from administration officials who have devoted two
terms to the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort and feel that their
remaining time is ebbing away.
</P>
<P>
   Middle East peace, however, does not work on anyone's schedule.
Certainly the last two weeks have produced an unpredictable shift
on the ground, in which the Palestinians' frustration with the slow
pace of peace erupted at the same time that officials finally got
down to serious and substantive final-status negotiations in
Stockholm, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators face a September deadline, which is tight even
without timeouts, given that other events will compete for the
Israeli leader's attention. Soon, Barak, who is also the defense
minister, will be forced to focus on the complex and delicate task
of withdrawing Israeli troops from southern Lebanon by July 7. And
analysts believe that the dynamic of the withdrawal is already
affecting Israeli-Palestinian relations.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Arab world see Israel's withdrawal as a defeat to be
celebrated, and as an object lesson that negates the value of peace
negotiations. Fighters from Hezbollah, or the Party of God, are
intensifying their combat to ensure that Israel pulls out under
fire.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, for the first time in years, they attacked an Israeli
outpost at the foot of Mount Hermon, in the Shebaa Farms area that
was Syrian territory when Israel occupied the Golan Heights. Israel
does not plan to withdraw from the Shebaa Farms even though Lebanon
recently claimed the land as Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, which will certify whether Israel's
withdrawal is complete, is unlikely to accept Lebanon's assertion.
This makes the Shebaa Farms a worrisome zone, and Hezbollah sent a
message Sunday that it would keep fighting Israel if the withdrawal
did not include the area.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in the last week, Palestinian youths cited the
Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon as proof that violence ``forces the
Israelis to surrender,'' as one teen-ager said Sunday. ``They are
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that this will be a new intifada,'' Nafez Azzam, a
leader of the Islamic Holy War group in Gaza, said, referring to
the uprising of the late 1980s. ``It should continue as far as
occupation remains. There is no excuse for resumption of talks
under such an atmosphere. This is an atmosphere of war.''
</P>
<P>
   The street violence, which involved sustained gunfire between
Israeli and Palestinian troops last Monday, provoked opposition
forces on both sides to press their leaders to suspend the peace
talks. At Sunday's Israeli Cabinet meeting, Health Minister Shlomo
Benizri of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party said that Yasser Arafat,
the Palestinian leader, was ``either a dead horse or a deadly
one,'' and he proclaimed the peace effort to be useless.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Stockholm negotiations continued until Sunday, when
Barak halted them ``in light of the situation.'' He also deferred
the transfer of Abu Dis and two other villages abutting Jerusalem
to full Palestinian control.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office said he viewed the incident in Jericho ``with the
greatest concern'' and has demanded that the Palestinian Authority
track down and arrest those responsible. The car in which the
little girl was traveling was passing through Jericho on its way to
northern Israel, a shortcut that many Israelis prefer to the
circuitous bypass road that was constructed so they could avoid
Palestinian-ruled areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Jericho attack unnerved pro-peace Israelis, who have
hesitated to accept that the recent violence could be anything but
a short-lived spurt, because such incidents were coming to be seen
as a thing of the past. Many have touted the normalization of
tourism to and travel through Jericho in particular as an emblem of
successful ``people to people'' peace relations.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a reflection of the successful casino there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We today are not at peace with ourselves when we see what is
happening with the Palestinians,'' said Shlomo Lahat, a former
mayor of Tel Aviv and chairman of a pro-peace forum. ``We are
sensitive people, and we understand their pain _ but to attack
people and shoot at them _ that's the thanks we get? These things
cause us to reconsider whether the road we are on is the right
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, of course, see things differently.
</P>
<P>
   In the last nine days, rubber-coated or live bullets fired by
Israeli troops killed five Palestinians and wounded more than 1,000
others, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian human rights groups said the Israeli troops were
using ``excessive force against unarmed Palestinians,'' although
some of the protesters, who threw stones and firebombs, were backed
by sharpshooters. The Israeli soldiers targeted chests, abdomens
and necks, and used live ammunition to disperse crowds, the human
rights advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   The violence grew out of street protests on behalf of the 1,650
Palestinian prisoners in Israel, coupled with demonstrations
marking the anniversary of what Palestinians call the ``nakba,''
the ``catastrophe'' that coupled the destruction of Palestine with
the birth of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In a familiar ritual here, some protesters marched to Israeli
guard positions on the outskirts of Palestinian areas and threw
stones and firebombs. The Israeli soldiers responded by shooting
tear gas, rubber bullets and live bullets. And the Palestinian
police were hesitant to place themselves between their own people
and the Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian Authority cannot use brutal measures on its
own people,'' said Nabil Amr, the minister of parliamentary
affairs. ``We cannot deny them the right to express themselves even
if, unfortunately, it leads to violence and more violence.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, however, the Palestinian police prevented most
demonstrations in the West Bank and Gaza from escalating into
violent clashes. In Ramallah, for instance, they set up roadblocks
on all streets leading to an Israeli-guarded junction and then,
using billy clubs, pushed hundreds of stone-throwing demonstrators
away from the fence of a nearby settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, demonstrators began throwing stones t their
own police officers, and some of the officers hid behind a wall and
threw stones back.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinians said they thought a visit by Sandy Berger,
President Clinton's national security adviser, to Arafat on
Saturday night helped calm the situation. They met in Ramallah.
Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official, said that ``the
Americans affirmed their readiness to hold a trilateral summit''
with Arafat and Barak but insisted that progress in negotiations be
made first.
</P>
<P>
   That would require negotiations to resume. And Berger, who spoke
at Tel Aviv University on Sunday morning, seemed to be urging the
parties to rise above the moment and take the long view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today and in the months ahead, we have a historic opportunity
that we must not allow to slip away _ a chance to resolve the
Israeli-Palestinian problem, the core of the Arab-Israeli
conflict,'' he said. ``The alternative to a peaceful compromise is
not the status quo. It is something very different and, I am
convinced, far worse. For the condition that produced hostility in
the past remains current to this day, as we see in the violence of
the past week.''

BRASSAI RETROSPECTIVE REVEALS AN ALL-ROUND ARTIST 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ With the publication of his first book, ``Paris de
Nuit,'' in 1932, Brassai did more than win immediate acclaim as a
photographer. In what was already a much photographed city, he
created iconic images of nighttime Paris that redefined how it was
seen, almost as if darkness were its natural condition. In the
process he established an artistic trademark that, if exploited,
would have assured him a lifetime of fortune as well as fame.
</P>
<P>
   Brassai, however, was something of a reluctant photographer. He
never had a studio, he never worked on news events or fashion
shoots, he never did commercial portraits, he never considered
photography to be that important. He took up photography almost by
accident, but it was his love of art and literature that shaped his
vision of the world. The idea of endlessly recording Paris by night
was inconceivable to him.
</P>
<P>
   The artists, writers and intellectuals in his circle also
understood that photography was only one of his interests. ``I am
not at all surprised that you are also a good orator _ and a
painter and a sculptor and a writer too,'' Henry Miller, a friend
from prewar days in Paris, told him in a nostalgic letter sent from
California in 1948. ``I'll never forget your speech about Goethe
and Thomas Aquinas in the middle of the night. I'd love to have a
copy in German.''
</P>
<P>
   While remembered as a photographer, then, Brassai was always
reaching beyond photography. He was drawn to Miller and the poets
Jacques Prevert and Henri Michaux _ and photographed them _ because
he was fascinated by the written word. He photographed Picasso,
Matisse, Bonnard and Giacometti, not because they were famous, but
because he identified with them as artists.
</P>
<P>
   This, at least, is the persuasive thesis of the largest ever
retrospective of his work, which is being presented at the Georges
Pompidou Center in Paris through June 26 and which will later
travel to Verona, Florence, London, Tokyo and Berlin. ``Brassai,''
as it is called, naturally focuses on his photography, but it also
exhibits his drawings and sculptures, shows a short film that won
him a prize at the Cannes film festival in 1956 and recalls his
career as a journalist and writer.
</P>
<P>
   This show has a special advantage. ``Brassai: The Eye of
Paris,'' the well-received exhibition organized last year by the
Houston Museum of Fine Arts (and seen during the winter at the
National Gallery of Art in Washington), was built around American
collections of his work. But ``Brassai'' in Paris was able to tap
the archives of both the Pompidou and the photographer's widow,
Gilberte. As a result, 100 of the 450 works on display are being
shown in public for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these offer new insight into how Brassai worked. His
images of Paris night life, of couples in bars or solitary figures
on park benches, earned him the nickname ``pickpocket of reality,''
as if, like Henri Cartier-Bresson, he captured ``decisive
moments.'' But archive photographs in the show demonstrate that,
rather than snapping away surreptiously, Brassai worked slowly and
openly, taking a series of photographs before finding a composition
that pleased him.
</P>
<P>
   Some nighttime series were clearly staged, like those taken of
women in a popular brothel, Chez Suzy, of a prostitute and her
client in a hotel on the Rue Quincampoix and of young hoods hanging
out in the Italian quarter. In all of these he was intent on
creating a mise en scene to suggest a narrative. The man in
overcoat and trilby seen entering Chez Suzy was not ``caught in the
act''; he was evidently a friend who walked up the steps several
times until Brassai was satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Brassai's nude photographs, famous in their own right, become
even more interesting when seen beside his drawings and stone
sculptures of naked women. As a student sketching models in Berlin,
he portrayed women with narrow torsos and exaggeratedly Rubensian
hips, a ``look'' that is echoed in the Cycladic shapes of his
little statues, the photographic poses that emphasize rotund rears
and other nude drawings done 20 years later.
</P>
<P>
   His artist's eye was not accidental. Born as Gyula Halasz in the
then Hungarian (now Romanian) town of Brasso in 1899, he attended
high school in Budapest and served in the Austro-Hungarian Army in
World War I before entering the Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest in
1918. Two years later he continued his studies at the Academy of
Fine Arts at Charlottenburg in Berlin where, just as significantly,
he discovered Goethe. Yet if his purpose was to become an artist,
he was also restless. In 1924 he moved to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   To make ends meet, he became a journalist, covering sports
events for a Hungarian newspaper and writing features for German
magazines. And because these features needed illustration, he began
to meet photographers, among them a fellow Hungarian, Andre
Kertesz. In 1929 Halasz bought his first camera so he, too, could
take photographs for his articles. And, given his Bohemian way of
life, it seemed natural for him to photograph Paris after dark.
``Paris de Nuit,'' with 60 atmospheric black-and-white images, was
the result. It brought him a new career and a new identity:
adapting the name of his birthplace, he became Brassai.
</P>
<P>
   The book's success led to invitations to photograph sculptures
by Picasso in his studio on the Rue La Boetie and to collaborate
with Andre Breton's Surrealist review, Minotaure. He accepted both.
The first led to a lifelong friendship with Picasso and the 1964
book of memoirs, ``Conversations with Picasso.'' (``Read this book
if you want to understand me,'' Picasso said approvingly.) The
second drew him into Breton's circle, although he always rejected
being termed a Surrealist.
</P>
<P>
   ``They considered my photographs `surrealist' because they
revealed a phantasmal and unreal Paris, plunged in darkness and
fog,'' he later wrote. ``But the surrealism of my images was
nothing more than reality rendered fantastic by the way it is seen.
I sought only to capture reality because nothing is more surreal
than that.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   One example of this surreal reality might be the wall portraits
that he called ``Graffiti.'' These were not concerned with words in
the modern sense of graffiti, but rather with the texture and
shapes of crumbling facades eroded by weather or marked by some
amateur artist's knife. Later in life, when Brassai tried his hand
at color photography, these ``Graffiti'' came even closer to
abstract paintings. But, as he liked to point out, they were still
only walls.
</P>
<P>
   After Nazi Germany occupied France in June 1940, Brassai refused
to seek permission to continue working as a photographer or
journalist. Instead, he took up drawing again. (He published a book
of his drawings in 1946, with a preface by Prevert.) He also wrote
a short book, ``Bistro-Tabac,'' about life in occupied Paris. Then,
from 1943, he again accepted Picasso's invitation to photograph his
sculptures, this time in the artist's studio on the Rue des
Grands-Augustins.
</P>
<P>
   After the war resuming a relationship with Harper's Bazaar that
began in 1937, Brassai was free to photograph anything he wished,
with Paris and its artists _ Maillol, Braque, Beckett and Ionesco
were among his new subjects _ favored by the magazine. His own
interests, though, remained eclectic. He wrote a book, ``The Story
of Maria,'' with a preface by Miller, about a humble domestic
servant. He made the film, ``As Long as There Are Animals,'' that
won the prize at Cannes. And while he never returned to Hungary, he
traveled widely.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris show, which is inspired by the 100th anniversary of
Brassai's birth (he died in 1984), is organized around key periods
in his life, with sections dedicated to ``Paris de Nuit,'' his work
for Minotaure, his drawings and sculptures, and his so-called
``Transmutations,'' engravings made on glass plate that already
carry a nude image.
</P>
<P>
   The show also evokes three significant Brassai exhibitions:
``Five French Photographers'' at the Museum of Modern Art in New
York in 1951, which featured Cartier-Bresson, Robert Doisneau,
Izius and Willy Ronis as well as Brassai; ``Language of the Wall:
Parisian Graffiti'' in 1956, also at the Modern; and ``Art Mural''
at the Galerie Recontre in Paris in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising, perhaps, this is the first Brassai
retrospective held in Paris. Yet it achieves its objective. His
photographs of Paris at night have long been part of the city's
visual language, but other Brassais _ the draftsman, sculptor,
writer, filmmaker, even the orator _ were less well known. By
presenting him as the complete artist, this show also uses his life
to make a broader point: that creators are enriched when they avoid
isolation in their own art form.

DODGERS' TOUGH TRIP HAS HAPPY ENDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI - To a man, everyone in the Dodgers clubhouse knew the
first seven weeks of the season were more about survival than
success. If they made it through and were anywhere near .500,
they'd be happy.
</P>
<P>
   How's ecstatic sound?
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers ended a grueling four-city road trip against the
Florida Marlins on Sunday, bringing an end to one of the toughest
stretches to begin a season that any Dodger can remember. And,
after losing the first three games to Arizona, they come back 24-17
and in second place in the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody could have had a schedule like we had,'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said. ``We talked about it in the spring that
we best not come out of spring training struggling. With a new
shortstop/second baseman combination ... a new prime player in our
lineup, we couldn't afford to come out stumbling.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not only the just-completed road trip that took the Dodgers
to Arizona, St. Louis, Chicago and Florida that was difficult. The
Dodgers and San Diego are tied for the NL lead with 27 road games,
and the Dodgers have played a league-low 14 home games.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have made three road trips, including an 11-day
swing to start the season, and each time they've traveled to the
East Coast. There's also the time they had to return to New York on
a scheduled off day between Cincinnati and Atlanta to play a
make-up game, and the suspended game against the Giants at Pac Bell
Park that basically turned into a doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the toughest start to a schedule of any time
I've been here,'' first baseman Eric Karros said. ``We could have
put ourselves in a very tough situation. We played two teams
(Houston and Chicago) under .500, played the fewest home games, so
with the position we're in right now we couldn't ask for a better
start.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though they lost right-hander Kevin Brown to a broken
pinkie for two weeks and had to juggle the rotation because of two
other rainouts, the Dodgers lead the league with 16 road wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the schedule and see all the road games to begin
with, and you blow it off and go do your job,'' right-hander Darren
Dreifort said. ``Guys have done a great job. I think everyone has
gotten to know each other pretty well so far and we have a good
bunch of guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so home cookin': Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield won a
World Series with the Marlins, but he's still lustily booed every
at-bat at Pro Player Stadium. But he did enjoy the 442-foot grand
slam he hit Saturday in the Dodgers' 12-6 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the highlights I wanted to do,'' Sheffield
said. ``Even when I was here and I had success, it was a love-hate
relationship. If I didn't get a hit, I got booed. If I got a hit, I
was cheered. They were only behind you if you were doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Counting on Cora: Even though Alex Cora was sent to Triple-A
Albuquerque after Saturday's game, he did enough in his time
replacing the injured Kevin Elster to give everyone confidence he
can play shortstop on a regular basis if need be.
</P>
<P>
   Cora hit .297 in nine games, drove in three runs and displayed
great range and played above-average defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He proved he's a big-league shortstop,'' Johnson said. ``He
can hit up here. That's the big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Left-handed reliever Trever Miller, claimed off
waivers from the Philadelphia Phillies on Friday, joins the Dodgers
today. Lefty Onan Masaoka is expected to be sent to Albuquerque to
free up the roster spot. ... When Shawn Green and Sheffield hit
back-to-back homers in the ninth, it marked the second time this
season the Dodgers have done it. The last time was against Florida
in Los Angeles, when Green followed a Sheffield homer.
</P>
<P>
   DODGERS vs. CINCINNATI
</P>
<P>
   Time: 7:10 p.m., at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Fox Sports Net 2; 1150-AM, KWKW-AM (1330 Spanish).
</P>
<P>
   Matchup: Believe it or not, the Dodgers play a home game. In
fact, they open a nine-game homestand with the first of three
agains a team they obliterated last month in Cincinnati when they
scored 36 runs in a three-game sweep. Right-hander Darren Dreifort
(3-1, 3.52 ERA) starts for the Dodgers against left-hander Denny
Neagle (4-0, 3.76). In his last outing, Dreifort lasted 4 innings
and gave up six runs, all of which came after he slid into third
and jammed his right knee. He says he's OK. Neagle is a much better
pitcher on the road, going 2-0 with a 1.93 ERA. Tuesday _ Dodgers
RH Eric Gagne (0-2, 4.30) vs. Reds RH Osvaldo Fernandez (0-0,
5.68); Wednesday _ Dodgers RH Chan Ho Park (4-3, 4.89) vs. Reds RH
Steve Parris (2-6, 5.63).

it has been one of execution. The Chinese have hardly cooperated,

freedom would eventually produce political freedom. Nor has there

WORKING IN ENGLISH AND LAUGHING IN OJIBWE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Latest in a series. See note at end.)  
 By LOUISE ERDRICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years now I have been in love with a language other than the
English in which I write, and it is a rough affair. Every day I try
to learn a little more Ojibwe. I have taken to carrying verb
conjugation charts in my purse, along with the tiny notebook I've
always kept for jotting down book ideas, overheard conversations,
language detritus, phrases that pop into my head. Now that little
notebook includes an increasing volume of Ojibwe words. My English
is jealous, my Ojibwe elusive. Like a besieged unfaithful lover,
I'm trying to appease them both.
</P>
<P>
   Ojibwemowin, or Anishinabemowin, the Chippewa language, was last
spoken in our family by Patrick Gourneau, my maternal grandfather,
a Turtle Mountain Ojibwe who used it mainly in his prayers. Growing
up off reservation, I thought Ojibwemowin mainly was a language for
prayers, like Latin in the Catholic liturgy. I was unaware for many
years that Ojibwemowin was spoken in Canada, Minnesota and
Wisconsin, though by a dwindling number of people. By the time I
began to study the language, I was living in New Hampshire, so for
the first few years I used language tapes.
</P>
<P>
   I never learned more than a few polite phrases that way, but the
sound of the language in the author Basil Johnson's calm and
dignified Anishinabe voice sustained me through bouts of
homesickness. I spoke basic Ojibwe in the isolation of my car
traveling here and there on twisting New England roads. Back then,
as now, I carried my tapes everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The language bit deep into my heart, but it was an unfulfilled
longing. I had nobody to speak it with, nobody who remembered my
grandfather's standing with his sacred pipe in the woods next to a
box elder tree, talking to the spirits. Not until I moved back to
the Midwest and settled in Minneapolis did I find a fellow Ojibweg
to learn with, and a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Mille Lac's Ojibwe elder Jim Clark _ Naawi-giizis, or Center of
the Day _ is a magnetically pleasant, sunny, crew-cut World War II
veteran with a mysterious kindliness that shows in his slightest
gesture. When he laughs, everything about him laughs; and when he
is serious, his eyes round like a boy's.
</P>
<P>
   Naawi-giizis introduced me to the deep intelligence of the
language and forever set me on a quest to speak it for one reason:
I want to get the jokes. I also want to understand the prayers and
the adisookaanug, the sacred stories, but the irresistible part of
language for me is the explosion of hilarity that attends every
other minute of an Ojibwe visit. As most speakers are now
bilingual, the language is spiked with puns on both English and
Ojibwe, most playing on the oddness of gichi-mookomaan, that is,
big knife or American, habits and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   This desire to deepen my alternate language puts me in an odd
relationship to my first love, English. It is, after all, the
language stuffed into my mother's ancestors' mouths. English is the
reason she didn't speak her native language and the reason I can
barely limp along in mine. English is an all-devouring language
that has moved across North America like the fabulous plagues of
locusts that darkened the sky and devoured even the handles of
rakes and hoes. Yet the omnivorous nature of a colonial language is
a writer's gift. Raised in the English language, I partake of a
mongrel feast.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred years ago most Ojibwe people spoke Ojibwemowin, but
the Bureau of Indian Affairs and religious boarding schools
punished and humiliated children who spoke native languages. The
program worked, and there are now almost no fluent speakers of
Ojibwe in the United States under the age of 30. Speakers like
Naawi-giizis value the language partly because it has been
physically beaten out of so many people. Fluent speakers have had
to fight for the language with their own flesh, have endured
ridicule, have resisted shame and stubbornly pledged themselves to
keep on talking the talk.
</P>
<P>
   My relationship is of course very different. How do you go back
to a language you never had? Why should a writer who loves her
first language find it necessary and essential to complicate her
life with another? Simple reasons, personal and impersonal. In the
past few years I've found that I can talk to God only in this
language, that somehow my grandfather's use of the language
penetrated. The sound comforts me.
</P>
<P>
   What the Ojibwe call the Gizhe Manidoo, the great and kind
spirit residing in all that lives, what the Lakota call the Great
Mystery, is associated for me with the flow of Ojibwemowin. My
Catholic training touched me intellectually and symbolically but
apparently never engaged my heart.
</P>
<P>
   There is also this: Ojibwemowin is one of the few surviving
languages that evolved to the present here in North America. The
intelligence of this language is adapted as no other to the
philosophy bound up in northern land, lakes, rivers, forests arid
plains; to the animals and their particular habits; to the shades
of meaning in the very placement of stones. As a North American
writer it is essential to me that I try to understand our human
relationship to place in the deepest way possible, using my
favorite tool, language.
</P>
<P>
   There are place names in Ojibwe and Dakota for every physical
feature of Minnesota, including recent additions like city parks
and dredged lakes. Ojibwemowin is not static, not confined to
describing the world of some out-of-reach and sacred past. There
are words for e-mail, computers, Internet, fax. For exotic animals
in zoos. Anaamibiig gookoosh, the underwater pig, is a
hippopotamus. Nandookomeshiinh, the the lice hunter, is the monkey.
</P>
<P>
   There are words for the serenity prayer used in 12-step programs
and translations of nursery rhymes. The varieties of people other
than Ojibwe or Anishinabe are also named: Aiibiishaabookewininiwag,
the tea people, are Asians. Agongosininiwag, the chipmunk people,
are Scandinavians. I'm still trying to find out why.
</P>
<P>
   For years I saw only the surface of Ojibwemowin. With any study
at all one looks deep into a stunning complex of verbs. Ojibwemowin
is a language of verbs. All action. Two-thirds of the words are
verbs, and for each verb there are as many as 6,000 forms. The
storm of verb forms makes it a wildly adaptive and powerfully
precise language. Changite-ige describes the way a duck tips itself
up in the water butt first. There is a word for what would happen
if a man fell off a motorcycle with a pipe in his mouth and the
stem of it went through the back of his head. There can be a verb
for anything.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to nouns, there is some relief. There aren't many
objects. With a modest if inadvertent political correctness, there
are no designations of gender in Ojibwemowin. There an no feminine
or masculine possessives or articles.
</P>
<P>
   Nouns are mainly designated as alive or dead, animate or
inanimate. The word for stone, asin, is animate. Stones are called
grandfathers and grandmothers and are extremely important in Ojibwe
philosophy. Once I began to think of stones as animate, I started
to wonder whether I was picking up a stone or it was putting itself
into my hand. Stones are not the same as they were to me in
English. I can't write about a stone without considering it in
Ojibwe and acknowledging that the Anishinabe universe began with a
conversation between stones.
</P>
<P>
   Ojibwemowin is also a language of emotions; shades of feeling
can be mixed like paints. There is a word for what occurs when your
heart is silently shedding tears. Ojibwe is especially good at
describing intellectual states and the fine points of moral
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Ozozamenimaa pertains to a misuse of one's talents getting out
of control. Ozozamichige implies you can still set things right.
There are many more kinds of love than there are in English. There
are myriad shades of emotional meaning to designate various family
and clan members. It is a language that also recognizes the
humanity of a creaturely God, and the absurd and wondrous sexuality
of even the most deeply religious beings.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly the language has crept into my writing, replacing a word
here, a concept there, beginning to carry weight. I've thought of
course of writing stories in Ojibwe, like a reverse Nabokov. With
my Ojibwe at the level of a dreamy 4-year-old child's, I probably
won't.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was not originally a written language, people simply
adapted the English alphabet and wrote phonetically. During the
Second World War, Naawi-giizis wrote Ojibwe letters to his uncle
from Europe. He spoke freely about his movements, as no censor
could understand his writing. Ojibwe orthography has recently been
standardized. Even so, it is an all-day task for me to write even
one paragraph using verbs in their correct arcane forms. And even
then, there are so many dialects of Ojibwe that, for many speakers,
I'll still have gotten it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As awful as my own Ojibwe must sound to a fluent speaker, I have
never, ever, been greeted with a moment of impatience or laughter.
Perhaps people wait until I've left the room. But more likely, I
think, there is an urgency about attempting to speak the language.
To Ojibwe speakers the language is a deeply loved entity. There is
a spirit or an originating genius belonging to each word.
</P>
<P>
   Before attempting to speak this language, a learner must
acknowledge these spirits with gifts of tobacco and food. Anyone
who attempts Ojibwemowin is engaged in something more than learning
tongue twisters. However awkward my nouns, unstable my verbs,
however stumbling my delivery, to engage in the language is to
engage the spirit. Perhaps that is what my teachers know, and what
my English will forgive.

PUTIN'S MOVE ON GOVERNORS WOULD BOLSTER HIS ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It turns out that the most momentous act of Vladimir
Putin's first days as Russia's elected president has not been his
choice of a Cabinet, or the internal debate over a sweeping
economic restructuring plan, or even the approval of two nuclear
arms treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it is Putin's mounting of a swift and stunning crusade
last week to gut the power and political influence of Russia's 89
governors _ and not coincidentally, perhaps, to enhance his own.
</P>
<P>
   If the campaign succeeds _ and that seemed more than possible
this week _ then Putin will have reoriented Russia's federal system
toward the Kremlin. And the governors, arguably the most powerful
and rebellious politicians outside the Kremlin walls, will have
been relegated to truly provincial status.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin says that is what Russia needs to pull itself out of
the slough that is its 9-year history as an independent nation, and
many experts agree. But it will come at the cost of making Putin,
already endowed with czarlike powers by the constitution, an even
more towering figure in Russian politics and government.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Moscow's all-powerful mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, was quick to
attack Putin's plan as arbitrary and potentially illegal. But many
political experts here say Putin is on the right course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general tendency is positive because the major obstacle to
reforms is the influence of the oligarchs and the governors, whom I
call dictators,'' said Sergei Markov, one of the country's top
political analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Lilia Shevtsova, a top analyst at the Moscow office of the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said, ``The fact that
Putin wants to crush these authoritarian regimes is a very
promising sign.'' She calls the governors robber barons and says
reining them in should be one of the new president's top
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's proposal comes at the peak of his political power now,
while he is blessed with a comparatively prosperous economy and a
clutch of powerful alliances with the major factions in Parliament.
He took quick advantage of it all last week, in effect declaring
war on the governors in two prime-time television speeches.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he proposed to oust, permanently, all 89 governors
and the leaders of their legislatures from their guaranteed seats
in Russia's counterpart to the U.S. Senate, the Federation Council.
The move would wipe out the current membership of the 188-seat
house, replacing it with lesser regional officials.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, Putin said on Wednesday that he would seek legal
authority to personally suspend or fire any governor who flouts
federal law or defies the Russian constitution.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all: Four days earlier, a Putin decree corralled
the governors' 89 provinces into seven new administrative
districts, each overseen by a regional official who is answerable
directly to Putin, and no one else.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the semi-official Interfax news service called the
proposals ``an attack, one may even say storming'' of the
governors' political bastion. Putin is said to have sprung the plan
on top governors last week in a meeting that ran so long that the
president's next appointment _ his new prime minister, Mikhail
Kasyanov _ cooled his heels for more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The governors, still awed by Putin's popularity, have reacted
cautiously. But few Russians expect them to roll over. For taken
together, the proposals have the potential not just to end the
their long run as regional potentates, but to wreak vengeance on
the most disobedient of their lot.
</P>
<P>
   The seven new administrative districts have been billed as a
streamlining of the government, replacing the individual envoys to
all 89 provinces who served under President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   But they are more than that. Under Yeltsin, both the envoys and
many federal agencies became willing captives of the governors, who
supplied them with favors the Kremlin could not or would not
provide. Federal officials were dependent on the provinces for
everything from office space and telephones to jobs for their
families and summer camps for their children.
</P>
<P>
   That will all change under Putin.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The seven new envoys will work from regional capitals with
budgets, housing and offices supplied by the Kremlin, as well as
the power to bestow perks on federal officials in their districts.
The effect, the administration hopes, will be to bring those
officials back under the Kremlin's sway, and thus to bring more
pressure to bear on the governors to follow federal orders.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed reorganization of the Federation Council is
potentially even more far-reaching. While details of the plan were
not clear last weekend, Putin apparently intends to replace the
council members with provincial officials elected by their peers,
diluting the governors' power to control votes on the council.
</P>
<P>
   The governors, however, stand to lose far more than political
power. If they lose their parliamentary seats, they also surrender
one of its most coveted benefits: complete immunity from criminal
prosecution. And more than a few of them have cause to worry about
that.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Russia's governors have lived high for a long time. As a string
of crises and Yeltsin's desultory rule drained Moscow of money and
influence, the far-flung provinces have increasingly made their own
way, and some leaders have become corrupt, autocratic or both.
</P>
<P>
   On the Pacific coast, 5,000 miles from the Kremlin, the governor
of the Primoriye region, Yevgeny Nazdratenko, has taken over
private businesses, seized control of the press and judiciary,
pumped government budgets dry and, according to Yeltsin's Kremlin,
regularly ignored federal decrees.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country on the Black Sea, Krasnodar Province has been
identified by human rights groups as a center of authoritarianism,
anti-Semitism and ``extreme xenophobia'' under Gov. Nikolai
Kondratenko. On the nearby Caspian, Kalmikiya has threatened
secession, veered toward dictatorship and spent lavishly on a
``chess city'' under its chess-obsessed president, Kirsan
Ilyumzhinov.
</P>
<P>
   Some regions have erected trade barriers, treating each other
almost like foreign nations. Putin claims that a fifth of
provincial laws run counter to federal legislation. He need not
look far: The city of Moscow, a federal district, has paid little
attention to warnings that its regulations counter federal law.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In making his argument to clean up the system, Putin argues,
with some justification, that he won election on a platform of
bringing a dangerously undisciplined Russia to heel before it does
itself fatal damage, and that reining in such behavior is the first
step.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just correct today; it is absolutely necessary,''
he said on Wednesday. ``The looseness of power is very costly for
millions of average people. The cost of the lack of discipline in
the state is our personal security, the inviolability of property
and housing and, finally, our own well-being and the future of our
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The president stresses that his proposals conform to the
constitution, that they require Parliament's approval, and that he
rejects more draconian options, like arrogating to himself the
power to appoint governors.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is making his case directly to the people, on television,
which suggests that he wants the sort of public mandate that past
leaders, including Yeltsin, rarely bothered to seek.
</P>
<P>
   His chances of getting what he wants seem good. Although the
Federation Council would seem likely to oppose much of the
Kremlin's plan, it appears that the Duma, the lower house of
Parliament, will overwhelmingly approve it. Both the Duma's
Communists and its right-wing party, the Union of Right Forces,
have announced their support.
</P>
<P>
   If the Duma gives Putin 300 of its 450 votes, a constitutional
majority, the Federation Council will be unable to derail the bills
even if it votes against them.

BEIJING AND TAIWAN'S NEW LEADER TESTING EACH OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ A day after Beijing hinted at new flexibility
in dealing with Taiwan and its new president, it hastened to
restate that its ``one China'' principle was an absolute
precondition of strengthening ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acceptance or rejection of the one-China principle is the
touchstone to test whether one sincerely wants to improve
cross-straits relations,'' said a commentary by the official New
China News Agency, issued in response to the inaugural speech on
Saturday by President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who dares insist on splitting Taiwan from China,'' the
press agency said, ``must bear responsibility for all the serious
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech on Saturday, Chen tried to reassure Beijing that
he wanted reconciliation, but he did not satisfy the Chinese
leaders' demand that he unequivocally call Taiwan a part of China.
</P>
<P>
   In an official response on Saturday that was largely repeated in
Monday's article, Beijing accused Chen of insincerity and
evasiveness. But the statement also emphasized China's desire to
seek closer economic ties across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the first time since Chen's election in March, Beijing
said negotiations could start under two conditions: if both sides
``express in their own way orally'' that they adhere to the
one-China principle, as China says both did in 1992, and if Taiwan
does not call itself an equal state.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, in his second day as president, Chen offered a potential
plum if the two sides can start talking. He said he hoped to
negotiate an end to what he called Taiwan's outdated ban on direct
trade, shipping and postal links.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has long sought such direct ties, known as the ``three
links,'' not just to save the cost of sending goods and flights via
Hong Kong but as a way to draw Taiwan to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan, professing security concerns, has kept the ban as a
bargaining chip, but its own business leaders, who have invested
billions in China and send it a huge amount of exports, are
increasingly chafing at the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts in China and Taiwan said the varying
statements during the last two days were predictable as the sides
continued to test each other as Chen assumed power. In particular,
Beijing is probing to see how far Chen has moved from his longtime
advocacy of formal independence for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Chen Shui-bian's speech offered something positive,
and we should catch the opportunity,'' said a Chinese specialist in
foreign policy, Shen Dingli of Fudan University in Shanghai. ``But
Beijing will continue to put pressure on him over `one China' to
keep him moving in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was preparing to run for president, Chen stopped calling
for formal independence, though he emphasized that Taiwan was
already sovereign in practice and intended to stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   China's statement Monday, compared with Saturday's, included
more emphatic reminders that the one-China principle was a
non-negotiable precondition for talks.
</P>
<P>
   Chen described his goal of relaxing commercial restrictions
today as he visited the outlying Taiwan-controlled island of
Kinmen, or Quemoy, which is near the mainland and would greatly
benefit from direct commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the precondition that national security can be
assured,'' Chen said, ``we are willing to review the outdated,
rigid and inflexible three-links policy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the admission of China and Taiwan to the World Trade
Organization, which could happen as early as September, would
provide a natural forum for discussing such impediments to direct
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Kuo, a political scientist at Soochow University in
Taipei and an adviser to Taiwan's Foreign Ministry, said it was ``a
good sign'' that Beijing had mentioned reviving the 1992 political
formula and its desire to strengthen economic ties.
</P>
<P>
   Kuo warned that rapid progress was unlikely, especially before
China's leaders make crucial decisions about Taiwan at their annual
seaside retreat in August.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that membership of China and Taiwan in the
trade organization could provide an opportunity to ``sort out
economic issues'' and end the ban on direct commerce. China and
other countries have agreed in principle that Taiwan can join the
trade group on a special, non-state basis.

OSCAR HAS LEARNED HIS LESSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Oscar De La Hoya is less than a month away from
one of the biggest fights of his life yet a bout that occurred last
September remains the hottest topic of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya gave away a fight he was winning by running the final
three rounds against Felix Trinidad on Sept. 18, his first and only
loss, which he says changed his approach to boxing as he prepares
to face Shane Mosley on June 17 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the Trinidad fight, De La Hoya said he played
it safe in rounds 10-12 because he believed he had built a
sufficient lead to win.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says there was more to it than that - much more.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, speaking to reporters on the porch of his training-
camp home in Big Bear, said he was dead tired after nine rounds and
lost confidence as a result.
</P>
<P>
   He feared he could be hurt or lose the fight had he engaged the
big-punching Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel I was in condition to stay in there and bang
with him,'' he said. ``In the back of my mind, I'd be thinking,
`I'm gonna get tired, I'm gonna get tired. He might catch me with a
good shot.'
</P>
<P>
   ``... I look back at it now and I realize I should've worked
harder. I should've gone to bed earlier in the training camp, I
should've run a few more miles. These are things I'll always
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, if what he says is true, he (begin ital)couldn't(end
ital) run a few more miles.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, along with trainer Robert Alcazar, said the fighter
endured several bad breaks during training camp before the fight.
</P>
<P>
   A left-hand injury bothered him throughout camp, he sprained his
ankle while breaking in new boxing shoes about two weeks before the
fight and came down with flu around the same time, bad breaks that
inevitably will be construed as excuses by some.
</P>
<P>
   Alcazar said De La Hoya did virtually no training in the final
weeks of camp. He and his fighter thought about postponing the bout
but decided the injuries weren't severe enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did almost nothing the last two weeks,'' Alcazar said. ``It
was tough. Even like that, he was able to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you imagine what he could do in better shape? He could
probably fly.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya doesn't plan to do any flying against Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   Alcazar defended the strategy for the Trinidad fight: punch and
move, move, move. He said the objective in this business is to win
and avoid being hurt.
</P>
<P>
   However, the camp also learned several lessons that night.
</P>
<P>
   One, don't leave your fate in the judges' hands even when you're
deemed the house fighter. And, two, do everything in your power to
be in prime condition come fight time.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya has said repeatedly that he plans to fight four times
and score four knockouts this year. In part, that decision was made
to stir interest and re-establish him as a force inside the ring.
It also is the result of the judges' scoring, which they and many
others believe was misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to give you nothing,'' Alcazar said. ``He's
going to go into the ring and win by knockout from now on. He's not
interested in decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya claims he has a new outlook on training after the
Trinidad fight.
</P>
<P>
   He says he goes to bed earlier than ever - no later than 9:30 -
and gets up early to run. He and Alcazar say he's stepped up his
mileage and speed and his legs feel stronger than ever as a result.
He also is sparring more than usual.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the first time in a long time, he says he's 100 percent
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father has always said that if I'm in great shape, no one
can beat me,'' De La Hoya said. ``Now, finally, I'm a believer in
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``... The loss made me realize I'm not unstoppable, I'm human.
If I'm not in shape, somebody is going to beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   All fighters say in one way or another that they're in the best
shape of their lives before big fights.
</P>
<P>
   We'll know whether De La Hoya really has adjusted his regimen
only if the fight with Mosley goes into the late rounds.
</P>
<P>
   No problem: Mosley, although a year older than De La Hoya at 28,
has never had to deal with the media crush he experienced Wednesday
because he's never been involved in a truly big fight.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of newspaper and television reporters and photographers
descended upon his Big Bear training camp to have a word with him.
</P>
<P>
   How'd he do? Handled it like a champ.
</P>
<P>
   He obliged a seemingly endless line of TV reporters there for
one-on-one interviews and then sat with a group of newspaper
reporters and cheerfully answered questions for more than a half
hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is fun, what I've worked my whole career for,'' he
said. ``I wanted to be in a spot like this, where if I go out and
have an impressive performance and win, I will be considered the
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pressure. This is a dream to be in this spot.''
</P>
<P>
   No one who has spent time with Mosley is surprised by his
demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   The Pomona resident isn't taciturn, but he's low-key and seems
to take things in stride.
</P>
<P>
   He's the type of person who will continue to handle the pressure
of a such an event well.
</P>
<P>
   Money matters: De La Hoya will make a guaranteed $8 million but
could clear $15 million depending on pay-per-view buys for the June
17 bout, promoter Bob Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley's promoter, Cedric Kushner, is being paid $5 million and
Mosley will get a portion of that. They could make as much as $7.5
million if the fight does well, Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson watch: Politicians and women's rights groups should back
off in their efforts to keep Mike Tyson out of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Few are crazy about the guy and no one condones his despicable
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   However, Tyson, scheduled to face Lou Savarese on June 24 in
Glasgow, served his prison term and deserves the right to make a
living.
</P>
<P>
   If he had plans to (begin ital)live(end ital) in Scotland, it
might be a different story. As it is, he'll fight and get out of
town, a town that will benefit financially from the event.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: The Erik Morales-Marco Antonio Barrera rematch -
at 126 pounds - is set for Jan. 20 at Staples Center, Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said he would like the winner to face WBO featherweight
champ Naseem Hamed. ...
</P>
<P>
   WBA bantamweight champ Paulie Ayala, who reportedly is near a
deal to face Hamed, has the boxing skills to give the obnoxious
Briton trouble.
</P>
<P>
   However, he probably doesn't have the power to beat him. Ayala
can't punch in his own weight class and will have less power at
featherweight. ...
</P>
<P>
   The sanctioning of a scheduled bout between Kostya Tszyu and
Julio Cesar Chavez is being challenged by the Nevada State Athletic
Commission and National Association of Boxing Commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Some authorities fear for the safety of Chavez, who will be 38
on July 12. ...
</P>
<P>
   Arum said rival promoter Don King is doing all he can to
convince Felix Trinidad to fight De La Hoya at 147 pounds in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it. Trinidad is no longer comfortable at 147 and
De La Hoya won't move up in weight. ...
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya is expected to fight in Japan in February, Arum said.
...
</P>
<P>
   Eric ``Butterbean'' Esch, the 350-pound former Toughman fighter
who hasn't gone beyond four rounds in his pro career, reiterated
this weekend that he wants to fight Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   And he thinks he would win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the Tyson people remember, the Tyson who moves and
punches,'' Bean said. ``He just stands there now like a punching
bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too small to stand and bang with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Is a Tyson-Bean fight realistic?
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you pay to see it? That's how realistic it is,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He has a point. Tyson-Bean probably would draw twice the number
of viewers as the Lennox Lewis-Michael Grant fight, which had about
325,000 pay-per-view buys. ...
</P>
<P>
   Tony Ayala Jr. beat Gerald Coleman on Friday to run his
post-prison record to 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's time for him to face a legitimate opponent. Could it
be Fernando Vargas?

BARBARA CARTLAND, 98, WROTE MORE THAN 700 ROMANCE NOVELS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barbara Cartland, whose outpouring of more than 700 romance
novels during seven decades made her the undisputed queen of a
genre for hundreds of millions of readers the world over, died
Sunday at her home near Hatfield in Hertfordshire, England. She was
98.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her professional life, Cartland possessed a most
uncommon ability: She was able to turn out 50,000-word novels at
the rate of two a month. During the 1980s, when she was hardly
young, she routinely produced 23 titles a year. With all of it she
still managed to live the good life in Camfield Place, her gracious
400-acre estate in Hertfordshire, with Twi-Twi, her Pekingese, and
with her white Rolls-Royce ever at the ready, a pink mohair rug
neatly folded in the back seat, there to keep guests comfortable
when they were driven to her home from the station.
</P>
<P>
   And although her name may not have been taken seriously by the
more serious students of comparative literature or by the
subscribers to literary supplements, about 1 billion copies of her
723 books were printed and sold in 36 languages. Bantam and Jove
Publications were among her several American publishers.
</P>
<P>
   She has appeared in The Guinness Book of Records as the world's
best-selling author, breaking records for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   In a century in which so many writers struggled against
censorship laws for the right to describe a variety of sexual
activities in explicit terms, Cartland's prose remained dedicated
to an unlikely celebration of the adventures of passionate virgins.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't roll around naked in my books,'' Cartland said in
an interview in 1987. ``I do allow them to go to bed if they're
married, but it's all very wonderful and the moonbeams.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the way to sustain an approach to fiction writing that
remained essentially unchanged from the early 1920s to the end of
her days. She was totally convinced of its appropriateness. When it
was suggested that she could be a tad more risque, she replied,
``You can't get more naked than naked, can you, and then where do
you go from there?''
</P>
<P>
   Her virgin heroines were typically fresh as April's peach
blossoms. They were always wide-eyed, idealistic and impecunious,
as demure as they were determined to struggle against all manner of
vicissitudes in their quest to find Mr. Right.
</P>
<P>
   He, in turn, was invariably a dark, square-jawed chap, perhaps
with bulging biceps, incessantly given to splendid thoughts despite
his worldliness. He was furthermore possessed of that indefinable
magnetism that seems to surround men who have an enormous bankroll,
a title and all the connections needed to keep good women out of
harm's way forever.
</P>
<P>
   Cartland never asked anything of her heroines that she didn't
ask of herself. Although twice married and the mother of three, she
did not really like being kissed or touched, wrote a biographer
with whom she cooperated, Gwen Robyns.
</P>
<P>
   The process by which a man and a woman found each other usually
occurred in Regency, Victorian or Georgian times, and before they
got to live happily ever after, her characters said things like,
``Oh, Miss, there is evil in this house,'' or, ``My son will never
marry; I am his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Her narrative style provided ample cement for such dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``All she knew was that she was close against him, and he was
kissing her wildly, passionately, demandingly and the world stood
still,'' she wrote in ``Fire in the Blood,'' published in 1983.
``He kissed her until he carried her as he had before up the peak
of Olympus, and they were no longer human but one with the gods.''
Even with stuff as racy as this, readers came away thinking that
her heroines remained as untouched as they had been in Chapter 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heroines are always virgins,'' the writer said in 1973.
``They never go to bed without a ring on their fingers; not until
page 118 at least.'' She also asserted that her notion of a truly
sexy man was one who was ``fully clothed and preferably in
uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   People who watched Cartland in action were not sure how she
produced so much work. She wrote so quickly that even her fans were
not always in agreement as to how many titles she had produced at
any given time. Since mere typewriters could never keep up with
her, she neatly avoided them and dictated her fiction to awestruck
assistants who wrote furiously, backed up by tape recorders.
</P>
<P>
   She was frequently able to dictate 7,000 words in an afternoon
session, which usually lasted a few hours. She held forth from a
sofa, a hot water bottle at her feet, her dog cuddled next to her.
Her secretaries were not permitted to sneeze or cough while she
dictated.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in part because of her approach to dictating, her prose
offers a prodigious number of one-sentence paragraphs, closer in
its look to wire-service journalism than to the pages of Faulkner
or Fitzgerald. In addition to her books she wrote some 30 plays.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she wrote so much, she replied, ``I wanted the
money.'' On other occasions, however, she denounced society's
materialism, if not her own.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Hamilton Cartland was born in Warwickshire County,
England, on July 9, 1901, the daughter of Bertram Cartland and
Nancy H. Scobell Cartland, who was better known as Polly. Bertram
Cartland was handsome and charming and came from a prominent
family. But he could never have been the prototype for the novels
his daughter would write. He was not a very good provider, and when
his father's fortune was lost, forcing the family members to sell
their house, it was Polly Cartland who led them into a home far
less commodious than the one they had lost. The new one she rented
offered only six bedrooms, a tennis court, stables and a garden
that nobody had tended lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor I may be, but common I am not,'' Polly said, sounding not
unlike the heroines her daughter would later create.
</P>
<P>
   The Cartlands made do, and young Barbara and her two brothers
spent their formative years this way, learning to play tiddlywinks
and other games. By the time she was 19, Cartland said, she had
rejected four proposals of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   After she completed finishing school, she turned to writing and
produced her first novel, ``Jigsaw,'' in 1922 when she was 21. It
did not get good reviews _ one critic called it a ``modern feverish
novel of the amateur'' _ but it went into six editions and was
translated into five languages.
</P>
<P>
   She married Alexander McCorquodale in 1927. He was a rich
Scotsman widely known as an accomplished salmon fisherman. They
were divorced five years later, and although she said she did not
like the McCorquodale family much, she married Hugh McCorquodale,
Alexander's cousin, in 1936. This marriage lasted until Hugh's
death in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her writing, Cartland found time to support many
charities, promote aviation and work to improve the plight of
pensioners and the acceptance of Gypsies in England. She was also
credited with popularizing a swimming pool on the roof of the Hotel
Piccadilly in London. She tried her hand at designing wallpaper and
lent her name to a perfume. The perfume venture was unsuccessful,
she said, because the perfume was not expensive enough.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950 she moved into Camfield Place, a palace built in 1867,
in which Beatrix Potter wrote ``The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' at the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 she was made a dame of the British Empire. She said she
was sure the honor was not for her contributions to literature but
for her efforts of behalf of charities and the Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Cartland is survived by a daughter, Raine, Countess Spencer, who
was the stepmother of Diana, Princess of Wales; and two sons, Ian
and Hugh McCorquodale.
</P>
<P>
   Cartland was steadfast in her belief in vitamins _ at one point
she took 78 a day _ and in yoga, clairvoyance, fruit sugar,
ginseng, garlic and honey. She wrote so convincingly that honey was
an aphrodisiac in ``The Magic of Honey,'' published in 1970, that a
temporary shortage was created in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   She had no use for smoking, white bread, white sugar and most
forms of alcohol, but she drank brandy when she visited New York in
1981 because, she said, she could taste chlorine in the water.

BEIJING AND TAIWAN'S NEW LEADER TESTING EACH OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Corrects Monday to Sunday throughout.) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ A day after Beijing hinted at new flexibility
in dealing with Taiwan and its new president, it hastened to
restate that its ``one China'' principle was an absolute
precondition of strengthening ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acceptance or rejection of the one-China principle is the
touchstone to test whether one sincerely wants to improve
cross-straits relations,'' said a commentary by the official New
China News Agency, issued in response to the inaugural speech on
Saturday by President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who dares insist on splitting Taiwan from China,'' the
press agency said, ``must bear responsibility for all the serious
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech on Saturday, Chen tried to reassure Beijing that
he wanted reconciliation, but he did not satisfy the Chinese
leaders' demand that he unequivocally call Taiwan a part of China.
</P>
<P>
   In an official response on Saturday that was largely repeated in
Sunday's article, Beijing accused Chen of insincerity and
evasiveness. But the statement also emphasized China's desire to
seek closer economic ties across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the first time since Chen's election in March, Beijing
said negotiations could start under two conditions: if both sides
``express in their own way orally'' that they adhere to the
one-China principle, as China says both did in 1992, and if Taiwan
does not call itself an equal state.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, in his second day as president, Chen offered a potential
plum if the two sides can start talking. He said he hoped to
negotiate an end to what he called Taiwan's outdated ban on direct
trade, shipping and postal links.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has long sought such direct ties, known as the ``three
links,'' not just to save the cost of sending goods and flights via
Hong Kong but as a way to draw Taiwan to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan, professing security concerns, has kept the ban as a
bargaining chip, but its own business leaders, who have invested
billions in China and send it a huge amount of exports, are
increasingly chafing at the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts in China and Taiwan said the varying
statements during the last two days were predictable as the sides
continued to test each other as Chen assumed power. In particular,
Beijing is probing to see how far Chen has moved from his longtime
advocacy of formal independence for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Chen Shui-bian's speech offered something positive,
and we should catch the opportunity,'' said a Chinese specialist in
foreign policy, Shen Dingli of Fudan University in Shanghai. ``But
Beijing will continue to put pressure on him over `one China' to
keep him moving in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was preparing to run for president, Chen stopped calling
for formal independence, though he emphasized that Taiwan was
already sovereign in practice and intended to stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   China's statement Sunday, compared with Saturday's, included
more emphatic reminders that the one-China principle was a
non-negotiable precondition for talks.
</P>
<P>
   Chen described his goal of relaxing commercial restrictions
today as he visited the outlying Taiwan-controlled island of
Kinmen, or Quemoy, which is near the mainland and would greatly
benefit from direct commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the precondition that national security can be
assured,'' Chen said, ``we are willing to review the outdated,
rigid and inflexible three-links policy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the admission of China and Taiwan to the World Trade
Organization, which could happen as early as September, would
provide a natural forum for discussing such impediments to direct
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Kuo, a political scientist at Soochow University in
Taipei and an adviser to Taiwan's Foreign Ministry, said it was ``a
good sign'' that Beijing had mentioned reviving the 1992 political
formula and its desire to strengthen economic ties.
</P>
<P>
   Kuo warned that rapid progress was unlikely, especially before
China's leaders make crucial decisions about Taiwan at their annual
seaside retreat in August.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that membership of China and Taiwan in the
trade organization could provide an opportunity to ``sort out
economic issues'' and end the ban on direct commerce. China and
other countries have agreed in principle that Taiwan can join the
trade group on a special, non-state basis.

SWISS VOTE FOR CLOSER LINKS TO THEIR NEIGHBORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Swiss voters broke with their tradition of isolationism
Sunday, and approved, by a two-thirds majority, a set of agreements
with the European Union that will link their nation more closely
with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The government hopes that the accords are a first step toward
joining the 15-country union. But the seven-part package, which
removes barriers to trade and commerce, bolsters the Swiss economy
without binding it any closer politically, for now, to the rest of
Europe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The package won particularly strong support in areas close to
the borders with France and Germany. Only the Italian-speaking
southern canton of Ticino, and one other of the country's 26
cantons, voted against the agreements. The vote in Ticino, which
abuts Italy, was driven by fears that provisions allowing freer
movement of people would attract cheap labor from northern Italian
areas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Foes of closer ties with Europe argued that the accords would
jeopardize Switzerland's historic independence and neutrality, and
lead inevitably to full membership in the European Union _ a step
strongly opposed by a substantial segment. Nationalists and
anti-immigration forces, who criticized the union's treatment of
Austria after Joerg Haider's party entered the national government,
joined to force a nationwide popular vote on the accords. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Swiss government, business and trade unions lobbied for the
accords on the ground that they are vital to Switzerland's economic
future, which is built on trade because the landlocked country has
few raw materials. Its biggest trading partner is the European
Union _ with two-thirds of what the country exports going to the
bloc, and 80 percent of imports coming from those 15 countries. The
package increases Swiss access to European markets and opens up the
country's markets in areas like agriculture, aviation, research and
transport. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest winner is likely to be the national carrier,
Swissair, which now has a green light to expand in the union's 15
countries.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The government had taken steps to defuse a major voter fear _
that foreigners would take Swiss jobs and drain generous social
benefits by creating new mininum wage floors to protect workers.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The accords were worked out in protracted negotiations after
1992, when the country unexpectedly rejected, by a narrow margin, a
plan to join the European Economic Area, which would have tied it
closer to the union than the accords approved Sunday. To overcome
that defeat, the government engaged in years of complicated
negotiations to come up with the package approved Sunday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The head of the ultra-nationalist Swiss People's Party, Ueli
Maurer, said: ``The subject of joining the EU is finally off the
table. EU membership is not an issue at least for the foreseeable
future.'' But spokesmen for other Swiss political parties hailed
the vote as a signal for the government to reignite its campaign to
join the union. National sentiment, though, is so uncertain that
government ministers said they would not apply for membership
before 2004, and that Swiss entry was unlikely before the end of
the decade, if then.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The treaty package has been ratified by the Swiss and European
parliaments, and faces clearance in the parliaments of the union's
15 member states before it can take effect in January 2001, as
planned.

JEAN PIERRE RAMPAL, 78, VIRTUOSO FLUTIST 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jean-Pierre Rampal, the French-born flutist who was the first
virtuoso on his instrument to enjoy enormous success and celebrity
as a touring soloist and who almost single-handedly took the flute
to new levels of popularity in the decades after World War II, died
Saturday at his home in Paris. He was 78 and had been ill with a
heart condition for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Other important flutists had managed to lift themselves from the
ranks of orchestral and chamber players and achieve success as
soloists, starting with the flutist and composer Johann Joachim
Quantz in the 18th century. Two master French flutists earlier in
the 20th century, Georges Barrere and Marcel Moyse, were also known
for solo work, especially Moyse, who ``opened the door for us,''
Rampal used to say.
</P>
<P>
   But Rampal was the first flutist to attain the kind of
visibility and presence that previously had gone only to virtuoso
pianists and violinists. Rampal regularly filled the world's
largest concert halls, even at times the Hollywood Bowl, for his
recitals and chamber music performances, and in his prime he gave
more than 100 concerts a year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most-recorded and best-selling classical
instrumentalists in history, he was a proud trailblazer in the
crossover genre. His CBS Masterworks recording of Claude Bolling's
Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano, released in 1975, made the
Billboard chart of top-selling albums for 10 consecutive years,
only the second time the 10-year milestone had been reached, the
first being Pink Floyd's ``Dark Side of the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Rampal's popularity was grounded in qualities that won him
consistent praise from critics and musicians in the first decades
of his career: solid musicianship, technical command, uncanny
breath control, and a distinctive tone that eschewed Romantic
richness and warm vibrato in favor of clarity, radiance, focus and
a wide palette of colorings. Younger flutists assiduously studied
and tried to copy his approaches to tonguing, fingering, embouchure
(the position of the lips on the mouthpiece) and breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing Rampal's performance in Mozart's Concerto for Flute
and Harp with the New York Philharmonic in 1976, the New York Times
critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote: ``Mr. Rampal, with his effortless
long line, his sweet and pure tone and his sensitive musicianship,
is of course one of the great flutists in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in his career, Rampal was often faulted by critics for
resting on his laurels and cutting musical corners, giving
performances that sometimes seemed listless, uninvolved and sloppy.
But when he emerged in the late 1940s and for years thereafter he
was an indisputably major artist.
</P>
<P>
   His entrance into concert life coincided with a revival of
interest in Baroque music, which Rampal championed. Still, much of
his popularity came from his presence and energy as a performer. At
6 feet 1 inch, with a bearlike build and erect stance, he looked
imposing when he walked on stage. But once he started to play, he
seemed the essence of French elegance, taste and poise.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1998, at a concert in Boston's Symphony Hall,
though Rampal was recuperating from knee surgery, fighting a cold
and clearly uncomfortable, his performance moved the Boston Globe
critic Richard Dyer to note that ``the level of Rampal's skill and
the charm of his personality'' had not changed.
</P>
<P>
   Though his background would seem to have preordained him for a
musical career, Rampal was late in his commitment to it. He was
born on Jan. 7, 1922, in Marseilles, France, where his father,
Joseph, was a professor of flute at the music conservatory and his
mother, Andree, badly wanted her son to become a doctor. He began
flute lessons with his father at 12, entering the conservatory but
taking a full course in letters and philosophy at the Lycee Thiers.
In 1937 the conservatory awarded him first prize in a flute
competition. Still, he enrolled at the state college in Marseilles
to study medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, in his third year of medical training, he was called up
for military service by the occupying German forces. But he evaded
the Germans by going to Paris, where he hid out and frequently
changed residencies while studying at the conservatory. Within five
months, he won first prize in a competition there and gave his
first formal performance with an orchestra, playing the Ibert Flute
Concerto with the Orchestre National de France.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1945, with the Germans out of Paris, I was getting happier
every minute,'' he later recalled in his 1989 autobiography,
``Music, My Love,'' which has been translated into four languages.
Accounting for the French penchant for early music at the time, he
further wrote: ``The beat to which the city marched was one dear to
my heart. Baroque music was the sentiment of the day. Bach, Haydn,
Handel, Vivaldi &AMP; Co., with their precise, measured music, gave the
public the security and sense of order that the war had taken away.
You knew where this music was going and what it would do.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, he was invited to join the orchestra of the Paris
Opera. He became its principal flutist in 1958 and held the
position for six years. But he simultaneously pursued his solo
career, starting in 1946 when he began a long association with the
pianist and harpsichordist Robert Veyron-Lacroix. That year he also
made his first formal recording (Mozart's Quartet in D for Flute
and Strings). In 1947, he married Francoise Bacqueyrisse, a
harpist. The security he gained from his marriage, which produced
two children, emboldened him to undertake concert tours as a solo
flutist, at the time an untried idea.
</P>
<P>
   The risk paid off. In 1948, he formed the Ensemble Baroque de
Paris, which enjoyed considerable success. By the 1950s he was
touring Europe as a recitalist. In 1958, he and Veyron-Lacroix made
their first ambitious concert tour of the United States and Canada,
the highlight of which was a performance at Carnegie Hall of works
by Handel, Bach, Beethoven and Prokofiev, as well as a Poulenc
sonata written for him.
</P>
<P>
   Rampal played a large number of contemporary works, including
premieres by Bernstein, Copland, Ezra Laderman, David Diamond and
Krzysztof Penderecki. Though he performed some boldly contemporary
works, including a sonata by Pierre Boulez that was dedicated to
him, Rampal's taste in new music tended toward the conservative.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, he made his conducting debut with the Mostly Mozart
Orchestra at Lincoln Center, and received mixed reviews. Conducting
would never be a notable component of his career.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He was always best known for his performances of Baroque and
Classical works. Yet as the early-music movement grew and the
understanding of historical performance practices increased,
Rampal's work in Baroque began to seem sadly anachronistic. He
unabashedly played Baroque trio sonatas, intended for intimate
settings, in cavernous concert halls. ``It's nice to have a
crowd,'' he explained in a 1992 interview. ``We are all a little
ham, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   In later years many critics found him at times to be more than a
little ``ham.'' Reviewing a 1990 recital at Avery Fisher Hall, the
Times critic James R. Oestreich chided Rampal and the
harpsichordist John Steele Ritter, Rampal's partner since 1982, for
performing Bach's complete flute sonatas without including a
continuo instrument (typically a cello, viola da gamba or bassoon)
to support the bass line of the harpsichord part, which was
standard practice in Bach's day. Rampal showed ``a kind of hubris
seemingly intrinsic in today's superstar events,'' Oestreich wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Rampal's legacy is assured. Audiences will long remember the
gleam and the disarming sound of the 14-karat gold flutes that
Rampal always favored.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Rampal is survived by a daughter,
Isabelle; a son, Jean-Jacques; five grandchildren; and six
great-grandchildren. In a sense, he is also survived by flutists
like James Galway, Carol Wincenc and other virtuosos who have
thriving solo careers in part because Rampal paved the way.

STUDENT MOVEMENT EMERGES AS POPULAR FOE OF MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A student movement demanding sweeping
political change is surging in popularity and is now a significant
target for attack by the government of the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The movement, called Otpor, or Resistance, has given fresh
energy and an arrogant innocence to Milosevic's political
opposition. Otpor has not been shy about criticizing opposition
leaders for their lack of unity and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely organized and without a clear leadership structure that
could be subject to arrest, Otpor is intended to be difficult to
repress. But it shows few signs of becoming a serious revolutionary
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Still, government officials are attacking the group as ``fascist
hooligans'' and ``terrorists.'' The officials are giving strong
signals that Otpor will be a prime target of _ or at least the
pretext for _ a sweeping new law on terrorism that could be
introduced as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The law, said to be largely based on the emergency measures in
force here during NATO's bombing war last year, could provide for
detention without charges or limitations, restricting the rights of
the accused.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, people can be detained for questioning for 72
hours without being charged, a measure the police have been using
liberally against young Otpor activists all over Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, the police could detain people on national
security grounds for up to 60 days without trial, and the police
were given the right to search people or property without warrants.
The law under consideration would also authorize the police to
confiscate all firearms, registered or not.
</P>
<P>
   If passed in such a form, the law would create an informal state
of emergency. It could be used against opposition politicians and
also against independent journalists, whom the government accuses
of working for NATO and the ``enemies of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Otpor spokesmen say more than 200 of their members have been
detained in the last week throughout Serbia. They are often
arrested at home in the early hours, questioned by the police for
up to a day or more, threatened and sometimes beaten.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday another 34 Otpor members and eight opposition
politicians were detained, questioned and later released.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regime senses the danger, that we don't care a lot about
anything else other than taking them down,'' said Milan Samardzic,
23, a law student with Otpor. ``We're not in it for power or money,
unlike many of the opposition politicians. We just want change. The
idea of resistance itself is very powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Vukasin Petrovic, 23, a political science student and one of
Otpor's steadily changing spokesmen, says that about 25,000 people
have signed papers of various kinds to become members, even though
there is no single membership form, and that the organization may
be able to call on as many as 50,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   More ask to join every day, Petrovic says, ``and we're getting a
little overwhelmed. Things are moving at a very quick pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Otpor started as a student response to a restrictive law on
universities in October 1998. While many regard it as a movement of
arrogant rich youths from nice families, its surge in popularity is
a direct result of disappointment with this generation of political
leaders, who have failed during the last decade to bring down
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Otpor activists say they want to inspire the population and
``guide'' the political opposition, as a kind of monitor, to keep
them unified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition leaders have shown that they are very vain, and
that their petty interests are more important to them than our
larger interests as a country,'' Samardzic said. ``We say we've
seen through the regime and we're disappointed in the opposition.
The opposition leaders don't seem to have a solution, and people
don't trust them. But we do deserve the people's trust, at least so
far.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   During the last large opposition rally in Belgrade, on April 14,
an Otpor member was on stage with leaders of political parties and
said, ``Our task is to secure your victory.'' He then warned them
in vulgar terms: ``Gentlemen, this time there will be no betrayal,
because whoever betrays now is scum.''
</P>
<P>
   At a later rally, on May 15, many leaders including the
Democratic Party head, Zoran Djindjic, wore Otpor T-shirts, bearing
a fist, though in Djindjic's case he wore a stylish black sport
jacket over it. It was also a gesture of solidarity with two young
Otpor activists and a lawyer who had been beaten badly in
Milosevic's hometown, Pozarevac, by bodyguards working for his son,
Marko.
</P>
<P>
   The case was important because two local judges and a prosecutor
resigned, apparently over pressure from the government to charge
the young men, who asserted that they had not begun the fight, with
attempted murder. One judge who released them quit after they were
rearrested.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The government has tried its best to impugn the organization.
When Bosko Perosevic, a senior official of Milosevic's party, was
slain in Novi Sad on May 13, the government announced that the
50-year-old killer was an Otpor activist and a supporter of Vuk
Draskovic's Serbian Renewal Movement, suggesting that both groups
were in the pay of Western intelligence agencies. Both charges were
denied, but the police said they had found Otpor leaflets in the
killer's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of like a marketing agency,'' Petrovic said,
``promoting one idea, the idea of resistance as a habit of mind, a
way of standing up in dignity. To me, dignity is very similar to
resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Otpor tries to provoke and mock the authorities with sometimes
daily happenings and with slogans like ``Bite the system.'' In the
last three months, Samardzic said, Otpor has put up 400,000 posters
and handed out two million leaflets and badges throughout Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Otpor insists that this is paid for solely with donated
materials, labor and money from Serbs abroad. But the organization
is also getting money and advice from the West through programs to
``promote democratization'' in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   After the seizure of the main opposition television station,
Studio B last week, Samardzic said he was appalled by the confused
reactions of the opposition, especially Draskovic, who remained in
Serbia's sister republic, Montenegro, for two days before returning
to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The silence of the opposition has not just been strange, it's
been a disaster,'' Samardzic said. ``People assume Vuk is afraid.
Well, so are we all. But he's not selling popcorn'' _ he is a
political leader.
</P>
<P>
   Otpor is proposing a program of civil disobedience, of the kind
Gandhi used against the British in India. When he is reminded that
the Serbian authorities are not British and behave by different
rules, Samardzic only shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   One opposition leader, Zarko Korac, a psychologist and
university professor who heads the Social Democratic Union, says
teachers are accustomed to being criticized by students.
</P>
<P>
   Otpor matters, he says. ``They have the energy and the innocence
of youth, and they are uncompromising and unyielding,'' he said,
noting that the Suharto government in Indonesia had been toppled by
student demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These students feel they have no future, no employment,''
Korac said. ``They can't travel and work. So they are fighting for
their own future, which is also the future of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Otpor's symbol, the fist, ``is a clear, clean message,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So clean that one of Serbia's most influential writers and
briefly Yugoslavia's president, Dobrica Cosic, walked into an Otpor
office this month and filled out a membership form. Cosic, a
nationalist picked by Milosevic and then discarded by him, is
blamed by some for helping to create the myth of Serbian sacrifices
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A drawing by a noted cartoonist, Corax, showed Cosic scrubbing
himself clean in a bathtub using the skeletal fist of Otpor.
</P>
<P>
   With signs pointing toward an attempted crackdown and even a ban
on Otpor, the organization will need whatever it has.
</P>
<P>
   Korac says such a crackdown on Serbia's children, like the
seizure of Studio B, has cumulative consequences with the public.
``It's like insults in a marriage,'' he said. ``It adds up. It may
not show right away on the streets, but it's building. People are
very angry.''

CLINTON SEES SUCCESS OF CHINA TRADE BILL AS LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For seven years very little has gone as planned in
Bill Clinton's effort to shape a new relationship with China. Now,
amid increasing confidence among White House officials this past
weekend that they will prevail in one of the most crucial
congressional votes in a decade, the president who came to office
knowing little about China may leave claiming he fundamentally
altered Washington's relations with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In public his aides say the vote is still too close to call.
``We don't have the 218 to pass it, and the opposition do not have
218 at this point, in my opinion, to stop it,'' Commerce Secretary
William Daley, who is leading the administration's lobbying drive,
said Sunday on CBS's ``Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In private, however, many of Clinton's advisers suspect that the
bill to give China permanent trade status _ thus ending an annual
congressional review _ will pass by a margin of 10 votes or more,
chiefly because of the support of Republicans. The Republican whip
in the House, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, said Sunday, ``We're moving
toward that magic number of 218,'' giving much of the credit to
lobbying by the president.
</P>
<P>
   With the coalition in Congress still fragile, Clinton's staff
has carefully shielded him from much public engagement about the
deal. They canceled a television address to the nation Sunday
evening, for fear that it would anger undecided Democrats. After
lengthy discussions, they declined to make him available for an
interview, again out of concern that he might say something that
would cost a few needed votes.
</P>
<P>
   Their caution points to the importance of the vote for Clinton,
who aides say has come to see it as possibly his last hope of
leaving a deep imprint on foreign affairs in his second term. With
time running out for a Mideast peace accord or a new arms deal with
Russia, the outcome of the vote has taken on huge importance in the
president's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hates the word, but it's the legacy thing, in a big way,''
said one Cabinet member.
</P>
<P>
   For the president, the problem with China policy has not
necessarily been lack of vision. Once in office, he quickly cast
away his campaign attacks on President Bush for ``coddling
dictators'' in Beijing. And since 1994 he has steadily built on his
theme that the Internet and China's growing economic ties to the
West will ultimately create pressures for political openness that
Beijing will not be able to control.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been more one of execution. The Chinese have
hardly cooperated, imprisoning more dissidents even as Clinton
argued that economic freedom would eventually produce political
freedom. Nor has there been much help from the president's fellow
Democrats, most of whom have fought his trade and China policies at
every turn.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks Clinton has sworn to close friends and
colleagues that he will not let himself repeat the mistake he now
blames himself for making at least twice before _ letting politics
keep him from taking a step that he is convinced is the best hope
for keeping China from becoming an adversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he blew it in 1995 and again last year,'' said one of
Clinton's foreign policy advisers, referring to Clinton's decision
to grant a visa to Taiwan's president in 1995 to visit the United
States, and then to walk away last year from a sweeping trade deal
with China's reform-minded prime minister, Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   So with the passion of a convert, Clinton is spending hours each
day arguing the merits of a strategic vision that he took years to
adopt. In small coffees in the Yellow Oval Room of the White House
residence and even aboard Air Force One as he took New York
Democrats to his wife's formal nomination for the Senate race, he
offers lectures about competing scenarios of what the United
States' dealings with China may look like in 2025.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Clinton wins, the victory may feel incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledges that for all his talk about the benefits
for the United States of economic globalization _ the opening of
new markets for American exports and innovation _ fewer Democrats
are with him on this than on the passage of the North American Free
Trade Agreement. He told a colleague not long ago, ``I'm doing this
despite my party, not with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even allies say that this is because his commitment to
rebuilding the China relationship and pursuing a trade policy for a
new era of globalized commerce has waxed and waned.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in so many things,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a
leading advocate of the trade bill, ``he too often let the politics
of last month or next month affect decisions toward China that go
to half-century strategic issues.'' Only in recent times, Moynihan
added, ``has the president begun to see this in historic terms.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the White House strategy has been fairly
straightforward. Clinton is largely letting others argue the
economic benefits, and avoiding direct engagement with the labor
unions, which fear that any benefit from an increase in exports to
China would be outweighed by the movement of American jobs there.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the president focuses his arguments on national
security, saying that the real point of letting China into the
World Trade Organization is to further economic engagement so the
two nations do not drift into adversarial roles.
</P>
<P>
   To the enormous frustration of the White House, the Chinese are
hardly aiding Clinton's cause. In past years, when Congress was
gearing up for a vote on the annual renewal of trading status,
Beijing usually released a few long-imprisoned dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, as Daley said recently, ``the Chinese certainly
aren't making it any easier.'' While they moderated their reaction
to the inauguration this weekend of a new Taiwanese president,
Chinese authorities have been arresting members of the Falun Gong
religious group, and recently sentenced a leader of the fledgling
Democracy Party to a long stint in prison. Clinton, curiously, has
made no recent public comments about those arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his team have tried to turn China's continued
crackdowns to their advantage, arguing that the trade deal, by
ushering in Western technology, legal systems and ideas, will
ultimately undercut the ability of the Chinese government to
repress dissent.
</P>
<P>
   At the Coast Guard Academy on Wednesday, the president took this
argument farther than he ever had before, making the case that
``when over 100 million people in China can get on the Net, it will
be impossible to maintain a closed political and economic
society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's right, but it will take a generation,'' said Sandra
Kristoff, who headed the Asian operations of the National Security
Council in Clinton's first term. President Jiang Zemin of China is
taking the other side of that bet, hoping that _ as happened in
Singapore _ he can reap the benefits of an open economic system
while suppressing, or at least managing, real political opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will likely be deep into retirement before historians
can assess whether he or Jiang has guessed right. But it is already
clear that Clinton's journey to his strategic vision of dealing
with China was a long road with many unintended detours.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He spent his first 18 months in office digging his way out of
his own campaign rhetoric. His comments had inflamed the Chinese,
and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said, ``I remember telling him one
day that the first step was that he had to treat China with
respect.'' Clinton, he said, ``seemed surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1993, and a disastrous trip to China by Secretary
of State Warren Christopher, it was clear that the president's
effort to condition China's trading rights to its performance on
human rights and arms proliferation was collapsing. It was a short
intellectual leap to granting permanent trade status.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no evidence that we ever gained any leverage over
the Chinese with annual renewal,'' said Charlene Barshefsky,
Clinton's trade representative. ``It was an empty threat. We knew
it, and the Chinese knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reversed course, saying he could make more progress with
China through engagement than by threats _ the conclusion his
predecessors had reached.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1995, with his re-election looming, Clinton allowed Lee
Tung-hui, Taiwan's president, to make a private visit to Cornell
University for a college reunion, over the objections of many
advisers. Clinton feared that denying the visa would prompt
Congress to rewrite the Taiwan Security Act, worsening relations
with Beijing. But he underestimated the outrage in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton now views that as a mistake. ``There were two stages to
his learning about China,'' said one former adviser, who dealt with
China policy daily. ``After the campaign, he learned that China was
a lot more complex than he believed. And now he's learned the
second part _ that dealing with China means putting the security
interests first, and not letting politics get in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   If that was the lesson, it was forgotten again in April 1999. By
that time Clinton and Jiang had exchanged visits to China and the
United States, and gotten to the final stages of the 13-year
negotiations for China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
Zhu, the prime minister who has come to personify China's economic
reform movement, arrived in Washington ready to end the wrangling
with an offer of a huge range of openings.
</P>
<P>
   Many advised Clinton to take it; he listened to Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin and Gene Sperling, the head of the National
Economic Council, who feared that if a deal was struck, Congress
was in no mood to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton realized almost immediately that he had made a mistake,
but it was too late. When the United States accidentally bombed the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, during the air war over
Kosovo a few weeks later, talks fell apart. They were not patched
together again until marathon negotiations in November, and then
some of the terms had changed _ for better and for worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The previous deal couldn't have passed,'' Sperling says now,
referring to the details of the pact and to the congressional
climate. ``This one can.''

STUDY FINDS MOST STATES LACK SYSTEM FOR MONITORING ASTHMA 
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the number of asthma cases in the United States rises sharply
and researchers scramble to find the cause, newly released data
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that most
states have no system to track the number of people with asthma or
monitor what happens to them, and only a few states have any recent
reports on the illness in their jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   The data were reported in a study by Health Track, a new public
health group based at Georgetown University in Washington and
financed by the Pew Charitable Trusts. The study, to be made public
Monday, says that 27 states have no asthma monitoring program, 30
states have no up-to-date information on asthma within their
borders, and more than 40 states have no ``ready access'' to
information on how many people get emergency care or whether
patients have access to good treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The recent rise in the number of asthma cases is a mystery. It
appears to be occurring in many spots around the world, and while
the number of cases had been rising slowly over many decades, the
figures have shot up dramatically since about 1980, said Dr. Lynn
Goldman, a pediatrician with the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene
and Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The explosive growth has come recently, and it is very
unusual,'' Goldman said. ``There are not many things in medicine
that rise suddenly like that.'' The increase _ ranging from 75
percent to 160 percent in different age groups, with the biggest
jump among children _ has occurred in less than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma is the most common chronic disease among children, the
most common medical reason for school absence and the most frequent
cause of trips to hospital emergency rooms, according to statistics
from the National Institutes of Health. The last statistic is
important, doctors say, because treating asthma in the emergency
room is an expensive and inefficient approach that health insurers
would like to reduce.
</P>
<P>
   Various studies have shown that certain factors _ including the
presence of cockroaches, higher levels of ozone and diesel
pollution, and increased smoking among young women _ are associated
with asthma, but it is uncertain why. Dust mites, viral infections
and breast-feeding have also been linked to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But in looking for the cause of the epidemic, said James O'Hara,
executive director of Health Track, ``We have blindfolded
ourselves, because most states don't have access to one of the
least expensive and most effective tools for preventing the spread
of the disease: information.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said additional information was essential. ``To prevent
and treat the disease, we have to know where to look and what to
look for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, knowing in what parts of the country and among what
groups the disease is hitting hardest can help public health
officials target prevention and treatment programs. More important
in the long run is the way information on an epidemic can be used
to spot its cause.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have estimated that a national tracking and
monitoring program for asthma would cost about $25 million
annually, O'Hara said. He said the cost of asthma to the national
economy was about $14.5 billion a year and rising.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control began to watch the rise in cases
a few years ago, and in 1998 noted that the increase had reached
epidemic proportions. The agency began to survey states, cities and
territories about their ability to monitor the epidemic, and
finished analyzing the survey results this year.
</P>
<P>
   Health Track, which specializes in environmental issues,
combined the data with reports from the National Institutes of
Health and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists to
produce the current report.

CLIPPERS DON'T MIND NO. 3 PICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite being in cahoots with math, the Clippers'
latest challenge added up to another retreat in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   As the league's ranking rank team, they entered Sunday's NBA
Draft Lottery with the best shot (25 percent) at securing the first
pick for June 28.
</P>
<P>
   The shot was off to the south.
</P>
<P>
   The winning, four-ball combination among the 1,001 in the hopper
was scored by the New Jersey Nets, whose Ping-Pong chops could make
Forrest Gump flinch. The Nets converted the seventh-best odds (four
percent) into the top pick.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers went from first to third.
</P>
<P>
   But there's precedent. Thanks to rotten luck and expansion
guidelines, the NBA's worst team hasn't been rewarded with the No.
1 pick since the Nets prevailed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Bulls slipped from second to fourth and Vancouver
climbed from fourth to second. Orlando's first pick slipped from a
potential No. 3 to the reality of No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not that disappointed,'' said Elgin Baylor, the
Clippers vice president of basketball operations. ``We'll still get
a good player. There isn't anyone available who can turn your
franchise around.''
</P>
<P>
   Right, no owners in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   And no obvious, immediate superstar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like there's a Shaquille O'Neal or Tim Duncan out
there,'' said Jeff Weltman, the Clippers director of player
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   OK, if the truth isn't out there, who is?
</P>
<P>
   Most of the early draft buzz has been generated by Kenyon
Martin, the ferocious and athletic 6-foot-8 power forward from
Cincinnati. Drafting Martin virtually guarantees a more visible
mean streak for the defense of the team drafting him.
</P>
<P>
   It also guarantees a few months of patience.
</P>
<P>
   On March 9, Martin's college career was snuffed when an on-court
collision resulted in a fractured fibula and torn ligaments in his
right leg. He's expected to make a complete recovery, and the
Clippers wouldn't have minded using Martin to replace anticipated
goner Maurice Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   But now they'll compete in a vigorous chess tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, desperate for a coach, a basketball staff and a
center, will take a hard look at 7-0 Texas evacuee Chris Mihm. But
they could select a player whose potential trumps their need
(Martin), although wealthy Keith Van Horn is the incumbent Nets
power forward. Or they could consider their requisite trade
opportunities. Orlando, with three lottery picks and packaging
potential, is said to covet Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver, at No. 2, is beating the drum for a power forward and
would figure to jump all over Martin. That could leave Iowa State's
Marcus Fizer and 6-9 LSU sophomore Stromile Swift, each projected
as a ``four'' man, as candidates to be Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor passed on an opportunity to comment on specific players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've looked at quite a few guys,'' he said, ``but we want a
player we feel can come in and make a contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer, a polished offensive player, may be more prepared for
immediate production. But many personnel hounds believe the
acrobatic Swift has more potential than any player in the draft. He
also would provide a better eventual matchup for the lanky, springy
power forwards currently terrorizing the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Swift, whose posturing over a possible return to college
includes not yet signing with an agent, is planning a private
workout in Louisiana for the eyes of top contenders. If a team
brings him in for a visit and he ultimately decides to abandon the
draft, Swift would be required to reimburse that team to retain his
collegiate eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the Clippers will be seeking sneak previews with
Fizer and Swift, while high school entry Darius Miles a 6-9 small
forward from East. St. Louis, Ill. becomes a candidate for an L.A.
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   But Miles' agent is David Falk, who as Taylor's rep has
developed a contentious relationship with the Clippers and could
play hard to get in for a workout.

HAITI HOLDS A LONG-DELAYED ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GONZALEZ

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Overcoming fears of violence, Haitians
crowded into chaotic polling places Sunday to elect thousands of
legislators and local officials with the hope that their country
would finally escape its political paralysis of the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The vote had been postponed three times since its original
November date because of political fights and logistical setbacks.
Voters initially encountered confusion and long lines Sunday when
they tried to cast ballots. Polls opened late in many places as
officials scrambled to deliver ballots or voter lists. Nonetheless,
there was a widespread expectation that perhaps Haiti had a chance
to have a fully functioning democracy and recover from its
turbulent past and impoverished present.
</P>
<P>
   ``These elections are important because this is the only weapon
the people can use to struggle against all that is bad,'' said
Jean-Claude Augustin, a candidate for mayor in Petionville, a
Port-au-Prince suburb. ``This is our chance to vote for the people
who can do something for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Accomplishing that in a country where decades of dictatorship
under the Duvalier family and a succession of military juntas has
been the norm proved trying Sunday. Postponements and delays,
combined with 15 politically related killings in the past six
weeks, had created a climate of insecurity and fears that voter
turnout would be low.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the streets were calm and bustling with people early
Sunday, and turnout was initially estimated at more than 45 percent
of the four million registered voters. More than 29,000 candidates
were vying for 7,500 posts from senators and deputies to mayors and
local delegates. Final results were not expected until later in the
week. Civic leaders were buoyed by the turnout because the current
political stalemate stemmed from disputes over the validity of the
last legislative elections in 1997, when only 5 percent of the
electorate voted.
</P>
<P>
   Voters said they went to the polls because the country had no
other option if Haiti ever hoped to for the international community
to recognize it as having a legitimate government and finally have
access to $500 million in foreign aid that had gone untouched
because the government was in a political standoff. Since last
January, the country has had no constitutionally appointed prime
minister and no parliament. Its fortunes have steadily worsened
with crumbling roads, insufficient police and increased crime. Drug
trafficking has soared, making Haiti a major transshipment point
for drugs headed to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a change,'' said Venel Esteve, as he waited to vote.
``I want people to have a life where they can put their children in
school and put food on the table.``
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of emerging from the paralysis of recent years
was enough to make some voters willing to confront even the worst
memories of the past. Alexis Metalome waited to cast his vote at
the Argentine Bellegarde National School, a place that had been a
bloody memory since November 1987 when thugs linked to the military
massacred more than 30 people trying to vote in the first
post-Duvalier elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not afraid to vote today,'' said Metalome, who
recalled how he fled the school in 1987 when he saw gunmen jump out
from two cars and start shooting. ``The violent people are now more
afraid than we are. Nothing can stop the vote today.''
</P>
<P>
   But many things delayed it. Voters from the middle class suburb
of Petionville to the teeming slums of Cite Soleil complained that
they arrived at the polls at 6 a.m. only to wait for six hours or
more because electoral officials showed up without ballots or voter
lists. Tempers flared in Cite Soleil when voters could not find
where they were supposed to vote. While there were few reports of
violence, observers said a local electoral official in Cite Soleil
fled when intruders burst into a polling place, grabbed the ballots
and marked them for the candidates of Family Lavalas, the party of
former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's vote was seen as a crucial test for Aristide's power
and popularity in anticipation of his run for the presidency in
November. In the months before the election, roving bands of people
claiming to be Lavalas supporters had violently forced cancellation
of a voter-education campaign. In April, those roving bands of
``chimeres'' burned down one party's headquarters while the police
did nothing to stop them. The violence ebbed in recent weeks but
created a climate of fear that sent some candidates into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers and civic leaders feared that Lavalas wanted
to derail the elections, or at least wear down the opposition's
patience and campaign funds to assure that their candidates would
win. Some people suggested that the multiple delays in scheduling
the vote were part of an attempt to combine the presidential and
legislative elections so that Lavalas candidates could ride to
victory on Aristide's coattails.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing Aristide certainly does not want is to find
himself with a parliament he could not control,'' said a diplomat
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Lavalas officials insisted that they had been ready for
elections all along. Aristide has also said that he wanted to make
sure that calm prevailed during the elections. They accused their
opponents of trying to tear them down because they cannot match
Lavalas' popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the source, the fear as well as the numerous logistical
glitches and delays took their toll on candidates who barely
campaigned after running out of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was there time enough for elections? Yes,'' said one
businessman who was active in a civic coalition that urged
candidates to resume campaigning. ``Was that time used properly?
No.''
</P>
<P>
   Confusion and fatigue were evident among those Haitians who
decided to sit it out altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not have money or a job,'' said Gerard D'Liscard, as he
fixed fishing nets on a rickety pier the day before the election.
``I'm not going. I voted before and nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said they saw the problems leading up to the elections as
the inevitable result of a country that is tottering towards
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All countries pass years and years before establishing a
certain real democracy,'' said Raoul Denis, a businessman. ``It's a
perpetual fight. Even in France, from 1789 to now they have
problems. It's difficult for us. It's nobody's fault. It's
history.''

lists. Tempers flared in Cite Soleil when voters could not find
where they were supposed to vote. While there were few reports of
violence, observers said a local electoral official in Cite Soleil
fled when intruders burst into a polling place, grabbed the ballots
and marked them for the candidates of Family Lavalas, the party of
former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's vote was seen as a crucial test for Aristide's power
and popularity in anticipation of his run for the presidency in
November. In the months before the election, roving bands of people
claiming to be Lavalas supporters had violently forced cancellation
of a voter-education campaign. In April, those roving bands of
``chimeres'' burned down one party's headquarters while the police
did nothing to stop them. The violence ebbed in recent weeks but
created a climate of fear that sent some candidates into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers and civic leaders feared that Lavalas wanted
to derail the elections, or at least wear down the opposition's
patience and campaign funds to assure that their candidates would
win. Some people suggested that the multiple delays in scheduling
the vote were part of an attempt to combine the presidential and
legislative elections so that Lavalas candidates could ride to
victory on Aristide's coattails.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing Aristide certainly does not want is to find
himself with a parliament he could not control,'' said a diplomat
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Lavalas officials insisted that they had been ready for
elections all along. Aristide has also said that he wanted to make
sure that calm prevailed during the elections. They accused their
opponents of trying to tear them down because they cannot match
Lavalas' popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the source, the fear as well as the numerous logistical
glitches and delays took their toll on candidates who barely
campaigned after running out of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was there time enough for elections? Yes,'' said one
businessman who was active in a civic coalition that urged
candidates to resume campaigning. ``Was that time used properly?
No.''
</P>
<P>
   Confusion and fatigue were evident among those Haitians who
decided to sit it out altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not have money or a job,'' said Gerard D'Liscard, as he
fixed fishing nets on a rickety pier the day before the election.
``I'm not going. I voted before and nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said they saw the problems leading up to the elections as
the inevitable result of a country that is tottering towards
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All countries pass years and years before establishing a
certain real democracy,'' said Raoul Denis, a businessman. ``It's a
perpetual fight. Even in France, from 1789 to now they have
problems. It's difficult for us. It's nobody's fault. It's
history.''

NEW ARCHBISHOP HAS AGGRESSIVELY RECRUITED FOR THE PRIESTHOOD

 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Nicholas Pavia, a city councilman and mechanic in Stamford,
Conn., the call to the priesthood was neither an urgent whisper nor
a siren. It was a tugging, always in the background, that stayed
with him as one election followed another. And it was a summons put
off by earthly misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, Pavia met the emissaries of Edward M. Egan, the
bishop of Bridgeport, Conn., soon to become New York's archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt empty, or anything like that,'' said Pavia, a
40-year-old who was ordained Saturday in Bridgeport. ``But I felt I
could be doing something more.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when other dioceses throughout the nation are
struggling through a shortage of priests, Egan has vigorously
recruited men like Pavia for the priesthood, ordaining a higher
proportion of priests than any other diocese in the Northeast. The
bishop's success weighed heavily in his nomination to head the New
York archdiocese, said one church official involved in the highly
secretive process, a sign that the Vatican considers the shortage
one of the most serious problems facing the church.
</P>
<P>
   In his first news conference after he was named
archbishop-designate this month, Egan boasted that his calling card
gave not only his own phone number, but that of his diocese's
recruitment director. The bishop's accomplishment, it seems, lies
in creating the structures that have allowed others to nurture
aspiring priests.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bridgeport's diocese is only one-sixth the size of New
York's, Egan opened a minor seminary soon after arriving there in
1988, modeled on one that Cardinal John O'Connor established in the
Bronx, to embrace men considering the priesthood and to allow them
a year to glimpse the life they would take on.
</P>
<P>
   But the bishop also created a full-time recruitment team, headed
by the Rev. Christopher Walsh, whose stated purpose was to
aggressively recruit candidates for the priesthood. They keep track
of men who express an interest in becoming priests, following those
who enter the seminary the bishop created, St. John Fisher in
Stamford, at every step of their preparation. The diocese also
adapts the seminarians' training to accommodate each candidate's
interests and circumstances, and, like many other dioceses hard
pressed for new priests, it readily accepts older men into the
ranks of seminarians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord is calling, but there's a lot of static out there,''
Walsh said. ``My job is to reduce the static. To create the
environment where the call can be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   While Egan has aggressively courted men for the priesthood, he
has not done so by softening or popularizing the church's stands,
but rather by stressing the orthodox view of the clergy's role. It
remains to be seen how Egan's approach to training men for the
priesthood will influence relations between the church and the New
York archdiocese's 2.4 million Roman Catholics. Nor is it clear
whether he will seek to have a political voice in New York, or how
his decision will play out in the hurly-burly world of local
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the priests Egan has ordained say his emphasis on
restoring the traditions of the church was one of the reasons they
chose to serve in Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said that some of the seminarians seemed nostalgic for a
church steeped in rituals they had imagined, but not known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them are not into getting all excited about guitar
Masses and Masses on the beach,'' Walsh said. ``They're, to be
honest, more attracted to the tradition, to the liturgical
tradition, to some of the devotions of the church, rosaries,
novenas and eucharistic adoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, the generation that's coming up now have been
deprived of that tradition; they're the children of the baby
boomers who discarded much of that,'' Walsh added. ``I don't see it
as an ideological fixation on the past, but as a longing for the
tradition that they've missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the priority he sets on building up the priesthood,
Egan _ officially not New York's archbishop until his installation
on June 19 _ ordained this year's graduates of St. Joseph's
Seminary at St. Patrick's Cathedral Saturday. The priests
prostrated themselves on the cathedral's marble floor as the
congregation prayed over them. Egan closed his hands over theirs
while the men swore lifelong respect and obedience to the
archbishop-designate and his successors.
</P>
<P>
   But there were only five of them. Over the last year, considered
an average one, more than a score of priests have died in the New
York archdiocese. And a declining enrollment of candidates for the
priesthood at St. Joseph's suggests the number of new priests will
slide even further in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not limited to New York. With fewer and fewer
young men choosing a life of celibacy and sacrifice, many priests
across the nation must serve at more than one parish. While the
Roman Catholic population in America has grown 30 percent over the
last 35 years, to 59.2 million from 45.6 million in 1965, the
number of priests has dropped 21 percent, to 46,352 from 58,632.
</P>
<P>
   Dean R. Hoge, a professor at Catholic University and the author
of ``The Future of Catholic Leadership,'' said that a generally
rising standard of living had given young men today more career
options, making the cost of the priesthood's demands _ particularly
celibacy _ seem higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come to a crossroads in Catholic history,'' Hoge said.
``There's not enough candidates. We have a problem producing
high-quality product.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Katarina Schuth, author of the 1999 book ``Seminaries,
Theologates, and the Future of the Church Ministry,'' said strict
traditionalists were having an increasing influence in seminaries,
though they might not represent a greater share of students. Nearly
half of today's seminarians, she found, begin their studies for the
priesthood after a religious conversion. One out of four speak
English as a second language.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In such an atmosphere, even Walsh wonders why Bridgeport is
succeeding where others are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the newer priests or those soon to be ordained chose the
Bridgeport diocese because it was their home. But others selected
Bridgeport from a number they had considered, attracted by Egan's
reputation for orthodoxy and for fostering an esprit de corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the diocese or priests in the diocese are being
hypercritical, or saying Rome is way off base, that doesn't attract
young men,'' Walsh said. ``You aren't going to get young men to
give their lives to an institution if you're criticizing that
institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Bridgeport diocese, like New York's, is home to a
large number of Hispanics, none of the young men graduating from
the seminary this year are Hispanic. ``It's sort of a fluke this
year,'' said Walsh, noting that five of the 30 seminarians
considering the priesthood at St. John Fisher are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who are joining the Bridgeport diocese are Robert
Kinnally, the 39-year-old dean of admissions and financial aid at
Stanford University, who will enter St. John Fisher this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Thomas W. Powers, 35, the priest at St. Theresa's in
Trumbull, Conn., left a promising job at a global consulting firm
to join Egan's diocese.
</P>
<P>
   Powers calls Egan ``an impressive man, the kind of guy you want
to follow,'' and he does so with an absence of reservations that
can be striking in an age of skepticism. ``I trust him,'' Powers
said. ``He's been a spiritual father to me. He inspires me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do God's will by obeying my bishop.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining the diocese not only meant giving up a successful job
but, in a sense, erasing his ego so his sense of God could take
over, Powers said. ``We really must die to ourselves,'' he said.
``He must increase, while I must decrease.''
</P>
<P>
   Powers said he was drawn to Egan's ``orthodoxy'' and
``holiness.'' Staunchly anti-abortion, Powers sometimes prays the
rosary outside abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Kinnally, an organist who once worked as musical director of St.
Augustine's Cathedral in Bridgeport, said Walsh's encouragement
played an important role in his decision to return to the diocese.
He also considered applying to the diocese in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an openness to guys like me who are coming at this a
little later, and the sense that what we bring to it can enrich the
priesthood,'' Kinnally said. ``Bridgeport is doing so well. The
simple way to say it is, they're doing something right.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pavia's case, the diocese tackled his misgivings head on. It
even allowed him to keep his full-time job as a mechanic in the
maintenance department of Stamford Hospital while he attended St.
John Fisher, until he was sure about committing to the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   While priests ordained in the 1960s and '70s generally do not
describe the ritual of their ordination as something they gave much
thought to beforehand, seeing it mostly as a necessary step to
becoming the spiritual shepherd of Catholics, Pavia was awed by the
moment he was to deliver his personal will to the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holy Spirit at that time is coming over you,'' Pavia said.
``Everyone, from saints in heaven to the people in the pews, are
praying for you. My life is now totally in God's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   As a newspaper boy long ago, Pavia would get so wrapped up
talking to his customers that he sometimes forgot to collect their
money. Now, he sees the essence of his new life in the Masses,
baptisms and confessions ahead. He envisions going door to door
once again, visiting nursing homes and hospitals, seeing to the
needs of his parishioners with Bible in hand. The impulse to do for
others, he said, will probably never leave him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the calling and we all have it,'' he said. ``We
just respond to it in different ways.''

FIVE NUCLEAR POWERS MAKE STRONGER PLEDGE TO SCRAP ARSENALS 
</HEADLINE>
   y BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took decades of international pressure and weeks of intense
negotiations, but when a month-long conference of more than 185
nations ended at the United Nations this weekend the five original
atomic powers had agreed for the first time to the ``unequivocal''
elimination of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the move, part of a broad
agreement to reinvigorate nuclear arms control, ``a significant
step forward in humanity's pursuit of a more peaceful world.''
</P>
<P>
   The five nuclear powers _ Britain, China, France, Russia and the
United States _ never considered setting a deadline for meeting
this goal, and there are strong lobbies in every country arguing
for retention of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   But their pledge, brokered by a group of seven middle-level
powers calling themselves the New Agenda Coalition, gives at least
a psychological boost to flagging efforts to contain and abolish
nuclear weapons, the aim of a 30-year-old treaty whose achievements
and failures have been under review by the United Nations
conference.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official, who spoke on condition that
he not be identified, said Sunday night that the agreement did not
represent a significant shift in United States policy. But the
wording of the document did mark a break with earlier public
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the United States and other nuclear-weapons nations
have always insisted on qualifiers like the ``eventual''
elimination of arms.
</P>
<P>
   The final document pledges ``an unequivocal undertaking by the
nuclear-weapon states to accomplish the total elimination of their
nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament to which all states
parties are committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's chief negotiator, Ambassador Seiichiro Noboru, who has
been active in a six-month campaign to put muscle in disarmament
promises during this treaty review conference, was jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is happy news that we could get agreement for the first
time without the infamous word `ultimate,''' he said in an
interview at the end of a meeting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons was
adopted in 1968, went into effect in 1970 and was extended
indefinitely in 1995. The pact, the cornerstone of international
nuclear controls, is reviewed every five years.
</P>
<P>
   This year's conference was considered by arms control experts to
be especially important because in light of recent setbacks,
including India and Pakistan's tests of nuclear weapons in 1998 and
Congress' refusal last year to approve a treaty banning nuclear
testing.
</P>
<P>
   India, which has long aspired to great-power status, has used
the argument that it is unfair for some countries to keep nuclear
bombs while others are not permitted to have them under the
nonproliferation treaty, which succeeding Indian governments have
refused to sign. Only three other nations have also refused: Cuba,
Israel and Pakistan, which insists that India go first.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, which is assumed to have the bomb, was singled out for
the first time this year for its refusal to sign the treaty and
allow comprehensive inspections of its nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have not signed cannot take part in the five-year
review conferences, except as observers.
</P>
<P>
   In the final document of this year's conference _ which was
finally approved late Saturday after being held up for 24 hours by
a dispute between the United States and Iraq over how to word the
status of Iraqi cooperation with nuclear inspections _ nuclear and
non-nuclear nations recommitted themselves to forgo nuclear
testing.
</P>
<P>
   China, in a break with the past, agreed to greater openness in
sharing information about its atomic programs.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats and disarmament experts say that the greater
flexibility shown by the United States this year may have been
rooted in its determination not to have its proposed antimissile
nuclear defense program criticized in the final conference
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The antimissile program has been under steady criticism at the
conference, where delegates from many nations said it could
undermine decades of arms control agreements by provoking a new
kind of weapons race.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement to drop the qualifiers for the elimination of the
weapons came on Thursday after Russia and France withdrew
objections. The new wording emerged on Wednesday after days and
nights of closed-door meetings between the five original nuclear
powers and the New Agenda Coalition _ Brazil, Egypt, Ireland,
Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for arms control groups that welcomed the step, Rebecca
Johnson, the director of Disarmament Diplomacy, a British journal
covering arms control, said that the statement was very important
because it reinforced a World Court judgment that ``there is a
legal obligation to negotiate the elimination of nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that previous documents issued at reviews of the
nonproliferation treaty had much ``woollier'' provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get this paragraph on the unequivocal undertaking on the
elimination of nuclear arsenals is a very much clearer statement of
objectives and purpose,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other antinuclear groups were not happy, however, describing the
new pledge as too little, too late.

DIANE SAWYER SCHEDULED AFTER `MILLIONAIRE'  
 NEW YORK POST PLANS A SPORTS WEEKLY  
 A POLITICAL EXCHANGE COURTESY OF GANNETT  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, Diane Sawyer received some very good news.
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives announced she would be a co-host a new news
magazine program, ``Prime Time Thursday,'' starting in the fall. It
will be preceded by ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' the ratings
blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely believed that by moving Sawyer's prime-time duties
from Wednesday to Thursday nights after ``Millionaire,'' executives
have given her good leverage in the highly competitive race to win
interviews with sought-after newsmakers. If the game show can
maintain its popularity, Sawyer can guarantee potential subjects
extra-large audiences.
</P>
<P>
   But what is good for Sawyer does not necessarily make for smooth
office politics.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Walters, who won fame for her interviews with newsmakers
long before Sawyer came along, had been pushing for an installment
of ``Millionaire'' before her Friday night edition of ``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, programmers scheduled a new sitcom in the time slot.
Called ``Madigan Men,'' it stars Gabriel Byrne as a divorced
architect living in New York. Walters is said to be relieved that
she will no longer have to follow the network's Friday night
programming block tailored for youngsters, which is being
dismantled for the fall. But she has expressed deep disappointment
about not following ``Millionaire,'' said executives close to the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   They added that they expected Walters to raise that
disappointment again when she renegotiates her contract in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer, it should be noted, played the good soldier last year in
agreeing to be a co-host of ``Good Morning America,'' a grueling
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Neufeld, who is executive producer for all of the ABC
news magazine programs, said: ``All this has to do with is how the
network saw the schedule working out for the best.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW YORK POST PLANS A SPORTS WEEKLY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the age of 24-hour sports television networks, sports
talk radio stations, countless sports Web sites, the continued
dominance of Sports Illustrated and the immediate availability of
game scores on wireless devices (and so on). So do sports fans,
particularly in the New York area, need more sports coverage?
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post thinks so. Beginning June 1, it will publish a
separate weekly newspaper covering local teams.
</P>
<P>
   The editors of the tabloid think a good portion of its readers
just cannot get enough of its particular brand of sports coverage
and will be willing to spend an extra $1.50 a week for the new
publication, to be called New York Post Sports Week.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is in keeping with the strategy of Rupert Murdoch, the
chairman of The Post's parent company, the News Corp., to
capitalize on avid sports fans' passions for their favorite teams
and players. His television sports network, Fox Sports Net, for
instance, creates regional programming for fans in 19 different
markets nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Chandler, The Post's publisher and editor in chief, said his
editors came up with the idea for the paper and saw it as a good
chance to extend The Post's brand. In a similar vein, earlier this
year the newspaper began a separate Web site for its gossip column,
Page Six (Pagesix.com).
</P>
<P>
   This will not be a major rollout. The initial print run will be
75,000 to 100,000, a fraction compared with the circulation of The
Post (436,544 daily; 358,545 on Sundays). The publication, which
will carry 48 to 52 pages at first, will be supported by newsstand
sales, with some advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But Chandler said the news articles would be original, not
recycled. Six new reporters will write exclusively for the weekly
newspaper, but the entire sports staff will contribute to it in
return for more money, including The Post's columnists, like Steve
Serby, Phil Mushnick and Peter Vecsey.
</P>
<P>
   While The Post follows the sports news of the day, Chandler said
Sports Week would be filled with long features, investigations and
deeper statistics. It will feature color on its cover and on some
inside pages.
</P>
<P>
   Can it work?
</P>
<P>
   ``Between The Sporting News, Sports Illustrated and the
Internet, the dailies, it's kind of interesting that they think
there's an opportunity there,'' said Jared Weiss, a partner at
Steiner Sports Marketing. ``I don't see it from the surface.''
Nevertheless he said he is discussing promotions with the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's based on the assumption that our readers love our sports
coverage and no matter how much we give them in the paper, they
always seem to want more,'' he said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A POLITICAL EXCHANGE COURTESY OF GANNETT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for reporters to complain that candidates do
not hold enough debates. In New Jersey, however, where the
Democratic contenders for the U.S. Senate have been debating about
debates for months, editors from Gannett papers around the state
found an unusual way to initiate at least one additional
face-to-face encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett, which owns seven papers in New Jersey, invited Jon S.
Corzine to meet with members of its editorial boards at 1 p.m. last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Unbeknownst to Corzine, who has been reluctant to debate his
opponent, Jim Florio, the papers also invited Florio.
</P>
<P>
   Like Corzine, Florio said he was stunned when he arrived and
found his rival in the room. Both men were even more surprised when
the editors told them that instead of the individual interviews
they had expected, the candidates were expected to engage in a
debate.
</P>
<P>
   When the impromptu encounter ended, both campaigns complained
that they had been misled.
</P>
<P>
   Robert E. Ingle, Gannett's Trenton bureau chief, said the papers
had decided months ago to save time by holding just two editorial
board meetings, one for the four Republicans and one for Corzine
and Florio. Ingle, who was in charge of setting up the encounters,
said that both campaigns were fully informed of the arrangements,
although he could not recall whom he spoke with at either campaign.
If Corzine was misled, it was by his own people, Ingle said.
</P>
<P>
   And was Florio misled, in precisely the same way, by his aides?
``Well, who else would it be?'' Ingle asked.
</P>
<P>
   With less than three weeks remaining until the primary, neither
campaign wanted to antagonize a newspaper chain by complaining
publicly, so their spokesmen tried to laugh off the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School of
Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, said that a
newspaper can harm its own credibility if it is not candid and
complete in its dealings with political candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The protocol is that it's the newspaper's responsibility to be
absolutely clear about who will appearing at a forum and what the
format will be,'' she said. ``Otherwise, it sounds like the
candidates were blindsided.''

AGENT'S ROLE IN MUSIC SITE CHANGES WAR OVER RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Ovitz, superagent and former Disney president, has made
his name _ and a considerable fortune _ aggressively securing
hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties and other payments for
artists and studios that he represents. But his latest endeavor, a
pop-culture hub on the World Wide Web, has the potential to drain
income from some of those same clients by enabling users of the
site to copy music, media and other files from one another.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ovitz and a business partner bought 51 percent of
Scour.com, an entertainment site and search engine used to find
music and movie files. Last month, though, the site added a
feature, Scour Exchange, that lets users exchange multimedia files
online with one another, including copyrighted material by some of
the world's leading artists, some of them clients of Ovitz's talent
management agency, Artists Management Group.
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of Ovitz in Scour.com would seem to be at cross
purposes with his role in Artists Management. But his backing of
Scour.com also marks a significant shift in the roiling battle over
copyright protection in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the archnemeses of the recording industry have been
20-something entrepreneurs creating Web sites that make it easy to
exchange copyrighted files over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz's backing for Scour.com's file-exchange mechanism suggests
that opposition may be eroding to technology that, by many
accounts, will force the development of new business models for the
entertainment industry, changing how artists are compensated for
their work and how their work is protected.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz declined to comment. But James Ellis, general counsel for
Artists Management Group and a director of Scour Inc., said it
makes more sense to embrace the technology than to fight it. ``In
the face of a rapidly changing marketplace, Scour had to respond,
to maintain and grow its audience and give them what they wanted,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said that Scour hoped to find ways to make file sharing
lucrative for artists. And he said Scour was vigilant about kicking
copyright infringers off the site if Scour was informed of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rodrigues, 24, co-founder and president of Scour.com, said
Scour Exchange could not be held accountable if some people used
the service to pirate copyrighted material. ``It's impossible for
us to screen, censor or review,'' he said. ``It's not our job to
know what is, or is not, infringing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scour.com Web site does include a copyright notice but,
practically speaking, it is simple to obtain copyrighted material
by entering the search term for the desired song or movie.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet music industry analysts say Ovitz has a
potentially serious conflict of interest in holding a stake in
Scour.com and managing artists whose music and movies may be traded
freely on Scour Exchange. The works of several of the artists
represented by Ovitz's agency are exchanged on Scour Exchange,
including music from the group Blues Traveler and the singer Liz
Phair.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a significant potential for conflict,'' said Kevin
Hause, an Internet music analyst with IDG, a market research group.
``He is someone entrusted to look out for the best interest of
artists.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rodrigues said that Ovitz is actually building a bridge
between the old-world media companies and the new business models
of the Internet. ``He understands both sides of the equation,''
Rodrigues said. ``He understands what entertainment companies need
and what's important to copyright holders and what works on the
Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Scour.com was founded in a two-bedroom apartment near the campus
of the University of California at Los Angeles. Traffic to the site
grew quickly, and the company eventually attracted the interest of
Ovitz, who read about Scour.com in the school newspaper, and the
grocery billionaire Ron Burkle. For $4 million, the pair took a
majority stake in the business, said Rodrigues.
</P>
<P>
   The company reached deals with a number of Internet start-ups
and media companies to provide content to include with the search
function. Scour is now contemplating a variety of business models,
including taking advertisements, selling subscriptions and selling
multimedia content.
</P>
<P>
   It now features movie trailers and music promotions provided
legitimately by movie and record companies, along with some items
for sale, like music available for download. The site now receives
2 million visitors each month.
</P>
<P>
   As with Napster, the controversial site offering a service that
lets users share and trade their music files online, users of Scour
download software over the Internet that allows them to store and
catalog multimedia files on their own computers.
</P>
<P>
   Scour Exchange posts those catalogs and then enables users of
the service to visit one another's computers over the Internet and
share and download one another's music, movies, and other holdings.
The service does not provide the content, but facilitates the
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, based in San Mateo, Calif., has been sued by the
Recording Industry Association of America for reportedly
facilitating music piracy in a pending case that many expect to set
a precedent. The association and the five major record labels it
represents say its artists are losing tens of millions of dollars a
year because of rampant music piracy on the Internet, a practice
that the trade group says threatens to undermine the very economics
of the creation of music.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Rosen, the president of the recording industry
association, said the group was aware of Scour Exchange's
activities and was considering its options. But she said the
organization did not want to rush to file lawsuits against each
Napster-like service, hoping the decision in that case case might
dissuade copycats. ``We don't have any interest in litigating our
way through the Internet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But in reality the industry association might simply lack the
resources to file enough lawsuits, given the boom in these services
and the complexity of the attendant technology. Most recently, a
23-year-old Irish programmer created Freenet, which would enable
people to share files online directly with one another in a way
that would make it virtually impossible for copyright holders to
find a central database or hub to blame for the interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies a key argument of Rodrigues and Scour Exchange.
They contend that the free exchange of files online may be
inevitable, so media companies might as well get on board. ``Were
trying to work with entertainment companies to help them use it,''
Rodrigues said, adding, ``Ovitz has been instrumental to us in
leveraging entertainment relationships he has.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Scour has some agreements with other companies aimed at helping
users to download multimedia files in a way that protects
copyright. For instance, Liquid Audio, a company that makes
technology to enable digital distribution of music in a way that
protects copyright and that is a partner of some of the major
record labels has a deal with Scour to enable it to sell several
encrypted songs on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Cook Fleming, vice president of marketing for Liquid
Audio, said Liquid Audio is providing an alternative to people who
might otherwise pirate music rather than pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Another company that has signed a deal with Scour is Nettwerk
Productions, an independent record label aiming to promote one of
its up-and-coming artists, a musician named Brian Transeau who
records as BT, on Scour.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Barrett, director of strategic marketing for Nettwerk,
said the deal puts the label in an awkward position because the
site is promoting the music of BT, but with a single click of the
mouse, users can get pirated versions of BT's songs free through
Scour.
</P>
<P>
   But BT said people will inevitably trade copyrighted music on
the Web, so artists might as well try to figure out how to
capitalize on the sites making that possible. ``It's an
uncontrollable situation,'' BT said. ``You might as well embrace it
and make the best of it, or you're going to go insane trying to
prevent it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some musicians and their agents disagree. Howard King, a
Los Angeles attorney who is representing Metallica and Dr. Dre in
lawsuits against Napster, said that Ovitz and Scour have an
obligation to stand up to piracy. ``Just because some kid in the
Philippines knows how to create a devastating virus, doesn't mean
we say, `Oh it'll happen again,' and not do something about it,''
he said.

<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. _ At 69, the former senator, cabinet officer and
party chairman is enjoying what would be for some the pleasures of
retirement, like a power boat on the Severn River or an afternoon
walk around the colonial era streets of Maryland's capital _ not to
mention cheering the Naval Academy's football team.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Brock is anything but retired. For several years he had
been working quietly, as chairman of Intellectual Development
Systems Inc., on a program to help school systems overcome learning
problems. For the last few weeks he has been working noisily to
rebuild the current presidential nominating system.
</P>
<P>
   Although he concedes that ``every reform I ever voted for has
come back to bite me,'' Brock is leading an effort among Republican
leaders to begin the primary season with the smallest states and
put the biggest states, like New York and California, last.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, if adopted at the Republican convention this summer
and implemented by the states, is intended to enable people in
every state to feel involved in the choice of presidential
nominees, and thereby in the system generally. This year, for
example, Republicans had high turnout in early states, through the
March 7 primary. Then, ``It was just like falling off a cliff, in
terms of participation,'' Brock said. ``Nobody came from then on.''
</P>
<P>
   By starting with small states, the system would encourage
lesser-known candidates without lots of money. ``You place your
primary emphasis on retail politics, face-to-face campaigning in
small settings, small groups where people can ask questions looking
the candidate in the eye and hear his response or her response. The
candidates can get a much, much clearer sense of what is bothering
Americans by walking their neighborhoods than they can by standing
in front of a television camera _ or reading a poll.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, who holds the party chairmanship that Brock
occupied from 1977 to 1981, put him in charge of reinventing the
primaries last summer, creating a commission of several party
elders.
</P>
<P>
   Brock represented Tennessee in the House and the Senate, and
after his time as party chairman, when he rebuilt the machine that
Ronald Reagan led to victory, he served in the Reagan
administration as trade representative and secretary of labor. In
the Senate, he cast some votes for what he thought was reform. He
supported encouraging the development of political action
committees. He voted for the 1974 Federal Election Campaign Act,
which imposed a $1,000 limit on campaign contributions, which he
said worked pretty well for the 1976, 1980 and 1984 elections,
before the blossoming of soft money.
</P>
<P>
   He does not argue that the new primary system would solve all
the problems in the system. Changes in campaign financing are
essential, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think soft money is an abomination. I think what has
happened to PACs has dismayed all of us who thought it was a reform
when we voted for them in the early 70s after Watergate. Obviously,
the $1,000 limit is a problem because it is worth less than $300
now in real terms. So that is ridiculous. And all of these are
pieces of the whole. All of these are parts of the problem, and if
you try to deal with one aspect and not the complete package, you
are not going to get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   The urgency of acting soon settled on the commission, Brock
said, when ``we saw this whole thing come to a crashing halt,
effectively, on the 7th of March. People began to realize that it
is not just the financial side, it is the whole process that
requires remedy.'' He added, ``Doesn't it scare people that we have
elections in America where nobody comes? That is a terrifying
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Many leaders from big states oppose the plan because they think
the nominating contest would end before it reached them. And even
if Brock gets his proposal through the Republican National
Committee and the convention, he knows it won't be very effective
unless Democrats agree.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like the Republicans must make the first move. Their
current party rules can only be changed by the convention. The
Brock plan would ask the convention to allow the national committee
to change the rules between conventions. Then a deal could be
struck with the Democrats, who can change their rules between
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Brock speaks kindly about the Democrats who are watching to see
if he will succeed. ``The Democrats have a particular problem,'' he
said. ``Their rules are very difficult to change'' because it takes
a ``two-thirds majority. It effectively allows almost any
significant group of opponents to block reform. That's the
challenge they face. I'm very sympathetic to their problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bill Brock who came to Washington in 1963, or even the one
who beat Al Gore Sr. for the Senate in 1970, would not have been
tolerant of Democrats. But he changed in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in riding my white horse with my armor burnished, ready
to slay the dragons of the left,'' he said. ``It was amazing how
little I thought of Hubert Humphrey until I got to know him, and
then how much I loved him. We didn't have to agree on issues. You
know, viewed from afar, people don't look as good as they can look
up close. It's really hard to hate somebody that you have to live
with and work with. You begin to have an appreciation for and a
respect for the process. The system works, and you have to pay
attention to it and make sure it continues to work because the
world does change.''

ANALYSIS: AFTER GIULIANI'S WITHDRAWAL, RETOOLED CAMPAIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It had become a race about celebrity and personality: Hillary
Rodham Clinton attacking New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as harsh
and temperamentally unsuited for a place in the U.S. Senate, and
Giuliani portraying Clinton as opportunistic and untrustworthy,
unsuited to represent New Yorkers in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But as Clinton and her new opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio of Suffolk
County, set out across New York Sunday, laying out their divergent
ideologies and themes, it was clear that the new candidate lineup
had prompted the first lady, and to a lesser extent the
Republicans, to retool their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   This has become a contest that is slightly less about who the
participants are, and slightly more about what they stand for. And
it is a development that appears to be welcomed by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   In the old lineup, Clinton had sought to attack Giuliani on both
his temperament and his ideology. But she kept returning to his
jagged personality, in no small part because depicting the moderate
mayor as too conservative was ``a stretch,'' as one of her advisers
conceded Sunday with a sudden candor that surfaced with Giuliani's
exit from the race.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has now flipped. Attacking the temperament of
Lazio _ with his Boy Scout grin and telegenic good looks _ seems
even more improbable than attacking Giuliani as hard-right
conservative. But Lazio stands to the right of Giuliani, which
means that Clinton may now be able to draw on the ideological
differences with Lazio that had proved so elusive with Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``We no longer have the hard-edged personality to pivot off,''
one of Clinton's senior advisers said Sunday. ``Now we really are,
in a large measure, in a campaign of issues. I think that issues
and ideology are going to play more importantly going forward than
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if Giuliani at times sought to resist Clinton's attempt
to draw ideological distinctions between them, Lazio seemed Sunday
to be encouraging them, in the calculation that he would benefit
from the contrast more than Clinton. At every turn, he belittled
his new opponent as a liberal, reprising the play book that
Republicans have used in every state election in New York and
throughout the country for the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, one of Lazio's advisers said, the new
candidate, who won the formal endorsement of the state Republican
chairman, William D. Powers, Sunday, will carry on with some of the
more personality-driven attacks that Giuliani offered. In an
interview on Sunday, for example, he described Clinton as an
opportunist, and he has repeatedly labeled her a carpetbagger, a
line of attack that his aides said would be central to his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While a series of polls has suggested that the issue of
Clinton's new residency has receded in the minds of many New
Yorkers, it is the kind of topic, one of Lazio's advisers said,
that could help the Republicans paint Clinton as ``not one of us,''
to use the shorthand favored by consultants. One Republican
suggested that that could prove easier for the easygoing Lazio than
for the hard-driven Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani was the opponent, there was some disagreement
among Clinton's advisers about the extent to which they should go
after the mayor's personality rather than his ideology, because the
two held such similar views. The question now, one aide said, is
determining how aggressively Clinton should move to show Lazio as
ideologically extreme.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Clinton's advisers were described as divided
Sunday night over whether they should quickly wheel out television
advertisements attacking Lazio's positions, in particular his
support for much of Newt Gingrich's ``Contract With America'' in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   To date, it has been Clinton's surrogates (Sunday, it was her
press secretary, Howard Wolfson, on ``Meet the Press'' on NBC)
rather than the candidate who has carried the attack, reflecting
the concern among Clinton's advisers that she remains too
polarizing a figure to carry out the assaults herself.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it was Clinton's aides who first attacked Lazio, a
point that Lazio made over the last two days. Still, Clinton
presented herself as something of the victim in an appearance in
Albany, the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little disappointed yesterday that my latest opponent
has already started hurling insults instead of offering ideas about
what we can do to improve the lives of New Yorkers,'' she said. ``I
am sorry that my opponent couldn't even get through his
announcement speech without going on the attack.''

   CONCORD, N.C._ With dark sunglasses hiding the circles around
his eyes, H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler on Sunday once again was forced to
discuss tragedy at Lowe's Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler, the track's president and general manager, had rested
only a couple of hours since the collapse of a pedestrian bridge at
11:15 p.m. Saturday, moments after The Winston stock-car race.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that 107 people were injured when
an 80-foot section of the walkway above the south-bound lane of
U.S. 29 collapsed. As many as 13 were listed in critical condition
on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The concrete bridge, constructed in 1995 by Lowe's Motor
Speedway at the cost of $1 million, was a shortcut from the race
facility to the parking lots and campground. It consists of four
80-foot sections. Each is 16 feet wide and is enclosed by a tall
chain-link fence that arches at the top to discourage people from
throwing debris on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second tragedy in 13 months at the Charlotte track.
Three fans were killed in May, 1999, when debris from an open-wheel
car flew into the stands during a wreck. A bomb threat was called
to the track at last October's Winston Cup event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we are concerned (about the track's image) after
the three incidents that happened here,'' Wheeler said. ``This is
the worst thing you go through with one of these things when
spectators get hurt. It's very much a concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not concerned about the safety of this place. We've
had excellent architects, excellent engineers and have a tremendous
maintenance crew of full-time staff who do constant inspections of
everything in the (track). I feel like it is a very safe place.''
</P>
<P>
   In a press briefing on Sunday, the assistant bridge engineer for
the North Carolina Department of Transportation said that, ``rusty
or eroding'' steel cables could have contributed to the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to make any generalizations or conclusions from
this,'' said Don Idol of the N.C. DOT, ``(but) I did observe what
appeared to be corrosion on some of the (steel cables) at the
failure point. You can make your own judgement from that. Tests and
all will confirm or deny whether that was the real mechanism of
failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Around 40 steel cables run through the two sections of the
bridge. The cables cannot be seen from the outside and are supposed
to be sealed. According to Idol, only water and oxygen can cause
erosion of the cables. When the steel rusts, the bridge weakens.
</P>
<P>
   The section that collapsed was the highest, about 20 feet,
officials said. It cracked in the center, leaving two pieces that
gave way under the weight of shoulder-to-shoulder people leaving
the race, said state traffic engineer Rich Mason, who witnessed the
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses reported two loud pops, following by a mass of people
sliding down the broken sections. It was as though the ends of two
sliding boards were coming together in the highway, said David
Hampton, assistant director of Cabarrus County Emergency Management
Services.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked, watching his feet to avoid running into people in
front of him, Gus Lejano, of Huntersville, N.C., said, ``I saw the
concrete open up and crack open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, all of a sudden,'' Lejano said, ``when you saw all those
bodies and all those people in front of you, in an instant I could
see all the way across to the other side of the bridge because they
all fell down.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the injured who returned to the speedway Sunday to
get their cars and return to their homes had cuts and scrapes.
Their arms and legs were bandaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an amazing sight; everyone disappeared. . . . There was
a mass of people, and then they were all gone,'' said Mike Aquino,
41, of Atlanta, who was treated for minor injuries. ``For a split
second, I was thinking I was going to die, and then I realized I
was going to live.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a surreal scene outside the track after The Winston for
more than three hours. U.S. 29 was crowded with ambulances, police
cars, and rescue vehicles with flashing lights. Thousands of fans
watched helicopters transport the seriously injured spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a freak thing,'' driver Sterling Marlin said.
``That doesn't make it any easier for the folks who were hurt, but
still something no one could have expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The Winston was the first of two consecutive race weekends at
Lowe's Motor Speedway. Wheeler said Wednesday night's qualifying
for Sunday's Coca-Cola 600 will proceed as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are about 170,000 people who have already made their
commitments to be here,'' Wheeler said. ``A lot of them are here
now, and we're going to go on. This is not to take us away from our
concern for the people who are injured. This is not going to take
away from what we can do for those people, nor is it going to take
away from the investigation.''

facility to the parking lots and campground. It consists of four
80-foot sections. Each is 16 feet wide and is enclosed by a tall
chain-link fence that arches at the top to discourage people from
throwing debris on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second tragedy in 13 months at the Charlotte track.
Three fans were killed in May, 1999, when debris from an open-wheel
car flew into the stands during a wreck. A bomb threat was called
to the track at last October's Winston Cup event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we are concerned (about the track's image) after
the three incidents that happened here,'' Wheeler said. ``This is
the worst thing you go through with one of these things when
spectators get hurt. It's very much a concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not concerned about the safety of this place. We've
had excellent architects, excellent engineers and have a tremendous
maintenance crew of full-time staff who do constant inspections of
everything in the (track). I feel like it is a very safe place.''
</P>
<P>
   In a press briefing on Sunday, the assistant bridge engineer for
the North Carolina Department of Transportation said that, ``rusty
or eroding'' steel cables could have contributed to the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to make any generalizations or conclusions from
this,'' said Don Idol of the N.C. DOT, ``(but) I did observe what
appeared to be corrosion on some of the (steel cables) at the
failure point. You can make your own judgement from that. Tests and
all will confirm or deny whether that was the real mechanism of
failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Around 40 steel cables run through the two sections of the
bridge. The cables cannot be seen from the outside and are supposed
to be sealed. According to Idol, only water and oxygen can cause
erosion of the cables. When the steel rusts, the bridge weakens.
</P>
<P>
   The section that collapsed was the highest, about 20 feet,
officials said. It cracked in the center, leaving two pieces that
gave way under the weight of shoulder-to-shoulder people leaving
the race, said state traffic engineer Rich Mason, who witnessed the
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses reported two loud pops, following by a mass of people
sliding down the broken sections. It was as though the ends of two
sliding boards were coming together in the highway, said David
Hampton, assistant director of Cabarrus County Emergency Management
Services.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked, watching his feet to avoid running into people in
front of him, Gus Lejano, of Huntersville, N.C., said, ``I saw the
concrete open up and crack open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, all of a sudden,'' Lejano said, ``when you saw all those
bodies and all those people in front of you, in an instant I could
see all the way across to the other side of the bridge because they
all fell down.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the injured who returned to the speedway Sunday to
get their cars and return to their homes had cuts and scrapes.
Their arms and legs were bandaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an amazing sight; everyone disappeared. . . . There was
a mass of people, and then they were all gone,'' said Mike Aquino,
41, of Atlanta, who was treated for minor injuries. ``For a split
second, I was thinking I was going to die, and then I realized I
was going to live.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a surreal scene outside the track after The Winston for
more than three hours. U.S. 29 was crowded with ambulances, police
cars, and rescue vehicles with flashing lights. Thousands of fans
watched helicopters transport the seriously injured spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a freak thing,'' driver Sterling Marlin said.
``That doesn't make it any easier for the folks who were hurt, but
still something no one could have expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The Winston was the first of two consecutive race weekends at
Lowe's Motor Speedway. Wheeler said Wednesday night's qualifying
for Sunday's Coca-Cola 600 will proceed as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are about 170,000 people who have already made their
commitments to be here,'' Wheeler said. ``A lot of them are here
now, and we're going to go on. This is not to take us away from our
concern for the people who are injured. This is not going to take
away from what we can do for those people, nor is it going to take
away from the investigation.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Wednesday night, President Clinton will headline
the most lucrative political fund-raising event ever, collecting at
least $25 million from 12,000 donors packed into the MCI Center
here.
</P>
<P>
   The record-setting gala, a salute to Clinton and Vice President
Al Gore, will draw thousands of small donors who bought $50
tickets, but also a large number of mega-givers, including 15 to 20
people who have raised or pledged at least $500,000 each. Some of
these big givers will share a private dinner with the president and
vice president the night before the gala at the BET Jazz club in
downtown Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion cements the president's legacy as the most
prodigious political fund-raiser ever. Democratic fund-raisers and
the White House estimate that Clinton is responsible for raising at
least $500 million and perhaps as much as $1 billion since 1992 for
his own campaigns and for Democratic candidates. He is also helping
Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton collect millions of dollars for
their campaigns and is also soliciting money for his presidential
library.
</P>
<P>
   The $500,000 donors to the gala represent a new level of giving
in the arena of soft money, the large, unrestricted contributions
to the political parties. Among those who have given or pledged to
raise this amount are S. Daniel Abraham, the chairman of Slim-Fast
Foods Co.; Claire Dwoskin, the wife of a northern Virginia property
developer, and Vinod Gupta, an Internet entrepreneur from Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has devoted an extraordinary amount of time to cajoling
cash from Democratic donors, speaking at 350 fund-raising events
just since January 1997, an average of one every three days. That
total includes only the events that appear on the president's
official calendar; it does not even capture countless private
sessions that have brought additional millions of dollars into
Democratic accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Clinton has also embarked on a campaign to raise $200
million for his presidential library in Little Rock, Ark., a
project that just last year was projected to cost $125 million.
Multimillion-dollar pledges to the library have been made by
wealthy Clinton friends like David Geffen, the movie mogul and
co-founder of DreamWorks SKG.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike contributors to federal candidates and parties, donors to
the library do not have to be disclosed and so far the White House
has refused requests from the news media to make public the names
of library contributors. The president has been criticized for
raising these large, undisclosed contributions for his library
while he is in office, although previous presidents have also
engaged in similar fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's success in raising money astonishes even those who
have closely watched him do it over the years. ``I don't know how
you count it,'' said Mark Weiner, a financier from Rhode Island, a
friend of Clinton's and treasurer of the Democratic Governors'
Association. ``I would think Clinton has raised $1 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said that Clinton
had certainly raised hundreds of millions of dollars and that the
figure was probably approaching $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even close to debatable that he has raised more money
than any other figure in American political history,'' a senior
Democratic party official said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some of Clinton's more brazen tactics, especially
inviting big donors to sleep at the White House and to fly on Air
Force One, have drawn criticism, as well as scrutiny from federal
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his sheer effort at cultivating wealthy donors from
Hollywood to Wall Street, what is the secret of Clinton's success?
His admirers and his critics both said that he combined the
celebrity and charisma of a polished entertainer with the power and
gravitas of the presidency, a formula that left potential donors
energized.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the givers also strongly agree with the president's
agenda and want to see Gore and other Democratic candidates
continue his policies.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been tireless in his fund-raising duties,
Clinton seldom directly asks his audiences for cash, leaving that
task to others, most notably Terry McAuliffe, who is one of the
president's closest friends. McAuliffe estimated that he had raised
at least $300 million for Clinton and Democratic causes, including
the 1997 inaugural, the White House millennium celebration, the
president's legal defense fund and the campaigns of Gore and
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the years that I've known Bill Clinton, I've never
known him to ask someone for a contribution,'' McAuliffe said. ``He
doesn't like it. He'd rather have someone else do it, like me.''
</P>
<P>
   From his first campaign for the White House in 1991-92 until
this year, Clinton has voiced support for changing the current
campaign finance law, including a ban on soft money. In October
1997, for example, Clinton appeared with congressional advocates of
campaign finance revisions to demand action on legislation to
tighten the laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tide of reform is coming in,'' he said at an appearance in
the White House. ``I will fight as hard as I can for as long as I
can'' for passage of reform legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he did not forswear the raising of soft money, which
led to the scandals and investigations of his 1996 re-election
campaign, Clinton said: ``I'm not sorry that I did what was
available under the existing system. But I have always been for
changing the system. I'm just not for unilateral disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gore has asked Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to join him in
eschewing soft money, but the offer was rebuffed and the soft money
race has continued unabated. The two political parties have raised
$160.5 million in soft money for the 2000 election, a record for
this point in an election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Clinton could have devoted his charisma and the
power of the presidency to achieving significant changes in the
political money game. Instead, they say, he used his skill to
stretch it to the breaking point while feeding public
disillusionment with politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton's presidency on campaign finance has been one of
the great squandered promises and missed opportunities of all
time,'' said Scott Harshbarger, the president of Common Cause and a
former Democratic attorney general of Massachusetts. ``He has
eliminated any sense of shame or outrage from the system of
money-raising in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's fund-raising prowess has generated envy and spawned
imitators in the Republican Party, Harshbarger said. ``The
smoothness, the ingenuity, the almost sheer gall _ people saw what
was happening, and now everyone has just copied him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to calculate with precision how much money
Clinton has raised since he announced his candidacy for president
in 1991. He collected about $30 million in relatively small
donations for his own primary campaigns in 1992 and 1996. But he
also helped the Democrats raise $123 million in soft money for the
1996 campaign and is committed to helping the party surpass that
number this year.
</P>
<P>
   He has also raised untold millions of dollars for Democratic
candidates for the House and Senate, for mayors and governors and
candidates for state legislatures. He raised $10 million for the
millennium celebration. The president's friends and supporters also
donated $8 million to two of his legal defense funds.
</P>
<P>
   He was the host of more than 100 White House coffees in 1995 and
1996, each of which had a fund-raising goal of about $400,000. And
he has tirelessly traversed the country in aid of virtually any
Democrat willing to share a stage with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went into Indiana and did an Evan Bayh dinner in 1996 and
we raised $1 million,'' said Weiner, the treasurer of the
governors' association. ``He'd show up at the Democratic Governors'
Association and we'd raise $5 million.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Clinton says he does not relish the job of raising
money, he offers no apologies for the aggressive way that he and
McAuliffe have taken to the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry and I have never been of the school that believed that
we ought to act embarrassed because we ask people in the system we
have to contribute so that we could get our message across,''
Clinton said at a tribute to McAuliffe last June.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe sees Wednesday's gala as the crowning achievement of
his and the president's fund-raising career and a fitting send-off
for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who doesn't love it?'' McAuliffe said. ``This is a perfect
ending.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Overcoming fears of violence, Haitians
crowded into chaotic polling places Sunday to elect thousands of
legislators and local officials with the hope that their country
would finally escape its political paralysis of the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The vote had been postponed three times since its original
November date because of political fights and logistical setbacks.
Voters initially encountered confusion and long lines Sunday when
they tried to cast ballots. Polls opened late in many places as
officials scrambled to deliver ballots or voter lists. Nonetheless,
there was a widespread expectation that perhaps Haiti had a chance
to have a fully functioning democracy and recover from its
turbulent past and impoverished present.
</P>
<P>
   ``These elections are important because this is the only weapon
the people can use to struggle against all that is bad,'' said
Jean-Claude Augustin, a candidate for mayor in Petionville, a
Port-au-Prince suburb. ``This is our chance to vote for the people
who can do something for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Accomplishing that in a country where decades of dictatorship
under the Duvalier family and a succession of military juntas has
been the norm proved trying Sunday. Postponements and delays,
combined with 15 politically related killings in the past six
weeks, had created a climate of insecurity and fears that voter
turnout would be low.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the streets were calm and bustling with people early
Sunday, and turnout was initially estimated at more than 45 percent
of the four million registered voters. More than 29,000 candidates
were vying for 7,500 posts from senators and deputies to mayors and
local delegates. Final results were not expected until later in the
week. Civic leaders were buoyed by the turnout because the current
political stalemate stemmed from disputes over the validity of the
last legislative elections in 1997, when only 5 percent of the
electorate voted.
</P>
<P>
   Voters said they went to the polls because the country had no
other option if Haiti ever hoped to for the international community
to recognize it as having a legitimate government and finally have
access to $500 million in foreign aid that had gone untouched
because the government was in a political standoff. Since last
January, the country has had no constitutionally appointed prime
minister and no parliament. Its fortunes have steadily worsened
with crumbling roads, insufficient police and increased crime. Drug
trafficking has soared, making Haiti a major transshipment point
for drugs headed to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a change,'' said Venel Esteve, as he waited to vote.
``I want people to have a life where they can put their children in
school and put food on the table.``
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of emerging from the paralysis of recent years
was enough to make some voters willing to confront even the worst
memories of the past. Alexis Metalome waited to cast his vote at
the Argentine Bellegarde National School, a place that had been a
bloody memory since November 1987 when thugs linked to the military
massacred more than 30 people trying to vote in the first
post-Duvalier elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not afraid to vote today,'' said Metalome, who
recalled how he fled the school in 1987 when he saw gunmen jump out
from two cars and start shooting. ``The violent people are now more
afraid than we are. Nothing can stop the vote today.''
</P>
<P>
   But many things delayed it. Voters from the middle class suburb
of Petionville to the teeming slums of Cite Soleil complained that
they arrived at the polls at 6 a.m. only to wait for six hours or
more because electoral officials showed up without ballots or voter
lists. Tempers flared in Cite Soleil when voters could not find
where they were supposed to vote. While there were few reports of
violence, observers said a local electoral official in Cite Soleil
fled when intruders burst into a polling place, grabbed the ballots
and marked them for the candidates of Family Lavalas, the party of
former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's vote was seen as a crucial test for Aristide's power
and popularity in anticipation of his run for the presidency in
November. In the months before the election, roving bands of people
claiming to be Lavalas supporters had violently forced cancellation
of a voter-education campaign. In April, those roving bands of
``chimeres'' burned down one party's headquarters while the police
did nothing to stop them. The violence ebbed in recent weeks but
created a climate of fear that sent some candidates into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers and civic leaders feared that Lavalas wanted
to derail the elections, or at least wear down the opposition's
patience and campaign funds to assure that their candidates would
win. Some people suggested that the multiple delays in scheduling
the vote were part of an attempt to combine the presidential and
legislative elections so that Lavalas candidates could ride to
victory on Aristide's coattails.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing Aristide certainly does not want is to find
himself with a parliament he could not control,'' said a diplomat
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Lavalas officials insisted that they had been ready for
elections all along. Aristide has also said that he wanted to make
sure that calm prevailed during the elections. They accused their
opponents of trying to tear them down because they cannot match
Lavalas' popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the source, the fear as well as the numerous logistical
glitches and delays took their toll on candidates who barely
campaigned after running out of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was there time enough for elections? Yes,'' said one
businessman who was active in a civic coalition that urged
candidates to resume campaigning. ``Was that time used properly?
No.''
</P>
<P>
   Confusion and fatigue were evident among those Haitians who
decided to sit it out altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not have money or a job,'' said Gerard D'Liscard, as he
fixed fishing nets on a rickety pier the day before the election.
``I'm not going. I voted before and nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said they saw the problems leading up to the elections as
the inevitable result of a country that is tottering towards
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All countries pass years and years before establishing a
certain real democracy,'' said Raoul Denis, a businessman. ``It's a
perpetual fight. Even in France, from 1789 to now they have
problems. It's difficult for us. It's nobody's fault. It's
history.''

COMMENTARY: I REMEMBER MAE 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mae West, who would be 106 if alive, is staging an
impressive comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirty Blonde,'' a superb play by and starring Claudia Shear,
brings her to life with such zesty insight that the New York Times
critic cheered: ``Stand up, boys, and take your hats off. Mae West
is back on Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   She is the subject of other plays and articles recalling her
battles against bluenoses. A new book about how women achieved
power in Hollywood is titled ``Is That a Gun in Your Pocket?'' the
first half of one of West's memorable lines, which concluded with
``or are you just happy to see me?''
</P>
<P>
   Why is this subject fit for the Op-Ed page? Because I
interviewed the real Mae West, boys, before she had a wrinkle on
her face, and well remember the lesson she taught a cub reporter
about living up to a legend.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1949; she was in her late 50s, starring on Broadway in
``Diamond Lil.'' Her leading man was not her film discovery Cary
Grant, to whom she had famously vamped ``Come up and see me
sometime,'' but the actor who also played ``Captain Video'' on
small-screen TV.
</P>
<P>
   My boss at The New York Herald Tribune, the columnist Tex
McCrary, thought it would be a kick to send a 19-year-old kid to
interview the sex goddess. I was ushered into the ornate hotel
suite by her maid, who I presume was named Beulah and could peel
grapes.
</P>
<P>
   West, from her reclining position on a chaise longue, looked up
at me with an expression of ``Have I sunk to this? They're sending
the office boy?'' Worse, my first question was painfully puerile:
What was it like to play opposite the hero of thousands of kids,
Captain Video?
</P>
<P>
   She thought about that. Then, coming to a decision, she changed
her expression. Batting those long false eyelashes, she looked at
the ceiling and murmured, ``Mmmm ... suppose you ask Captain Video
... mmmm ... how does it feel to play opposite ... Mae West!''
</P>
<P>
   She had caught the editor's angle, as I had not: Send an
innocent to the symbol of sin. She would play along for publicity's
sake, presuming her persona would sell more tickets than her
person.
</P>
<P>
   I asked why she had turned to her first director, Edward Elsner,
to stage her shocking ``Sex''; he was famed for directing the
actress Maude Adams, no sex symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a director that wasn't too young, one that knew all
the old tricks, because ... mmmm ... I knew all the new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first man I went to said I didn't stick to a formula. He
wasn't my man. The second guy just sputtered that my play was
immoral and salacious. He wasn't my man, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed Elsner directed such sweet things,'' she recalled, ``I
didn't think he'd like my play. His glasses were broken when I went
to see him, so he couldn't read the script himself. I read it to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had one of those cruel little smiles,'' she said, smiling a
cruel little smile herself. ``He looked like Mephisto. He never
laughed once during my reading _ just that little, thin smile. I
couldn't figure what was going on in his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finished the first act, I asked him if he wanted me to
go on. He just looked at me long and hard and smiled that cruel
little smile and said, `Miss West, I want you to read ... every ...
single ... line of it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Right then I knew _ this was my man!''
</P>
<P>
   A carefully constructed anecdote, but when delivered by Mae West
playing Mae West, devilishly suggestive. She proudly mocked her
sexiness even as she exploited men's interest in sex. Unlike
glamour girls and sex goddesses before and after, she was
nice-tough, good-humored and forthright _ which made her
invulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Though she was jailed in 1926 for ``corrupting the morals of
youth,'' no scandal touched her personal life. Nor did this
mistress of the double entendre stoop to the explicit vulgarity and
needless nudity that substitutes for sex appeal today.
</P>
<P>
   As she rose to usher me out, I dared ask if she ever did the
shimmy onstage. ``In an Ed Wynn show, I did a shimmy. But never'' _
West reached up to brush an imaginary blond hair off my shoulder, a
touch I can feel right now _ ``never did I do the shimmy
shewabble!'' (That's a shimmy with bumps and grinds. Low class. Not
our Mae.)

U.S. DID LITTLE TO DETER BUILDUP BY ETHIOPIA AND ERITREA FOR WAR  

</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton annointed the leaders of
Ethiopia and Eritrea as princes of an African Renaissance two years
ago, he and three of his aides took a special interest in trying to
head off one of the continent's biggest and costliest wars.
</P>
<P>
   The behind-the-scenes courting of the Ethiopian Prime Minister,
Meles Zenawi, and the Eritrean president, Isaias Afewerki, ended in
bitter disappointment 10 days ago when Ethiopia rolled into Eritrea
with tanks and artillery and launched trench warfare reminiscent of
World War I.
</P>
<P>
   The latest offensive was taken after two years in which both
countries, among the poorest on earth, spent more than $1 billion
on arms. But in trying to forge a peace settlement, the
administration never sought economic or arms sanctions. Nor did it
seek to slow down more than $1 billion in World Bank loans in the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it focused on an intensive, and sometimes highly
personal diplomatic maneuver. At times, the diplomats involved
said, Clinton himself phoned the two leaders and wrote them letters
trying to coax them away from battle and into peace talks that
could have been held in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A last-second maneuver this month by a team of United Nations
ambassadors who knew the fighting was imminent because blood plasma
had just been shipped to the front also failed.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons pouring into the region _ fighter planes and
helicopters, tanks, howitzers, shoulder-to-air missiles, and
ammunition from Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania, China and North
Korea _ were easy for Western intelligence agencies to see as they
entered Eritrea by sea and Ethiopia overland from Djibouti, by
rail.
</P>
<P>
   But the three Clinton Administration diplomats who headed the
peace effort _ Anthony Lake, a former National Security Agency
adviser to Clinton; Gayle E. Smith, the director for Africa at the
agency; and Susan E. Rice, the assistant secretary of state for
African affairs _ acknowledge that they were reluctant to chastise
the two African leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Former guerrilla leaders who once fought together, Zenawi and
Afewerki were seen as friends of the United States, men who had
promise as reformers, despite their drive to fight each other. They
led countries at the bottom of the economic ladder: it seemed
heartless to be too tough. And they were considered useful in the
administration's efforts to curb the power of the Islamic regime in
Sudan, a government that Zenawi and Afewerki opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as 10 days of fighting have dislodged hundreds of thousands
of people from their homes in Eritrea and killed unknown numbers of
front-line conscripts, the United Nations Security Council has
approved a weapons embargo at the urging of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As the Ethiopians step up their assault by bombing targets near
Eritrean Red Sea ports, the diplomats say they are still talking to
both sides. But they are also considering more severe sanctions,
like limiting the ability of the Eritreans to collect remittances
from friends and relatives in the United States and restricting
international flights of Ethiopian Airlines, a major revenue
earner.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Rice said ``different sanctions'' were
considered at different points.
</P>
<P>
   But she said, ``It was our view given the disposition and the
psychology of the two governments and the two peoples that external
pressure was more likely to drive them in the opposite direction
than the desired direction.'' It was decided to ``resort to those
pressures only in extremis.''
</P>
<P>
   Last October, as the weapons buildup became impossible to
ignore, Lake said there were suggestions to seek an arms embargo.
But Lake said he remained convinced that an arms embargo would have
thrown the two countries into war. Zenawi and Afewerki had asserted
that an arms embargo would bring about a collapse of the peace
talks, making war much more likely, Lake said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the policy say that it was much too soft. ``We should
look them in the eyes and growl,'' said Chester A. Crocker, a
former assistant secretary of state for African affairs. ``They
would blink if they thought we were going to shut them down with
the World Bank. We have the power to come down hard on the
leadership. No one laid our glove publicly on either of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the poverty _ and now the shortage of food that has struck
both countries _ the governments have spent staggering amounts of
money on weapons in the last two years, according to figures from
the Institute for International Strategic Studies in London.
Ethiopia, a country of 60 million, spent $480 million on arms in
1999; Eritrea, a nation of 3 million, spent $306 million. They
spent slightly smaller amounts in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Ethiopia's defense budget is set to rise to $533
million. Yet before the first outbreak of war in 1998, Ethiopia's
defense budget was a little more than $100 million, the Institute
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four years, Ethiopia received $924.9 million from
the World Bank, more than two-thirds of it in 1998 after a first
round of fighting, according to the World Bank. Eritrea, a much
smaller country, received less.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank never threatened to stop the money, bank
officials said, although Ethiopia lost its program with the
International Monetary Fund because of excessive military spending.
</P>
<P>
   As well, the Eritrean leader, Afewerki has been able to
complement the foreign aid money by raising funds from the very
loyal Eritrean diaspora in the United States. In early March,
Afewerki addressed more than 10,000 Eritreans at the Equestrian
Center in Upper Marlboro, Md., and many of them gave generously to
his war machine.
</P>
<P>
   The three negotiators who squared off with the African leaders,
who turned out to be less princes of reform than warriors for
personal honor, were eclectic, each with a point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Lake, 61, who specialized in Africa as a university student and
wrote his doctoral dissertation on Rhodesia, carried the weight of
a professional diplomat. Smith, 44, once a freelance journalist who
was on friendly terms with the two leaders from the 1970s and 1980s
when she wrote about them from behind the lines, conveyed intimate
knowledge of the region's clans and personalities. Rice, 35, an
African-American who has the confidence of Secretary of State,
Madeleine K. Albright, carried the authority of that office.
</P>
<P>
   The current fighting represents the third and most expansive
phase of the battle between the two countries. The State
Department's best guess is that 50,000 to 60,000 people were killed
in the first two rounds in the last two years, officials said. The
death toll this time could be even higher, they said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, the dispute is about territory around a
border between Eritrea and Ethiopia. Eritrea says it was reclaiming
its own land when it marched over the line in May 1998; Ethiopia
says it must have the territory back before it will agree to a
comprehensive peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   As both leaders amassed their huge arsenals and conscripted wave
upon wave of peasants, teachers, engineers and doctors, they were
summoned to negotiations in Algiers earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   There, the talks were convened under the umbrella of the
Organization for African Unity, but atmospherics were sour. The two
men walked away, determined to go to war, just as they had been at
various points all along, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When a group of United Nations ambassadors, including the
American envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, heard that the countdown for
war was under way, they rushed from central Africa northward to see
if they could make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   But the envoys found Meles and Afewerki impervious to arguments
about how they risked the lives of tens of thousands of their
citizens and the viability of their fledgling countries.
</P>
<P>
   As the ambassadors left, war broke out, making clear that
Clinton's speechwriters, who chose to compare Meles and Afewerki to
Renaissance leaders, may have unwittingly been correct. The
Renaissance, several Africa hands noted, ended in bloody wars too.

19 DIE IN PENNSYLVANIA PLANE CRASH

<P>
   A charter plane carrying 19 people from Atlantic City, N.J., to
Wilkes-Barre, Pa., apparently developed engine trouble Sunday
morning as it approached its destination and crashed, killing
everyone aboard, federal and local officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane, a twin-engine turbo prop carrying 17 passengers
and two crew members, had made one failed approach at
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport and was trying another
approach when it crashed at 11:48 a.m., said George W. Black, a
federal National Transportation Safety Board member. The plane fell
in Bear Creek Township, a hilly, wooded area in northeast
Pennsylvania about nine miles southwest of the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Fire, police and ambulance crews found the burning wreckage in
the Poconos Mountains nearly an hour later, at 12:45 p.m. ``They
found the crash site, and there were no survivors,'' said Ron Rome,
spokesman for Luzerne County 911, which coordinated emergency
services.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots of the Jetstream 31, an aircraft owned by Executive
Airlines of Farmingdale, N.Y., had reported engine trouble as the
plane made its first approach through cloudy skies and mist,
prompting airport officials to dispatch fire and ambulance crews.
The aircraft was unable to land and continued around for a second
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some indication on the air traffic control tapes that
they were encountering engine problems during the first approach
and those continued into the second attempt,'' Black told reporters
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On a portion of the tape played on ABC News, one pilot can be
heard saying ``tell him we lost both engines.'' The other pilot
replies: ``We lost both engines.''
</P>
<P>
   Wy Gowell, the assistant director of the Wilkes-Barre airport,
said that low cloud cover and rain required the pilots to try an
instrument landing. The pilots were in contact with air traffic
controllers through the first landing attempt, Gowell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was apparently going around for another approach,'' Gowell
said. ``And then he apparently experienced some difficulty, and the
tower and radar approach lost contact with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gowell said the passengers, all or most of them from the
Wilkes-Barre area, had left on Saturday for Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Maguire, 37, who lives two miles from the crash scene,
said she was gardening when she heard an aircraft motor revving
overhead. ``I realized that it wasn't a lesson, that it was a plane
in distress,'' she said. ``I looked up but I couldn't see it
because of the clouds. Then the motor quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Black said investigators would analyze the cockpit voice
recorder to determine what problems the pilots believed they were
encountering as they approached the airport. But he said the
Jetstream 31, like many planes its size, is not required to carry a
flight data recorder, which tracks altitude, air speed, engine
performance and other details that help investigators determine
what may have caused a malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Black said the plane, which was manufactured by British
Aerospace, does not have a history of malfunctions. According to a
Federal Aviation Administration database, the plane that crashed
was built in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Accidents, though, have happened. On Dec. 13, 1994, a Jetstream
31 operated by American Eagle crashed on approach to Raleigh-Durham
International Airport in North Carolina, killing 15 of the 20
people aboard. The cause was pilot error. In January 1991, another
Jetstream 31 operated by American Eagle crash-landed at Beckley,
W.Va., starting a cabin fire. No one was killed but 16 people were
hurt.

 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak recalled his peace
negotiators from Sweden on Sunday after a firebomb seriously
wounded a 2-year-old Israeli girl in a car passing through the
sleepy Palestinian-ruled city of Jericho.
</P>
<P>
   The attack prompted Israel to block entrance to the Palestinian
territories, declaring them unsafe for Israelis and tourists, and
temporarily undercut a year of normalization efforts. The incident
also undermined Palestinian attempts to restore order, although the
Palestinians did clamp down on street fighting for the first time
in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials denounced Barak for pushing away from the
peace table. Calling it an ``irresponsible decision,'' Ahmed Abdel
Rahman, general secretary of the Palestinian Authority, said it
would lead to ``further deterioration and increased tensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night, because of surging violence in the West
Bank, Gaza and Lebanon, Barak also canceled a trip to consult with
President Clinton on the U.S.-mediated ``final status'' peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton's advisers said they understood, the
cancellation indicated that Israel was setting its own timetable
despite prodding from administration officials who have devoted two
terms to the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort and feel that their
remaining time is ebbing away.
</P>
<P>
   Middle East peace, however, does not work on anyone's schedule.
Certainly the last two weeks have produced an unpredictable shift
on the ground, in which the Palestinians' frustration with the slow
pace of peace erupted at the same time that officials finally got
down to serious and substantive final-status negotiations in
Stockholm, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators face a September deadline, which is tight even
without timeouts, given that other events will compete for the
Israeli leader's attention. Soon, Barak, who is also the defense
minister, will be forced to focus on the complex and delicate task
of withdrawing Israeli troops from southern Lebanon by July 7. And
analysts believe that the dynamic of the withdrawal is already
affecting Israeli-Palestinian relations.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Arab world see Israel's withdrawal as a defeat to be
celebrated, and as an object lesson that negates the value of peace
negotiations. Fighters from Hezbollah, or the Party of God, are
intensifying their combat to ensure that Israel pulls out under
fire.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, for the first time in years, they attacked an Israeli
outpost at the foot of Mount Hermon, in the Shebaa Farms area that
was Syrian territory when Israel occupied the Golan Heights. Israel
does not plan to withdraw from the Shebaa Farms even though Lebanon
recently claimed the land as Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, which will certify whether Israel's
withdrawal is complete, is unlikely to accept Lebanon's assertion.
This makes the Shebaa Farms a worrisome zone, and Hezbollah sent a
message Sunday that it would keep fighting Israel if the withdrawal
did not include the area.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in the last week, Palestinian youths cited the
Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon as proof that violence ``forces the
Israelis to surrender,'' as one teen-ager said Sunday. ``They are
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that this will be a new intifada,'' Nafez Azzam, a
leader of the Islamic Holy War group in Gaza, said, referring to
the uprising of the late 1980s. ``It should continue as far as
occupation remains. There is no excuse for resumption of talks
under such an atmosphere. This is an atmosphere of war.''
</P>
<P>
   The street violence, which involved sustained gunfire between
Israeli and Palestinian troops last Monday, provoked opposition
forces on both sides to press their leaders to suspend the peace
talks. At Sunday's Israeli Cabinet meeting, Health Minister Shlomo
Benizri of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party said that Yasser Arafat,
the Palestinian leader, was ``either a dead horse or a deadly
one,'' and he proclaimed the peace effort to be useless.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Stockholm negotiations continued until Sunday, when
Barak halted them ``in light of the situation.'' He also deferred
the transfer of Abu Dis and two other villages abutting Jerusalem
to full Palestinian control.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office said he viewed the incident in Jericho ``with the
greatest concern'' and has demanded that the Palestinian Authority
track down those responsible. The little girl was severely burned,
and her mother and aunt had less serious burns. Their car was
passing through Jericho early Sunday on its way to northern Israel,
a shortcut that many Israelis prefer to the circuitous bypass road
that was built so they could avoid Palestinian-ruled areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Jericho attack unnerved pro-peace Israelis, who have
hesitated to accept that the recent violence could be anything but
a short-lived spurt, because such incidents were coming to be seen
as a thing of the past. Many have touted the normalization of
tourism to and travel through Jericho in particular as an emblem of
successful ``people to people'' peace relations.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a reflection of the successful casino there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We today are not at peace with ourselves when we see what is
happening with the Palestinians,'' said Shlomo Lahat, a former
mayor of Tel Aviv and chairman of a pro-peace forum. ``We are
sensitive people, and we understand their pain _ but to attack
people and shoot at them _ that's the thanks we get? These things
cause us to reconsider whether the road we are on is the right
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, of course, see things differently.
</P>
<P>
   In the last nine days, rubber-coated or live bullets fired by
Israeli troops killed five Palestinians and wounded more than 1,000
others, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian human rights groups said the Israeli troops were
using ``excessive force against unarmed Palestinians,'' although
some of the protesters, who threw stones and firebombs, were backed
by sharpshooters. The Israeli soldiers targeted chests, abdomens
and necks, and used live ammunition to disperse crowds, the human
rights advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   The violence grew out of street protests on behalf of the 1,650
Palestinian prisoners in Israel, coupled with demonstrations
marking the anniversary of what Palestinians call the ``nakba,''
the ``catastrophe'' that coupled the destruction of Palestine with
the birth of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In a familiar ritual here, some protesters marched to Israeli
guard positions on the outskirts of Palestinian areas and threw
stones and firebombs. The Israeli soldiers responded by shooting
tear gas, rubber bullets and live bullets. And the Palestinian
police were hesitant to place themselves between their own people
and the Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian Authority cannot use brutal measures on its
own people,'' said Nabil Amr, the minister of parliamentary
affairs. ``We cannot deny them the right to express themselves even
if, unfortunately, it leads to violence and more violence.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, however, the Palestinian police prevented most
demonstrations in the West Bank and Gaza from escalating into
violent clashes. In Ramallah, for instance, they set up roadblocks
on all streets leading to an Israeli-guarded junction and then,
using billy clubs, pushed hundreds of stone-throwing demonstrators
away from the fence of a nearby settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, demonstrators began throwing stones at their
own police officers, and some of the officers hid behind a wall and
threw stones back.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinians said they thought a visit by Sandy Berger,
President Clinton's national security adviser, to Arafat on
Saturday night helped calm the situation. They met in Ramallah.
Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official, said that ``the
Americans affirmed their readiness to hold a trilateral summit''
with Arafat and Barak but insisted that progress in negotiations be
made first.
</P>
<P>
   That would require negotiations to resume. And Berger, who spoke
at Tel Aviv University on Sunday morning, seemed to be urging the
parties to rise above the moment and take the long view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today and in the months ahead, we have a historic opportunity
that we must not allow to slip away _ a chance to resolve the
Israeli-Palestinian problem, the core of the Arab-Israeli
conflict,'' he said. ``The alternative to a peaceful compromise is
not the status quo. It is something very different and, I am
convinced, far worse. For the condition that produced hostility in
the past remains current to this day, as we see in the violence of
the past week.''

   NEW YORK _ If Major League Baseball officials can find time when
they are not probing the baseball or brushback pitches or

Sunday at Shea Stadium in the aftermath of the Mets' battering of
Randy Johnson. Johnson, several members of the Arizona Diamondbacks
asserted, is human.

   Mark Connor, the team's pitching coach, said it. So did Damian
Miller, who was Johnson's catcher. Even Jay Bell, one of the wiser
members of the Diamondbacks, offered that view. ``Randy's human,''
Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Before his 7-6 loss, certainly, they or anyone else would have
been hard pressed to substantiate that claim. But if they are
right, their revelation may be most helpful to their opponents and
most destructive to themselves. If Randy Johnson is indeed human,
it creates the possibility of an entirely different outcome when he
pitches every fifth day.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson approached Sunday's start against the Mets as the
National League leader in victories, strikeouts, shutouts, complete
games, innings pitched, lowest opponents' batting average, overall
earned run average and earned run average at home and on the road,
at night and in daylight. His season ERA read 0.97, and that really
doesn't suggest a human species, not in today's game when the
composite league ERA is five times greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy obviously has set a very high standard for himself, one
that's very tough to meet,'' Buck Showalter, his manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   So, if the Diamondbacks were to be believed, this was the human
Randy the Mets swatted around the ballyard Sunday. ``Even Randy
Johnson can't go out every fifth day and be unhittable,'' Miller
said. ``This is the big leagues, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   It was presumably the alien form of Johnson that struck out
batters for 13 of the 20 outs he recorded. It was the mere human
who gave up eight extra-base hits for the eight hits he allowed:
five doubles and three home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Slugging percentage is computed by dividing total bases by times
at bat. In Johnson's first nine starts, teams compiled a .268
slugging percentage against him. The Mets amassed 22 total bases in
27 at-bats. Those figures produce an .815 slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Location,'' Connor said, explaining the reason for Johnson's
problems. ``A lot of the balls were in the middle. He was behind in
a lot of counts.'' Was this the first time this season the
left-hander has had trouble with location? The coach said
emphatically, ``Oh, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson especially had trouble with the location of a pitch to
Mike Piazza in the third inning. The location when the ball reached
the plate was bad enough; when it landed, it was oh-so-much worse.
``It was a pitch up and over the plate,'' Miller said. ``The slider
didn't do much, just kind of hung up there about belt high right
down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   And the location when the ball reached its final resting place?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably still circling the stadium right now,'' Johnson
said. The ball landed in the third-highest of four tiers of seats,
the ones painted green near the orange pole separating fair from
foul at the end of the left-field line. The Mets, using their
computerized chart, estimated the distance at 492 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some mistakes,'' Johnson said, offering no apologies or
excuses, ``and when you make mistakes to good hitters, hang
pitches, then they hit them a long ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had cracked three doubles when their first inning was
only eight pitches old. Joe McEwing, a .190 hitter, who had
previously managed only two hits in 12 at-bats against Johnson,
produced the first double, rapped another in the fifth inning as
the climax of a 12-pitch confrontation, then heaped injury upon
insult in the seventh by smashing a home run.
</P>
<P>
   The home run, which cut the Mets' two-run deficit in half,
followed a 1-1 pitch that Johnson thought was a strike but Umpire
Tim Timmons called a ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you feel like you throw strikes, you want them to be
called,'' Johnson said, refusing to say anything more about the
call or link it to the ensuing development. Miller offered more of
an insight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when he doesn't get that pitch,'' the catcher said,
``he'll get a little bit more erratic instead of just saying, `OK,
it's a ball, I have to make a quality pitch right here.' When he
doesn't, he gets in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson struck out Derek Bell after McEwing connected, but then
Edgardo Alfonzo tied the score with another home run. ``Alfonzo's a
hitter that has a history against us,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first game of their division playoff series last October,
Alfonzo started Johnson on his way to a loss by whacking a
first-inning home run against him. After the Mets loaded the bases
against Johnson in the ninth inning of the 4-4 game, Alfonzo
crushed a grand slam against Bobby Chouinard.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo hit Sunday's home run on the second pitch Johnson threw
to him. In the first inning, he swung at the first pitch and
doubled just after Bell had done the same thing. Piazza hit his
monstrous home run on the third pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was surprising how they came out and swung the bat right
away,'' Miller said. ``I think their plan was to get him early,
before he got two strikes on them. They were swinging at a lot of
first pitches. If I was facing Randy Johnson, that's what I would
do. I'd swing early in the count.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had not discussed a plan, Piazza said, but they were
aware that some hitters had had success against Johnson by swinging
at an early pitch. If that word gets around, Johnson may become
permanently human. &QL;

COMMENTARY: GIULIANI'S CHANGE OF HEART 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The weather was miserable. A cold rain, whipped by
strong winds, had laced the city for the better part of two days.
Some of the reporters and politicians making their way to City Hall
on Friday had been soaked.
</P>
<P>
   The media crush was so great the press conference had to be held
in the Public Hearing Room, instead of the elegant and more
intimate Blue Room, where most mayoral press conferences are held.
</P>
<P>
   The 107th mayor of New York, looking nervous and weary, walked
into the hearing room a little before 4 p.m. and announced that he
would not run against Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   And then Rudolph Giuliani proceeded for the next half-hour to
present himself as some kind of suddenly changed man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen in life for reasons that sometimes you only
figure out afterwards,'' he said. ``And there is something good
that comes out of this. A lot of good things come out of it. I
think I understand myself a lot better. I think I understand what's
important to me better.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor tried in his inexperienced way to express a sense of
warmth and compassion. He seemed to say that he would like to
establish some bridge of understanding between himself and ethnic
minority groups in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people in the city have felt a big change, a great sense
of optimism,'' he said. ``They've gotten a lot of help and they've
gotten a lot of benefits, and they feel very differently. But it
hasn't reached everyone in this city. And there are a lot of people
who haven't felt that. And I'm going to dedicate myself to trying
to figure out how we can get them to feel that, too, including
maybe changes I have to make in the way I approach it, the way I
look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is going through a period of extended agony and most
New Yorkers feel he deserves a break and our best wishes. I hope he
defeats the cancer that threatens him and finds the personal
happiness he seeks.
</P>
<P>
   But with all due respect, he comes a little late to the table of
fair play and brotherhood. Too late.
</P>
<P>
   This instantaneous conversion from the man who wielded the whip
to the tender and ultrasensitive soul concerned about the blacks
and the downtrodden, the people without health insurance and those
who have to face the dark night of grave illness alone _ well, it's
a little tough to take seriously. This sudden abstract embrace of
all things humane is conveniently timed to cast a helpful glow on
Giuliani's image of himself as he does battle with his own grave
illness.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's all about him.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks that I've talked to over the past couple of days have
tended to point out rather dryly that it took an encounter with a
potentially fatal illness for the notion of empathy, compassion and
real fairness to even dawn on Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never cared about us,'' said Lucie Greene, a black woman
who lives on the East Side of Manhattan. ``His whole thing was to
show that he could discipline us. So let him get his treatment and
get on with his life. I don't wish him any more bad luck. But don't
try to sell me any stories about he cares about me, because he
doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's career, even more than most politicians, has been
about power and control. He ruled by fear, ruthlessly, and created
a carefully calculated image of powerhouse strength and
invulnerability. Most of the city and much of the nation bought
into that image.
</P>
<P>
   And then came the cancer diagnosis and the feelings of fear,
sadness and vulnerability that inevitably accompanied it. And it
turned out that Rudolph Giuliani was just a man, after all.
</P>
<P>
   He will be helped by the many good wishes of the ordinary people
of New York, which is to say, the kindness of strangers. The city
has always been kinder than he's ever been.
</P>
<P>
   No one is holding the mayor to his impulsive promises in his
hour of need. We've heard them before. On election night, 1997, in
the victory speech televised to the city, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do a better job of serving all of you. We have to
reach out to all of you. And if we haven't, I apologize. I'm sorry,
and it is my personal commitment that we will try, endlessly and
tirelessly, to bring all of you into the kind of success and
optimism we have in this room.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Maybe he meant it when he said it.

KOBE LEARNS TO PLAY IT COOL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO - Boxed into a corner, trapped on the baseline, with
somewhere between four and six arms criss-crossing in his face,
Kobe Bryant showed Saturday how much his game has evolved.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant was harassed repeatedly by multiple Portland defenders,
but he handled the double- and triple-teams with the finesse of a
veteran as the Lakers defeated the Trail Blazers to take a 1-0 lead
in the Western Conference Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the first time I ever faced a double-team that
aggressive on the post consistently,'' Bryant said Sunday. ``It was
fun. I enjoyed it, because it's another aspect of the game that I
want to master. And I want to learn, as far as double-teams, where
the double-teams are coming from, where your teammates should be,
that type of stuff. It's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time that such defensive pressure would prompt
Bryant into forced shots and bad decisions. But he committed just
one turnover in 38 minutes, and his patience was evident in his
shooting - 4 for 9 from the field - and his six assists.
</P>
<P>
   It was the deft passing of Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal that got
the Lakers' role players clicking in the second quarter, when the
Lakers outscored the Blazers 37-16. The bench, led by Robert
Horry's 12 points, scored 20 points in the period.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played well,'' O'Neal said of Bryant. ``We had orders to
get everybody else involved. Me and Kobe can't do it by ourselves.
... If everybody's scoring, and Kobe and I just get our average,
we'll be a hard team to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said he didn't mind the low-scoring day, but he did enjoy
the few occasions that Portland left 5-10 Damon Stoudamire to guard
him one-on-one. ``He can't guard me,'' Bryant shouted to fans
sitting courtside after Stoudamire fouled him late in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves the Blazers with difficult decisions to make
heading into Game 2 tonight: continue doubling both Bryant and
O'Neal and watch Horry and Rick Fox shoot 3-pointers, let
Stoudamire handle Bryant solo or perhaps move Scottie Pippen onto
Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be kind of difficult, because their biggest
strength is having Scottie roam the field, especially with this
offense and with this system,'' Bryant said. ``They like to have
him disrupt things, so either way they're going to be giving us
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson said the Blazers' wealth of tall, athletic
players allows them to double-team two players at once, but said,
``We think we can survive that. We've handled it a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Still hacked: Portland's failed hack-a-Shaq tactics put O'Neal
at the foul line for 25 fourth-quarter attempts, but O'Neal said
he's not concerned about a Game 2 encore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even worried about other people's strategic
planning,'' he said. ``We just have to go out and play our game.
... You know, if they want to play against the odds, the odds
haven't worked all year. So I don't think they're going to work
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Was Portland coach Mike Dunleavy perhaps trying to psyche out
O'Neal for the series?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't mess with my mind. Impossible,'' he said. ``I think
they're just paying homage to my game. That's all. Just call me the
Big Homage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into the back-and-forth thing'' with
Dunleavy, O'Neal said. ``I'm not going to get into the
confrontations. ... I remember the old days when it was blood and
blood, sweat for sweat. That's the kind of basketball I like. All
this strategic Internet planning, playing the odds and playing the
lottery, that does not work.''
</P>
<P>
   He also took another shot at Portland center Arvydas Sabonis,
who failed to keep O'Neal (41 points) in check and went scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's a shame that a 7-foot-3 guy can't play a 7-
foot-1 guy one-on-one. That's a shame,'' he said.

REFERENDUM ON 2-PARTY PLAN IN ITALY FIZZLES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ An ambitious referendum aimed at reducing the instability
in Italy's electoral system was invalidated Sunday night because
too few Italians turned out for the vote to be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 32 percent of voters cast ballots Sunday, far less
than the 50.1 percent needed. The referendum was supposed to make
Italians decide seven questions, covering a broad range of
political, economic and social issues.
</P>
<P>
   But the most contested item was an effort to move Italy closer
to a two-party system by ridding it of the parliamentary seats that
are allotted proportionally. That measure, fiercely opposed by
small parties who feared that they would be wiped out in the new
system, was also opposed by Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the
center-right party Forza Italia. An exit poll by the Abacus agency
showed that 82 percent of the people who did vote wanted to get rid
of the old system.
</P>
<P>
   The low turnout was a blow to the embattled government of
Giuliano Amato, which had hoped that a favorable vote would give it
strong public backing for electoral reforms that previous
center-left governments had not been able to pass in the badly
divided Italian Parliament. A similar referendum on changing the
electoral system narrowly failed to draw the necessary voter
turnout last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year the government passed a decree to purge electoral
lists of deceased voters and some nonresidents, hoping that would
make it easier. Even Sophia Loren, who does not reside in Italy,
was removed from the lists of her native town of Potzzuoli, near
Naples. After the voter rolls were cleaned up, just over 49 million
Italians were registered.
</P>
<P>
   But the failure to win voter approval for a change in the
electoral system means that it is likely that Italy's political
instability will continue. The current center-left coalition is
Italy's 58th government since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The low turnout was a short-term political victory for
Berlusconi, who leads the center-right opposition and is already
campaigning to become prime minister in the next election. But the
current system, which often forces the ruling majority to make
ill-matched alliances with small parties that can easily balk and
bring down a government, has inherent problems for any candidate.
Berlusconi was prime minister in 1994 for less than a year, but
lost office when a coalition partner defected and forced his
center-right government to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The low turnout did not necessarily mean that most Italians
favor their current electoral system or disagree with the
referendum's other questions, like whether to loosen laws
protecting employees from dismissal, or whether prosecutors can
also serve as trial judges.
</P>
<P>
   The low attendance mainly reflected most Italians' disgust with
politics as usual and widespread referendum fatigue. Voters have
been summoned to vote in referendums seven times since 1990. The
measure, once reserved for weighty social matters like abolishing
the monarchy in 1946, or legalizing divorce in 1974, became a kind
of political crutch for settling issues that Parliament was unable
to resolve. (In 1990, a referendum on hunting regulations and the
use of pesticides also failed to draw enough voters.)
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are coming to vote are very confused, the issues
are so diverse and complicated,'' said Laura Bianchi, 43, after she
voted in Rome. She said that with Italy's chronic revolving
governments, ``the legislatures are so short that they can't pass
any laws.''

SPORTS COLUMN: TRIPLE CROWN DREAM DIES AS RIVALRY IS BORN  

</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Well, he is no Secretariat. And, at least for the
moment, he is not even Red Bullet.
</P>
<P>
   In something less than two minutes, Fusaichi Pegasus fell from
his pedestal on Saturday when Red Bullet outran him in the
homestretch of the 125th Preakness and, just like that, racing lost
its chance that the &QC; $4 million flying horse would continue flying
toward the Triple Crown. Racing people had joined the public in
almost conceding the crown to Fusaichi Pegasus, acclaiming him as a
superhorse, hailing him as the horse who would rescue the sport
from its steep decline.
</P>
<P>
   But if this is the end of the dream, it is likely the start of a
new rivalry that may achieve the same goals. Fusaichi Pegasus and
Red Bullet, first and second in the Wood Memorial in April, second
and first in the Preakness in May. Both were destined for New York,
where the Belmont Stakes will be run on June 10, and will most
likely meet again, perhaps then and there.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Orseno, who trains Red Bullet for Frank Stronach of Austria
and Canada, put his horse on a van for New York Sunday and said,
``They will be facing each other again.'' And Neil Drysdale, who
trains Fusaichi Pegasus for Fusao Sekiguchi of Tokyo, said that his
horse would ``temporarily go to New York on Monday morning, and he
seems suited to the Belmont because he's a big, long-striding
horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Racing can mourn its beaten favorite after the Preakness, but
two horses may still turn out to be better than one. Affirmed and
Alydar. Easy Goer and Sunday Silence. You play the hand that is
dealt, and right now fate has dealt two aces with dramatic
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Racing has waited 22 years for a horse who could withstand the
rigors of winning the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont
in five weeks' time. In each of the last three years, it looked
imminent. But Silver Charm, Real Quiet and Charismatic all were
thwarted in the final yards of a race that took them a mile and a
half. And since Pegasus captured the Derby with classical power and
a kind of majesty, racing sensed that the superhorse had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he has. But as Stronach put it, ``Horses are not
machines.''
</P>
<P>
   How did it happen? You can find four elements to the equation,
starting with the fact that Fusaichi Pegasus ran in the Kentucky
Derby two weeks ago and Red Bullet did not.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when they did meet, they raced on a heavy track that
Drysdale described as greasy. Still, as Orseno said, ``We all had
to run over it.'' But that is where the fresh horse had the edge.
Red Bullet had been biding his time for five weeks since the Wood.
And even superhorses may lose a step along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the gate opened for the Preakness, the favorite was
squeezed between the horses alongside him and lost some momentum.
Drysdale does not use that as an excuse. In fact, after flying to
Hollywood Park overnight, he said by telephone this morning: ``He
pulled up well after the race and was quite bright and playing in
the test barn. He wasn't tired. He came up with a tiny cut under a
knee, which indicates he got hit by some horse. But that didn't
really mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, most of the credit has to go to Red Bullet, who got
hooked into a duel with Fusaichi Pegasus in the homestretch and
simply outran him by three and three-quarter lengths. Red Bullet
was a legitimate challenger, too, despite his four-length loss in
the Wood. Since then, he had been training sensationally at
Pimlico. And in the Preakness, he had the extra advantage of having
Jerry Bailey on his back, providing a flawless ride and making sure
that Red Bullet would not beat himself.
</P>
<P>
   The other members of the cast are generally tossing in the
towel. High Yield has made 14 starts, and shows it: 15th in the
Derby, 7th in the Preakness. His trainer, D.Wayne Lukas, said he
would look through his deep stable for another Belmont horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably Commendable,'' he said. ``He's a fresh horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve, eighth in the Derby and fourth in the Preakness,
was headed home to California with Snuck In and Hugh Hefner. Cash
Asmussen, the rider on Snuck In, said, ``When Red Bullet went by
us, it was like, whoosh.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal's Hope tired badly to finish 8th and last after running 16th
in the Derby. ``He hasn't done any good since we left Florida,''
said Harold Rose, his 88-year-old owner and trainer.
</P>
<P>
   But Impeachment, third in the Derby and third in the Preakness,
was booked into the Belmont. Also listed as probable candidates
were seven horses who did not run in the Preakness, namely
Aptitude, Wheelaway, Tahkoda Hills, Unshaded, Chief Seattle, Curule
and Globalize.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest ones were the horses who dueled down the stretch
in the Preakness: Red Bullet and Fusaichi Pegasus. And the best is
yet to come. &QL;

   MIAMI _ The players from both teams dispersed after a tense
timeout, but a frantic Coach Jeff Van Gundy was still standing on
the court, cupping his hands and directing the Knicks until the
official Dick Bavetta raked him back toward the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   There were just 12.4 seconds on the clock, and all his team
needed was one last defensive stop to leave the Miami Heat in
pieces once again. Van Gundy wanted the choreography to be perfect.
As the next 10.3 seconds unfolded inside the queasy air of American
Airlines Arena, he watched as the ball went to Alonzo Mourning,
but, on cue, Patrick Ewing and Larry Johnson sealed him off like
gates at a railroad crossing.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't going to let Mourning end their season. Anyone but
him. So Mourning had to pass, found an open Jamal Mashburn, but too
timid to shoot, he ditched the ball to Clarence Weatherspoon. A
reserve, a misfit on a Miami Heat team filled with them, was forced
to take the Heat's last shot of the deciding Game 7 and final shot
of their season.
</P>
<P>
   Weatherspoon's jumper in the lane arched over the wingspan of
Marcus Camby and fell horribly off the rim. As the loose ball
bounded away, Latrell Sprewell darted between two Heat players and
hugged the ball as his feet danced dangerously near the baseline
with 2.1 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   For an instant, there was confusion. Had Sprewell called a
timeout? Had he stepped out of bounds? At first, the official
Bennett Salvatore rewarded the ball to the Heat. A conference took
place, Bavetta overruled Salvatore, and the ball went back to the
Knicks as another tortured grimace registered on Heat Coach Pat
Riley's face.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, it was over. Charlie Ward inbounded the ball to
Chris Childs. Then the confident bit player, who emerged as the
Knicks' stars vanished Sunday, hoisted the ball into the rafters
before the Heat could foul him. In another addition to the lore of
this rivalry, the Knicks eliminated the Heat on Miami's home court
for the third year in a row, 83-82, and advanced to the Eastern
Conference finals to play the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   `'I don't think you're surprised by how a game goes,'' Van Gundy
said. `'It came down to a last possession and Sprewell's rebound.
We feel very proud of our accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat players didn't want to leave the floor. As cups and
plastic noisemakers pelted the court, Tim Hardaway was barking at
the officiating crew, as Mashburn was in the ear of Bavetta while
security led the referees away.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why they call him `Knick Bavetta,''' a wounded Hardaway
said. `'It's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't have to come down to the officials. In the end, the
Heat weren't as mentally strong as the Knicks. They couldn't come
up with an X factor like Childs, who scored the Knicks first 10
points of the fourth quarter to keep his team in the game. They
couldn't find a way to get the ball to Mourning, who scored 29
points but couldn't get off a shot in the last 5 minutes of the
game. They couldn't capitalize on their chances at the free-throw
line, where the Heat missed 5 of 7 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks kept themselves together because Childs wouldn't let
his team fall apart. All around him, he saw his teammates
disappear. A limping Allan Houston (2 for 10) was only a decoy on
the floor. A hot Sprewell scored 20 in the first half but made just
1 of 8 shots in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   `'I just kept attacking,'' Childs said. `'I was just trying to
make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He did just that near the 9-minute mark of the fourth quarter.
With the Heat ahead, 71-68, Childs seized on the misstep Anthony
Carter made on his dribble, stripped the ball from him and then
raced down the floor and connected on a fastbreak layup that drew a
foul and created a 3-point play.
</P>
<P>
   The lead for the Heat was 6 points again when Childs penetrated
again and drew a foul with 4 minutes left. Coolly he hit both free
throws. At this point, he had scored the Knicks only 10 points of
the fourth quarter. Help would come soon. Ewing began asserting
himself. With 1:20 left in the game, Mourning darted toward Ewing
for a steal. Ewing sidestepped his Georgetown protege and went in
for a dunk that gave the Knicks a 83-82 lead. That's how it stood
with 12.4 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   `'At that point, it was all about getting the ball out of
Mourning's hands,'' Van Gundy said. `'We were willing to live with
any other shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat have to live with another devastating outcome, one that
ended on a wild last possession and controversial call.
</P>
<P>
   `'I have Sprewell calling timeout but I wasn't sure if his foot
was out,'' Salvatore said after the game. `'I didn't believe he was
out of bounds but I wanted to check with my partner. He was not out
when my whistle blew. He confirmed that there was no question that
the timeout came before he went out of bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for one thing. Sprewell said after the game that he never
called a timeout. Was it a phantom voice? Whatever it was, it will
haunt the Heat through another season filled with Knicks demons.
But a somber Riley did not use the officials as an excuse. He cited
all the missed opportunities, instead. In the end, the Heat just
could not come up with the kind of miracles that have worked so
well for the Knicks over the span of this playoff rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   `'You have to wonder what will happen to them,'' said Marcus
Camby who helped give the Knicks a, 46-43 rebounding edge with 13
boards. `'Riley might break it up. But as long as he is the coach
here, it will always be an intense rivalry. This was something,
wasn't it?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It had become a race about celebrity and personality: Hillary
Rodham Clinton attacking New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as harsh
and temperamentally unsuited for a place in the U.S. Senate, and
Giuliani portraying Clinton as opportunistic and untrustworthy,
unsuited to represent New Yorkers in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But as Clinton and her new opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio of Suffolk
County, set out across New York Sunday, laying out their divergent
ideologies and themes, it was clear that the new candidate lineup
had prompted the first lady, and to a lesser extent the
Republicans, to retool their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   This has become a contest that is slightly less about who the
participants are, and slightly more about what they stand for. And
it is a development that appears to be welcomed by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   In the old lineup, Clinton had sought to attack Giuliani on both
his temperament and his ideology. But she kept returning to his
jagged personality, in no small part because depicting the moderate
mayor as too conservative was ``a stretch,'' as one of her advisers
conceded Sunday with a sudden candor that surfaced with Giuliani's
exit from the race.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has now flipped. Attacking the temperament of
Lazio _ with his Boy Scout grin and telegenic good looks _ seems
even more improbable than attacking Giuliani as hard-right
conservative. But Lazio stands to the right of Giuliani, which
means that Clinton may now be able to draw on the ideological
differences with Lazio that had proved so elusive with Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``We no longer have the hard-edged personality to pivot off,''
one of Clinton's senior advisers said Sunday. ``Now we really are,
in a large measure, in a campaign of issues. I think that issues
and ideology are going to play more importantly going forward than
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if Giuliani at times sought to resist Clinton's attempt
to draw ideological distinctions between them, Lazio seemed Sunday
to be encouraging them, in the calculation that he would benefit
from the contrast more than Clinton. At every turn, he belittled
his new opponent as a liberal, reprising the play book that
Republicans have used in every state election in New York and
throughout the country for the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, one of Lazio's advisers said, the new
candidate, who won the formal endorsement of the state Republican
chairman, William D. Powers, Sunday, will carry on with some of the
more personality-driven attacks that Giuliani offered. In an
interview on Sunday, for example, he described Clinton as an
opportunist, and he has repeatedly labeled her a carpetbagger, a
line of attack that his aides said would be central to his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While a series of polls has suggested that the issue of
Clinton's new residency has receded in the minds of many New
Yorkers, it is the kind of topic, one of Lazio's advisers said,
that could help the Republicans paint Clinton as ``not one of us,''
to use the shorthand favored by consultants. One Republican
suggested that that could prove easier for the easygoing Lazio than
for the hard-driven Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani was the opponent, there was some disagreement
among Clinton's advisers about the extent to which they should go
after the mayor's personality rather than his ideology, because the
two held such similar views. The question now, one aide said, is
determining how aggressively Clinton should move to show Lazio as
ideologically extreme.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Clinton's advisers were described as divided
Sunday night over whether they should quickly wheel out television
advertisements attacking Lazio's positions, in particular his
support for much of Newt Gingrich's ``Contract With America'' in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   To date, it has been Clinton's surrogates (Sunday, it was her
press secretary, Howard Wolfson, on ``Meet the Press'' on NBC)
rather than the candidate who has carried the attack, reflecting
the concern among Clinton's advisers that she remains too
polarizing a figure to carry out the assaults herself.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it was Clinton's aides who first attacked Lazio, a
point that Lazio made over the last two days. Still, Clinton
presented herself as something of the victim in an appearance in
Albany, the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little disappointed yesterday that my latest opponent
has already started hurling insults instead of offering ideas about
what we can do to improve the lives of New Yorkers,'' she said. ``I
am sorry that my opponent couldn't even get through his
announcement speech without going on the attack.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ In the Miami Heat's defining moment Sunday, a reserve
took the pivotal shot. And then, with the game to the Knicks
freshly lost _ and the Heat's season suddenly in ashes _ one of its
most frustrated players ran after a referee, berating him.
</P>
<P>
   With the Heat losing, 83-82, in the fading seconds at American
Airlines Arena, it was left to the backup small forward Clarence
Weatherspoon to decide the game. His high-arcing 12-foot jump shot
hit off the side of the rim and signaled an end to Miami's season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm driving the ball and I'm seeing 4 seconds on the clock,''
said Weatherspoon, in the game because the starter P.J. Brown had
fouled out. ``Who else you throw it to? I wanted us to have a
chance of rebounding the ball, and I didn't want the clock to run
out.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened after the defeat showed the depth of Miami's
despair. Small forward Jamal Mashburn, who thought the officiating
likely cost Miami this victory so crucial to its psyche, cornered
one of the game referees.
</P>
<P>
   What did he say?
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them they stink,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mashburn thought in particular that a foul should have been
called on a drive to the basket he made with two and a half minutes
to play and the score tied at 79.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was contact,'' he said. ``If you're going to let us
play, let us play throughout the whole game. Don't sway one way or
another. Be consistent with it. I don't think they were very
consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Mashburn, who had largely exorcised the demons of his previous
failures against the Knicks with his play in this series, had a
nightmarish game to carry into the offseason. He made just 3 of 15
field-goal attempts, shot no free throws and had 2 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   In the game's final 7 minutes 42 seconds, he had the ball last
on a shot-clock violation, launched an out-of-control shot with the
Heat up by 4 points, missed on the drive in which he thought he was
fouled and misfired on a medium-range jump shot with the Heat
trailing by a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't win and I didn't make the shots,'' he said,
blanching at the idea that his play through the stretch might have
been a liability. ``If you want to put that on me, that's cool.
That's fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mashburn said there was a feeling of shock in the locker room.
This was the third straight season that the Knicks have eliminated
the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for the people in this locker room,'' he said.
``I feel their pain. Everybody had a little tear in their eye or
something, Coach was pretty broken up.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that no one realizes what a work schedule the Heat
submitted to in order to have a chance at National Basketball
Association title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a lot of work into it _ a whole lot more than any other
NBA team will ever even think about,'' he said, his head now up and
defiant.
</P>
<P>
   About then, someone asked him whether he thought the NBA's
hierarchy had ordained a Knicks-Los Angeles Lakers final to capture
television ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if they are going to do that, then they need to send us
a memo before the season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Around the locker room, the Heat echoed Mashburn's sentiment
about inconsistent refereeing. Center Alonzo Mourning thought a
chintzy ``touch foul on the perimeter'' had been allowed to settled
Game 6, and that Mashburn had clearly been fouled late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Tim Hardaway even called for a league investigation
into the officiating, before abruptly ending his post-game
critique.
</P>
<P>
   Heat Coach Pat Riley was a little more contrite, but not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have won in spite of it,'' he said. ``There were
four fouls where our players just played hard. This is a very
difficult loss for my team to take _ we were at home. With as much
as we were attacked going to the basket, there was a disparity in
the foul calling. It is hard to lose that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning thought the officials plainly erred after
Weatherspoon's missed field-goal attempt with 2.1 seconds left. The
Knicks' Latrell Sprewell retrieved the rebound and was granted a
timeout. Mourning complained, to no avail, that Sprewell never
requested it and, in fact, stepped out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the better team,'' Mourning said. ``No one will be
able to convince me otherwise. But sometimes things happen. It's
tough to take.''

THALIDOMIDE'S ANTI-CANCER USE IS SUPPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Ark., N.J., Ill.)   By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The early promise of thalidomide as an anti-cancer
drug apparently is holding up, according to findings disclosed
Sunday at the meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
</P>
<P>
   Thalidomide is the sedative that was banned worldwide after it
maimed thousands of babies in the 1960s, mostly in Europe, Canada
and Japan, when their mothers took it for morning sickness. Now
thalidomide is being resurrected as part of the treatment for AIDS,
leprosy and some types of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Dr. Bart Barlogie, an oncologist at the University of
Arkansas, reported that thalidomide could slow the course of
multiple myeloma among people who had failed to respond to standard
therapy. Multiple myeloma is a deadly cancer that damages the bone
marrow and other organs.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Barlogie told the meeting that his team had confirmed
and extended the findings that thalidomide was effective and could
be used safely with chemotherapy in a larger group of people with
advanced multiple myeloma in the same study.
</P>
<P>
   Barlogie described the findings as ``stunning'' at the meeting,
which has drawn more than 20,000 cancer specialists from more than
100 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Barlogie said thalidomide appeared to be the first new drug in
three decades that had a beneficial effect on multiple myeloma.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings involve 169 patients, nearly double the 89
cases that the Arkansas team reported on in the New England Journal
of Medicine last year. All patients had received stem-cell
transplants; about half had failed to respond to other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Response to thalidomide, however, often occurred rapidly in
these patients. After 25 months of thalidomide and other
chemotherapy, overall survival was 45 percent, and about 10 percent
have not had a significant relapse, Barlogie said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he could not compare these figures with other treatments
because a clinical trial of therapy in advanced multiple myeloma
among patients who had had stem-cell transplants had not been done
previously. ``An educated guess'' was that most patients would have
died in six months without thalidomide, Barlogie said.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists have reported similar findings in studies
involving about 800 patients with advanced multiple myeloma,
Barlogie said.
</P>
<P>
   Because thalidomide ``is working impressively,'' Barlogie said
his team has begun a new set of studies in the last part of the
standard three-stage system used to determine the effectiveness and
safety of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   These studies, which are expected to involve about 500 patients,
are aimed at answering two questions. One is whether thalidomide
would be effective as part of the therapy in newly diagnosed cases
of multiple myeloma. The other is whether thalidomide would be
effective if used alone in multiple myeloma.
</P>
<P>
   Thalidomide's limited success is a mystery. Although the drug is
believed to block growth of blood vessels, this action does not
appear to explain its effect in multiple myeloma.
</P>
<P>
   Every year about 14,000 Americans develop multiple myeloma. The
cancer can lead to bone pain, anemia and kidney failure. Because it
also damages the immune system, it can lead to recurrent
infections.
</P>
<P>
   Malignant myeloma cells produce a protein in the blood that is
reduced among patients responding to thalidomide therapy.
Thalidomide also makes the bone marrow more normal. These findings
raise the possibility that thalidomide has a potent effect on the
immune system or may even kill myeloma cells directly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Food and Drug Administration approved thalidomide
for the first time, for treatment of leprosy. The drug is marketed
by Celgene Corp. of Warren, N.J.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a different study discussed at the meeting Sunday, Dr. Monica
Morrow of Northwestern University in Chicago reported that survival
rates among women with breast cancer varied with the number of
women that hospitals treated each year.
</P>
<P>
   Survival rates were better among patients at hospitals that
cared for more than 25 cases a year, according to the study that
Morrow led for the American College of Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   In the study of 175,879 women treated at 1,404 hospitals, across
the United States, 509, or 39 percent, of the hospitals treated
fewer than 25 breast cancer patients a year. Survival rates at
hospitals that treated fewer than 25 breast cancer patients were 18
percent less than at hospitals that performed a larger volume of
breast cancer care.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow attributed the difference to systems of care at
high-volume hospitals, which have teams of specialists, rather than
the quality of doctors at small-volume hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, speed of referrals through a hospital
system or overall coordination of care may be important factors.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow's team did not examine the competence of the doctors in
the study. But she said, ``It would be a serious mistake to
interpret this data as saying that the whole explanation was
physician quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrow said that earlier studies had found a correlation between
survival after surgery for cancer of the pancreas and esophagus and
the number of such procedures performed each year. Similar
correlations have been found in some heart surgeries.

BARAK SUSPENDS PEACE TALKS WITH PALESTINIANS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak suspended peace talks with
the Palestinians Sunday, ordering his negotiators home from
Stockholm amid continued violent demonstrations in the West Bank
and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   A 2-year-old Israeli girl was on life-support Sunday after being
critically burned late Saturday when Palestinians hurled firebombs
at her family's car in Palestinian-ruled Jericho, where a casino
often draws Israeli patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's move raised fears that the peace process could be
derailed just as the two sides are engaged in multiple negotiating
tracks in an attempt to come up with the frequently delayed final
peace agreement by the new deadline of Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's spokesman said in a statement that Barak
recalled Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and lawyer Gilad
Sher, who have been conducting a second track of negotiations in
Stockholm with Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had already canceled a trip to Washington to meet with
President Clinton, citing the ongoing clashes between Palestinians
and Israeli soldiers and the upsurge in fighting in south Lebanon,
which is taking place just a month before Israel's planned
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   He also barred Israelis and foreign tourists Sunday from
entering the Palestinian-ruled areas.
</P>
<P>
   The recall of the negotiators was condemned by the Palestinian
Authority, which now controls some 40 percent of the West Bank and
most of Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   One Palestinian official said Barak's decision was an attempt to
cover up the fact that negotiations were not going anywhere. The
two sides are negotiating over how much more land the Palestinians
should have for an independent state, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like these negotiations didn't achieve anything, and
Barak is using the incident as a pretext for bringing the
negotiations to an end,'' said Yasser Abed Rabbo, the Minister of
Information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any connection between the incidents in
the West Bank and Barak's decision,'' said Abed Rabbo, who this
month resigned from a different negotiating team, saying he had not
been informed about the talks in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Six Palestinians have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded in
the violence that escalated sharply on May 15, the annual
Palestinian day of mourning marking Israel's creation in 1948, when
hundreds of thousands of Palestinians either fled or were forced
from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Some 40 Israeli soldiers have been wounded, including one
seriously, in the clashes that last week spun out of control when
Palestinian police and Israeli soldiers shot at each other with
live ammunition. Twenty-two Israeli civilians have also been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The West Bank and Gaza have since been rocked by pockets of
violence between Palestinians hurling stones and Israeli soldiers
firing tear gas and rubber-coated metal pellets, but there has been
no repeat of the large-scale gunbattles that erupted last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But while the demonstrations have grown smaller, they continue
to reflect long-simmering Palestinian anger over the slow-moving
peace process and Israel's refusal to release more Palestinian
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   While some Israeli officials have charged that Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat may have lost control of the demonstrators,
the clashes have given Arafat an important boost in popularity just
as criticism was growing, Palestinian political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the violence could not have come at a worse time for
Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations began the day Barak's Cabinet narrowly
approved transferring three Jerusalem suburbs to full Palestinian
rule, a move that has mixed support from the public but has been
promoted by Barak as an important step in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Since the vote Barak has been fighting to keep his coalition
government intact. Two coalition partners, one representing Jewish
settlers in the West Bank and Gaza and the other Russian
immigrants, have threatened to withdraw when the land is handed
over.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said he will delay handing over the three suburbs of
Jerusalem until the Palestinian Authority reins in the
demonstrators, some of whom are said to be part of an opposition
group within Arafat's Fatah party.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the clashes, coupled with the increased violence in south
Lebanon, including Hezbollah rocket attacks on Israel's northern
border over the past few days, have led to complaints from some
Israelis that Barak is making concessions and getting only violence
in return.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a sign that Arafat may be trying to limit further
violence, his Fatah party Sunday called for five days of peaceful
protests on behalf of the 1,650 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians say that Israel should release the prisoners,
particularly those who committed violent acts before the 1993 peace
accord was signed. Israel has released some as part of the peace
process but said most should serve out their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The Fatah decision to organize new protests was clearly designed
to get the demonstrations back under control and reduce the tension
that has gripped both Israelis and Palestinians since clashes
began.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians stage demonstrations to remind Israelis why
they should withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza, while Barak's
hesitation over transferring more land is a reminder to Arafat that
Israel is not free to give in to all demands, one Israeli analyst
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In each case the leadership is showing that it is not coming
to the negotiating table with absolute freedom, that it has limited
powers,'' said political analyst Yaron Ezrachi.

JOHNSON IS NO MATCH FOR METS' MCEWING 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joe McEwing is one foot shorter than Randy Johnson,
the 6-foot-10-inch pitcher who Bobby Valentine said looks 8 feet
tall while he is lurking menacingly on the mound. When you see
Johnson at a baseball game, you figure he is a powerful athlete.
When you see McEwing, you feel like asking for two with mustard.
McEwing would probably fetch the hot dogs, too.
</P>
<P>
   But there was McEwing talking softly and ever so humbly about
conquering Johnson and helping the Mets burst past the Arizona
Diamondbacks, 7-6, to complete the three-game sweep at Shea Stadium
Sunday. Derek Bell lined a single off Byung-Hyun Kim in the ninth
inning that enabled McEwing to hustle in from second base with the
winning run and complete his own extraordinary day in style.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, Johnson had dominated the National League with his
ferocious fastball and an intimidating disposition. Until 10 days
ago, McEwing was playing, but hardly dominating, with Class AAA
Norfolk in the International League. But on a raw, rainy day,
McEwing, the 28-year-old who is called Super Joe by his teammates,
aggravated the Diamondbacks with a home run, two doubles, a walk, a
crucial stolen base and three runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the ultimate challenge for us to face a guy like
him,'' McEwing said of Johnson. ``As professionals, that's what we
strive for. We went out and battled all day. We came from behind
four times and didn't give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Valentine mused that at least one person surely
speculated that the game was over when the Diamondbacks went ahead,
1-0, in the first inning. But the Mets opened up with three
consecutive doubles off Johnson to erase the first of three
deficits against him. Johnson gave up five earned runs on three
homers and five doubles in six and two-thirds innings, as many
earned runs as he had allowed in his previous six starts over 472/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets struck out 13 times against Johnson, including one
stretch in which he fanned 11 of 14 batters. But the Mets pelted
Johnson by being aggressive, by trying to avoid two-strike counts
in which he could unleash his slider and by viewing the reigning Cy
Young award winner as a mortal pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just showed that none of our guys played that game before
it started,'' Valentine said. ``They came out and had a little
determined look in their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes after the victory, McEwing still had his cap
pulled tight over his brow while he did a radio interview. There
were bloodstains on the right knee of his white uniform pants and
dirt stains splashed across the backside. McEwing, who had his
first major league hit off Johnson while with the St. Louis
Cardinals last season and who is now 5 for 16 off the left-hander,
looked like a kid who had been frolicking in a puddle. That is how
he wants to look.
</P>
<P>
   McEwing started the first rally with a double, he finished a
memorable 12-pitch at-bat that featured seven two-strike fouls with
another double, he lined a homer to spark another rally and he
began the winning rally with a walk on a 3-2 pitch. In five times
at bat, McEwing, the leadoff hitter, squeezed 34 pitches out of
Johnson and Kim.
</P>
<P>
   ``For what he lacks in pure size and ability, he makes up with
his gutsy play,'' Mike Piazza said. ``He's fun to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   After McEwing, Bell and Edgardo Alfonzo doubled on three
straight pitches in the first inning to put the Mets ahead, 2-1,
Arizona clipped Rick Reed for two runs in the third to make it,
3-2. But Piazza belted a majestic homer, estimated at 492 feet,
into the left-field mezzanine section to even the score.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Lee's two-run homer off Reed in the sixth gave Arizona a
5-3 lead, the third time the Mets trailed Johnson. No problem, the
Mets thought. McEwing lumbered to the plate an inning later,
holding his bat high above his shoulders and hammered a fastball
over the left-field fence. Alfonzo went deep one batter later to
tie the score, 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley homered off Dennis Cook in the eighth to push
Arizona ahead, 6-5, but once again the Mets displayed resilience.
Robin Ventura, who did not start for the second straight game
because of a strained left thigh muscle, was healthy enough to
smack a pinch-hit homer off Mike Morgan and tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth game drifted to the ninth, and it was a nice
omen for the Mets when McEwing led off the inning. McEwing walked
against the submarine-throwing Kim and quickly stole second. He
scored the decisive run when a diving Lee missed snaring Bell's
liner to right by a few inches. The Mets sprinted out of the dugout
to mob Bell and McEwing, who, fittingly, was the last player to
leave the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very humble person, so I'm not going to brag about
myself, but I'm also a confident person and I believe in my
abilities,'' McEwing said. ``You just got to go out and battle.
That's what I do every day. I play hard.''

HAITIAN ELECTION INITIALLY HAILED AS A SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ In an election marked by long lines,
disorganized poll workers, and voters possessing reservoirs of
patience, Haiti's landmark vote Sunday went off without reports of
major trouble, an apparently successful step toward rebuilding the
destitute nation.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, in direct contrast to elections held over the last 13
years of topsy-turvy democracy, was notable for its absence of
fear. It was social, and it also was miserable for those waiting
five, six, seven hours in the sun. But for many, voting was their
duty. For some, it was pure joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I scored!'' yelled a young woman as she danced out of a voting
place in Leogane, about 20 miles south of the capital, known for
its boatbuilders who helped launch thousands of desperate
boatpeople toward America in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted!'' she shouted. ``For the first time!''
</P>
<P>
   The long-delayed elections will fill Haiti's now-vacant
parliament seats as well as an astounding 7,300 local offices. The
ballots _ some of them being carried by donkey over roadless hills
and mountains _ aren't expected to be tallied for a week or two, or
three.
</P>
<P>
   The seating of a parliament alone carries major benefits for
Haiti, which has been without a legislature for 17 months and
without a truly functioning government for more than three years.
Once a parliament is sworn in this summer, about $500 million in
frozen international assistance becomes available. After scheduled
presidential elections in November, more donor aid is expected.
</P>
<P>
   For the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, one with
illiteracy long stuck at 80 percent, Sunday's vote was seen as a
possible turning point to end its relentless downward political and
economic spiral.
</P>
<P>
   With only incomplete reports coming in to Port-au-Prince, the
vote wasn't free of crisis. In Croix des Bouquets, a supporter of
an arrested candidate shot and wounded a policeman, who returned
fire and killed him, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In two southern areas of Grand-Anse and Nippes, elections were
postponed late Saturday because of poor preparation, frustrating
335,000 registered voters, or about 8 percent of the electorate.
And in voting centers throughout the country, thousands of polls
opened several hours late _ including the center where former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide cast his vote. Polls were kept
open an extra hour because of the late start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, overall, it's looking quite positive so far,'' said
Mary Durran, spokesperson for the Organization of American States'
210-member electoral observer mission. She ticked off a list of
problems, including the late poll openings, disorganized poll
workers, some violations of secrecy of the vote, and crowd control
problems in Port-au-Prince, Gonaives and Cap Haitien.
</P>
<P>
   Representative William Delahunt, a Quincy Democrat who was part
of a congressional delegation here, said, however, the most
surprising and encouraging part was the calm mood and high turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary estimates from international observers put the
turnout in the capital _ where intimidation and despair had kept
most voters at home in previous elections _ at 40 to 60 percent,
and as high as 80 percent in many northeastern towns.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt said that election officials should move quickly to
reschedule the postponed vote in the two southern areas. He also
foresaw potential difficulties with the compilation of the
balloting, given the massive undertaking _ 11,000 voting stations
and 29,000 candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``To borrow someone's line, I'd call these free, fair and flawed
elections,'' Delahunt said.
</P>
<P>
   At polling center No. 9711 in Port-au-Prince's Fontemara
section, a group of young men waited five hours to vote _ and then
didn't want to leave afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at us,'' said Jean Jean-Robert, 33, who sells medicine in
the streets. ``The fact that in 1987 nobody was able to hang around
a polling station because we feared getting shot, and that we are
staying here today, shows that things are much better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was worth staying in line for five hours,'' said Olivier
Bonnet, 26, who is studying to be an electrician. ``We know where
we came from. We know where we want to go. And without this vote,
we can't get there.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Port-au-Prince school where gunmen killed about 20 people
lined up to vote in 1987, Metilhomme Alexis, 56, also drew upon the
past to explain why he was voting. He had arrived at 6 a.m., the
official time to begin voting. Voting didn't begin until after 8
a.m., but Alexis didn't complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the massacre in 1987, I was watching from across the
street. I saw a jeep drive in. It was a jeep of death. These guys
with guns jumped out and started shooting at us. We escaped,'' he
said. ``I have no fear whatsoever today. If we didn't vote, I see
nothing happening in this country. I see no escape.''
</P>
<P>
   The day wasn't without its frustrations, small and large. When a
polling station finally opened at the National Theater in the
capital at 7:57 a.m., security officials opened a metal gate and
hundreds tried to shove their way in, causing screaming and pushing
for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In Leogone, moments after the young woman publicly expressed her
happiness, an opposition party leader screamed his displeasure
inside the voting place. Jean Marie Mariel said election officials
unfairly kicked out a representative of the opposition Espace party
because he didn't have the right stamp on his documents.
</P>
<P>
   And in a tiny schoolroom-turned-polling place in Grecier, south
of the capital, one man began telling his wife how to vote. ``Stop
that!'' said one election official.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make a mess here,'' the man said. ``I'll blow this place
up!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Want us to call the police?'' said the official.
</P>
<P>
   The man left everyone alone, his wife included.
</P>
<P>
   But such anger seemed rare Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Most people, their faces stoic, approached voting as their
solemn national duty _ even if many knew none of the candidates or
needed help deciphering the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voting is your right and your work,'' said Carmen Rose, 26, of
Nancolin.
</P>
<P>
   Next to her was Fort Stenley, 29, straddling his bicycle.
``We're not going to solve this in one shot, one vote,'' Stenley
said. ``It's going to be day by day, and little by little it's
going to get better.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE DEVILS TAKE STOCK AS ELIMINATION LOOMS  

</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Among personalities in the coaching
profession, there are the fire-breathers and the cool breezes.
Bobby Knight, the Indiana basketball coach, is often among the
first group. Larry Robinson, the Devils' coach, is usually among
the latter. Robinson is unlikely to put his hands on an athlete's
throat or to insult people gratuitously or to scream at his team in
the dressing room. He prefers to offer positive reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
   But Robinson, with exasperation and in desperation, yelled quite
a bit Saturday night after the Devils fell to the brink of
elimination in the Stanley Cup playoffs. After a 3-1 Flyers victory
in Continental Arena, Robinson kicked over a trash can and
addressed his players in shouts that could be heard in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't regret anything I said,'' Robinson said Sunday
afternoon, in measured tones, before the team boarded its bus to
Philadelphia. ``However, my voice regrets it and my head regrets
it. I felt it was the right place and the right time. They had to
know exactly how I felt. At least I know I've done what I could.''
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a performance for a man whose first grandchild was
born over the weekend, and it might not be enough. The Devils trail
by 3-1 in the four-of-seven-game Eastern Conference finals, which
resume Monday night at First Union Center. A Flyer victory would
put Philadelphia into the Stanley Cup finals against either Dallas
or Colorado, who are tied at two victories apiece in the West.
After winning Game 1, the Devils have lost three consecutive games
to a similar team that may be a little bigger, tougher and more
skilled.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said Sunday that he thought his team had become
undisciplined when the score was 1-1 in the third period. He said
his players needed to maintain their positions and trust in the
game plan. He said his forwards needed to push to the net and try
for more rebounds. He said that some players were giving full
effort but that not everyone was trying hard enough. So he wanted
more energy, execution, focus and finish. The message seemed to
have reached its intended receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, he's going to get it through our thick skulls what
he wants,'' Scott Stevens, the captain, said. ``You never see him
mad. I was shocked. It was very upsetting.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur, the goalie whose play improved Saturday despite
another costly turnover that led to the first goal, said it was not
wrong for Robinson ``to lose it like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If he doesn't, it would have proved he doesn't
really care.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Gomez, the rookie center, said Robinson's loud words
``showed us how much he cares about us and how much he believes in
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was one of two veteran defensemen praised by Robinson
for their effort. The other was Ken Daneyko. When prompted to cite
a few more positives Sunday Robinson instead chose to stress
negatives. ``Philadelphia has scored probably 90 percent of their
goals going to the net and getting rebounds,'' he said. ``We have
yet to score off a rebound. That's what the New Jersey Devils have
been noted for, going to the net and being hard to move in front of
the net. We haven't been in front of the net. You don't have to
move anything that's not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of those big forwards are Bobby Holik and Randy McKay. Holik
scored the only Devil goal Saturday and McKay assisted. Referring
to Robinson's outburst, McKay said: ``It better have the desired
effect because he was right. We didn't play smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his teammates, McKay said: ``It wasn't from lack of trying.
Everyone in here cares. I'm not questioning anybody's character.''
</P>
<P>
   Holik added that Robinson's words had an effect. ``If a man of
that stature says something, everybody in the room had better
listen,'' Holik said.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes what is unspoken is also important. The Flyers can
be an intimidating team around their net. Dan McGillis, a big
defenseman, is having a good series. Rick Tocchet and Keith Jones,
rugged forwards, are punishing people who turn their backs to them
in pursuit of the puck. And forwards like Mark Recchi, John LeClair
and Keith Primeau are breaking free for rushes going the other way,
putting defensemen like Stevens and Daneyko on their heels.
</P>
<P>
   While Philadelphia will probably advance, a Devil comeback is
not totally far-fetched. In a tournament this long, teams can fall
into slumps and come out of them. The Devils showed signs of it
Saturday. The stylish attacking tandem of Gomez and Alexander
Mogilny, despite being on the ice for Philadelphia's winning goal,
had several close chances. Mogilny rang a crossbar behind goalie
Brian Boucher. Gomez charged to the net and ended up in it after
Boucher stopped his low backhander. Claude Lemieux was aggressive
and nasty and inspired fans and teammates with his penalty killing.
</P>
<P>
   But, with Robinson's words ringing in their ears, do the Devils
have enough time, grit and skill to recover?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' Brodeur said. ``It's up to us.'' &QL;

YANKEES FRUSTRATED IN ROOKIE'S FINE DEBUT  

</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Paul Rigdon has been a big-league pitcher for one
day and he can tell friends he gets standing ovations every other
inning. He can say those world champion Yankees aren't that tough
if you just throw strikes. He can say he outduels pitchers like
Orlando Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Rigdon can say his record is perfect, after he allowed just two
hits in pitching shutout ball for seven innings Sunday, as
Cleveland dumped the Yankees, 6-1. The Yankees' only run came in
the ninth; they have not scored a run with Hernandez (4-4) in the
game since May 3, a span of 24 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees lost two of three games to Cleveland this weekend.
It was the first time they dropped a series at Jacobs Field since
June 20-22, 1997, when the Indians also took two of three games.
Because Boston lost two of three to Detroit, the Yankees (24-16)
did not lose any ground in the American League East: they are one
game behind the Red Sox (25-15). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rigdon, 24, was promoted to the majors in the wake of the rash
of devastating pitching injuries suffered by the Indians last week.
In one day Cleveland placed three pitchers _ the starters Jaret
Wright and Charles Nagy and the reliever Ricardo Rincon _ on the
disabled list. All the Yankees knew about Rigdon before he pitched
Sunday was contained in a few lines of a scouting report. He throw
sinkers, it was written, and sliders, and he throws lots of
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams said later that the report did not mention the
changeup that Rigdon threw. Nor did it mention that Rigdon blew out
his elbow in 1996 and had to have the joint rebuilt, or that he
missed the entire 1997 season, or that he was among the first
players cut in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees learned about Rigdon mostly by watching him pitch
Sunday. They could see he was a tall right-hander, and aggressive.
He was nervous facing the Yankees, he said afterward, so he just
pretended he was not facing the Yankees, but just an ordinary team.
</P>
<P>
   He just kept pumping strikes, ``kept getting ahead in the
count,'' Manager Joe Torre said. ``He wasn't overpowering,
obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees kept getting healthy swings against Rigdon, putting
the ball in play, but Chuck Knoblauch did not collect the Yankees'
first hit until there were two out in the third inning. After
Rigdon retired the side in the top of the fourth, striking out
Jorge Posada to close the inning, fans at Jacobs Field _ accustomed
to seeing the Yankees destroy Cleveland pitching _ gave the rookie
a standing ovation. They stood again for him after the fifth and
sixth innings. ``When there are 40,000 on their feet cheering for
you,'' Rigdon said, ``it sends chills down your spine.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland (23-17) scored in each of the first three innings,
building a 4-0 lead with rallies that included an inside-the-park
home run. Two outs into the second inning, Enrique Wilson lifted a
high drive toward right field. Paul O'Neill retreated, staring
upward. O'Neill felt the hard rubber surface of the warning track
beneath his feet, and as he continued to follow the flight of the
ball, he anticipated he would reach the fence.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill did not know he had drifted into the jaws of an angle,
where one part of the wall meets another and creates a little extra
space on the warning track. O'Neill was not as close to the wall as
he thought. Rather than back up another step or two, he jumped,
falling backward, and the ball glanced off his glove, ricocheted
off the fence and bounded toward the infield. O'Neill lay against
the base of the wall, helpless.
</P>
<P>
   As Williams ran over from center field to retrieve the ball,
Wilson charged around the bases, waved around third by the base
coach Jim Riggleman. It appeared the second baseman, Knoblauch, the
relay man, had a reasonable chance of cutting down Wilson at the
plate, but his throw sailed high over the catcher Posada's head
while Wilson belly-flopped across the plate, exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got kind of lost and I missed it,'' O'Neill said. ``It
got in the sun and I lost it. But it hit my glove, and any time it
hits your glove, you should catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez had his hands on his hips frequently, his pose of
frustration, and after Jim Thome ripped a high curveball for a
two-run homer in the third, Hernandez looked at Posada and tapped
himself on the chest: my fault. Manny Ramirez's two-run homer in
the seventh finished the scoring against Hernandez, who allowed
nine hits, three walks and six runs in six-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Posada lined a one-out double off Rigdon in the seventh and the
Indians' bullpen came to life, as if the Indians could not believe
how much they were getting out of Rigdon. But Jim Leyritz smashed a
grounder that shortstop Omar Vizquel gloved to begin an
inning-ending double play _ the second of three Cleveland double
plays _ and fans were on their feet again. Later, Knoblauch and
Scott Brosius estimated that they have received two standing
ovations at Yankee Stadium; Rigdon had four on his first day.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored an unearned run in the ninth before Posada
flied out to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez flipped his batting gloves onto the dugout and
other Yankees tossed balls and other items as if to rid themselves
of mementos from this frustrating day against a rookie pitcher they
could not hit. &QL;

COLLEGE COMMENCEMENT DOUBLES AS A WAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVERHILL, Mass. _ Bradford College, a small liberal arts school
that had been struggling to find a niche since it became a
four-year coeducational institution a generation ago, died Saturday
after a bittersweet commencement ceremony that drew hundreds of
alumni from around the country. It was 197 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the cause was a simple failure to find enough
students to cover operating costs, though many blame mismanagement
and weak marketing. Bradford's demise was sealed when enrollment
fell short of expectations last fall by just 31 students, but it
probably had been inevitable at least since the college decided in
1996 to borrow $18 million to build new dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to change to survive,'' said Karen M. Shugrue, a 1970
graduate who heads the board of trustees. ``Bradford has always
done that _ has always somehow managed, until now, to change and
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   With its grand red-brick buildings around a grassy quad and a
wooden bridge arcing over Tupelo Pond, Bradford is the
quintessential picture of a New England college campus and has long
been the cultural heart of this historic working-class community,
35 miles northeast of Boston. It was founded in 1803 as one of the
first girls' schools in New England and, in 1932, became a two-year
college serving the daughters of the well-to-do. Four decades
later, at the height of the Vietnam War, Bradford admitted men and
began granting bachelor's degrees; since then, the college has been
on the cutting edge of liberal arts education, offering tiny
student-faculty ratios, innovative teaching and an emphasis on
internships and community service.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, amid the increasingly competitive college
market, Bradford has been in a seemingly endless process of
self-reinvention, catering to artists, international students, the
learning disabled. But with fewer than 600 full-time students, the
bulk of them lured to campus with generous discounts off the
$25,000 sticker price, the college ran yawning deficits.
</P>
<P>
   While elite liberal arts colleges like Amherst in Massachusetts
and Oberlin in Ohio are thriving, higher education has shifted its
overall focus to professional training, leaving smaller,
lesser-known schools, like Bradford, in danger. In 1960, about half
the nation's students were at liberal arts colleges; today, about
17 percent are. Since 1986, more than 40 such institutions have
shut their doors, but none was as old or respected in academic
circles as Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's profoundly sad for all of us,'' Arthur C. Levine,
president of Teachers College at Columbia University and a former
president of Bradford, said in the final commencement address
Saturday. ``For our nation, it's a tragedy, when small colleges,
which know their students by name and character, give way to
megaversities and online campuses that know them by Social Security
numbers or URLs.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's ceremony was more Irish wake than funeral, as
graduates celebrated their successes through tears and alumnae from
a half-century ago joked about reconvening if the college is
converted into a retirement home. The 25-acre campus, which has 19
buildings _ from the 17th-century tavern where the school was
conceived to the new complex of town houses that brought it to the
brink of bankruptcy _ is on the market, and though schools have
come shopping, none has made a bid.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford's e-mail network and mailing address will be defunct by
month's end, its transcripts sent to nearby Merrimack College, the
$20 million endowment in the hands of the state attorney general.
The fate of other assets _the 36-foot mural of Bradford's history
painted a decade ago; the trowel used to lay the cornerstone of
Academy Hall, the campus centerpiece, in 1870; countless old bows
and arrows, snowshoes, tennis rackets and posture trophies in the
former gym _ remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mourn the 200-year tradition, obviously,'' said David
Crouse, a 1990 graduate who returned to teach writing five years
ago. ``But a lot of my mourning is about the possibilities. We were
on the verge of great things.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the closing was announced on Nov. 23, the campuswide
strategic planning process has been replaced with talk of transfer
applications and job interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Students and faculty have cycled through the stages of grief:
angry protests under desperate ``Save Bradford'' banners; a futile
effort to raise $20 million, which netted several thousand in
pledges; a steady march of farewell parties; and throughout, an
attempt at teaching and learning, tests and projects, even the
annual faculty-senior softball game, as the college ran out of
basic supplies like light bulbs and paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like purgatory,'' Marc Mannheimer, an art professor for
the past 21 years, said in an interview the day after classes
ended. ``Every day, I say to myself, `This is the last time I'll do
this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford is survived by 6,711 alumni, 497 students (131 of whom
received diplomas Saturday), 33 full-time professors and 121 staff
members. It was preceded in death by the renowned writer Andre
Dubus, who taught at the college for 18 years, and Portia Marshall
Washington Pittman, the daughter of Booker T. Washington, who
graduated in 1905.
</P>
<P>
   As they milled about outside the white commencement tent,
generations of former students reminisced about gooey chocolate
Bradford cake (which was served at the alumni reception), singing
holiday songs by candlelight on the steps of Academy Hall, jumping
in the pond when classes were canceled on the annual Spring Day.
Singing the alma mater for an institution founded when Thomas
Jefferson was president, they wondered what it would mean to have a
diploma from a place that no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Jordan Gabrielson, a 1945 graduate who lives in
Philadelphia, said Dorothy M. Bell, Bradford's president for 27
years, always told her ``the one thing you can count on in life,
that's change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we didn't expect it here,'' said Gabrielson's classmate,
Muriel Horne Weldon, who wore her monogrammed green Bradford scarf
around her neck. ``That is, not in this form. They changed their
thinking. They added buildings, added students. But it was still
supposed to be here forever.''

THE NETS SCORE A BIG VICTORY: THE NO. 1 PICK  

</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SECAUCUS, N.J. _ The Nets do not have a coach, a director of
basketball operations or much of a history of good fortune. But
they do now have the No. 1 pick in the 2000 National Basketball
Association draft and a chance to begin to reverse their struggles
after coming up as the winners of the draft lottery Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who finished with the league's seventh-worst record,
had 44 chances out of 1,001 to obtain the top overall selection,
but the Ping-Pong balls fell their way. The organization, which has
been undergoing an overhaul with Coach Don Casey being let go and
the team's president, Michael Rowe, being reassigned since the end
of a disappointing season, suddenly finds itself in an enviable
position for once.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Katz, the principal owner of the Nets, sat on the podium
listening as the June 28 draft order was called off. After the Nets
had passed by the No. 7 spot where their record would have placed
them, and it came down to the final two spots, Katz sat nervously
mouthing silent words to himself.
</P>
<P>
   When the announcement came that the Vancouver Grizzlies were No.
2, leaving the Nets as the winners, Katz pumped his fist and
shouted, ``Yes, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so unbelievable,'' Katz said. ``You start out at 40 out
of 1,000, and you're thinking, `I want to be at No. 7, I don't want
to lose my position.' Then when you hit 7, it's like, `I'd like to
be No. 3.' And then, all of the sudden, it's like you're at the
Academy Awards. It's you.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Nets, it's absolutely phenomenal. It's an up for a
tough season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies, who had the fourth-worst record in the league,
moved up to No. 2, and the perennially struggling Los Angeles
Clippers dropped to the third pick despite having the worst record.
Chicago moved down to No. 4 and also picked up the seventh pick
from the Washington Wizards, who owed the pick as a part of a trade
if they did not get one of the top three spots.
</P>
<P>
   With no clear choice for the first overall selection, the Nets
must decide whether to use the pick themselves or to trade it away.
The thought has been that Kenyon Martin, a 6-foot-9-inch power
forward from the University of Cincinnati, would be the top pick in
this draft. But Martin is coming off a broken leg and torn
ligaments in his ankle and also plays the same position as Keith
Van Horn. So the Nets could consider another player, such as Chris
Mihm, a 7-foot center from the University of Texas, or Stromile
Swift, a 6-8 forward from Louisiana State.
</P>
<P>
   Or they could field offers, such as the one that came, jokingly
at this time, from Orlando General Manager John Gabriel. As the
Nets celebrated the pick, Gabriel leaned over to Nets General
Manager John Nash and offered up the No. 5 and No. 10 picks that
the Magic wound up with Sunday. The Magic also has the No. 13 pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is a decision that is going to be made by a
number of people who aren't currently with us,'' Nash said. His
status remains a question with the Nets having begun interviewing
candidates for a director of basketball operations, including John
Thompson, who was interviewed on Friday. ``It's going to be an
organizational decision,'' he said. ``I think it would be
inappropriate until the organization is fully intact to be making a
decision as important as this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets had the top pick in the draft once previously, in 1990
when they selected Derrick Coleman. Coleman was more of a sure
thing than Martin as a talent, but never delivered the lift to the
organization that his ability had promised, and he was finally
dealt away as a disappointment. This time, the Nets bring back a
far more talented roster than the 17-65 team that Coleman joined,
but one still with needs. With Jayson Williams' health a question
mark and all three of the small forwards from the past season's
roster potential free-agent departures, the Nets' most glaring
needs are center and small forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we can fill a major void,'' Nash said. ``The
question is, can we improve the team even more if we opt to trade
the pick? Right now, I wouldn't be predisposed to trading the pick,
but as I say, we're going to have some new key management and
coaching people in place over the next couple of weeks and I think,
in fairness to them, they're going to have significant input.'' &QL;

WALKING THE STREET TO CRUISE THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a typical New York street fair in many ways:
cotton candy, silly balloon hats, rock band, stock-option raffle.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it was a little different. With 60-odd Internet companies
hawking their wares at the Silicon Alley Street Fair, creativity
ruled the day. And the 30-somethings at Asktherobot.com, a
job-recruitment company, perhaps best captured the spirit of the
day by raffling 500 shares of their soon-to-be-public stock to the
winners of a basketball toss.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Internet,'' explained Michael Vogel, the chief
executive of the company, which started nearly four months ago and
plans to go public in a year or so. ``The big calling card to the
world is stock options. This is what the Internet is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogel estimated the potential value of the stock at $25,000,
depending on the selling price at the initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, hyperbole ruled the day as well.
</P>
<P>
   The fair, after all, was intended in large part to promote
Silicon Alley, the concentration of technology and Internet-related
companies that have cropped up in and around Manhattan, said Janet
Stites, the publisher of Alleycat News, which organized the fair at
Union Square Park with the marketing firm MarketMatch Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``People read about Silicon Alley, they hear about it, but they
don't come face to face with it,'' Stites said. ``It's an economic
development issue and a curiosity issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiosity seemed to be winning. Droves of people, despite a
chilly drizzle, massed under white tents for demonstrations of all
manner of Web sites, brought through a T-1 high-capacity telephone
line set up just for the event. And of course they filled plastic
bags with all manner of freebies: T-shirts, flying discs, caps and,
of course, software.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Kimmel, 59, who lives nearby, toted a bag filled with
goodies, a powerful lure for her. But she also recently bought an
Internet-only computer after months of surfing the Web at a
library, so anything ``dot-com'' would have brought her out. ``I'm
very obsessed with the Internet now,'' she said. ``I'm just
thrilled with it. I have so much clutter and thousands of pieces of
paper, so I can get rid of it all because all the information is on
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Cohen of Brooklyn picked up a CD-ROM for a
financial-services Web site, infogate.com, and was amazed at the
variety of companies. Many were start-up firms like
Asktherobot.com, but mainstays like IBM and United Parcel Service
also got in on the action, as did out-of-towners like mall.com, a
retail site based in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wider range of companies than I thought,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet service providers, or portals, and companies offering
online shopping seemed most abundant. Or at least made the most
noise. ``Come on, lonely Matt here is waiting for somebody to
e-mail him!'' cried a worker for juno.com, an Internet service
provider, as another employee, Matt Daly, sat checking his empty
in-box.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at cyberrate.com, a retailing site, beckoned passers-by
by flashing a strobe light and throwing T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Mariolene Jeanbaptiste, dressed as a big red bean, passed out
temporary tattoos for beenz.com, an electronic commerce site.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll try anything,'' said Marion Rodgers, turning away from
the big bean with a handful of tattoos. ``It's like when you go to
the mall and all these people come up to you. I don't know why I
would be surprised that Internet companies would be any different.
Maybe because you never see real people on the Internet.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Certainly the paradox at hand _ that everybody there had left
his home to visit a fair whose companies promise you won't have to
because of the Internet _ was not lost on some people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be interesting to see if they can have a virtual
street fair some day,'' said Adrian Marsh, a sophomore at New York
University majoring in English who is thinking more and more of
majoring in computer science. ``At least that way they would not
have to worry about the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe next year, though organizers have more modest goals _ like
using wireless modems next time, and of course drawing more
companies. Laura Sabia of MarketMatch said she is working on
creating similar fairs for other high-tech cities like Boston and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   New York's fair was enough for Alan Barnes, 33, of Brooklyn.
``This place was as crowded and jumbled as the Internet,'' he said
as he left empty-handed and walked into that century-old portal,
the subway.

EDITORIAL: PUTIN'S MISSTEPS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, May 22:
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton prepares to visit Moscow next month, there
are disquieting signs that Russia's new president, Vladimir Putin,
is steering the Kremlin toward anti-democratic policies. A
government raid on a private media company earlier this month and
Moscow's recent welcome for Yugoslavia's defense minister, who has
been indicted for war crimes, suggest a contempt for democratic
values that Clinton and his aides must consider as they plan for
the Moscow summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the police raid on the offices of Media-MOST
and the defense minister's visit were tactical maneuvers designed
to placate some of Putin's conservative political allies rather
than a signal of new policies. Even so, Putin must have understood
that the steps would send a chilling message in the first days of
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The government defended the crude search of Media-MOST
headquarters as necessary to gather information for a criminal
investigation of suspected financial irregularities at the company.
Putin himself echoed that view when he endorsed the police action,
while affirming his support for a free press. But it is difficult
to believe that the arrival of masked agents with automatic weapons
was not an effort to intimidate an enterprise whose publications
and broadcast outlets have been critical of Putin and his
prosecution of the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   By hosting Dragoljub Ojdanic, Belgrade's defense minister and a
loyal ally of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, Moscow
defied the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, which was established
by the U.N. Security Council to deal with atrocities in the recent
Balkan ethnic conflicts. Ojdanic was army chief of staff during the
war in Kosovo. The tribunal last May charged him and other Yugoslav
leaders with responsibility for the deportation of hundreds of
thousands of ethnic Albanians and the murder of hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
   As a member state of the United Nations, Russia had an
obligation to detain Ojdanic so he could be brought to trial.
Instead, he met with Russian defense officials and moved freely
through Moscow during a five-day visit that coincided with Putin's
inauguration. Last week, after a visit by Belgrade's foreign
minister, Moscow granted Yugoslavia a $102 million loan. Putin may
be playing to nationalist and Slavic sentiment in Russia with his
embrace of Belgrade, but these steps are a direct slap at
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers talk about the coming summit meeting as an
opportunity to take the measure of Putin, and a chance to explore a
broad agenda of common interests. The Russian leader may turn out
to be a pragmatic negotiator. Certainly he is more energetic and
more familiar with policy details than his predecessor, Boris
Yeltsin. On economic issues, he seems inclined to spur reform. But
on such critical issues as respect for democratic principles, Putin
has not made a promising start.

 IBM TO UNVEIL BREAKTHROUGH IN CHIP SPEED  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ IBM on Monday will unveil the first products
containing a breakthrough semiconductor technology that is
considered likely to spread across the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Called silicon-on-insulator, or SOI, the technology increases a
chip's speed and reduces its power consumption. It involves putting
a thin layer of silicon, then an insulating layer, under the
millions of tiny metal-oxide transistors, or switches, that do the
work inside the chip.
</P>
<P>
   The net effect is to make it possible to turn these switches on
and off with less electricity and therefore faster _ about 20 to 30
percent faster, according to IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big deal,'' said Fred Zieber, an analyst at Pathfinder
Research in San Jose, Calif. ``They're probably a couple of years
ahead of everyone else, but eventually everyone will have to adopt
SOI if they want to keep moving to higher clock speeds.''
</P>
<P>
   The products IBM is announcing today are additions to its AS/400
series of big business servers. In the long run, however, SOI could
have its greatest impact in battery-powered mobile computers
because it can reduce a chip's power requirements by as much as a
factor of three, according to IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Because IBM doesn't currently make Intel-compatible chips, SOI
won't show up in Windows notebooks until the company decides to
license its process to other manufacturers, or other companies
manage to come up with their own equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   But an IBM spokesman said the technology will be available to
Apple, which already uses IBM-made PowerPC chips in its laptops.
While declining to provide details, he said SOI will appear in a
portable device this year.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at IBM and elsewhere have been studying SOI for
almost 30 years, but until 18 months ago, when IBM first announced
the technology that led to today's products, no one had managed to
implement it in a way that could be applied to high-volume
commercial production.
</P>
<P>
   The advance is the latest in a string of recent technology
firsts for IBM. It has led the industry in shifting from aluminum
to copper for the internal wiring inside its chips, another
innovation that increases processor performance. Last month, it
announced major progress in another critical area of processor
technology known as ``low-k dielectrics.''
</P>
<P>
   These advances have bolstered the company's status as a leader
in microprocessor technology. Both Hewlett-Packard and Sun
Microsystems _ competitors with IBM in the server market _ have
recently contracted with IBM's microelectronics division to
manufacture some of their cutting-edge processors.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to the combination of copper wiring and SOI, the
AS/400 servers IBM is announcing today are up to 3.6 times faster
than their predecessors, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   They include the AS/400e 250, a small business server that
starts at $7,500 without memory or disk storage; the AS/400e 270, a
line designed for Web serving, e-business and Java applications,
which will be priced between $10,000 and $50,000; and the AS /400e
820, 830 and 840, a series of ``mid-market enterprise servers''
priced between $30,000 and $1.2 million.

 INTEL TO INTRODUCE XEON PROCESSORS TODAY  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Intel Corp. will announce new versions of its
high-end Pentium III Xeon processors Monday, boosting the
performance of the server-oriented chips by 13 to 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new Xeons, running at a clock speed of 700 megahertz, will
feature 1 or 2 megabytes of performance-enhancing ``Level 2 cache''
memory built into the chip. The company already offers versions of
the Xeon that run at speeds up to 866 megahertz, but those chips
have only 256 kilobytes of cache; until this week, the larger-cache
versions were available only at speeds of 550 megahertz or less.
</P>
<P>
   The new 700-megahertz version with 1 megabyte of cache will sell
for $1,177 in quantity; its 2-megabyte sibling will be $1,980.
</P>
<P>
   The chips, each of which has 140 million transistors, are
intended mainly for servers with four or more processors. Servers
are used not only to store data and run major business applications
inside corporations, but also to deliver Web pages and host
e-commerce programs.
</P>
<P>
   Companies expected to announce servers with the new chips in the
next few weeks include Compaq, Dell, Fujitsu-Siemens, Gateway,
Hewlett-Packard and IBM, which on Wednesday will unveil what it
calls ``the world's largest Intel-based server.''
</P>
<P>
   According to International Data Corp., 78 percent of all servers
in use worldwide are now based on Intel chips. Most of those are
low-end models, by server standards, but over the past five
quarters, the Xeon's market share in servers priced above $10,000
has climbed from 40 to 53 percent.

SPORTS COLUMN: CHILDS LEAVES THE HARD ROAD BEHIND HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ He hoisted the basketball toward the rafters, a long
heave that ended another heirloom of a game and left Chris Childs
defiantly shaking his head. Standing there as his teammates stormed
the middle of American Airlines Arena and hugged and laughed and
lifted each other off the floor, Childs resembled the park ranger
who instructed the tourists not to feed the bears.
</P>
<P>
   Hadn't Miami Coach Pat Riley and his team learned anything from
this surreal seven-game odyssey? Whether it was Anthony Carter
dropping in an impossible shot over the backboard in Game 2 or
Bruce Bowen calmly downing a 3-pointer to seal Game 5, it became
understood.
</P>
<P>
   Do not leave players who took the long road to the National
Basketball Association open. You cannot give them the lane to
drive, an inch behind the arc or two free throws in the final
minutes. They worked too hard to get here.
</P>
<P>
   Childs thought long about this after the game was over, this
83-82 thriller won by the unshakable Knicks and their backup point
guard. He scored 10 straight Knicks points to begin the fourth
quarter, keeping them in a game they were about to throw away.
</P>
<P>
   Until the most confident role player in America morphed into the
Knicks' go-to guy, maneuvering his 6-foot-2-inch frame past Alonzo
Mourning and the Miami front line, scoring on driving layups and
drawing the foul, knocking down important jump shots. Who did he
think he was playing for, Quad City?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that CBA guys have unbelievable heart,'' Childs, a
five-year veteran of the Continental Basketball Association, said
after another demoralized Heat crowd had filed out into the Miami
sunlight, cursing his existence. ``Nobody has seen the hotels we
stay in, the money we make. What we had to do to even make the NBA.
You can't really describe unless you live that life. We have a
passion for the game nobody could understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody. Not a No. 1 draft pick whose bags have been carried to
and from the team charter plane since he was 22 years old. Not a
most valuable player candidate with a $105 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost fitting for Childs to help end the madness. It
began when Riley gave players like Carter and Bowen and _ at the
bitter end for Miami _ Clarence Weatherspoon the ball with the game
on the line. Either Mourning was covered or Tim Hardaway was
injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what a person has done to get here,'' Kurt
Thomas said afterward in the Knicks' locker room. ``A lot of people
thought Anthony Carter would never play in this league. He ended up
having a big series. When you look at it, it was just 24 guys who
suited up, willing to give everything they had.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Knicks-Heat has never been about ego, multimillionaires
or franchise players. It is about hard-core ball, gym rats and hoop
junkies, trading shots like two youngsters in a pillow fight who
can't seem to get the other one to go groggy and drop.
</P>
<P>
   With the season in the balance, Childs' gumption, his coolness
amid the calamity, sent the Knicks to Indiana and the conference
finals for the second straight season.
</P>
<P>
   You could not believe the decibel level in this building when
Mourning blocked Allan Houston's driving runner with less than 10
minutes left. Miami had a 71-65 lead, and for the first time in two
weeks it seemed that someone would end the dance, pull away from
the other for good.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat had the ball and a chance to go up by 8 points. With
bedlam about to ensue, Childs stole a Jamal Mashburn pass and raced
upcourt. He bore down, went hard to his right and attacked the
basket. He was not taking on Mourning and P.J. Brown and
Weatherspoon as much as he was taking on the venom in the arena,
the people who would die happy if his layup was rejected into the
stands as he raced toward the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Bucket. And a foul on Weatherspoon. Three-point play.
Three-point game.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest plays of the game,'' Riley said. ``Chris
drove down to our basket and got a 3-point play. Chris Childs
played really big for them.''
</P>
<P>
   There is something about Childs that embodies this Knick team
like no other player. The constant feuding with referees. The way
he hip-checks everyone who is guarding him as he dribbles down the
floor. The way he squared off against Kobe Bryant two months ago in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The little bully, unbent and unbowed, ready to trade genuine
blows with every player who challenges him, cocksure enough to
guarantee a Game 6 victory _ and back it up.
</P>
<P>
   For 9 minutes 12 seconds Sunday, the people who are paid more
than anyone else to fill Madison Square Garden and deliver the
Knicks a championship either could not make a shot or were
blanketed by their defender. Patrick Ewing, Latrell Sprewell and
Houston _ all current or past All-Stars _ were stifled by this
suffocating Heat defense.
</P>
<P>
   Childs scored 13 straight at one juncture, beginning with a
3-pointer at the end of the third quarter and ending with two free
throws with four minutes left. With the noise at a deafening pitch
and Mourning about to decide the series defensively, Childs took on
the Heat and Dade and Broward Counties all at once.
</P>
<P>
   The irrepressible Quad City kid, going back to the Eastern
Conference finals, heaving the ball toward the rafters, leaving the
hard road behind. &QL;

 LEAN TIMES FOR WEB STORES AS INVESTORS LOSE INTEREST  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ So you want to be an Internet entrepreneur?
</P>
<P>
   One day you see that a terrific domain name _ BBQ.com _ is for
sale, and you decide to build an Internet store around it, selling
$3,300 Lynx gas grills, bacon-wrapped Omaha steaks, electric bug
zappers.
</P>
<P>
   You quit your six-figure job. You line up seed money, hire
staff, build a Web site. You sell your first grill 30 seconds after
the site is up. Within half a year, business starts doubling
monthly. You add people. You build a bigger, better Web site. You
gear up for summer, barbecue's equivalent of Christmas. Now you
need more capital to fuel your growing business.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one problem.
</P>
<P>
   The same people who last year threw bundles of cash at online
pharmacies, pet food and cosmetics stores now say that investing in
e-tailers is dumber than pouring lighter fluid on flaming coals.
</P>
<P>
   By now, you realize you're playing out a drama being repeated
all over the e-tailing landscape: A cast of factors _ Nasdaq
gyrations, big-name debacles like Drkoop.com and CDNow, IPOs that
turned into penny stocks _ have created a downward spiral effect
for Internet stores.
</P>
<P>
   You give your pitch to 20 venture-capital firms, explaining the
barbecue market's allure: a huge, fanatical following who spend $18
billion a year; no dedicated stores online or offline; high margins
and, surprisingly, year-round traction. Some kinda like the idea,
but no one wants to take the lead in financing your company.
</P>
<P>
   The money's almost gone. You lay off most of your staff. Some
are so loyal they continue to show up at work for a few hours every
day.
</P>
<P>
   Now you have just days to see if you can find a deep-pockets
backer and pull a success out of the mesquite embers of your dream.
</P>
<P>
   So it's gone for Anthony Johndrow, chief executive and
co-founder of San Francisco's BBQ.com.
</P>
<P>
   After raising $1.68 million last summer to purchase the BBQ.com
domain name and launch the site, Johndrow went back to the well two
months ago only to find that it had run dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, I could have raised $30 million, but now VCs are
hiding under their desks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in May should hit $75,000 and could double in June, he
said _ if the site is still around.
</P>
<P>
   Johndrow and co-founder Fred Karem said they're talking to six
``very interested parties'' who might cough up the money to rescue
BBQ.com by investing or acquiring it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly the bottom of the ninth, two outs, a man on first
and second. If we don't knock something home this week, then that's
probably it,'' said Matthew Poole, the site's editor.
</P>
<P>
   BBQ.com's story exemplifies that of many little guys on the Web.
For every well-known Internet store that streaks across the night
sky like a comet, there are probably a dozen that don't attain much
more than the luminescence _ or life span _ of a firefly.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the recent flops have been huge. Europe's Boo.com, a
clothing site that aspired to a global market, burned through $120
million in months and last week went kaput.
</P>
<P>
   But many failures have been of small, specialty firms.
Violet.com, a San Francisco clothing site, shut down last month.
Connecticut's Craftshop.com, an arts-and-crafts e-tailer backed by
CMGI Inc., this month said it plans to file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Targeting a niche market can mean a company is thinking smart _
or that it's consigned to have a trifling business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to go national with a boutique,'' said David
Cooperstein, research director for online retail at Forrester
Research in Cambridge, Mass. ``You need demand, a way of tapping
into it, a business strategy sound enough to execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Some three-quarters of all e-business startups are destined for
failure, according to a recent Gartner Group study. But that
doesn't mean that the whole idea of e-tailing is a bust, just that
the market can't support hundreds of little players.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, too many companies are doing (e-tailing), there's
too much hype, some companies are not well-managed. But if you look
past that, there's a huge market, growing really fast,'' said Barry
Parr, director of consumer e-commerce research, at International
Data Corp. in Mountain View, pointing to an expected $42 billion in
consumer spending on the Internet this year, up more than 50
percent from 1999.
</P>
<P>
   VCs have clearly lost their taste for e-tailing, but they're
still putting money in the sector. In the first quarter of 2000,
funding for e-commerce firms dropped in half from the previous
quarter, while overall funding went up almost 25 percent, according
to VentureOne, a VC research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Still, e-commerce drew $744.19 million in backing, although that
includes companies creating business exchanges as well as those
selling to consumers. Some e-tailers scored major bucks: Food.com
landed $80 million in private placement; eZiba, which sells
hand-crafted goods, got $68 million in VC; and home-improvement
products site OurHouse.com got $62.4 million in VC.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Fram, a professor of marketing at the Rochester (N.Y.)
Institute of Technology, offers a historical perspective on the
current Darwinian struggle.
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, a brand-new industry sprang up in America,
generating incredible hype and excitement. More than 400 companies
fiercely competed to meet its demands. Eventually, only three
remained.
</P>
<P>
   A total flop, just like some say e-tail will be?
</P>
<P>
   The three players that survived the carnage _ Ford Motor Co.,
Chrysler Corp. and General Motors _ managed to do pretty well.

 REALNETWORKS UPGRADES INTENDED TO FIGHT MICROSOFT CHALLENGE  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Trying to head off a strong charge by Microsoft,
RealNetworks Inc. has reworked its Internet video and audio
playback software to become an all-purpose online entertainment
center.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle company Monday will unveil its latest upgrades of
its RealPlayer video and audio programs and the RealJukebox digital
music software as a prelude to the company's fourth-annual
developer's conference later this week in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The new RealPlayer 8 and RealJukebox 2 will still be available
separately and for free, although they now have more common,
integrated features and will be promoted as part of a suite of
programs called the Real Entertainment Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Microsoft Office model for digital
entertainment,'' said Rob Grady, product manager for RealNetworks'
consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks is trying to keep its lead over Microsoft's
competing Windows Media Player audio and video technology, which is
being shipped with Microsoft's Windows 98, Windows 2000 and
forthcoming Windows Millennium operating software.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks says it has about 125 million registered users of
its RealPlayer streaming video software and 34 million RealJukebox
users. Microsoft, meanwhile, says it has more than 100 million
registered users of its Windows Media Player.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which was built on software that allowed audio and
video to be streamed across the Internet, hopes to capitalize on
the increasing use of the Web as an entertainment medium, from MP3s
to video, with products that will work on computers and wireless
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the improved RealPlayer and RealJukebox, along
with a new file downloading manager, should help RealNetworks keep
its lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their technology is still well ahead of Microsoft's,'' said
Larry Gerbrandt, a senior analyst with Paul Kagen Associates in
Carmel, Calif. ``The government may complain about a lack of
competition, but we're certainly seeing the benefits of competition
in the streaming space.''
</P>
<P>
   Both RealNetworks and Microsoft are trying to build all-purpose
media players that do more than just play streaming video, but play
music converted into the MP3 or other audio formats, store and
catalog music files in a computer database and transfer the files
into separate digital audio devices.
</P>
<P>
   The RealNetworks upgrades are for the first time able to read
HTML code like a standard Web browser to better tie into the
company's Real.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Zaballos, director of systems marketing, said the company
is trying to stay abreast of the rapid consumer-driven changes in
digital entertainment, which will shift even more this summer when
major record labels like Sony and BMG begin selling downloadable
top hit songs through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not using this as a feature to move operating systems,''
Zaballos said. ``We're looking at the complete transformation of a
communications medium. This is not about computers _ this is about
the way people communicate. It's about to explode in ways
completely independent of the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerbrandt said the Real Entertainment Center can better take
advantage of forthcoming Internet devices, such as wireless phones
and Web-connected stereo system components.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually moves the player to become a central entertainment
manager, not only for your streaming media but your MP3 files, your
CDs, and it really makes porting music from the desktop to other
devices much simpler,'' Gerbrandt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take too much vision to look down the road and see
Real moving into the consumer electronics space,'' he said.

 SCIENTISTS WAGER ON THE EXACT NUMBER OF HUMAN GENES  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Playful scientists have given a whole new
meaning to the term ``gene pool.''
</P>
<P>
   At a five-day conference last week on the Human Genome Project,
microbiologists took time out from their headache-inducing lectures
to create the scientific equivalent of an office pool.
</P>
<P>
   The event brought several hundred of the world's brainiest
biologists to Long Island, N.Y.'s Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,
headquarters of James Watson, who shared a Nobel Prize for the 1953
discovery of the structure of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   At this august gathering, 27-year-old European computer whiz
Ewin Birney walked around with a notebook soliciting opinions on
the hottest topic in DNA research _ just how many genes there are
in the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   The genome is a stretch of 3 billion chemical letters. After 10
years of work, scientists are on the verge of putting together the
entire sequence from one end to the other.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 95 percent of those chemical letters have no
apparent purpose. Only 5 percent of the letters are thought to
encode genes, which are the bodily equivalent of blueprints that
instruct cells how to make the proteins and enzymes that make our
bodies work.
</P>
<P>
   Previously published estimates of the gene count have gone from
35,000 to 150,000, a range that only serves to illustrate
humankind's collective ignorance about the body's basic software.
</P>
<P>
   Birney collected $1 from each of the 228 participants, who
contributed their own best guesses on the final gene count, which
should be hashed out over the next two years. Birney's collection
of estimates ranged from 27,462 to 200,000. Being a scientific
sort, Birney calculated the mean (62,598), the median (53,700) and
posted the distribution curve on the Web
( &LR; www.ensembl.org/genesweep.html &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   Francis Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research
Institute in Bethesda, Md., and chief U.S. scientist on the Human
Genome Project, got into the spirit of things.
</P>
<P>
   At his speech closing the conference, Collins proposed that, in
addition to the handsome purse, the winner should get an
autographed, leather-bound version of ``The Double Helix,''
Watson's hilarious book about how he and Francis Crick defied
authority and hoodwinked colleagues in order to beat famed American
scientist Linus Pauling to the finding that transformed biology.
</P>
<P>
   Providing that research proceeds on schedule, and scientists
actually agree on the gene count by then, the winner will be
selected at the Cold Spring conference in 2003 _ the 50th
anniversary of the Watson-Crick discovery.
</P>
<P>
   CANCER WATCH: Cancer has become the single largest sector of the
biotechnology industry, and many biotech stocks will rise or fall
this week depending on the research presented at the American
Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day event, which began Saturday, gives drug and biotech
firms a chance to share their latest findings with thousands of
oncologists who treat cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 years after President Richard Nixon declared war on
cancer, science may finally see a light at the end of the tunnel.
Although victory still seems distant, patients are living longer
and suffering less, thanks to new treatments that target cancer
cells more directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that things going through clinical trials today
will cut the death rate in half within five years,'' said Jim
McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter in
Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies presenting research will be Matrix
Pharmaceutical of Fremont, Calif., which is in the final stage of
testing a new chemotherapy agent. Instead of being administered
intravenously and roaming the blood stream, causing hair loss and
other side effects, Matrix's IntraDose is injected into a tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Matrix hopes this will confine the cancer-fighting effects to
the diseased tissues. This morning, the company will take the wraps
off a scientific study that will show whether this is true.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech Inc. will use the conference to unveil the results of
three studies that test a new cancer-fighting theory called
anti-angiogenesis.
</P>
<P>
   Angiogenesis is the term for blood vessel formation, and the
Genentech experiment is meant to show whether it is possible to
slow tumor growth by restricting new blood vessel formation.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Genentech released findings from a Phase II study
suggesting that its anti-angiogenesis agent lengthened the life
span of patients with advanced colorectal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The trial tested 104 patients divided into three groups. One
group received chemotherapy alone. The other two groups received
chemo plus a low or a high dose of the anti-angiogenesis drug.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the low-dose drug plus chemo seemed most
effective. Of the 35 patients in that group, more than half were
still alive after 17.3 months. Of the 36 patients in the chemo-only
cohort, the median survival rate was just 13.8 months. The 33
patients who got the high dose of the Genentech drug fell in
between, with a 16.1 median month survival rate.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Emily Bergsland, an oncologist at the University of
California at San Francisco who worked on the colorectal study,
said the study marks ``the first time an agent designed to block
blood vessel growth has proven effective in a random clinical
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be even greater interest in the data Genentech will
present tomorrow from a study of the same anti-angiogenic compound
used against lung cancer. Of the 67 patients enrolled in the lung
cancer study, six had such severe blood-coughing episodes that four
actually died. So oncologists will likely focus on the safety of
anti-angiogenesis in lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   THE SANTA CLAUSE: Speaking of Genentech, the South San
Francisco, Calif., firm held an uneventful annual meeting last
week. I showed up just to meet Franz Humer, chief executive of
Roche, the Swiss drug firm that owns 59 percent of Genentech. We
exchanged pleasantries during a brief conversation as Humer exited
the public gathering on his way to the private board meeting that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   The only meaningful business conducted during the open session
was the ratification of the new six-member board of directors that
includes Humer and another Roche executive, Jonathan Knowles, in
addition to two Genentech old-timers _ CEO Art Levinson and company
co-founder Herb Boyer _ plus two outside board members.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-votes were overwhelming for all six candidates, but
there was noticeably less enthusiasm for the two men from Roche.
The other four board members registered 245 million yeas, to a
couple of hundred thousand nays. Humer and Knowles got a lower
positive vote total and far more ``votes withheld'' _ 4.8 million
and 6.9 million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   A mere blip, insisted Genentech public relations, not even worth
mention. Perhaps, but there seems to be a molecule or two of
resentment out there in Genentech-land against the company's Swiss
overlords.
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley resident Herb Solomon, a longtime Genentech
shareholder, e-mailed me to complain that Roche was dumping so many
Genentech shares onto the market that it was depressing the stock
price. ``Their corporate greed seems to know no bounds,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But in a follow-up note, Solomon saw the bright side. Last year,
the U.S. government forced Roche to pay a $500 million penalty for
fixing vitamin prices. The sale of Genentech stock, which has
netted Roche over $5 billion dollars, has allowed the Swiss firm to
pay its ``price fixing almost 10 times over,'' Solomon quipped.

 DSL COMPETITION EXPECTED TO HEAT UP  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Flashcom touts its superfast Internet service
with a cartoon turtle, happily sporting aviator's glasses and a
rocket strapped to its back.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, EarthLink, Telocity and more than a dozen other
rivals also are peddling digital-subscriber lines, which offer
speedy access to the Net over telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Taback didn't have a hard decision when he ordered
DSL three months ago. He picked Pacific Bell, th local phone
company. It was the only name he knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have probably heard some ads and read some ads,'' said
Taback, an information systems consultant from Berkeley, Calif.,
``but none of the names (of the other DSL providers) has stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Pacific Bell has been steamrolling the competition in
the race to offer DSL to Bay Area consumers, despite complaints
about poor customer service, installation glitches and slow e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell has installed roughly 100,000 lines to residential
customers in California as of March 31 _ with probably more than
50,000 in the Bay Area alone. That's more than the largest
independent DSL providers have installed nationwide combined.
</P>
<P>
   But Yankee Group analyst Fritz McCormick said rivals could soon
become more aggressive because of something called ``line
sharing.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Pac Bell competitors usually have to install a
separate phone line for DSL, which costs more and is more
cumbersome to set up, discouraging them from signing up consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell, by contrast, can simply use the line already used for
voice calls for little extra cost. But starting June 6, the Federal
Communications Commission has ordered local phone companies to let
DSL competitors piggyback on the lines as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Line sharing will have a terrific effect'' on competition,
McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   But rivals have a lot of catching up to do. Less than a third of
consumers even know there are alternatives to the Baby Bell,
according to national research collected by Northpoint
Communications, a San Francisco DSL wholesale supplier.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Pacific Bell talks about competition, it normally
points to AT&AMP;T, which offers equally fast Internet access over
cable television lines for roughly the same price _ $40 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell spokesman Shawn Dainas said the company believes it has
a narrow lead over AT&AMP;T in the Bay Area. AT&AMP;T, which has well over
50,000 local cable modem customers, isn't sure who is ahead. ``It's
a horse race, that's for sure,'' said spokesman Andrew Johnson.
Neither company will divulge specific figures.
</P>
<P>
   But cable modem service isn't available in many cities,
including Oakland, San Jose and nearly all of San Francisco _
except the Bernal Heights neighborhood. Johnson says it will take
three years to upgrade the coaxial cable lines throughout the
cities. And even where AT&AMP;T says it covers the entire city, like
Berkeley, the company often cannot serve specific homes or
apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, DSL isn't available everywhere either, largely
because it works a short distance from a central switching office,
normally 3 miles.
</P>
<P>
   But since DSL is available in many places where cable isn't,
where are all the other DSL companies?
</P>
<P>
   Experts cite three reasons for Pac Bell's domination:
</P>
<P>
   -- Bigger brand. Think Pacific Bell Park. Think 8.5 million
residential phone customers. Plus, Pac Bell is spending millions
specifically promoting DSL, running radio and TV commercials, print
ads, employing telemarketing and inserting leaflets in local phone
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Even Flashcom's rocket turtle can't keep up. Most DSL providers,
including Telocity and Flashcom, are tiny upstarts with limited
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   And Internet behemoths have done little to promote DSL. America
Online, which carpet-bombed America with computer disks and CD-ROMs
to build a base of 22 million dial-up customers, has signed up only
a few thousand DSL customers. Spokeswoman Marta Grutka said the
company has done only limited telemarketing and online promotion to
get its feet wet before marketing the service more aggressively.
``We don't want to give our users a bad experience,'' Grutka said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Rivals have focused on the corporate market. The three
largest DSL wholesalers, Northpoint, Covad Communications and
Rhythms NetConnections, all estimate that between 80 and 85 percent
of their customers are nonresidential. (Wholesalers provide DSL
service to Internet service provides like Flashcom, Telocity and
others.) Covad Vice President Rich Wong said the company targeted
business customers first because they ``generate higher revenues
and profit margins.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Local phone companies have a big advantage. Pac Bell already
owns the phone lines, so it can charge its Internet arm nothing or
a nominal fee to use them for DSL.
</P>
<P>
   But Pac Bell rivals have traditionally had to install a second
phone line, and then pay $22 per month just to use the copper wires
between the home and the telephone switching office.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rhythms estimates it must spend $200 to $300 more
on installation costs because it has to dispatch technicians to
install the second line.
</P>
<P>
   The extra costs are so steep that Northpoint has mostly avoided
the consumer market because it couldn't make money selling lines
for $40 per month, said Northpoint CEO Liz Fetter. ``We are very
much loath to go beyond our costs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals also accuse Pac Bell of sabotaging their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Covad executives say the company usually has to wait several
weeks, and sometimes longer than a month, for access to a phone
line that should be available in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   An arbitration board just ordered Pac Bell to pay a $27 million
fine last week for dragging its feet providing lines and space in
its offices for Covad equipment. Pac Bell vowed to appeal and said
the judgment was based on old complaints that it has since
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Pac Bell competitors say they'll soon be on a more
even playing field when line sharing begins next month.
</P>
<P>
   How significant is line sharing? A month after the FCC ordered
it to begin this summer, Rhythms announced plans to target
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fundamentally changed the economics of DSL,'' said Mike
Calabrese, Rhythms' vice president of product management. ``We
wanted to position ourselves in the marketplace to be ready to go
when it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Northpoint has teamed up with Radio Shack and MSN,
Microsoft's giant Internet service, to offer DSL to consumers this
summer, after line sharing begins.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Northpoint and Rhythms' costs are coming down. Late
last year, the California Public Utilities Commission slashed the
price of leasing a line for DSL to between $11 and $16. And with
line sharing, a PUC judge tentatively ruled this month that Pac
Bell rivals should be able to share a voice line for less than $6.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the PUC cut the price rivals must pay Pac Bell to
ready a new line to about $40 from $88. It could be lowered
further.
</P>
<P>
   Now DSL competitors are pushing for even lower prices. Rhythms
just signed agreements with Bell Atlantic and US West to rent the
lines for free, because those phone companies do not charge their
Internet operations extra to use the lines for DSL.
</P>
<P>
   They want Pac Bell to do the same. (Pac Bell argues that since
it invested the money to install and maintain the phone lines, it's
absurd to hand it over to competitors for free.)
</P>
<P>
   Rhythms and others also say line sharing will make installation
faster and easier for consumers, who often gripe about having to
wait for DSL technicians who sometimes show up late or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Pac Bell started letting customers in the Bay Area
install DSL themselves. Now with line sharing, rivals say they will
be able to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   And as the playing field becomes more even, several Pac Bell
competitors say they plan to market DSL lines more aggressively to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Cupertino, Calif.'s Telocity, for instance, just started service
in the Bay Area last month and has started using radio and direct
mail to recruit customers. Covad has initiated a $40 million
national ad campaign with its partners.
</P>
<P>
   The added competition could help consumers by keeping prices
down and putting pressure on Pac Bell to improve its service.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell already says it is hiring hundreds more technicians and
support staff, beefing up its computers and going toward
self-installation to help customers. ``We know that customers have
a choice,'' spokesman John Britton said recently.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, other DSL companies have also sparked complaints.
</P>
<P>
   While Pac Bell rates among the worst DSL companies, according to
customer reviews collected on  &LR; www.dslreports.com &LR; , Flashcom, the
company with the happy turtle, is listed as dead last. Several
other DSL companies targeting local consumers are also rated worse
than Pac Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's early in the race, analysts say. Only about 3
percent of Americans have either cable modem service or DSL today.
Cahners In-Stat predicts the number will soar to roughly half by
2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Pac Bell ahead? I guess,'' said Covad's Wong. ``But we are
running hard on their tail.''
</P>
<P>
   But others are betting Pac Bell and other local phone companies
will retain their lead. Telocity executive Joe Harris likens it to
the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two decades after Ma Bell was busted up, AT&AMP;T still
claims 58 percent of the market. But rivals like Sprint and MCI
have become telecommunications giants. And countless smaller
companies have found a niche.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt the (local phone companies) are going to have a large
share of the DSL market,'' said Harris, Telocity's senior director
of market development. ``But that doesn't mean there's nothing for
anyone else.''

 TECH 21: IN PURSUIT OF EVER-SMALLER CIRCUITS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By HENRY NORR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 2000. The San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some of the smartest people in the technology
world are in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not talking about the cops who hunt for pedophiles on AOL or
the D.A.s chasing scam artists on eBay. I'm referring to the
scientists and engineers who enforce Moore's Law, the principle
that the number of transistors that can be packed into a given area
of silicon doubles every 18 to 24 months. It's the technical basis
for the exponential increases in processing power and memory
capacity that have made high tech as we know it possible.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Moore's Law isn't really a law at all, in the
jurisprudential or even the scientific sense. It's simply an
empirical observation _ more like Murphy's or Parkinson's laws than
Ohm's or Boyle's _ first formulated 35 years ago by Intel
co-founder Gordon Moore as he traced the early history of memory
chips.
</P>
<P>
   It's turned out to be an amazingly accurate predictor of
progress since then (see the chart at  &LR; www.intel.com/intel/museum &LR; 
 &LR; /25anniv/hof/moore.htm &LR; ). But compliance with this law doesn't
just happen _ it has always required intense effort and sustained
innovation, not to mention billions of dollars in investment for
R&AMP;D and capital equipment.
</P>
<P>
   That's all the more true as the industry looks to the future.
Some features on today's state-of-the-art chips are only .18 of a
micron wide _ about one-500th the thickness of a human hair. Next
year, .13-micron equipment will go into production, then .1 micron.
</P>
<P>
   By 2005, to keep up with Moore's Law, the industry will have to
be capable of putting features on chips that measure only .07
micron, or 70 nanometers. (A micron is a millionth of a meter; a
nanometer, which for obvious reasons will soon be the standard unit
of measure in this context, is one-billionth of a meter.) And
before the end of the decade, when microprocessors should be
operating at clock speeds somewhere between 5 and 10 gigahertz, the
leading edge will be down to 30 nanometers.
</P>
<P>
   You don't learn to make circuits that small just by parroting
Moore's dictum. Keeping pace depends on a host of breakthroughs not
just in electronics, but also in optical and mechanical
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the industry needs new lithographic technology.
Circuits are etched on chips by shining light through a mask _
essentially, a negative _ at photosensitive material coating the
chip. The industry does that now with something called ``deep
ultraviolet'' (DUV) light, which is beamed through a sequence of
lenses that reduce its image by a factor of four.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the wavelength of DUV, even after optical
reduction, is simply too big to draw circuits as minuscule as will
be needed by mid-decade. So several years ago, the industry
embarked on a search for an NGL _ ``next-generation lithography.''
Companies and trade groups around the world have been exploring and
debating a variety of technologies.
</P>
<P>
   That assessment process is still going on. IBM and Nikon are
promoting a solution called electron-projection lithography. By
most accounts, though, a technology called extreme ultraviolet
(EUV), originally considered a dark horse, has emerged as the clear
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Intel seems to be EUV's chief proponent, but rivals Advanced
Micro Devices and Motorola joined Intel in forming a consortium to
pursue it way back in 1987. This spring, Micron Technology and
Infineon, formerly the semiconductor division of German giant
Siemens, also signed on, and others are expected to enlist soon.
</P>
<P>
   Because several of the U.S. Department of Energy's national labs
in the Bay Area _ Sandia, Lawrence Livermore and Lawrence Berkeley
_ had already done preliminary research on the technology, the
industry consortium turned to them, agreeing to provide 100 percent
of the funding for a multiyear R&AMP;D program. The three labs in turn
decided to form a new entity to run the program; they call it the
Virtual National Lab.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the consortium and the virtual lab held a
briefing on their progress. I got there a little late, having been
delayed by some low-tech troubles (my car caught fire and burned to
the bare metal along Interstate 580!), but I managed to catch most
of the presentations and get a look at some of the prototype
machinery the labs are developing.
</P>
<P>
   While the leaders of the effort focused, understandably, on the
progress they've made, what impressed me most was the challenges
they face. In effect, as they put it, what they're trying to do is
equivalent to etching a quarter on the surface of the Earth from a
space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve such resolution, the equipment has to be almost
totally isolated from vibration. And EUV isn't exactly easy to work
with: Because it's absorbed by air, the lithography process has to
occur in a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   And because EUV's wavelength is so narrow, it won't work with
lenses; to focus and reduce it, lab engineers, building on work
done earlier at Stanford, are developing reflective coatings that
are only 12 to 15 atoms thick and flat to less than the thickness
of a single atom.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they say they're well on their way. They're now building
an ``alpha tool'' _ a prototype EUV lithography machine _ which
they expect to complete next year. A follow-up beta machine is
scheduled for 2003 or 2004. Commercial semiconductor equipment
companies will have access to the prototypes, so they can learn to
build their own versions.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, such machines will go into production in 2005 or 2006
_ and Moore's Law will stay on the books for at least another few
years.
</P>
<P>
   HUNT FOR ET _ ON PC AND MAC: Now that your average desktop
computer has more processing power than whole corporations and
governments did just a few decades ago, and most of that horsepower
sits idle most of the day, wouldn't it be nice if we could put it
to some constructive use _ something more useful than displaying
flying toasters or Windows logos?
</P>
<P>
   Several nonprofit groups are attempting to take advantage of
that opportunity by using extra cycles on ordinary computers to
take on tasks that would otherwise require expensive supercomputer
time.
</P>
<P>
   I've tried several of these ``distributed computing'' schemes,
all of which work roughly the same way: You go to the project's Web
site, sign up and download a chunk of data and a small application
that processes it. The programs are set up to kick in when your
system has been idle for a specified interval; as soon as you move
your mouse or tap a key, they get out of the way. When the program
has finished processing one chunk of data, it sends its results
back to the Web site and grabs another block of data.
</P>
<P>
   These programs also share another attribute: extreme nerdiness.
One, called PiHex, is currently calculating the quadrillionth bit
of Pi, according to its Web site ( &LR; www.cecm.sfu.ca/pr4ojects/pihex &LR; 
 &LR; /pihex.html &LR; ). Another, which calls itself Distributed.net
( &LR; www.distributed.net &LR; ), has run a variety of projects, but mostly
focuses on cracking encryption schemes. (It says its participants'
computers add up to the equivalent of more than 160,000
266-megahertz Pentium II PCs working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,
365 days a year.)
</P>
<P>
   The best-known distributed-computing initiative, however, is
SETIathome, which recently enlisted its 2 millionth participant.
Based at the University of California at Berkeley, the project
invites users to help analyze data collected by a large radio
telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, in hopes of finding hints of
intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. (The raw data is first
snail-mailed, on tape, from Puerto Rico to Berkeley, according to
the project's Web site,  &LR; setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   None of these goals is very high on my personal priority list,
but for want of something better I've recently loaded the latest
version of the SETIathome software on my home machines.
</P>
<P>
   No sign of extraterrestrial life yet, but the effort has
generated some new fuel to throw on an everlasting fire _ the
PC-versus-Mac debate. After 48 hours of work time, my 450-megahertz
Power Mac G4 had completed eight full SETIathome ``work units''
plus 44.5 percent of another. In the same time, a Hewlett-Packard
Pavilion 1G, powered by a 1-gigahertz Intel Pentium III, finished
only five units plus 27.6 percent of another.
</P>
<P>
   Between SETI searches, I've also been doing additional Adobe
Photoshop performance testing on the two machines, and on a
500-megahertz G4 Apple just lent to me, as a follow-up to a sidebar
on the subject I did last month. The results are interesting, and
they don't quite match my original findings, but I'll have to save
the details for another week.
</P>
<P>
   DUMB MISTAKES DEPARTMENT: In last week's column, I referred to
the new laser chips developed by Novalux as ``silicon lasers.''
That's wrong _ they're semiconductors, all right, but they're made
of gallium arsenide, not silicon. In addition, I jumped the gun in
suggesting that Novalux will be in production by the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company says, its Sunnyvale, Calif., fab will go
into full operation this month, but for now it'll be producing only
beta-test chips. Testing probably won't be complete until around
the end of the year.

EDITORIAL: A FAST START BY LAZIO 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, May 22:
</P>
<P>
   With a quick announcement of his candidacy, rapid-fire attacks
on Hillary Rodham Clinton and a sprint across New York state on
Sunday, Rep. Rick Lazio has gotten off to an energetic start in his
race for the Senate. All but anointed for the Republican
nomination, he has not left any time for Republican leaders to
wring their hands over Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's withdrawal. Five
months before the election, the little-known Long Island
congressman must be rated the underdog. But Clinton faces a
challenge in having to adjust to his intensity, and to his strong
drive toward establishing his stature as a credible candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton should also expect an effort to revive the issue of her
not being from New York. By campaigning hard upstate while Giuliani
stayed home, she has overcome some skepticism but may find that
voters outside New York City will see Lazio as a more comfortable
figure than the mayor. Common sense suggests the GOP will find the
money to help Lazio close the gap in the polls. For all the
freshness of the race, there was a certain familiarity to its
themes and politics. Lazio describes himself as a centrist, but in
1995 he voted fairly regularly with Speaker Newt Gingrich in the
budget battles against President Clinton. Mrs. Clinton is certain
to accelerate her attacks on his record of deep cuts in education,
Medicaid, Medicare and environmental programs. On the talk-show
circuit yesterday, Lazio tried to dismiss these actions as not
relevant, but his record will surely be thrown back at him.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking on Sunday of repairing New York's roads and
empowering its average citizens, Lazio was casting himself in the
Republican populist mold of his fellow Long Islander, Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato. But he could draw fire because of his prodigious record of
fund-raising among those interests that have business before him on
the Commerce and Banking Committees.
</P>
<P>
   The other familiar feature to the race is its reliance on the
traditional building blocks for electoral success in New York.
Against Giuliani, who was likely to get at least a third of the
vote in traditionally Democratic New York City, Clinton was under
tremendous pressure to build up support in traditional Republican
areas of the suburbs and upstate. She can now probably count on
winning the city at least three to one and may not have to do as
well outside it. Upstate, Clinton has presented herself as a kind
of Daughter of the Great Lakes and has made great inroads,
according to opinion polls. Ironically, Giuliani has always had his
greatest popularity in the New York suburbs, where Lazio should
also do his best.
</P>
<P>
   Although New York and the nation relished a Giuliani-Clinton
showdown, the focus on the mayor's health and personal life had, in
a curious way, diverted attention from the electoral competition.
Lazio's weekend blitz seemed likely to reignite voter interest in a
race that will still be one of the most watched in the country. Its
new dynamics will test Lazio's ability to adjust to a broader arena
and test Clinton's resilience and flexibility. New Yorkers are
fortunate to still have a lively contest of issues, ideas and
personalities.

<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Basketball playoff season reminds me of the reaction of my young
nephew Chris Nieroth to an invitation to his first Knicks playoff
game. Chris was an avid Knicks fan who was thrilled with the gift
of a No. 33 jersey like that of his favorite player, Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   When we offered Chris and his dad the use of our season seats
for an early playoff game, his excitement was boundless. His only
question was whether we thought he should wear his new jersey. He
seemed eager but a little troubled by the idea. When questioned
about his reluctance, my nephew, a 5-year-old, 4-foot-tall towhead,
replied: ``But what if they think I'm Patrick Ewing?''

in midtown when she heard the restaurant's staff serenading a

   A friend on a Madison Avenue bus recently became fed up, as did
most of the other passengers, by a young woman having an
interminable, and loud, conversation on her cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Just before a stop, another woman got up and said to the woman
on the phone: ``Here, it might be more convenient for you to attach
the phone to your ear.''
</P>
<P>
   She then delved into a bag, handed the stunned woman some glue,
and made a triumphant exit off the bus. The remaining passengers
didn't applaud, but there were some heartfelt ``Good for you''
comments as she alighted, and smiles, giggles and laughter _ with
one exception.

   Jerry Waisman was walking along First Avenue at noon on a balmy
day and turned the corner onto 30th Street. He and everyone else in
the vicinity noticed a muscular young man coming toward them from
Second Avenue. The young man tried, without success, to get a cab.
After a short time he gave up, walked to a brownstone and
disappeared through a doorway.
</P>
<P>
   There was one unusual thing about the sighting, which also
stopped other passers-by in their tracks: The young man, who had
been walking unconcernedly, was wearing nothing but white socks and
a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he couldn't get a cab because the drivers could see that
he didn't have a wallet, Waisman suggested.

walked into a Starbucks in our West Side building late one evening.
He asked for a large cup of coffee.

<P>
   Friend: A large coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Clerk: Do you want a venti?

<P>
   Friend: Right, and I don't have to buy coffee here.
</P>
<P>
   He turned and walked out of the store.
</P>
<P>
   The next evening he returned, assuming the same clerk would not
be working. As he approached the counter, the clerk _ the same one

   My wife, Sheila, and I went to the Angelika Film Center to see
Stanley Tucci's movie ``Joe Gould's Secret.'' I sat in the car
while she checked the starting time and learned that the movie was
not playing there.
</P>
<P>
   We went around the corner to find a newspaper with theater
listings, and as I parked, whom did I see standing there but
Stanley Tucci. ``Your movie isn't playing here,'' I said, and he
replied that no, it wasn't, but he told us where it was playing _
in the East Village, uptown and on the West Side. Only in New York
can you get directed to a movie by the director himself.

   One of my favorite New York stories took place in Ohio. I was in
a secondhand bookstore in Columbus and noticed a man and a woman
talking with the proprietor. He was telling them about a mall where
the store had additional books for sale. The mall was about an
hour's drive on the freeway and the owner was describing how to get
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're from New York; we don't know anything,'' the woman said.
Although I hadn't been included in the conversation, I couldn't
resist. ``You know, it's really unusual to hear somebody say `We're
from New York and we don't know anything,''' I said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman turned to me and offered an explanation. ``We're from
upstate, not the city,'' she said. ``It makes a big difference.''

LAZIO CAMPAIGN TRIES TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Rep. Rick A. Lazio raced through the first half
of a two-day Senate campaign fly-around Sunday, scrambling to
present himself to voters here and in Rochester, Syracuse and
Binghamton as a viable statewide alternative to his richly funded
and well-traveled opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But less than 48 hours after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani withdrew
from the race because of his prostate cancer, Lazio had already
accomplished two things the mayor had never done: He had officially
announced his candidacy, and he had embarked on an extensive,
multi-city upstate tour with his wife and two young daughters that
is to take him to Elmira, Watertown, Utica, Albany and Westchester
County on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio family stayed overnight in the Holiday Inn in Elmira.
In his infrequent trips upstate this year, Giuliani always returned
in the evening to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be here so often, I'm going to be sweating
Buffalo wings,'' Lazio told a modest but lustily cheering crowd in
a terminal of the Buffalo International Airport. Moments before, he
had stepped off a seven-seat, two-engine jet, which was hastily
chartered for the trip. ``This campaign has been a 40-hour
miracle,'' said Lazio's freshly hired political consultant, Mike
Murphy, who three months ago was advising Sen. John McCain on the
``Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio then introduced his wife, Patricia, and daughters Molly
Ann, 7, and Kelsey, 6, to the crowd. ``We're here because we're a
family operation, because we believe in family values,'' Lazio
said. It was a pointed contrast to Giuliani, who never once
campaigned in this race with his family and who announced this
month that he had a ``very good'' female friend and was seeking a
separation from his wife, Donna Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   At every stop, Lazio presented himself as the wholesome,
earnest, fresh-faced stand-in, without the irritability of the old
Giuliani or the philosophical soul-searching of the new. What he
lacked in star quality or moody complexity, he made up for in
energy. Even before he began his four-city upstate swing about
noon, Lazio gave a commencement speech on Long Island and
interviews to six morning news programs in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Lazio said he would accept the
Independence Party endorsement, even if Pat Buchanan was at the top
of the ticket. Both Clinton and Giuliani, at varying times, have
called Buchanan anti-Semitic and divisive.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's first upstate stop was Buffalo, where he was happily
greeted by the very same party leaders who only three weeks ago had
rallied around Giuliani on his first upstate trip since announcing
he had prostate cancer. For anyone who had been to both events, the
sudden change in candidates was disorienting, like watching a play
where the lead had been switched. But the overriding reaction of
party leaders, who had agonized while the mayor agonized, was
relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``As every day went by and there was no decision, I thought he
was staying in,'' Robert E. Davis, the Erie County Republican
chairman, said of Giuliani. ``I'm glad it's over; I'm glad that the
decision was made.'' Although Lazio is a virtual unknown outside
his Suffolk County home base, Davis added, he is confident that
that will change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a couple of weeks, he's going to be pretty close to
being a household name,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   At each stop Sunday, Lazio introduced himself to New Yorkers,
without the aid of a Clintonesque biographical video, as ``the son
of a guy who came back from World War II without a dime in his
pocket.'' His parents' first date, he told the crowd, was at Ebbets
Field, and his father built a business from scratch by borrowing
$700. Over and over, Lazio described himself as ``a home-grown''
boy, the kind who ``never needed an exploratory committee to find
western New York.''
</P>
<P>
   But as his last-minute tour made clear, Lazio faces enormous
challenges upstate _ territory that traditionally should be his
against a Democrat, but where Clinton was recently running even
with Giuliani in several polls. For nearly a year, Clinton has
campaigned extensively upstate, and seems to genuinely like it
here. Recently she proudly told reporters accompanying her one
early morning to see a waterfall in Wyoming County: ``You travel
with me, and you see New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also has $9 million in the bank compared with Lazio's
$3.5 million. One big question is whether he will be able to
harvest campaign contributions as prodigiously as Giuliani; the
mayor's advisers say his campaign was grossing $1 million a week
before he announced he had prostate cancer. (After the
announcement, the advisers say, the gross weekly contributions were
$600,000 to $750,000.)
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said repeatedly Sunday that he was up to the challenge.
``I know this is not just going to come to me,'' he told the crowd
in Buffalo. ``I know I have to earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   At each stop, Lazio presented himself as a moderate, despite his
alliance with Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House. He
said that he favored abortion rights but was against a form of
late-term abortion that opponents call ``partial birth.'' He also
said that he was in favor of ``reasonable measures to support the
rights of sportsmen,'' meaning that he was against gun
registration.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also frequently attacked Clinton, echoing the language of
his speech announcing his candidacy on Saturday. He said that she
is ``on the far left-wing of the Democratic Party,'' that she is
``no more a New Democrat than she is a New Yorker'' and that ``I
can't call on Air Force One whenever I need a ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded that ``I was a little disappointed yesterday
that my latest opponent has already started hurling insults instead
of what we can do to improve the lives of New Yorkers.'' Howard
Wolfson, Clinton's press secretary, added that ``it sounds like the
Rick Lazio statewide insult tour, day two.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gov. George Pataki nor the state Republican Party
chairman, William D. Powers, accompanied Lazio across the state
Sunday, but Lazio did take a call from the governor during his stop
in Buffalo. As a practical matter, there was no room on the plane.
Lazio and his family took up four seats, Murphy took a fifth, and a
press aide and a staff aide took up the remaining two.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said that the campaign's biggest short-term challenge is
``mechanically, we're just trying to deal with the explosive growth
of the campaign.'' He added that Lazio ``knows he's the underdog,
he knows he's going to be outspent, he knows he's going to be
behind for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel A. Giambra, the Erie County executive, said that he is
excited about Lazio, and that even though the candidate does not
have the ``star quality'' of Giuliani, he is the person ``who can
take on the 800-pound gorilla.''

SPORTS COLUMN: ONCE AND FOR ALL, THE HEAT FALLS  

</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Sunday was the final day in a battle of cliches. Pat
Riley, emperor and coach of the Miami Heat, exhorted his team with
``once and for all.'' After being eliminated by these Knicks the
previous two seasons, Miami could break this spell once and for
all. Jeff Van Gundy, the Knicks' coaching prince-in-waiting,
challenged his team to get to the ``ultimate game.'' Get the ball
and get to the ultimate game, Game 7
</P>
<P>
   Once and for all. The ultimate game. Somehow in the alchemy of
great competition, the teams came close to achieving their goals:
the Knicks got to their ultimate game; Miami very nearly exorcised
that New York ghost. In the end, Miami lost, 83-82, and its season
was over.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' victory was so enthralling that even Van Gundy, the
latter-day Lonesome George Gobel, could not hide his satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so proud of what this team has accomplished,'' Van Gundy
said. ``To come in here and win three times is something special.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Van Gundy's ultimate game; in a basketball sense, it
was Riley's most disastrous hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is tough to take,'' Riley said. ``This is a familiar
feeling; I didn't think it would happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   From start to finish in these Eastern Conference semifinals,
each game was like a civil war for the teams, who are part of the
same basketball nation: Riley, the former coach of the Knicks, who
pulled the franchise from the ashes and then left in an ugly
dispute; Van Gundy, who was once Riley's assistant and took over,
building a team in Riley's general image. Riley even has Van
Gundy's younger brother, Stan, on his bench.
</P>
<P>
   After yesterday's loss, Riley appeared with face reddened and
eyes downcast, though Miami brought this on itself. On Friday, the
Heat squandered an 18-point lead and lost. Yesterday's loss was a
slow roast.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat started so strong, with Alonzo Mourning dominating and
Tim Hardaway showing flashes of his old brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   But this game had such rapidly changing currents. The Heat led
by 9 points at the end of the first quarter; by intermission
Latrell Sprewell had caught fire and ignited a push that gave the
Knicks the lead. The currents continued to change until Miami was
knocked out of the playoffs by the Knicks for the third consecutive
year.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy was as compassionate as an opponent could be without
conceding the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for them,'' he said. ``I want to win, but I feel for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy challenged his team the last two weeks as he watched
the Knicks get pushed around, outhustled, beaten, it seemed, to
every loose ball. The Heat and Knicks went about this second-round
series in peekaboo fashion: lose a game, win a game; lose a game,
win a game; lose a game, win a game.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday he challenged the Knicks to have the guts to play for
the ultimate game, Game 7. They did, and yesterday the Knicks
pulled off a harrowing victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell surged in the second quarter and Chris Childs in the
fourth, and Ewing, playing his second dominating game in less than
48 hours, floored the Heat with a crushing dunk. He was the
exclamation point on a whip-around series of passes that went from
Childs to Sprewell to Larry Johnson to Ewing, who caught, stepped
and dunked the Heat out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   All the loose balls the Knicks lost, they got; the rebounds that
got away, they grabbed. Where before they had unwittingly fallen
into the Heat's defensive trap, yesterday the Knicks attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Someone said this was the greatest early-round series of all
time. Who knows? Better than those knockdown, drag-out series with
Baltimore in 1970 when the Knicks won, 4-3? Better than the 1971
series with Baltimore that they lost, 4-3?
</P>
<P>
   All Pat Riley knew was that this was the best one he had been
involved with, and he has been a coach and a player in the National
Basketball Association for almost 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in 13 world championships finals and I've never been
part of a finals that's had as much intensity and as much effort,
as much caring, as much everything as something prior to getting to
the finals,'' he said. ``You have to understand that this was a
very unique matchup. One team just ran out of clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley complained that the game had been determined by the
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been part of a game when officials were deciding
games on perimeter fouls,'' he said. ``It's hard for a team to
take. It just is.'' He said they were not shooting fouls, ``just
touch fouls and bailout fouls.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult, Riley said, ``for a team that has worked hard to
lose that way. I'd rather lose on what happened with Patrick with a
blatant dunk.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Heat made just 11 of 21 foul shots; the Knicks were 28
of 31. ``You got to step up and knock those down,'' Riley
conceded.''
</P>
<P>
   A third knockout loss to the Knicks made it that much worse.
``There's not much more we can learn from it,'' Riley said,
``because we've been here already a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   The future is just beginning for Van Gundy. Last year he played
with a team whose makeup was not necessarily to his liking, in a
truncated season, and reached the NBA. finals. This team, this
style is Van Gundy's from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Now for all the talk beforehand, the Knicks have to forget this
game and move on to Indiana. For one day, however, the Knicks did
play an ultimate game. &QL;

BLAZERS AREN'T CONVINCED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When is a 15-point Lakers victory not convincing?
</P>
<P>
   When you're the Portland Trail Blazers, you were on the wrong
end of that 109-94 score, and you've had all night to sort out the
excuses - Rasheed Wallace's ejection and the Lakers' unconscious
shooting though not the Blazers' questionable hack-a-Shaq tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning the Blazers awoke, went back to Staples Center to
practice, and sounded confident of taking away the Lakers'
home-court advantage by winning Game 2 of the NBA Western
Conference Finals tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a must-win, but it's a win that we want,'' guard
Damon Stoudamire said. ``We feel we can play with those guys. We
feel we just ran into a team (Saturday) that had about 10 guys get
hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoudamire thought he knew how to prevent a recurrence of the
second-quarter burst in which the Lakers made five 3-pointers to
expand a 30-28 lead to 52-30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were (the kind of uncontested) shots you get when you're
playing shooting games before practice. If we can get a hand in
their face, it can be different,'' Stoudamire said. ``I just think
Robert Horry, Rick Fox, those kind of players, if you give them
those shots, you give them a little confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers (those kind of players) plan some changes
tonight. Among the obvious:
</P>
<P>
   -Tighten their defensive rotations.
</P>
<P>
   -Keep Wallace in the game. The power forward earned his second
technical foul with 6:43 to play in the third quarter, having
scored 11 points in 16 minutes, after defying referee Ron
Garretson's order not to ``stare'' at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the answer to it, but I do know the result I'd
like, I'd like Rasheed to stay on the court,'' Blazers coach Mike
Dunleavy said, while Wallace was refusing interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy ridiculed Garretson's charge, picked up by an NBC
microphone, that Wallace was ``trying to intimidate me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know the officials got intimidated,'' the coach said.
``They're the ones who have all the power. ... I think you (a
referee) need to have a little more leeway in certain situations,
and I think yesterday was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq's probably not going to get thrown out of a game for
staring, and Shaquille O'Neal is a lot more intimidating than
Rasheed Wallace, in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Stoudamire: ``He's so emotional, that's how he plays the
game. He's just got to not let the refs beat him. Because if the
refs don't, the Lakers don't have anyone who can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   -Get Arvydas Sabonis involved early. The center wasn't involved
at all in Game 1, totaling 0 points and 1 rebound in 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   As for the adjustment fans everywhere would like to see: No, the
Blazers don't intend to abandon their strategy of fouling the weak
free-throw-shooting O'Neal in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was ugly Saturday, and it didn't help the Blazers, who
trailed by double figures before and after. Fouled 12 times in the
closing 5 minutes, O'Neal sank 12 of 24 free throws, right on his
season stats.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's called for, we'll do it,'' Dunleavy said.
``Basically it's somewhat of a high-percentage play. ... You try
for 2 (points) for (the Lakers') 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until (O'Neal) shows he can make free throws, it's going to
continue to be done.''

WIRED (Undated) In the battle to steal each other's cable and phone
customers in the Valley, high-tech giants Cox and US West are
employing a decidedly low-tech tool: shoe leather. Cox, formerly
just a cable provider, is stepping into the phone business,
assigning sales people to trudge through Phoenix area suburban
neighborhoods in search of US West's 1.2 million cable customers.
US West has taken to the streets of west Chandler and other Valley
communities, pushing to sign up some of the 615,000 households that
pay Cox for their cable TV. By BRUNO J. NAVARRO. Story will move in

EDITORIAL: TAKING ON THE NRA 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, May 22:
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association's annual convention over the
weekend in Charlotte, N.C., drew nowhere near the massive crowd
that took part in last week's Million Mom March for more stringent
gun control laws. But the NRA's power has never depended on
rallying vast numbers of people or even favorable opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the mothers' march itself was largely an expression of
frustration over the NRA's ability to block gun control in Congress
and the state legislatures even in the face of surveys showing that
many more Americans endorse gun control than oppose it _ as well as
the depressingly frequent outbreaks of gunfire in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control leaders are now considering how best to channel the
energy of the Mother's Day event into a sustained grass-roots
political movement. Their first order of business is to focus on
why their opponents are so successful. The NRA's dominance rests
mainly on intensity and intimidation. It says it has 3.6 million
dues-paying members, a figure seven times larger than the
contributors list of the leading gun control advocacy group,
Handgun Control Inc. More important is the NRA's relatively small
core of super-dedicated members, who can be relied upon to blanket
Congress with letters, phone calls and e-mail on a moment's notice,
making it appear that the pro-gun constituency is larger than it
really is.
</P>
<P>
   To reinforce the pressure on Congress, the NRA raises millions
of dollars that it then spreads around as campaign contributions to
its loyal supporters. It also has a long track record of punishing
those who dare deviate from the NRA line by making direct donations
to their opponents, and by running ``issue ads'' attacking them _
sometimes disguising the NRA's sponsorship by raising an issue
other than gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA also employs a large number of lobbyists who use their
knowledge of how laws are written and their close ties to key
legislators to water down popular gun control proposals when
outright opposition would be politically impossible. Promoting
weaker alternatives, and hiding behind calls for stricter
enforcement of existing laws _ something everybody supports _ the
NRA has succeeded in tying up the modest gun control package that
passed the Senate after the Columbine High School massacre last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the gun control side, NRA leaders have a
tendency to say offensive things that undermine their
organizational and monetary advantages. An example was the
suggestion in March by the group's executive vice president, Wayne
LaPierre, that President Clinton was ``willing to accept a certain
level of killing to further his political agenda.'' The recent
boast by the NRA's first vice president, Kayne Robinson, that the
NRA would have an office in George W. Bush's White House was not a
whole lot smarter.
</P>
<P>
   The gun control movement needs to be ready to take advantage of
these flubs _ much as Handgun Control recently did by running a
television commercial publicizing Robinson's indiscreet bragging.
But that is obviously not enough. For too long, the NRA has gotten
away with shoddy arguments unsupported by empirical evidence, like
the assertion that keeping a loaded handgun handy to use against a
possible intruder makes homes safer when, in fact, the opposite is
true.
</P>
<P>
   If it is to succeed, the gun control movement must be prepared
to step up its own public education efforts and to counteract the
NRA's lobbying efforts. That, in turn, means raising more money and
building a professional staff. But mostly it means putting pressure
on lawmakers using the movement's best asset _ the huge
constituency of voters in districts all around the country,
including a large number of suburban women, who are fed up with
gridlock on gun control.

WAL-MART'S REMAINING HYPERMART STORE TO BECOME SMALLER
SUPERCENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Sam Walton's trip to Kansas City in February
1990 was one of triumph.
</P>
<P>
   The Wal-Mart founder who started his retail empire with a small
store in a small town had come to Kansas City to open his magnum
opus: the Hypermart USA on Hillcrest Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited I can hardly stand it,'' Walton said that day
inside the giant ``mall without walls,'' a concept touted as one
that would change the way Americans shop.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, the experiment is over and Hypermarts are dead.
And a Kansas City councilman may have played a role in knocking off
the final one.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. announced last week that it would spend
$4.9 million to convert Kansas City's Hypermart USA to a Wal-Mart
Supercenter.
</P>
<P>
   At nearly 270,000 square feet, the store was the largest of the
company's four Hypermarts. The others have already been converted
or closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hypermarts were too big and too inconvenient for customers,''
said Wal-Mart spokesman Nef Garcia. He could not provide
information on store sales and profits.
</P>
<P>
   As for what Sam Walton, who died in 1992, would think of the
demise, Garcia speculated, ``I think he would be proud that we
responded to what our customers wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The hypermarket concept, which sells practically every consumer
product short of cars and major appliances, was more of a European
style of retail.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, to
abandon the style probably means it will be awhile before Americans
again see such massive stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Wal-Mart can't break into the hypermarket line, I don't
think other retailers would even try,'' said Bruce Van Kleeck, vice
president of retail operations for the National Retail Federation,
a trade association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean Wal-Mart did anything wrong _ they do their
homework. It may mean American shoppers just weren't ready for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an irony, Van Kleeck said: In an effort to be so convenient
as to offer everything under one roof, the Hypermart was
overwhelming to the shopper.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City 6th District Councilman Chuck Eddy put a different
spin on the story.
</P>
<P>
   He said his office received so many complaints about
deteriorating conditions at Hypermart that he pressured Wal-Mart
officials to make improvements at the store.
</P>
<P>
   And, Eddy said, he used leverage.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart wants to build a new store on State Line Road just
north of 135th Street. The project, which requires approval from
Kansas City officials, is opposed by neighbors in that area.
</P>
<P>
   According to Eddy, he told Wal-Mart officials that the
likelihood of getting approval for the new store would be greatly
enhanced if improvements were made at Hypermart, which is east of
Interstate 435 between 87th Street and Bannister Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want you going in there (to the new site) and doing
the same that you did at Hypermart,'' Eddy said he told Wal-Mart
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about Hypermart included trash in the parking lot,
dirty restrooms and overall messy conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very disappointed in the company for letting it get to
that point,'' Eddy said.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, the Wal-Mart spokesman, declined to comment on Eddy's
leverage, but did acknowledge that Eddy approached the company with
concerns about conditions at Hypermart. He said the company has
brought in a new manager to oversee the improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation is set to begin in July, Garcia said. Company
officials haven't decided on all the changes, but the plan
generally calls for the store's layout to be similar to other
supercenters, though larger.
</P>
<P>
   The red, white and blue facade will be replaced by the softer
blue shade seen on other Wal-Mart stores.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible Sam Walton wouldn't be surprised at the
changeover. That day a decade ago when he toured the new Hypermart,
he tempered his glee with caution.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City shoppers were not used to buying jeans, garden
fertilizer and a pot roast in one stop. And they certainly weren't
used to a store of more than a quarter-million square feet.
</P>
<P>
   The new Hypermart opened with 850 employees and 53 check-out
stands.
</P>
<P>
   Then 71, ailing and the richest man in America, Walton said the
store on Hillcrest would be the last Hypermart for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his trademark Wal-Mart hat, he said: ``We'll see how
this one goes and then we'll decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart never built another.

KANSAS CITY A STOP ON THE ROAD TO HEALING FOR FRIENDS OF SLAIN GAY
STUDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 MARY SANCHEZ  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Alex Trout and Walt Boulden moved to Kansas
City seeking refuge.
</P>
<P>
   They needed time to trudge the emotional path of grieving.
</P>
<P>
   The men were close friends of Matthew Shepard, the 21-year-old
Wyoming college student whose death became a symbol of violence
against gays after he had been pistol-whipped, hung on a rural
fence and left to die in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City was a good place to hunker down and do the healing
I needed to do,'' said Boulden, who has friends in St. Joseph, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The city also is where the two friends have begun to make sense
of a senseless death, to find a positive outcome for their loss.
</P>
<P>
   HELIOS-KC, a project to train police to better deal with gay and
lesbian people, is their answer. The acronym stands for Human
Equality Through Legislation, Innovation, Organization and
Sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   They have finished two-hour sessions with recruits from the
Kansas City, Kan., Police Department and with about 80 workers at
the Johnson County, Kan., Juvenile Detention Center. Other
departments are considering the training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our recruits to be sensitive to all citizens,'' said
Lt. Randall Murphy, director of training for the Kansas City, Kan.,
academy. ``And we have zero tolerance for any kind of same-sex
harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   HELIOS discussed stereotypes of gay people and coached the
recruits on how to differentiate between an assault and domestic
abuse in a homosexual relationship, especially if the people are
not openly gay.
</P>
<P>
   HELIOS' efforts are grass-roots. There is no budget, no staff.
</P>
<P>
   Trout, 23, sandwiches his efforts around work as a hotel clerk.
Boulden, 47, fits in the work between remodeling his 1908 Northeast
home and writing a book.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have no criticism of how police in Wyoming handled the
Shepard case.
</P>
<P>
   It was an incident here that sparked the idea for HELIOS.
</P>
<P>
   Trout was assaulted last June while talking with friends early
one morning in Penn Valley Park. A man grabbed him from his car and
beat him in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Trout reported the attack but said a police officer told him,
``That is known as fag park so unless you are a fag you shouldn't
be up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Trout filed a complaint. But he didn't think police would follow
up, so he began to focus on having them handle such incidents with
more sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget Alex Trout,'' said Kansas City police Maj.
Anthony G. Ell, whom Trout called after the incident. ``I'll never
forget how passionate he is in his thoughts and ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Trout persuaded Ell to push for changing a police discrimination
policy so it would include gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Ell said he did not think the department had a problem with
homophobia.
</P>
<P>
   ``But because it is not specifically in our policy, that wasn't
the perception Alex was able to draw because everyone else was
covered but his group,'' Ell said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Office of Citizen Complaints finished its
investigation. The officer was disciplined for making the slur and
the office recommended sensitivity training to help police serve
gay and lesbian people, said I. Pearl Fain, director of the office.
</P>
<P>
   Trout, who calls himself a ``reluctant activist,'' is buoyed by
local departments' willingness to listen.
</P>
<P>
   And Boulden said HELIOS was a fitting tribute to Shepard, who
wanted to work on human-rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   Boulden is one of the last people who spoke with Shepard. The
two friends planned to see a movie to celebrate Boulden's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard canceled, saying he wanted to study at a bar students
used as a hangout.
</P>
<P>
   The next day Boulden was called by Shepard's parents, who were
living in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard had been found by bicyclists, his skull crushed, his
face pistol-whipped and his body left hanging like a scarecrow on a
wooden fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear was his murder wouldn't be reported for what it was, a
hate crime,'' Boulden said.
</P>
<P>
   Boulden thought the Laramie newspaper would downplay the story
to prevent bad publicity. Boulden and Trout called friends working
for larger Wyoming newspapers, urging them to cover the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing I knew, I was being contacted by The Washington
Post, The New York Times, `20//20,' everybody,'' Boulden said.
``Every time I would hang up the phone, it would ring again.''
</P>
<P>
   The story and its horrible details continued to spread. Two men
were convicted of Shepard's death after they lured him under the
pretense they were also gay.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard stayed alive, breathing with a respirator, for several
days. Reporters staked out the hospital. Boulden and Trout sneaked
up back staircases to visit their friend privately.
</P>
<P>
   They also began to lobby for increased acceptance of gay and
lesbian people, speaking on the steps of the nation's Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Gay and lesbian advocates credit outrage after Shepard's murder
with legislative efforts in 35 states to ensure homosexuals are
protected by hate- crime laws. Missouri is one of seven states
where the legislation passed. Kansas has no such laws.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Boulden nor Trout wanted to attend the trial. Boulden
had just finished the research for his social work dissertation,
``How Can You Be Gay and Live in Wyoming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After the murder, every time I picked it up to go through the
research, it had a completely different meaning,'' he said of the
doctoral work.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard had read through the interviews and encouraged Boulden
to study college-age people, too. Friends in St. Joseph encouraged
Boulden to move. He had a job at a local college, but a hiring
freeze thwarted the position.
</P>
<P>
   Trout tagged along, also needing a place to find solace from the
media attention in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised that it is not OK to cry,'' Trout said. ``So it
took me awhile to actually deal with the fact that he was dead.
Even to this day I don't know that I have come to terms with it.''

US WEST, COX FIGHT FOR CUS
 TOMERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 BY BRUNO J. NAVARRO 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Unddated) - In the battle to steal each other's cable and phone
cus tomers in the Phoenix area, high-tech giants Cox and US West
are employ ing a decidedly low-tech tool: shoe leather.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, formerly just a cable provider, is stepping into the phone
business, assigning sales people to trudge through suburban
neighborhoods in search of US West's 1.2 million cable customers.
</P>
<P>
   US West has taken to the streets of west Chandler and other
Phoenix area communities, pushing to sign up some of the 615,000
households that pay Cox for their cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech oasis that is Chandler may be the center of the
battle being waged in the Phoenix area for the hearts _ and
pocketbooks _ of households seeking superfast connec tions to the
Internet and state-of-the-art access to entertainment program ming.
The Phoenix area war between Cox and US West is the only one of its
kind in the nation, largely because of the Phoenix area'sstatus as
a fast-growing metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   The contest is paying dividends for phone and cable customers.
In the quest for new business, each com pany is offering services
such as digital cable, digital telephone and high-speed Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   The foot soldiers on the front lines harken to another era, long
before telemarketing or e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   They are door-to-door salespeople.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Rummel hawks digital services for US West. One recent
evening, he stepped through the streets of west Chandler in the
hopes of catching potential new clients at home.
</P>
<P>
   During one sales pitch, he told a Chandler resident: ``We're
here to replace Cox cable.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Cox salesman Michael Lamacchia rattled off the households he's
sold on digital services as he navigated a company pickup truck
along the meandering streets of southeast Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go steal some phone custom ers,'' Lamacchia said.
</P>
<P>
   These are the trenches of the tele communications war. And what
hap pens here over the next few years could foreshadow what happens
across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the two companies have blurred the lines of what
they sell.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of new houses, affluent households and
tech-savvy residents has made Chandler a prime focus for the
digital revolution. Parts of Peoria and Scottsdale are also heating
up.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Rheam, a locksmith wearing his Motorola employee ID tag, an
swered the door and listened to Rummel run down the list of fea
tures US West offers.
</P>
<P>
   He was interested and asked a few questions, hoping for a
package that would save him money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to talk to my wife before I commit to anything, even
if it's free,'' he demurred.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Rheam said he had heard good things about the new
digital services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a son-in-law that has the US West cable and has the
voice messaging. They like it an awful lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cox has been hitting us pretty hard, obviously, because this
is their territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamacchia thanked him and handed over some literature before
heading back to his red Geo Metro to look for cars in driveways, a
telltale sign of who's home.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are giving away some services. Free installation,
one to three months of free digital cable, long-distance phone
rates of 7 cents a minute have been mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Competing campaigns to win a larger share of the market have
consisted of skirmishes to capture one household at a time. And
residents are getting caught in the marketing crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Brittain stepped out his door, stopping to listen to a
US West sales pitch as he took out the garbage. He listened, asks a
few questions and said he'll think it over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got the other guys trying to take over my phone line,''
he said afterward. ``With the calls, the mail, the visits, it gets
a little old, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an indicator that at least some residents are beginning
to tire of the intensifying push for new customers, one taped a
note to the front door that read: ``No solicita tions. No sales.
Leave packages at the door.''

   OLATHE, Kan. _ The island of Pohnpei is a long way from Olathe.
Only about 33,000 people inhabit the speck of volcanic rock in the
Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, one of them ended up at the Johnson County
Courthouse in 1998 needing an English-Pohnpeian interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   The case illustrates the growing challenge for court officials
to provide _ and pay for _ translators for an increasingly diverse
immigrant population.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Johnson County, court officials had to find
interpreters who spoke Arabic, Bengali, Cantonese, Farsi, German,
Hmong, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Mandarin Chinese, Polish,
Punjabi, Russian, Serbian, Somali, Spanish, Thai, Tigrinya, Turkish
and Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   The court is required by law to provide interpreters for any
non-English-speaking person who requests it _ even if that person
speaks Pohnpeian. (It took several days and a long-distance
telephone link to California, but officials found their Pohnpeian
interpreter.)
</P>
<P>
   The county spent $82,200 last year to provide interpreter
services for court proceedings. That was up from $59,000 in 1998.
And so far this year, the county has spent 33 percent more than in
the same period last year, according to Cynthia Bricker, purchasing
coordinator in the court administrator's office.
</P>
<P>
   Once a minor chore, arranging for interpreters now takes up
about 20 percent, or one work day, of Bricker's time every week.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County, Mo., Circuit Court officials said they also had
seen an interpreter increase, but their costs were roughly the same
for 1998 and 1999. Jackson County spent $17,000 to $18,000 each of
the last two years, according to the court administrator's office.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County's costs may be lower than Johnson County's
because Jackson County pays interpreters only for the time they
work, not for the two or three hours the interpretation services
often set as their minimum charge. Jackson County also does not pay
for mileage and other expenses as Johnson County does.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Castillo is the dean of Johnson County court interpreters.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo, of Overland Park, has worked for more than a decade in
the county's courts, as well as in federal and municipal courts.
The workload, he said, is now ``much, much, much more.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Yolanda Bustamante, also of Overland Park, provide the
bulk of Spanish interpretation services in Johnson County.
</P>
<P>
   It takes more than just being able to speak two languages to be
a good interpreter, said Castillo, who grew up in New Mexico and
once worked in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people who claim to be bilingual are just semiliterate in
two languages,'' Castillo said.
</P>
<P>
   The job requires a thorough knowledge of courtroom procedures
and legal terminology.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante, a lawyer in her native Peru, said she once listened
to an interpreter explain a court diversion program by using a
Spanish word for ``party.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Castillo and Bustamante do when they meet new
clients is find out what country they are from and how much
schooling they have had. The interpreters adjust their language
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their clients come from countries where there is extreme
mistrust and fear of the legal systems, Castillo said. When
attorneys explain to clients what options they have in the United
States, many ask the interpreters for their advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are surprised and have a hard time believing that they
have choices,'' Castillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante and Castillo said they could earn more providing
interpreting services in business, but courtroom work is
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest service Bustamante has provided occurred
last year in the case of a man charged in several burglaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He swore from the beginning that he hadn't done anything,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Mendoza was on his way to prison until Bustamante was
asked to translate a video recording of another burglary suspect's
statement to police.
</P>
<P>
   She was struck by how similar the two cases were.
</P>
<P>
   of operation), the same area, the same time,'' she said. ``It
was eerie,'' she said. ]
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante talked to Mendoza's attorney the next day, and he
contacted prosecutors. Investigators then found the second man's
fingerprint at the scene of one of the break-ins that Mendoza was
accused of committing.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors dropped the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bustamante, Kansas City resident Mira Mdivani is a lawyer
who branched out into court interpreting.
</P>
<P>
   She has seen a huge increase in calls for interpretation
services since starting her company, Vertex Corp., four years ago.
There has been a 30 percent increase in the past year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Johnson County, her company works in Jackson County,
Clay County, Mo., Franklin County, Kan., and in cities such as
Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   Vertex often turns to colleges and universities to find
interpreters but maintains a group of regulars, she said.
</P>
<P>
   One man the company employs speaks five languages. At least
that's what Mdivani thought until Johnson County court officials
called looking for someone who could speak the east African
language of Tigrinya.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that the man spoke six languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge was very happy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, a lawyer will subpoena one of her interpreters to
testify as a witness in a case. She fights such efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interpreters are impartial,'' she said. ``They don't take
sides, and they should not be used as witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Mdivani's company provides training, but there are no standards
or procedures concerning the qualifications or quality of
interpreters that the courts can rely on. That can be a problem
with languages for which the local pool of speakers is small.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Johnson County domestic violence case, the first
interpreter hired tried to talk the victim out of testifying. The
interpreter turned out to be a cousin of the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Bricker of the court administrator's office is doing research to
set up formal guidelines for the use of interpreters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ultimate goal is to establish a code of procedure and have
everybody follow the same rules,'' she said.

MAYOR WANTS TO OFFER SYMPATHY TO SLAIN MAN'S FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who upon ending his campaign
for the U.S. Senate intimated that he would work to improve his
relationship with minority residents, said in an interview
broadcast Sunday that he had ``sympathy, concern and compassion''
for the family of a Haitian-American man killed by the police in
March.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor made the remarks on Saturday in an intensely personal
interview with Tim Russert for broadcast Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the
Press.'' Giuliani also said he had no regrets about his decision to
drop out of the Senate race, given that he now realized politics
was ``not the most important thing in life.''
</P>
<P>
   The half-hour interview touched on a broad range of topics, from
Giuliani's thoughts about his political future to his prostate
cancer and what he acknowledged might have been bad advice that his
father once offered him, suggesting that it was more important to
be respected than to be loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, fathers make mistakes and fathers are human beings,
and I tend to think now that love is more important than I
thought,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani first acknowledged on Thursday that he did not respond
properly to the fatal shooting in March of Patrick Dorismond, the
Haitian-American man, by a plainclothes police officer who had
tried to solicit marijuana from him. Dorismond, a security guard
who was standing outside a midtown bar, was unarmed and was not
carrying drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said in the ``Meet the Press'' interview that he
intended ``to find a way'' to let Dorismond's family know about his
regrets, including possibly a visit to his parents. But the mayor
again defended his decision on the day of Dorismond's shooting to
release his juvenile arrest record.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I should have done is to do a lot more to express
sympathy, concern, help, assistance, compassion for a situation
where, whether justified or unjustified, whatever it turns out, was
still a tragic situation,'' the mayor said. ``I think that is where
I made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also spoke at length with Russert about his desire,
first expressed on Friday, to try to extend the benefits of New
York City's current economic boom to more disaffected communities
in the city. The mayor said he had not yet decided how he would do
that, but he said he was committed to finding a way ``to break down
the barriers that I've created'' as a result of his own sometimes
abrasive personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people in the city who feel that they haven't been
reached,'' by the progress in the city in recent years, the mayor
said. ``There are people that feel that I don't care about them,
there are people who feel that I don't take them into equal
consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside predominantly African-American churches in Harlem and
Queens on Sunday, city residents said they would be watching the
mayor to see if he lived up to his vows. Many said they were
skeptical that the mayor, who has been criticized for increasing
tension between the city authorities and New York's ethnic
communities, would succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it is like a leopard changing his spots,'' said
Douglas K. Henderson, 65, outside the Abyssinian Baptist Church in
Harlem. ``It has got to be some sort of a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Many said they wanted to see him talk with black leaders like
the Rev. Al Sharpton and visit in black neighborhoods, and then act
on what he has heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to lend people of color an ear,'' said Sharon
McClarty, 44, a computer technician from Queens. ``He has been
talking, but he doesn't listen.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Andrea Summers, a mother of two who said she was cut from the
welfare rolls as part of the mayor's workfare program, said the
mayor needed to soften his harsh stance on welfare. She said she
worked at two jobs but could not earn enough to pay the rising
rents in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   She dismissed the mayor's comments about breaking down barriers.
``He never comes to our parades, never comes meet the people, he is
never here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As the mayor's remarks were televised Sunday, founders of the
group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care challenged him to
compensate the Dorismond family by settling a lawsuit that it has
filed against the city.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond's parents, Marie and Andre Dorismond, could not be
reached for comment Sunday. But on Saturday, Dorismond's father
dismissed the mayor's recent offers of sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it doesn't make sense for him to apologize,'' he said.
``It's been two months since my son died. It's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   During the ``Meet the Press'' interview, the mayor, who said he
was still struggling to decide on which cancer treatment to choose,
appeared relaxed, laughing and joking with Russert at times, even
offering him one of his trademark Godfather impersonations.
</P>
<P>
   He called the decision to drop out of the Senate race the most
difficult of his life, a choice he said he made entirely because of
his cancer and not because of the controversy surrounding his
recently revealed relationship with an East Side woman, Judith
Nathan, and his decision last week to separate from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for the cancer and the timing of the cancer, I would have
gone ahead and done it,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, 55, who has 18 months left in office, deferred
questions about his own political future, not indicating whether he
might make a run for governor or accept an appointment to the
cabinet of George W. Bush, if Bush wins his bid for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love politics,'' the mayor said. ``The thing I felt good
about as I made the decision'' to leave the Senate race is ``I
finally figured out that politics is not my life. My life is about
things that are closer to you and deeper than that.''
</P>
<P>
   And Giuliani said he had not yet decided what he would do with
the approximately $9 million in unspent campaign contributions he
had amassed, noting only that he intended to do as much as he could
to support Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to try to do everything I can to help'' Lazio in
his bid against Hillary Rodham Clinton, the mayor said, ``if it is
advertising, if it's an appearance, if it's figuring out how to
make sure they're able to raise money.''

WILLIAM DALE JENNINGS, 82, WRITER AND GAY RIGHTS PIONEER 
</HEADLINE>
   By DUDLEY CLENDINEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Dale Jennings, a novelist, playwright and pioneer of the
American gay rights movement, died on May 11 in Los Angeles of
respiratory failure. He was 82 and lived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He had moved to the area after graduation from high school in
Denver more than six decades ago with ambitions to be a writer, and
saw three of his novels published. One, ``The Cowboys,'' was made
into a movie starring John Wayne, Colleen Dewhurst and Bruce Dern
in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   But Jennings' place in American political history was etched on
a November afternoon 50 years ago, when he sat on a Los Angeles
hillside with four other men to talk about forming a group to work
for gay civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was the conception of an American leftist and trade
union organizer named Harry Hay, and the organization that resulted
was the Mattachine Society, the nation's first enduring gay rights
organization. The term the society chose was not ``gay'' however.
It was ``homophile.''
</P>
<P>
   Even meeting to discuss such things was an act of daring. Hay
was a married man. He and two others of the five had been members
of the Communist Party, and hostility toward Communists and gays
was deepening, a product of the Cold War atmosphere that was
beginning to chill America. A Senate subcommittee issued a report
in December 1950 concluding that gays were a threat to national
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived in terror almost every day of our lives,'' Hay said.
</P>
<P>
   The report was the beginning of a national witch hunt, and the
Mattachine members took elaborate precautions to keep their
identities secret. Thus it was Jennings whose courage made him a
permanent icon _ and the infant movement's first hero _ when he was
arrested in Los Angeles on a sexual solicitation charge a year
later and decided to publicly contest it in court.
</P>
<P>
   Entrapment by vice detectives posing as gays in the bars, public
parks and restrooms where gay men went to find each other was
common then and for years to come, and those charged with
soliciting police officers commonly pleaded guilty rather than face
an accusation of homosexual conduct in open court.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings was followed home and arrested by a police decoy he had
encountered at night in Westlake Park. No one had ever been known
to fight such a charge.
</P>
<P>
   Hay said Jennings was clearly depressed when he bailed him out
of jail that morning. But Jennings had a dramatic, even combative,
personality. He had earned a reputation as a bright young
playwright in Pasadena, Calif., in the late 1930s, writing,
directing and producing his own short plays. He had served in the
Pacific theater in the Army in World War II. Hay told Jennings that
they should fight the charge to call attention to the entrapment
policy. Jennings agreed, and in a 10-day trial in 1952, with a San
Francisco labor lawyer defending him, he acknowledged being gay,
but denied the solicitation.
</P>
<P>
   When the jury deadlocked 11-1 for acquittal, the judge dismissed
the charge, and Jennings was freed. His case had given the young
movement its first cause and a surge in membership.
</P>
<P>
   That year, with Don Slater and Dorr Legg, he founded ONE Inc.,
which began publishing a national journal for gays, ONE Magazine,
which reported on police and government harassment of gays, and was
printed at first on a small press in Jennings' brother-in-law's
basement. The magazine established an important legal precedent
when the United States postmaster in Los Angeles confiscated it as
``obscene, lewd, lascivious and filthy'' in 1954, and the Supreme
Court, in 1958, unanimously reversed lower court rulings upholding
the post office.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings wrote articles, book and movie reviews for ONE
Magazine, and later for Tangents Magazine, the journal of the
Homosexual Information Center in Los Angeles. Even after he had
stopped writing for publication, said Jim Schneider, chairman of
the center, Jennings continued to dictate reviews of films, and at
his death left some 125 unpublished manuscripts of books, plays and
stories. His two other published books were ``The Ronin: A Novel
Based on a Zen Myth,'' and ``The Sinking of the Sarah Diamond.''

WILLIAM SEGAL, 95, PUBLISHER WHO PAINTED SELF-PORTRAITS  

</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William Charles Segal, a magazine publisher whose
search for self-understanding led him to paint his own portrait
over and over for about 60 years as part of his immersion in
philosophies and Eastern religions, died on May 16 here. He was 95
and lived in New York and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy and private man (he has no entry in Who's Who), Segal
had a circle of intensely loyal and admiring friends who regarded
him as a man of deep spirituality and exceptional character.
</P>
<P>
   The British theatrical director Peter Brook, a friend for many
years, wrote of his painting: ``William Segal looks at the outside
world and leads us into William Segal the man. His spaces and
silences all take us to a secret meditative core.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1946 Segal started American Fabrics, a magazine that quickly
became the bible of the garment trade at a time when the American
textile industry was entering a new era with the growing use of
synthetic fabrics like nylon, rayon and polyester. He ran the
publication for 35 years. In addition he founded Gentry, a men's
fashion magazine, which also sought to teach Americans how to lead
a more elegant, European style of life; the International Color
Authority, an international organization that publishes fashion
color forecasts; the AF Encyclopedia of Textiles; and a number of
other business publications.
</P>
<P>
   All his magazines were characterized by sophisticated layout and
high-quality artwork to which he brought the eye of a trained
artist and accomplished painter.
</P>
<P>
   Educated at New York University, he also studied painting at the
Art Students League in New York and then at La Grande Chaumiere in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   He entered publishing before World War II, working first for a
German magazine catering to the new plastics industry. Then he
founded a newsletter that dealt with men's clothing as well as many
other specialized publications. By 30 he was a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 he lost his right eye in an automobile accident and for
the rest of his life wore a black eye patch. After the death of his
first wife, Cora Carlyle, he married Marielle Bancou, a French
designer, who survives him, along with two daughters, Elizabeth
Katz and Margaret Walch, both of New York, and five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   As he became wealthy, Segal's interests turned increasingly
toward Eastern religion and a process of self-discovery in which
his self-portraiture played an important role.
</P>
<P>
   The two thinkers who influenced him most strongly where the
Greco-Armenian mystic and philosopher George Ivanovitch Gurdjieff
and his disciple P.D. Ouspensky, who taught that human life as
ordinarily lived is similar to sleep, but that mankind can achieve
higher levels of vitality through spiritual exercises. Segal was
also a student of Daisetsu Suzuki, the foremost exponent of
Japanese Zen Buddhism in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Segal met Gurdjieff and Ouspensky in the 1940's and at the time
of his death was co-chairman of the Gurdjieff Foundation in New
York. Segal also knew Suzuki and with his help was able to spend
time in most of the great Buddhist monasteries of Japan and become
friends with many of their abbots.
</P>
<P>
   Although Segal painted landscapes, his favorite subject was
himself; the long string of self-portraits through his life capture
his journey from youth to old age. He held several exhibitions
around the world, including in Tokyo in 1992, Jerusalem in 1995,
Paris in 1997 and at Tibet House in New York last year.
</P>
<P>
   He also tried to describe his religious philosophy in
interviews, writings and poems, some of which were collected and
published as a book, ``Opening,'' in 1998. What he had to say is
obscure; it centers on the idea that humans should practice
silence, stillness and contemplation to discover the secret
spiritual forces within themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one is still and listens, one begins to be in touch with
a mysterious element that is within each of us, which can transform
and shape us and can help to transform the world,'' he said in an
interview. &QL;

ANGELS SEARCH FOR SHORTSTOP
</HEADLINE>

By DAVE WERSTINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ With Gary DiSarcina out of the lineup with a
sore left shoulder and contemplating season-ending surgery, the
Angels are searching for a replacement at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Backup Benji Gil, who has started 31 games at short after
playing at Triple-A Calgary in the Florida Marlins' system last
year, seemed to be the logical choice, but he's struggled to say
the least.
</P>
<P>
   He is hitting just .224, but manager Mike Scioscia certainly
would be happy just to find a shortstop who is solid defensively.
However, Gil hasn't been that either.
</P>
<P>
   Gil's error Saturday, his team-leading ninth of the season, led
to four unearned runs in the top of the seventh inning in the
Halos' 8-7 come-from-behind victory.
</P>
<P>
   So, on Sunday, the Angels opted to give Keith Luuloa (pronounced
lew-oo-lo-uh) his first major-league start at shortstop. But
manager Mike Scioscia insisted the move was made to Gil a day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just to let Benji have a rest, give him a breather,''
Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   Luuloa, who made his first big-league appearance Wednesday as a
pinch runner in the eighth inning and finished the game, sees this
as a solid chance to establish himself in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I'm here as a utility infielder, a backup... until
Mike feels I can play two-three times a week,'' Luuloa said. ``I
understand that. My day will come.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Honolulu, Luuloa, who was challenged just three
times in the field and went hitless - if not for a diving grab by
Royals third baseman Joe Randa, is one of three Hawaiian-born
players currently in the major leagues, the others being the
Dodgers' Onan Masaoka and the Mets' Benny Agbayani.
</P>
<P>
   Line Drives
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson's third-inning grand slam was the sixth in the
majors Sunday, setting a new MLB record. ... As expected, reliever
Mark Petkovsek was not in uniform Sunday, still recuperating from a
fever caused by a viral illness. ... Sunday's pregame festivities
were highlighted by the annual Little League Parade. Nearly 12,000
youth baseball players took part in the march that last almost an
hour. ... The Angels' next home game begins interleague play, when
the Dodgers come to Edison Field on June 2 to open a three-game
series. The San Francisco Giants are in town the for three games
June 5-7 before the Halos get back to the American League. ...
Three years ago Sunday, the Angels set a record, scoring a
club-high 18 runs at home in an 18-3 victory over the Seattle
Mariners.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For Nicholas Pavia, a city councilman and mechanic in Stamford,
Conn., the call to the priesthood was neither an urgent whisper nor
a siren. It was a tugging, always in the background, that stayed
with him as one election followed another. And it was a summons put
off by earthly misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, Pavia met the emissaries of Edward M. Egan, the
bishop of Bridgeport, Conn., soon to become New York's archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt empty, or anything like that,'' said Pavia, a
40-year-old who is to be ordained Saturday in Bridgeport. ``But I
felt I could be doing something more.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when other dioceses throughout the nation are
struggling through a shortage of priests, Egan has vigorously
recruited men like Pavia for the priesthood, ordaining a higher
proportion of priests than any other diocese in the Northeast. The
bishop's success weighed heavily in his nomination to head the New
York archdiocese, said one church official involved in the highly
secretive process, a sign that the Vatican considers the shortage
one of the most serious problems facing the church.
</P>
<P>
   In his first news conference after he was named
archbishop-designate this month, Egan boasted that his calling card
gave not only his own phone number, but that of his diocese's
recruitment director. The bishop's accomplishment, it seems, lies
in creating the structures that have allowed others to nurture
aspiring priests.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bridgeport's diocese is only one-sixth the size of New
York's, Egan opened a minor seminary soon after arriving there in
1988, modeled on one that Cardinal John O'Connor established in the
Bronx, to embrace men considering the priesthood and to allow them
a year to glimpse the life they would take on.
</P>
<P>
   But the bishop also created a full-time recruitment team, headed
by the Rev. Christopher Walsh, whose stated purpose was to
aggressively recruit candidates for the priesthood. They keep track
of men who express an interest in becoming priests, following those
who enter the seminary the bishop created, St. John Fisher in
Stamford, at every step of their preparation. The diocese also
adapts the seminarians' training to accommodate each candidate's
interests and circumstances, and, like many other dioceses hard
pressed for new priests, it readily accepts older men into the
ranks of seminarians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord is calling, but there's a lot of static out there,''
Walsh said. ``My job is to reduce the static. To create the
environment where the call can be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   While Egan has aggressively courted men for the priesthood, he
has not done so by softening or popularizing the church's stands,
but rather by stressing the orthodox view of the clergy's role. It
remains to be seen how Egan's approach to training men for the
priesthood will influence relations between the church and the New
York archdiocese's 2.4 million Roman Catholics. Nor is it clear
whether he will seek to have a political voice in New York, or how
his decision will play out in the hurly-burly world of local
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the priests Egan has ordained say his emphasis on
restoring the traditions of the church was one of the reasons they
chose to serve in Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said that some of the seminarians seemed nostalgic for a
church steeped in rituals they had imagined, but not known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them are not into getting all excited about guitar
Masses and Masses on the beach,'' Walsh said. ``They're, to be
honest, more attracted to the tradition, to the liturgical
tradition, to some of the devotions of the church, rosaries,
novenas and eucharistic adoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, the generation that's coming up now have been
deprived of that tradition; they're the children of the baby
boomers who discarded much of that,'' Walsh added. ``I don't see it
as an ideological fixation on the past, but as a longing for the
tradition that they've missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the priority he sets on building up the priesthood,
Egan _ officially not New York's archbishop until his installation
on June 19 _ ordained this year's graduates of St. Joseph's
Seminary at St. Patrick's Cathedral Saturday. The priests
prostrated themselves on the cathedral's marble floor as the
congregation prayed over them. Egan closed his hands over theirs
while the men swore lifelong respect and obedience to the
archbishop-designate and his successors.
</P>
<P>
   But there were only five of them. Over the last year, considered
an average one, more than a score of priests have died in the New
York archdiocese. And a declining enrollment of candidates for the
priesthood at St. Joseph's suggests the number of new priests will
slide even further in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not limited to New York. With fewer and fewer
young men choosing a life of celibacy and sacrifice, many priests
across the nation must serve at more than one parish. While the
Roman Catholic population in America has grown 30 percent over the
last 35 years, to 59.2 million from 45.6 million in 1965, the
number of priests has dropped 21 percent, to 46,352 from 58,632.
</P>
<P>
   Dean R. Hoge, a professor at Catholic University and the author
of ``The Future of Catholic Leadership,'' said that a generally
rising standard of living had given young men today more career
options, making the cost of the priesthood's demands _ particularly
celibacy _ seem higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come to a crossroads in Catholic history,'' Hoge said.
``There's not enough candidates. We have a problem producing
high-quality product.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Katarina Schuth, author of the 1999 book ``Seminaries,
Theologates, and the Future of the Church Ministry,'' said strict
traditionalists were having an increasing influence in seminaries,
though they might not represent a greater share of students. Nearly
half of today's seminarians, she found, begin their studies for the
priesthood after a religious conversion. One out of four speak
English as a second language.

LACK OF CASH HIKES FIRE
 RISK

 BY MARK SHAFFER 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Flagstaff, Ariz.) _ In U.S. Forest Service vernacular, they're
called doghair thickets _ spindly, sickly looking pine trees, dark
gray, only 6 inches or less in diameter yet grow up to 20 feet
tall.
</P>
<P>
   Left to their own devices, as many as 2,000 of them can grow per
acre. Timber cutters say they aren't mar ketable enough to cut.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of providing shelter for some wildlife, the only notable
role the trees play is serving as fuel in forest fires, dangerous
match sticks that burn bottom up and tag bigger trees, generating
crown fires the likes of which roared into Los Alamos this month.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with drought conditions, the thickets turn forests into
catas trophes-in-wait-of-ignition. This has forest and park service
officials in Arizona fretting.
</P>
<P>
   A group of area fire agencies re leased a report in late March
in which they concluded that about 40,000 acres of the dense
ponderosa pine forest around Flagstaff and about half of the 60,000
people living within city limits are at high risk from catastrophic
wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   The Ponderosa Fire Advisory Coun cil and Grand Canyon Forest
Part nership also said that legal maneuvers by environmental groups
and shortages of money for the Forest Service for tree thinning and
controlled burns had allowed only 3 percent of that area to receive
fire-protection measures.
</P>
<P>
   The Pinetop-Lakeside and Show Low areas are almost as
vulnerable, said Ed Collins, district ranger for the Lakeside area
of Apache-Sit greaves National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said tree thinning had been done in only 20 percent of
the district's 115,000 acres and that the only industry in the area
that cut the smaller trees _ a pulp and paper mill in Snowflake _
got out of that business last year. Timber cutting has pretty much
disappeared from the state's public lands because of legal action
by environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly critical is a 15,000-acre area southwest of Show
Low, from where the prevailing winds blow in the spring and summer.
That part of the forest has had very little treat ment against
fires and funding limi tations have turned it into a project that
will last 10 years, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the state, park and forest service officials are in a
state of alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire conditions this year are as tough as we have ever
seen,'' said Rod Hoibakk, fire manager of Pres cott National
Forest. ``The bulk of the chaparral in tinderboxes like Hassayampa
Canyon hasn't burned in 70 years. The only question is when it's
going to go off.''
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service workers have been using a machine to cut and
grind the manzanita and chaparral near Pres cott subdivisions in an
effort to carve a mile-wide fire break between trees and the
thousands of homes on the south and east sides of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The state also has taken note.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull declared a ``wildfire emergency'' in Arizona on
Thursday, freeing up $3 million in state money to fight and prevent
wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's forests haven't always been so susceptible to
undergrowth such as doghair thickets.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1800s, the state's high country had open ponderosa
pine forests with few trees and large spreads of grass in between.
In those days, fires seldom burned more than ground cover.
</P>
<P>
   But increasing herds of cattle did a number on the grass. Then,
during a five-year period about the time of World War I, a
combination of wet years and abnormally high seed production by the
trees led to dense stands of small pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   That, plus the federal government's policy of immediately
suppressing all forest fires until the 1980s, led to the
proliferation of the thickets, so named because they are as thick
as dog's hair.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Farnsworth, fire management officer for the Coconino
National Forest in Flagstaff, knows more than he wants to about the
effects of doghair thickets.
</P>
<P>
   There was the ``Radio'' fire in 1977, which burned Mount Elden
to the nub. There were the ``Hochderffer'' and ``Horseshoe'' fires
four years ago that burned 25,000 acres of the west and north
flanks of the San Francisco Peaks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 10 largest fires in the Flagstaff area's history
all have occurred since 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth casts a wary eye to the forests south and west of
Flagstaff from where, as in Show Low, the winds blow at this time
of year.
</P>
<P>
   It's in these areas, near the caldera of Dry Lake, the U.S.
Naval Observa tory and Flagstaff's Arboretum, that Farnsworth has
funneled much of his $80,000 annual budget in thinning trees and
doing controlled burns on the likely route of any large fire that
would head toward Flagstaff. That kind of money doesn't buy much
these days, Farnsworth concedes, noting that he and his staff can
thin only about 500 acres and control burn about 3,000 acres
annually while tens of thousands of acres are at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth stops his pickup at the base of A-1 Mountain, near
where a small fire 10 days before had almost taken off up the
mountain because of 60 mph winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at all that junk in there,'' Farnsworth said, pointing
into the doghair thicket of hundreds of small pine trees curling
grotesquely toward the ground with dead pine needles and vegetation
about a foot thick on the ground. ``One lightning strike and,
whoosh, the fire would be out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the forest is in this condition, Farnsworth said, noting
the checkerboard ownership of the land among state, federal and
private entities. State lands tend to have worse conditions for
fire. With pri vate land, it depends on the owner, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But federal fire managers have their owns problems trying to do
con trolled burns.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said state agencies like the Department of Environmental
Qual ity and Game &AMP; Fish Department and federal agencies like the
Fish and Wildlife Service and Corps of Engi neers have control over
what he does because of clean air, endangered species and clean
water consider ations.
</P>
<P>
   And, because one of the best times to do controlled burns is in
the fall, after the summer monsoon rains, when temperature
inversions trap the smoke close to the ground, Collins said he
often runs afoul of DEQ.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few people call them and cough and I'm shut down,'' Collins
said.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the only problem, Collins said. ``It's costing
upward of $600 an acre to do these treatments because of all the
trees,'' Collins said. ``There's not enough money in Fort Knox to
do what we should do.''

 UNDATED: second language. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In such an atmosphere, even Walsh wonders why Bridgeport is
succeeding where others are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the newer priests or those soon to be ordained chose the
Bridgeport diocese because it was their home. But others selected
Bridgeport from a number they had considered, attracted by Egan's
reputation for orthodoxy and for fostering an esprit de corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the diocese or priests in the diocese are being
hypercritical, or saying Rome is way off base, that doesn't attract
young men,'' Walsh said. ``You aren't going to get young men to
give their lives to an institution if you're criticizing that
institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Bridgeport diocese, like New York's, is home to a
large number of Hispanics, none of the young men graduating from
the seminary this year are Hispanic. ``It's sort of a fluke this
year,'' said Walsh, noting that five of the 30 seminarians
considering the priesthood at St. John Fisher are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who are joining the Bridgeport diocese are Robert
Kinnally, the 39-year-old dean of admissions and financial aid at
Stanford University, who will enter St. John Fisher this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Thomas W. Powers, 35, the priest at St. Theresa's in
Trumbull, Conn., left a promising job at a global consulting firm
to join Egan's diocese.
</P>
<P>
   Powers calls Egan ``an impressive man, the kind of guy you want
to follow,'' and he does so with an absence of reservations that
can be striking in an age of skepticism. ``I trust him,'' Powers
said. ``He's been a spiritual father to me. He inspires me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do God's will by obeying my bishop.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining the diocese not only meant giving up a successful job
but, in a sense, erasing his ego so his sense of God could take
over, Powers said. ``We really must die to ourselves,'' he said.
``He must increase, while I must decrease.''
</P>
<P>
   Powers said he was drawn to Egan's ``orthodoxy'' and
``holiness.'' Staunchly anti-abortion, Powers sometimes prays the
rosary outside abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Kinnally, an organist who once worked as musical director of St.
Augustine's Cathedral in Bridgeport, said Walsh's encouragement
played an important role in his decision to return to the diocese.
He also considered applying to the diocese in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an openness to guys like me who are coming at this a
little later, and the sense that what we bring to it can enrich the
priesthood,'' Kinnally said. ``Bridgeport is doing so well. The
simple way to say it is, they're doing something right.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pavia's case, the diocese tackled his misgivings head on. It
even allowed him to keep his full-time job as a mechanic in the
maintenance department of Stamford Hospital while he attended St.
John Fisher, until he was sure about committing to the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   While priests ordained in the 1960s and '70s generally do not
describe the ritual of their ordination as something they gave much
thought to beforehand, seeing it mostly as a necessary step to
becoming the spiritual shepherd of Catholics, Pavia is awed by the
moment he will deliver his personal will to the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holy Spirit at that time is coming over you,'' Pavia said.
``Everyone, from saints in heaven to the people in the pews, are
praying for you. My life is now totally in God's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   As a newspaper boy long ago, Pavia would get so wrapped up
talking to his customers that he sometimes forgot to collect their
money. Now, he sees the essence of his new life in the Masses,
baptisms and confessions ahead. He envisions going door to door
once again, visiting nursing homes and hospitals, seeing to the
needs of his parishioners with Bible in hand. The impulse to do for
others, he said, will probably never leave him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the calling and we all have it,'' he said. ``We
just respond to it in different ways.''

DAVID GURALNIK, LEXICOGRAPHER, DIES AT 79  

</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David B. Guralnik, a lexicographer whose definitions of the
American language guided tens of millions of people who thumbed
through the dictionaries he edited, died on Friday at his home in
Shaker Heights, Ohio. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   He had colon cancer, his daughter, Eve Harrington, said.
</P>
<P>
   As editor in chief of Webster's New World line of dictionaries
from 1948 to 1985, when he retired, he supervised works that
carried his view of American English around the world.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time when the language was changing as rapidly as the
world it described, and he welcomed the changes. ``He looked at it
as a living organism,'' Harrington recalled. ``He said the language
will be alive as long as it keeps changing.''
</P>
<P>
   As a gatekeeper for words seeking admission to the literary
mainstream, Guralnik wrote many of the new definitions himself. He
took the title of editor in chief emeritus after he retired, and
was a vice president of Simon &AMP; Schuster, now the dictionaries'
publisher. His name recurred frequently as an arbiter in William
Safire's ``On Language'' column in The New York Times Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Among the works he edited, the best known is the College Edition
of Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language, a
one-volume desktop standard popular not only among students but
also with writers and other professionals. ``Our emphasis is on the
English language as spoken in America, and for that reason, we
chose to call it the dictionary of the American language,'' he
said. ``It does for the American language what the Oxford English
Dictionary does for the language as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Its first edition appeared in 1953, and Library Journal called
it ``a great advance in American lexicography.''
</P>
<P>
   But compared with the magnitude of the task, Guralnik and his
staff were few, and in the next several decades, as the publishing
company repeatedly changed hands, they struggled to keep up with
``not only a population explosion, but an information explosion of
unprecedented proportions,'' he said in the foreword to the second
edition.
</P>
<P>
   New words, new pronunciations and new meanings were being born
by then without the customary time for incubation. For example,
man's first walk on the moon, coming shortly before the second
edition was published in 1970, called for inclusion of a new word,
``mascon,'' meaning the very dense material that lay just
underneath the astronaut Neil Armstrong's dusty footprints. (And
Armstrong deserved a biographical entry, Guralnik decided.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the inevitable questions, as society's norms of
discourse shifted, about what class of words, if any, to banish. In
the second college edition, Guralnik decided to strip out some
racial epithets that had been included before, and refused to
include some common vulgarities, despite their ever widening use.
Some of the words he excluded were restored in the third edition,
after his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   He explained in the dictionary's foreword that the sexual and
excretory vulgarities were ``so well known as to require no
explanation,'' while what he called the ``true obscenities,'' the
ethnic slurs, are ``encountered with diminishing frequency these
days.''
</P>
<P>
   And he later engaged in a war of words with the publisher of the
13-volume Oxford dictionary over parts of its treatment of the word
``Jew,'' with a definition that referred to old stereotypes of
extortionate money-lenders.
</P>
<P>
   A leader in the Jewish community in Cleveland, Guralnik had a
passion for Yiddish, which he had learned as a child, delivering a
weekly radio commentary on words called ``A Yiddish Vort'' and
speaking and writing often on the subject. He served as president
of the Jewish Community Center, vice president of The Cleveland
Jewish News, and a trustee of the Jewish Community Federation of
Cleveland. An amateur actor and an avid singer, he joined the
Workmen's Circle and was vice president of the Cleveland Chamber
Music Society and a member of the Ohio Humanities Council. He was a
member of PEN; the Dictionary Society of North America; the
American Dialect Society; the Rowfant Club, an association of
bibliophiles; and the American Names Society.
</P>
<P>
   David Bernard Guralnik was born in Cleveland and had intended to
become a teacher, but after graduating from Western Reserve
University in 1941, where he would later receive a master's degree,
he took the advice of one of his own teachers and quit a summer job
at a furniture factory in favor of a dictionary writing job at
World Publishing Co. of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   After three years in the Army during World War II, where he was
a translator in several languages and was awarded the Bronze Star,
he returned to the publishing company and became editor in chief of
its New World line of dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
   He was married to the former Shirley Nashkin, a teen-age friend,
who survives. In addition to their daughter, Harrington, he is
survived by a granddaughter, Jessi Harrington; and two sisters,
Sylvia Eigenfeld and Beatrice Herman.

CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS CHIEF SUPPORTS STATE MONITOR FOR L.A. DISTRICT

   SACRAMENTO _ Even as Los Angeles Unified moves forward with
reforms and choosing a new superintendent, momentum is building in
Sacramento for state intervention in the long-troubled school
district.
</P>
<P>
   The latest to join the movement is Delaine Eastin, state
superintendent of public instruction. In an interview, Eastin
backed a bill by state Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles, that
would appoint a watchdog over the Los Angeles Unified School
District and break up the district if student achievement doesn't
improve.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Eastin said the first step to reforming the district should
be assigning someone to assess its status now and track its future
progress.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``It's a great help to know where all the bodies are
buried,'' said Eastin, who under Polanco's bill would appoint the
watchdog. ``We don't want the district to go further downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Sacramento's sudden willingness to dive into the district's
affairs has alarmed Los Angeles school board members. They have
spent the last year making sweeping changes that they say should,
given time, turn the ailing district around.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For interim Superintendent Ramon Cortines, the state's rush to
get involved ignores the work he and the board have done. He was
hired by the board in late fall to implement reforms and will leave
office next month after a new superintendent is chosen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``It's like I didn't need to come,'' he said. ``You want a
district to take corrective action, and the district does that, and
then you want to penalize them?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Mayor Richard Riordan said through a spokesman that he
continues to have confidence in the school board majority he helped
elect.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``The mayor has indicated the legislation could be improved,
and he wants to work with Sen. Polanco on it,'' spokesman Peter
Hidalgo said. ``The mayor has been encouraged with the LAUSD's
reform Board of Education and Superintendent Cortines, who are
working to enact purposeful changes.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But legislators say they've heard Los Angeles beg before for
more time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``At some point, there comes a time when you have to say we
can't wait any longer; we have to step in,'' said state Sen.
Deirdre ``Dede'' Alpert, D-San Diego, who chairs the Senate's
Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Alpert's committee is scheduled to vote on a heavily amended
version of Polanco's bill this week. The changes in large part
reflect the current mood in Sacramento toward Los Angeles Unified.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  While many legislators want to give the state greater
oversight, few want to take the next step of making day-to-day
decisions for the immense district. Accordingly, Polanco has
removed language that would have given the watchdog or monitor veto
power over Los Angeles Unified's administrative or policy
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  And while the idea of dismantling the district has gained
ground in Sacramento, many legislators want to wait several years
to see whether the changes wrought by Cortines and the board can
boost student achievement. The current version of Polanco's bill
calls for breaking up the district if it doesn't substantially
raise test scores and make other improvements in the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``I don't want to doom those efforts to failure before they
really get going,'' said Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Glendale, one
of the district's toughest critics. ``Setting a definite time line
is what we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Nor is Polanco's bill the only effort by state lawmakers to
involve themselves in Los Angeles Unified's fate. State Sen. Martha
Escutia, D-Montebello, has a bill that calls for a study of
removing several southeastern Los Angeles County cities, including
Bell and Cudahy, from the massive district.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Some school board members question why lawmakers have chosen
to jump into the fray now. Where were they two or three years ago,
the board members said, when previous district officials often
dismissed suggestions that their low-scoring, overcrowded school
system had serious problems?
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; And even if the monitor doesn't obtain veto power, many Los
Angeles Unified officials fear the end result will be the same: a
shadow superintendent operating hundreds of miles from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``This is a move away from local control,'' board member
Caprice Young said. ``This is just more bureaucracy and, after a
while, the bureaucracy becomes stifling.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Eastin and many legislators disagree with Young. Eastin added
that Cortines would make an excellent monitor were he interested in
the job. Cortines said he isn't.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  While remaining neutral on the move to break up Los Angeles
Unified, Eastin said she doubts it would work. Schools in some
parts of the district are so overcrowded that they must send their
students to distant neighborhoods to find room for them. Breaking
the district into smaller pieces might make that impossible, Eastin
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could build some nice new schools in Pacoima or Pico
Union (heavily populated areas in the San Fernando Valley and
downtown, respectively), you could make the case that the district
could be broken up,'' she said. ``Otherwise, it would be a civil
rights disaster, and I think it would lose in court.''

ROYALS END ANGELS' WIN STREAK

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ With their starting pitching depleted due to
injuries and having taxed the bullpen rather heavily because of it,
the Angels were hoping Kent Bottenfield would carry them deep into
the game Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't happen as the Kansas City Royals battered
Bottenfield around early and often to beat the Angels, 10-6, and
put an end to their season-best three-game winning streak at Edison
Field before a crowd of 28,052.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels (22-22), who finished a 12-game homestand - their
longest of the year - with a 6-6 mark, are idle today before
beginning a 10-day, nine-game trip that starts in Minnesota on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking all things into consideration, like our starting
pitching situation (Jason Dickson, Tim Belcher, Ken Hill and Kent
Mercker all on the disabled list), and looking back, things could
have been much worse,'' said Anaheim manager Mike Scioscia, whose
starters were 1-5 during the homestand while the bullpen went 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other side of it, you are looking to make up some
ground (in the standings),'' Scioscia added. ``But we are still
there ... a couple of games off the pace.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first career start against the Royals (22-21),
Bottenfield, who has pitched six-plus innings in each of his
previous six outings, could only carry the Angels 4 1/3 innings
while getting pounded for nine runs on 10 hits, including three
home runs.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like Bottenfield was a pitch short in every situation
where he allowed runs.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, he retired the first two batters but gave
up a double to Mike Sweeney and a run-scoring single by Mark Quinn
on two-strike counts. Carlos Beltrans homer leading off the second
came on a full count, and Joe Randa's took a 2-2 offering and
smacked a three-run homer in the third inning to make it 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just didn't have good command today,'' Scioscia said. ``He
left the door open and they took advantage of his mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind back-to-back homers by Garret Anderson, who slugged his
fourth career grand slam, and Troy Glaus off Kansas City starter
Chris Fussell, the Angels tied the score at 5-5 in the bottom of
the third, giving them - and Bottenfield - new life.
</P>
<P>
   But it was shortlived, as the Royals, who gave up a
fourth-inning run to the Angels on Mo Vaughn's RBI single off K.C.
reliever Jason Rakers, came back to score two runs in the fourth
and two more in the fifth, on David McCarty's homer, to take a 9-6
lead and chase Bottenfield (3-5).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a bad game,'' Bottenfield said of his
second-shortest start of the season. ``I made more mistakes than
good pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels reliever Mike Fyhrie, who allowed just one hit in 1 2/3
innings of work, closed out the fifth inning without any further
damage and got the Royals in order in the sixth, the first time
Kansas City failed to put up at least one run.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Weaver followed with a 1-2-3 seventh inning, before working
out of danger in the eighth to keep the Angels within striking
distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never think we are out of it,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   But their would be no Angels come-from-behind victory this time.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, who have won their last six games via the comeback,
were ineffective against K.C. reliever Jose Santiago (4-1), who
worked the final three innings to earn the victory and kept Anaheim
without a hit after Vaughn's single in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals, who put runners on first and second against Brett
Hinchliffe, added an insurance run on McCarty's single off of Mike
Holtz in the ninth inning.
