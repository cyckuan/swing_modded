<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The head of the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Thursday hailed the Convention of
the Rights of the Child (CRC) as "a milestone" and "the great
legal and ethical instrument for promoting and protecting the
rights of all children -- and the beacon that guides UNICEF in all
its work."
</P>
<P>
Carol Bellamy, UNICEF's executive director, made the statement
at a plenary meeting of the 54 General Assembly session on the
occasion of the commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the
Convention of the Rights of the Child.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly commemoration is one of many events that
have been taking place in all parts of the world to mark the
anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on November 20,
1989.
</P>
<P>
"The number and diversity of these events is a testament to the
remarkable success of a treaty that has been ratified with
unprecedented speed by virtually the entire community of nations,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, it has become the centerpiece of a global movement, a
movement that reflects a growing awareness of the importance of
safeguarding human rights -- and child rights in particular," she
said. "Its effects can be seen everywhere."
</P>
<P>
The CRC was adopted by the General Assembly on November 20,
1989. It came into force on September 2, 1990 after being ratified
by the necessary 20 states. It was by far the most rapidly
ratified human rights convention in history, and has since been
approved by 191 nations, also a record.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Education Minister Receives Death Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Education Minister
Yossi Sarid Thursday received a death threat, a phenomenon that
has worried the Israeli societyabout the motive behind the
intimidation, but the 58-year old Sarid, leader of the leftist
Meretz party, has been at odds with the ultra-orthodox religious
party Shas recently over the funding of its school system.
</P>
<P>
Shas has threatened to quit the ruling coalition of Prime
Minister Ehud Barak if the government does not transfer millions
of shekels to its debt-ridden educational network.
</P>
<P>
But Sarid and other Education Ministry officials insisted
that Shas should formulate a reform plan before the funding,
citing reports that millions of shekels have been wasted due
to mismanagement and alleged corruption.
</P>
<P>
The assassination of the late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin four
years ago has exposed one of the serious social problems in
Israel, namely, the split between the right and the left, and the
religious and the secular.
</P>
<P>
Senior Israeli officials warned on several occasions that
Israel has not learnt a full lesson from the tragedy of Rabin's
murder, pointing to increasing violence in families and the
society.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Libyan FMs Hold Talks on Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Libyan Foreign Minister Omar
al-Montassir arrived here Thursday evening and went straight into
talks with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa on efforts in
helping Sudan achieve national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said earlier that he and his Libyan counterpart will
discuss the coordination between the two countries' efforts and
those exerted by other parties related to the Sudanese issue,
Egypt's official Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya proposed in August a five-point peace plan,
which calls for a permanent cease-fire in Sudan and a meeting of a
preparatory committee for a peace conference aimed at seeking
national reconciliation in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and the country's Muslim opposition
parties have accepted the proposal, which they said forms a basis
for the peace process in the Africa's largest country.
</P>
<P>
But the southern rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA)
has expressed reservations over the initiative, saying that it
favored the role played by the Eastern African Inter-Governmental
Authority on Development, or IGAD, in mediating between it and the
government.
</P>
<P>
The northern Muslim parties, which want to share power with
Sudan's Islamic government, and the SPLA, which has been fighting
since 1983 for greater autonomy for the mostly Christian south,
formed an umbrella group, the National Democratic Alliance
(NDA).
</P>
<P>
The NDA will meet on November 22 in Kampala, Uganda, to forge a
final stand on the Egyptian-Libyan initiative.
</P>
<P>
Moussa disclosed that contacts are underway to merge the
Egypt-Libyan peace plan with IGAD's mediation role. But he said
"the matter is still a subject to consideration and discussions."
</P>
<P>
Egypt has repeated its keenness on securing Sudan's sovereignty
and territorial integrity and plays a key role in mediating
between the Sudanese government and the opposition for fear that a
possible disintegration of its southern neighbor may endanger the

Speaking here at a sideline meeting of the Commonwealth Summit

Nozizwe Phillip- Routledge said the small arms trade is totally
false and should not be left to the private sector and the normal
laws of economics.

South Africa would continue destroying illegal small arms as

this would be in the interest of the region and the continent.

She expressed the hope that the Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meeting would reach an agreement on proposals for joint
action against small arms.

The recommendations have been submitted by the International

 destruction of weapons at Natal Command.

At the function, Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy

JERUSALEM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Head of Planning of the
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Shalom Yanai is scheduled to present
the maps of IDF redeployment in the West Bank to Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted a Palestinian source as saying that Yanai will
call on Arafat in Gaza city and explain to him from which areas
the IDF will pull out its troops in the next redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran met here Wednesday with his
Palestinian counterpart Saeb Erekat and delivered him another
copy of the maps of the next IDF redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under Sharm El Sheikh peace deal signed early September by
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Arafat, Israel will
transfer 3 percent of the West Bank territories from Area C
(under full Israeli control) to Area B (where Palestinians
exercise administrative control) and 2 percent from Area B to
Area A (under full Palestinian control).
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet approved the maps earlier Wednesday in a
vote of 17-1 with one abstention.
</P>
<P>
The next redeployment, also called the second phase
withdrawal, will take place on November 15 as stipulated by the
new peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The lands to be transferred include 2.2 percent of the
territories east of the West Bank city of Hebron which will be
turned into a natural reserve, and other areas in the north of
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel transferred 7 percent of the West Bank territories to
the Palestinians during the first withdrawal on September 10
under the new peace deal.

<HEADLINE> De Beers to Stop Buying Diamond From Warring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's De Beers,
the world' s biggest diamond producer, said Thursday it would
suspend buying diamond from some war-torn African countries to
ensure diamonds are not used to fund conflicts.
</P>
<P>
De Beers chairman Nicky Oppenheimer told the Commonwealth
Business Forum in Johannesburg that De Beers supported the UN in
its efforts to take diamond out of the conflict in West Africa,
including an embargo on the purchase of diamond from Angola.
</P>
<P>
"Today in an effort to resolve this problem, a concerned world
is trying to break the link between the guns and the gold which
warlords receive from their exploitation of mineral wealth.
</P>
<P>
"This was a concern that De Beers shared because of the pity and
horror at what decades of conflict had done to the innocents of
Africa and because of the role competition for control of natural
resources had played in spurring conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was also a concern that once the "locust of war" had
picked over the spoils, there would be very little left for any
government to use to fund reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
"The countries that have wasted their natural wealth on war
will never be able to use it to fund peace. It is gone for ever,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Refutes Soha's Remarks on Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel Thursday dismissed
charges made by Soha Arafat, wife of Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, that Israeli troops are polluting the air and water of the
occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Terming the Soha's remarks as "undesirable," Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's office said in a statement that "Soha's comment has
no connection to reality, poisoning the atmosphere does not help
the negotiations currently under way between Israel and the
Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
Soha made the remarks Thursday in the West Bank city of
Ramallah after meeting U.S. First Lady Hillary Clinton. She said
the Israeli occupation troops in the territories are polluting the
air and water with gases that cause cancer among the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The first lady, who went to Ramallah for a short visit, did not
comment on the charges.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Soha, Palestinian Minister of Local Government Saeb
Erekat told the Israel Radio that Israeli forces and some other
Israeli industries are dumping wastes in the territories, which do
pollute the environment.
</P>
<P>
This is not a new problem, which is to be settled in future
negotiations, Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
Hillary arrived in Israel on Wednesday for a 36-hour visit, her
fifth to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Local media said Hillary's visit to Israel will add a new
wrinkle to the vagaries of ethnic politics in the U.S. and there
is little doubt that her visit comes with a view to her New York's
senate elections next year and is aimed at wining thousands of
Jewish votes there.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, she attended a conference on youth problems at Tel
Aviv University.
</P>
<P>
She will fly to Jordan Thursday night after attending the
annual memorial lecture of late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Rabin, who signed the first peace agreements with the
Palestinians, was assassinated four years ago by a Jewish
extremist.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Says World Has Reason to Celebrate CRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) on Thursday said that despite
disappointment and missed opportunities, the "World is a better
place" because of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind that this convention has
improved the lives of millions of children and made the world a
better place," UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
"It has stimulated legal reform in dozens of countries around
the world, enjoyed governments to take the health and well-being
of children seriously, and initiated a process of goal-setting
that keeps everyone honest about global progress -- or lack of
it," she said.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that "Some might emphasize the ways in which
the CRC has fallen short" of its lofty aims, Bellamy said that
the concrete achievements attributable to the treaty has
confirmed its stature as "a fountainhead for the lasting
improvement of children's lives."
</P>
<P>
"That's certainly how we feel about it, and that's why we'll
continue to use the CRC as a lever to help move leaders and
communities everywhere," she said.
</P>
<P>
While praising these advancements, however, Bellamy was quick
to add that "too much has been left undone."
</P>
<P>
"Basic health, education and protection are not simply
services that states may or may not provide -- they are
recognized rights that states are obliged to fulfill," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Convention on the Rights of the Child was adopted by the
U.N. General Assembly on November 20, 1989. It came into force on
September 2, 1990 after being ratified by the necessity 20
states.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Why the CRC Matters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The 54th General
Assembly session Thursday convened a plenary meeting to mark the
10th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child
(CRC).
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said Thursday that
despite disappointments and missed opportunities, the "world is a
better place" because of the CRC, the groundbreaking human rights
treaty that was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly 10 years ago
next week.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind that this convention has improved
the lives of millions of children and made the world a better
place," UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said prior to
addressing a 10th anniversary gathering of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that "some might emphasize the ways in which the
CRC has fallen short" of its lofty aims, Bellamy argued that the
concrete achievements attributable to the treaty had confirmed its
stature as "a fountainhead for the lasting improvement of
children's lives."
</P>
<P>
"That is certainly how we feel about it, and that's why we'll
continue to use the CRC as a lever to help move leaders and
communities everywhere," she said.
</P>
<P>
"On Saturday, November 20th -- the 10th anniversary of the CRC
-- we will celebrate three things," Bellamy said. "The global
resolve that brought the Convention into existence; the positive
changes it has spurred; and, not least, the enormous potential it
shill holds for guiding us in fulfilling what we have universally
declared to be our children's fundamental rights."
</P>
<P>
So far, the CRC has been ratified by 191 nations, making it the
most widely accepted treaty in the history of the United Nations.
It represents a set of common standards and values against which
all countries can measure progress.
</P>
<P>
The CRC has spurred a process of law reform in which more
than 50 states have amended their constitutions and/or legal
codes to take account of children's rights.
</P>
<P>
An additional 23 states are in the process of reviews of law.
</P>
<P>
The CRC has also altered the global peace and security agenda.
By making the rights of children a paramount issue during
conflict, the CRC helped clear the way for "Days of Tranquillity"
in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Angola,
Afghanistan and Sudan -- all countries where major immunization
campaigns have been able to reach millions of children during
cease-fires negotiated on the shoulders of the CRC.
</P>
<P>
While praising these advancement, however, there is too much
which has been left undone.
</P>
<P>
"Almost 12 million children are still dying every year from
entirely preventable causes," Bellamy said. "HIV/AIDS has been allowed
to devastate far too many communities, killing 2 million African
last year alone -- the number one killer on on that continent; and
in a world where civil conflict is plaguing more than 40 countries
and regions, children and women have increasingly become the
victims of violent death and dismemberment."
</P>
<P>
The CRC was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on
November 20, 1989. It came into force on September 1990 after
being ratified by the necessary 20 states. The Convention was by
far the most rapidly ratified human rights convention in
history, and has since been adopted by 191 nations.

<HEADLINE> African Trade Ministers Vow To Remove Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- African ministers of trade
have formulated a common position to oppose a new round of trade
negotiations of the World Trade Organization (WTO), a Zimbabwean
senior official said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira told the
Zimbabwe News Agency that Africa would instead press for the
realization of the 1993 Uruguay round negotiations meant to remove
trade barriers to free trade on selected areas like quotas on
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers acting under the Organization of African Unity
have resolved that they should be given preferential treatment
which must be maintained until such time the playing field is
levelled. They should also get time to implement the Uruguay
agreements," he said.
</P>
<P>
The WTO is scheduled to hold its third Ministerial Conference
at the end of this month in the United Stated where new trade
initiatives including a total liberalization of markets are to be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
The African ministers have resolved to fight hard within the
WTO to ensure their objectives are heard, Shamuyarira said.
</P>
<P>
They are scheduled to meet with their counterparts of the
Caribbean and Pacific countries within two weeks in the Dominican
Republic to come up with a common position for developing
countries, he said.

Children's Fund (UNICEF) on Thursday said that despite
disappointment and missed opportunities, the "World is a better

</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind that this convention has
improved the lives of millions of children and made the world a
better place," UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
"It has stimulated legal reform in dozens of countries around
the world, enjoyed governments to take the health and well-being
of children seriously, and initiated a process of goal-setting
that keeps everyone honest about global progress -- or lack of
it," she said.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that "Some might emphasize the ways in which
the CRC has fallen short" of its lofty aims, Bellamy said that
the concrete achievements attributable to the treaty has

While praising these advancements, however, Bellamy was quick
to add that "too much has been left undone."
</P>
<P>
"Basic health, education and protection are not simply
services that states may or may not provide -- they are
recognized rights that states are obliged to fulfill," she said.

The Convention on the Rights of the Child was adopted by the

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Libyan Foreign Ministers to Discuss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Thursday that he will hold talks with his Libyan
counterpart Omar al-Montassir on the Sudanese issue late in the
day.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that al-Montassir will arrive in Cairo in
the evening and they will review the two countries' joint efforts
aimed at helping realize national reconciliation in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss the coordination between the
Egyptian-Libyan efforts and those exerted by other parties related
to the Sudanese issue, Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted him
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya proposed in August a five-point peace plan
calling for permanent cease-fire in Sudan and a meeting of a
preparatory committee for a peace conference aimed at seeking
national reconciliation in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and the Muslim opposition parties have
accepted the proposal, which they lauded as a basis for the
country's peace process.
</P>
<P>
But the southern rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA)
has expressed reservations over the initiative. It favored the
mediation role played by the Eastern African Inter-Governmental
Authority on Development, or IGAD, between it and the government.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim parties, which want to share power with Sudan's
Islamic government, and the SPLA, which has been fighting since
1983 for greater autonomy for the mostly Christian south, form an
umbrella group, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The NDA
will meet on November 22 in Kampala, Uganda, to form a final stand
on the Egyptian-Libyan initiative.
</P>
<P>
Moussa disclosed that contacts are underway to merge the
Egypt-Libyan peace plan and IGAD's mediation role. But he said
"the matter is still subject to consideration and discussions."
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya have briefed the Arab foreign ministers on
their initiative and received a positive response, he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has repeated its keenness on securing Sudan's sovereignty
and territorial integrity and plays a key role in mediating
between the Sudanese government and the opposition for fear that a
possible disintegration of its southern neighbor may endanger the
Nile, its major water source.

<HEADLINE> Simitis: Athens Desires Good Climate in Greek-U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming visit to Greece
by U.S. President Bill Clinton was a very important event and the
Greek government desired a good climate in bilateral relations
between the two countries, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said that Greece's role in the Balkan region, bilateral
cooperation, Cyprus, Greek-Turkish relations were on the agenda of
Clinton's visit, which was due to start this Saturday but now
scheduled to take place on November 19.
</P>
<P>
As for the demonstrations that promised to greet Clinton, the
premier stressed that Greece was a country in which the expression
of opinion was free and for this reason there would be no
restrictions on it.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Greece must make good on its reputation
of having a great tradition of hospitality.
</P>
<P>
Following consultations of the two governments Wednesday,
Clinton put off his scheduled visit to Greece for six days and cut
it down to 24 hours amid security concerns and the prospects of
left-wing anti-American protests during his first ever visit to
Greece.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The president of the
54th General Assembly (GA) session, Theo-Ben Gurirab, Thursday
called for better protection of the rights of children worldwide
in order to ensure future survival of humanity.
</P>
<P>
Gurirab made the statement at the plenary session of the GA on
Thursday morning on the occasion of the commemoration of the 10th
anniversary of the Convention of the Rights of the Child.
</P>
<P>
"There are, I am told, over 2 billion children in the world
today: 2 billion precious fruit trees and beautiful flowers of the
human family -- our souls! Their protection and development is
crucial to the future survival of humanity," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must not fail our children, because the consequences are
unthinkable," he said. "They need special attention and priority
for a variety of compelling reasons -- moral, social, economic and
cultural as well."
</P>
<P>
"Since the adoption of the Convention, children's interest is
now placed higher on public and developmental agendas than every
before -- and significant recognition of their rights is reflected
in the initiatives that U.N. Member States undertake in the fields
such as public policy, law reform and enforcement as well as
social security," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, however, the process of globalization has
sharply widened the economic and social gap between and within
states, with women and children, being put precariously at the
receiving end in the Third World," he said.
</P>
<P>
The years 2002-2010 have been proclaimed by the General
Assembly as the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and
Non-violence for the Children of the World.
</P>
<P>
"We must translate this lofty declaration of intent into a
viable plan of action, buttressing it with generous funds,
resources and unwavering commitment by the entire international
community," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian Editor Jailed 90 Days for Libel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Eben Quarcoo, former editor of
the "Free Press'' weekly, was Thursday sentenced to 90 days
imprisonment and fined 1.5 million cedis (about 600 U.S. dollars)
for libel by the Accra circuit court, Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
On December 30, 1994, the newspaper published an article
accusing the Ghanaian First Lady Nana Konadu Agyeman Rawlings of
smuggling gold and narcotic drugs outside the country.
</P>
<P>
Quarcoo was found guilty on two counts of criminal libel with a
penalty of 90 days jail sentence on each count to run
concurrently.
</P>
<P>
The court fined Tommy Thompson Books Limited, Publishers of
the Free Press, five million cedis (2,000 U.S. dollars) for the
same offense.
</P>
<P>
Martin Amidu, Deputy Attorney-General who prosecuted, said the
court should have handed over a stiffer punishment.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think the sentence is commensurate with the gravity
of the offence committed by the accused. It is a serious
indictment for someone to accuse a decent Ghanaian of dealing in
narcotic drugs without evidence". Amidu said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Horn of Africa Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday met in a closed-door session to hear a briefing
by the U.N. Secretariat on the latest situation of the conflict in
the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Fall, the U.N. assistant secretary-general for
political affairs, is scheduled to brief the 15 Security Council
members on the latest developments in the conflict between Ethiopia
and Eritrea, U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia on Tuesday dismissed Eritrea's offer to pull its
troops out of the disputed areas of their common border, saying
Eritrea has talked before of withdrawal but never delivered,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean President Isayas Afewerki said on Sunday that he was,
in principle, prepared to pull his troops back to positions they
held before a war between the two countries erupted 18 months ago
if it would help end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
A peace plan put forward by the Organization of African Unity
(OAU), calls for a ceasefire monitored by independent observers
and then for both sides to redeploy their troops from the war
zones before work begins on the border's demarcation.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has accepted the plan in broad terms but insists it
will not agree to a ceasefire unless Eritrea first withdraws from
all the territory it has occupied.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed in two rounds
of fighting in the war, which began in May last year. There have
been only sporadic clashes since June, but both sides have sent
reinforcements to the front lines and diplomats say a third
round could begin at any time.

<P>
GENEVA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland Thursday marked its
third national anti-alcoholism day by urging people to drink in a
responsible manner and to be aware of the dangers of excessive
alcohol use.
</P>
<P>
With the millennium celebrations only a few weeks away, the
Swiss Institute for Alcohol and Drug Prevention warned consumers
that New Year's Eve celebrations can only too easily end in
alcohol-related traffic accidents, acts of violence and other
tragedies.
</P>
<P>
To mark the third national anti-alcoholism day, the institute
launched an information campaign and prevention activities in 35
towns and cities throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
More than 140 paintings created by alcoholics undergoing
therapy will be exhibited in the towns and cities of Zurich, St.
Gallen, Lucerne and Nyon.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics provided by the institute, 33,000
people are undergoing treatment and therapy for alcohol abuse each
year. About one in five consumers cannot control their drinking,
leaving 912,000 people drinking too much on certain occasions.

<HEADLINE> French FM in Syria for Talks on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine arrived here Thursday afternoon for talks with
Syrian officials on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day stay here, Vedrine is scheduled to hold
talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and conveyed him a
message from French President Jacques Chirac. He will also meet
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa. The content of the
message was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
France has recently intensified diplomatic efforts to help
resume the Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which have been stalled
since February, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said the Israeli-Syrian
talks could be resumed within a few weeks provided there is an
agreement on written formula on the resumption of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The trip came a few days after the Paris visit by Bashar
al-Assad, son of President al-Assad. Bashar is groomed to succeed
al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
The blackout imposed on Bashar's talks with Chirac indicated
the importance of the talks and the French-Syrian understanding on
a wide range of issues, foremost of which is the Lebanese issue.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its power-broker Syria have land disputes with
Israel. And Syria does not want the Lebanon issue is solved apart
from the return of its Golan Heights Israel captured from it in
the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine's visit to Syria is part of his three-nation regional
tour. He will leave for Lebanon Friday morning and then travel on
to Egypt, an important mediator in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Ex-ruling Party Terms Case Against Sharif Sad Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Muslim League
(PML), the former ruling party of Pakistan, Thursday expressed its
fear that deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif will not get fair
trial in the alleged attempted murder and hijacking case.
</P>
<P>
"It is a sad development," Raja Zafarul Haq, convenor of PML's
Coordination Council, was quoted by the News Network
International, a private news service here, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Terming the registration of case against Nawaz Sharif a
one-sided affair, Haq said the military government took one long
month for forming charges. "We don't see fair trial for Nawaz
Sharif because the military government took one month to complete
charges."
</P>
<P>
"Under international law, an arrested person is informed of the
charges within 24 hours of the arrest, which in this case was not
done," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif and some of his close allies have been under "protective
custody" since his government was dismissed in a military coup on
October 12. He remains head of the former ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Sharif and four others were charged with "attempted murder,
hijacking, criminal conspiracy and common intent" on Wednesday
night. Some of these charges carry death penalty under certain
Pakistan penal laws.

He offered his praise while meeting counselor representatives
who are here attending a meeting to mark the 50th anniversary of
the establishment of the Counselor's Office in the State Council.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past 50 years, the Communist Party of China
and the governments have always attached great importance to the
work of counselors, which have proved to be very important and
valuable.
</P>
<P>
He noted that most counselors are influential and revered non-
Communists, adding that they have offered useful advice to the
government and reported public opinion, something very important
for state decision making.
</P>
<P>
With their specialties and social influence, the counselors
have made great contributions to the country's economic
construction, social development and national reunification, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that they will continue to make
contributions to China's modernization and reform and opening up
policies.
</P>
<P>
The counselor's meeting, organized by the Counselor's Office in
the State Council, recalled the 50 years of counseling work and
discussed their new tasks in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Counselor representatives at all government levels across the
country attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> 2 Palestinian Guerrillas Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Islamic Jihad
Thursday announced that two of its members were killed in its
recent attacks on Israeli forces in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Damascus-based group returned to the last active
Arab-Israeli front line early this month after many years of
absence, and launched two attacks on the Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
The two fighters were killed during the group's second military
operation on Israeli outposts inside the Israeli occupied border
zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israelis out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Himalaya Mountains Appear Earlier Than Originally Thought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists have
confirmed that the Himalayas didn't appear until some 40 million
years ago. The finding tells us that the Himalayas appeared nearly
ten million years earlier than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
The new findings, based on analysis of rock specimens recovered
during exploration in the area was approved by the China
Geological University, one of China's leading institutes in the
field.
</P>
<P>
A group of experts from Chengdu University of Science and
Engineering found a new Marine Horizon along with hundreds of
geological specimens on the northern slope of the cordillera at an
altitude of 5,000 meters. This finding confirms that the Himalayas
were still under a vast expanse of water 40 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Marine Horizon is commonly used to determine the existence
of seawater or the height of plateaus and great mountains during a
particular period, said professor Wang Chengshan, the head of the
research group.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the new Marine Horizon has a significant
relationship with Neo-Tethys Ocean. Earlier research found a
Marine Horizon of some 50 million years ago, which led many
experts to draw the conclusion that the Himalayas rose during the
same period.

<HEADLINE> Rival Parties Clash in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Violent clashes between
supporters of Mozambique's ruling Frelimo Party (Mozambican
Liberation Front) and the former rebel movement Renamo (Mozambican
National Resistance) in the central province of Zambezia have left
ten people injured, three of them seriously.
</P>
<P>
The violence broke out Tuesday in the town of Errego, about 300
 kilometers from the provincial capital, Quelimane.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said all the ten injured people were members and
sympathizers of Frelimo.
</P>
<P>
The clashes coincided with the arrival in Errego of the Renamo
general- secretary, Joao Alexandre, who is campaigning for his
party across the northern part of Zambezia.
</P>
<P>
The deputy head of the Frelimo election campaign in Zambezia,
Deputy Defence Minister Antonio Hama Thai, made an emergency visit
to Errego on Wednesday morning, where he attacked "the violence
sponsored by Renamo during its campaign".
</P>
<P>
But he also criticized the police, accusing them of merely
watching the violence. He said that, 15 hours after the clashes,
the police had still done nothing to identify the ringleaders. The
Errego police commander, however, claimed his men did all they
could to avoid the clashes.
</P>
<P>
According to the Zambezia provincial police commander, Fernando
Saete, the violence broke out when rival Frelimo and Renamo
demonstrators crossed each other's paths on the main street in
Errego.
</P>
<P>
The Frelimo demonstrators retreated to the local Frelimo
offices, which are on the main street, but were pursued by the
Renamo mob, which then stormed the party premises.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sino-Portuguese JLG Works Well for 12 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Over the past 12 years, the Sino-
Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG) has been working well in
dealing with the affairs related to Macao's power transfer from
Portugal to China on December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
The comment was shared by the chief representatives of the two
sides of the liaison group at a press conference here Thursday
evening. The chief representatives of the two sides concluded the
37th plenary session of the JLG Wednesday, the last plenum meeting
of the group.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Portuguese JLG was set up in January 1988 as soon as
the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration went into effect. It was
decided that the work of the JLG would come to an end on January 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
"In the 12 years, the two sides have been working on the basis
of practical conditions in Macao and taken into consideration the
overall situation of Sino-Portuguese relations and the long-term
interests of Macao," said Han Zhaokang, chief representative of
the Chinese side of the liaison group.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the articles enshrined in the Joint
Declaration, the JLG has created favorable conditions for the
smooth transfer of power, Han said.
</P>
<P>
"Once more, the 37th plenary session was a conference in which
the two sides had participated with an active, pragmatic and
constructive attitude, and the results of the session were
favorable," Han said.
</P>
<P>
Santana Carlos, chief representative of the Portuguese side of
the Sino-Portuguese JLG, also gave affirmative comments on the
achievements made by the liaison group in the past years.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have made concerted efforts in resolving a number
of questions related to the handover, and some remaining issues
will surely be handled well in the days left, according to the
chief representatives.
</P>
<P>
In the past dozen years, the Sino-Portuguese JLG held 37
plenary sessions. In addition, there were 55 formal meetings of
the two chief representatives and numerous meetings of subordinate
panels and relevant specialists.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have reached consensus on Macao's joining 46
international organizations before and after the handover. And 141
international conventions have been approved by the JLG to be
applied in the future Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, officials from both sides have reached
consensus on 26 local franchise contracts which stride the
handover, and on the region's aviation agreements with 34
countries around the world. The two sides also exerted concerted
efforts to make two commercial banks in Macao enjoy the right of
issuing banking notes.
</P>
<P>
"The work of the liaison group has created favorable external
conditions for the long-term social and economic development of
the Macao SAR," Han said.
</P>
<P>
With less than 40 days left for the handover, officials of the
two sides will deepen their consultations on the matters directly
related to the handover ceremony, as well on the detailed
arrangements regarding the stationing of Chinese troops in the
Macao SAR, the chief representatives said.

<TEXT>
<P>
"There are other factors like drought and AIDs that contribute
to poverty but government policies have also contributed a lot,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
She said most countries are implementing programs that
impoverish their people, citing the Structural Adjustment Programs
and Export Processing Zones as having strongly contributed to
poverty as they are done by those who want to benefit from local
people.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Magwada, project analyst of the Public Service,
Labour and Social Welfare Ministry of Zimbabwe, told the
participants that the governments face the problem of assisting
the poor without distorting functions of the market system.
</P>
<P>
"Economic reform presents problems to the governments in terms
of matching scarce resources to social needs," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said if poverty is to be alleviated there is need for
social funds to shift from giving handouts to the poor but let
them access capital, technology, credit and land.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1998 Zimbabwe Human Development Report,
poverty is more prevalent in the rural areas with 75 percent of
households in the poor category compared to 39 percent in urban
areas.

equipped with roof-top speakers hurled stones at the UN offices,
causing considerable damages. There were no casualties reported.

On Thursday, similar demonstrations, described as large and
vocal but peaceful, took place in the western town of Herat and
Fahra. Again, no casualties were reported and no other details

Sanctions are set to be imposed by the UN Security Council on

<HEADLINE> Security Council Concerns at Humanitarian Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday voiced its concern at the worsening humanitarian
situation in Ethiopia and Eritrea, and urged the two neighboring
countries to "exercise maximum restraint."
</P>
<P>
The president of the Security Council for November, Danilo Turk
of Slovenia, made the oral statement to the press after the
15-nation council met in a closed-door session to hear a briefing
by the U.N. Secretariat on the latest situation of the conflict in
the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Council members expressed their concern at the deteriorating
humanitarian situation on the ground and called on the
international community to respond generously to the consolidated
inter-agency appeals for both countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Fall, the U.N. assistant secretary-general for
political affairs, is scheduled to brief the 15 Security Council
members on the latest developments in the conflict between
Ethiopia and Eritrea, the U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
Fall briefed the Security Council on "the status of progress
towards a negotiated settlement of the conflict between Ethiopia
and Eritrea," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Council members urged both Ethiopia and Eritrea to exercise
maximum restraint," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also commended the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), including the OAU chairman, Algerian
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and Salim Ahmed Salim,
secretary-general of the OAU, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia Tuesday dismissed Eritrea's offer to pull its troops
out of the disputed areas of their common border, saying Eritrea
has talked before of withdrawal but never delivered, reports said.

A peace plan put forward by the OAU calls for a ceasefire

Tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed in two rounds

<HEADLINE> Iran's Reformist Cleric Found Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative Special
Clerical Court on Thursday announced that the famous reformist
cleric Abdullah Nouri, Managing Director of the Khordad daily, was
found guilty on 15 charges against him.
</P>
<P>
The jury board members pronounced Nouri guilty on 11 cases
with majority of votes and on four cases unanimously, the court
said, and they did not consider him deserving any ease of
punishment, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The court started its trial on Nouri on October 30 and closed
the hearing on Wednesday by cutting off Nouri's defense for
himself.
</P>
<P>
Nouri was accused of publishing anti-religion materials and
sacrilegious articles, insulting the late Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini and opposing his views and opinions,
disseminating false ideas aimed at disturbing public opinions and
harming others, misinformation about the country's system and
insulting the system's officials and related organs.
</P>
<P>
The trial on Nouri, former interior minister impeached by the
conservative Majlis (parliament) in June last year, was believed
here as a move by the powerful conservatives for his
disqualification from forthcoming Majlis elections slated in
February.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, a top vote-winner in the first local council polling in
last February, stepped down in September from his post as the
chairman of Tehran City Council to run for the parliament.
</P>
<P>
It was widely believed that Nouri might be elected the Majlis
speaker if the reformist moderates win the parliamentary
polling.

<HEADLINE> Conditions for Resuming Syrian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine said here Thursday that the conditions for
the resumption of the Syrian-Israeli peace talks were not yet in
place.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, Vedrine
told reporters "it is highly important for us and the other peace
supporters to be apprised of al-Assad's stance."
</P>
<P>
He described his talks with al-Assad as useful for identifying
Syria's position.
</P>
<P>
"The conditions for resuming the talks on the Syrian and
Lebanese tracks were inappropriate so far as the main obstacle is
still there, namely from which point the talks should restart,"
Vedrine added.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined the inter-relations between the Syrian and
Lebanese tracks of talks.
</P>
<P>
Syria demands that the talks be resumed from where they were
left off three years ago when the negotiations hit impasse while
Israel wants the talks to start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said al-Assad voiced Syria's commitment to working for
peace and hoped Europe and France play a greater role in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
France has long wanted to play a greater role in Mideast
peacemaking, especially in Israeli-Syrian relations. Israel, for
its part, has not expressed enthusiasm for a wider French or
European role, preferring to stick with U.S. mediation and for
direct talks.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine arrived here Thursday afternoon on a one-day
visit. Syria is the first leg of Vedrine's three-nation tour and
he will travel on to Lebanon Friday morning and then Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Block Apartment Prices 25-30 Pct Down in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The prices of block
apartments have gone down some 25-30 percent lately, especially in
the capital city of Bucharest, and the demand for such dwellings
has declined even more, the official Rompres news agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The main cause of the market fall is the general economic
situation in Romania, the reports quoted Radu Moldoveanu,
secretary-general of the Romanian Association of Real Estate
Agencies, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Recession has made a great many foreign companies shrink their
activities in Romania so they have given up some headquarters and
cut short the number of experts brought from abroad, who used to
be paid handsome wages and who needed dwellings," Moldoveanu
added.
</P>
<P>
The rents too dropped from 100 U.S. dollars a month to 60-80
U.S. dollars for the average zone and in the case of other zones,
where the rent for a two-room apartment used to top 250 U.S.
dollars has now dropped to only 150-200 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The evolution of the real estate market however has had
positive consequences, as more and more people apply to real
estate agencies instead of handling such affairs by themselves.

BUCHAREST, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
launched, during this week, the first stage of the
two-million-euro EU-funded program for technology transfer and
quality management, the official Romprs news agency reported here
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This program stipulates a financing of up to 50,000 euros of
the projects in the fields of the machine building, leather goods,
electric appliances, textiles, fine mechanical goods, chemistry,
petrochemistry aiming, among other things, at setting up joint
ventures in the production units, compounds sub-contracts,

A special attention will be granted to the bills on environment
protection, to be offered an extra-financing up to 30,000 euros,
the program's total budget amounting to 5.7 million euros.
</P>
<P>
These funds prove the importance EU gives to the support of the

<HEADLINE> EU Sets Deadline for French-British Beef Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
executive arm set a deadline Thursday for France to end its ban
on British beef by early next week or to face legal action.
</P>
<P>
"We set ourselves a Tuesday deadline. So before Tuesday, we
hope a solution will be found. But we're ready to derive the full
consequences of an eventual negative conclusion of this case,"
said Riccardo Levi, spokesman for European Commission President
Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
"If steps to lift the embargo are not in place, the first step
of a legal procedure against France for non-respect of law will be
taken," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
EU Health Commissioner David Byrne is expected to report to the
European Commission Tuesday to take first effective step against
France since the nation decided not to look at an EU ruling ending
a ban on British beef.
</P>
<P>
The 15-country EU lifted a worldwide ban on the export of
British beef on August 1. The ban was imposed in 1996 because of
fears that the so-called mad cow disease could be linked to a
similar brain-wasting disease in humans.
</P>
<P>
However, the French government imposed its own ban on October
1, saying new evidence showed British beef still posed a danger.
Meanwhile, an EU scientific committee stopped the arguments last
week, putting more pressure on France to comply.
</P>
<P>
So far, Britain still hopes to avoid taking legal action, but
its farmers and opposition politicians have been pressing the
government to take firm action.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian PM Opposes Constitution Amendment by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
 Frederick Sumaye Thursday said that all amendments as deemed
necessary to the country's constitution should be effected by the
parliament and not through pressure from any quarters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 17th session of the National Assembly in the
central town of Dodoma, the prime minister stressed that the
three-government lobbyists shall never achieve their goals through
intimidation, nor should they pretend to represent the feelings of
all Tanzanians.
</P>
<P>
The present Tanzanian Union constitution has provided for a
two- government system (the Union government and the Zanzibar
government) and the Union between Tanganyika and Zanzibar has
lived for more than 35 years in harmony, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said if there is anyone aspiring for a three-government
system of union, or a union composed of the government of
Tanganyika, the government of Zanzibar and the Union government,
he or she should wait until other Tanzanians have their say on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the people are availed of the
opportunity to express their views in the parliament and he
praised all individuals, social groups and political parties for
their contributions to the proposed constitutional changes.
</P>
<P>
He said the major challenge faced by Tanzanians after the
demise of the founding president Julius Nyerere last month is how
to utilize the national solidarity and skills to develop the
country.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye's remarks on the Union comes about a week after the
opposition camp in the on-going parliament session cautioned over
the use of threats to sustain the Union.
</P>
<P>
The opposition said in the special National Assembly session
held to pay tribute to Nyerere that the Union will never be
nurtured, protected and sustained through threats and
witch-hunting.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader in the parliament Fatma Maghimbi said the
current system of the Union has a lot of contradictions that need
to be addressed and she suggested a union of three governments.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar, comprising Unguja and Pemba, as well as a number of
smaller islands, joined Tanganyika in 1964 in response to
Nyerere's proposal to form the United Republic of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
According to the Union constitution, the Zanzibar government
has the right to deal with its domestic issues independently
except those concerning diplomacy, national defense and security.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government Thursday
awarded a contract to Vivendi Telecom International, a French
firm, to break the monopoly in its mobile phone market.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to reduce the charges of cellular phones
and expand the services to the countryside, local observers said.
</P>
<P>
Vivendi and its Kenyan partner Sameer Investments won the
contract after defeating five other finalists for the contract,
said Samuel Chepkong'a, director of the regulatory body
Communications Commission of Kenya (CCK).
</P>
<P>
Vivendi Telecom, a unit of the Paris-based Vivendi
conglomerate, bid 55 million U.S. dollars and pledged to provide
582,700 lines in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
It will get a license next March and start operating before the
end of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Currently, customers have to pay around 50,000 shillings (about
660 U.S. dollars) to get the mobile phone connected and 28
shillings (about 37 cents)
</P>
<P>
per minute to make a call.
</P>
<P>
Safaricom, the current only mobile provider in the country, and
Vivendi will be the only two firms in Kenya's mobile phone market
for five years before the regulatory body considers licensing
another provider.

<HEADLINE> Romania Strives to Relate Currency to "Hard-Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian national
currency leu should not be related only to the U.S. dollar as
Romania's Central Bank (BNR)'s hard currency policy would not
attain its target of strengthening it, the Adevarul daily Thursday
quoted BNR Governor Mugur Isarescu as saying.
</P>
<P>
The leu suffered a lot by relating mainly to the U.S. dollar,
having lost more than half of its value against the latter since
the beginning of the year. Important steps must be made, stressed
the governor, in order to achieve the leu relating to a
"hard-currency basket," made up of the main currencies for
Romania's foreign trade operations to be run in.
</P>
<P>
One of them has been already made in January, when BNR
announced that the leu would be related not only to the U.S.
dollar, but also to the euro.
</P>
<P>
The next step to be made, in the future, is the reversal of the
positions between these two currencies. The euro will take the
first position, as it is an account currency, by the year 2002
when it is to become a physical currency. BNR will have to relate
the leu to the German mark which doubled its weight in the
Romanian exports, during the last six years, to the pound sterling
whose weight grew four times over the same time span, as well as
to other European currencies, Isarescu said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar went down during the first eight months of this
year, with its weight amounting to only 37.9 percent since 1993
when it represented 68.9 percent of the revenues brought by the
exports.
</P>
<P>
The final step towards the "hard currency basket" will be made
at the moment when BNR reaches a predictable rate for the Romanian
currency, Isarescu ended.

NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) - Kenya's Parliament members
agreed unanimously on Thursday to cut the presidential power in a
historic change to the constitution by a vote of 185-0.

Under the constitutional amendment carried out by the members,

Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, who had been vocal in his

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Expected to Undergo Medical Checkup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet is expected to undergo an independent medical test to see
whether he is fit to be extradited to Spain, a report here said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Reuters report quoted Pinochet's lawyer Michael Caplan as
saying that the retired general, who is currently under house
arrest near London, has responded to a suggestion British Home
Secretary Jack Straw offered in a letter last week.
</P>
<P>
Straw had suggested Pinochet to have a checkup after the
Chilean government asked for its former head-of-state to be
released on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
"I have responded today to the letter from the Home Office
received on Friday," Caplan said.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in a London hospital over a year ago
while he was recovering from a minor back operation. A Spanish
judge wanted to try him on torture charges dating from the latter
part of his 1973-1990 rule in Chile.
</P>
<P>
A London magistrate said earlier last month that Pinochet could
be extradited to Spain, giving Pinochet's fate to Straw, who has
the last saying on whether to sign the extradition papers.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, Straw could block the extradition on
compassionate grounds, and on October 14 Chile asked him to do so,
citing Pinochet's age and health.
</P>

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Unionists Reject Peace Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Pro-British Unionist
politicians Thursday narrowly rejected a proposal from the Irish
Republican Army aimed at reviving Northern Ireland's stalled peace
pact.
</P>
<P>
The plan was rejected by 14 votes to 13 at a meeting of the
powerful Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) bloc in the Northern Ireland
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
U.S. talks mediator George Mitchell was informed of the
decision and Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson
held 40-minute discussions with the UUP to try to convince them to
change their mind.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night talks were continuing at the Stormont
parliament buildings in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The plan was effectively rejected when the UUP members turned
down a proposal that it should be referred to the party's
750-strong policy-making council which gives grassroots views.
</P>
<P>
But the move was not being seen as a rejection of the whole
package.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell has struggled for 10 weeks to broker a deal between
the UUP and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to end wrangling
which has stalled the Good Friday peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The IRA olive branch is shrouded in the secrecy which has been
the hallmark of Mitchell's bid to implement the landmark Good
Friday peace accord signed in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell has struggled for 10 weeks to end wrangling between
the UUP and Sinn Fein to break an impasse over guerrilla
disarmament that has held up formation of a power-sharing
executive for the province.
</P>
<P>
The UUP insists it will not sit in a coalition home-rule
government until the IRA disarms -- a policy summed up in the the
pro-British party's mantra "no guns, no government."
</P>
<P>
The latest rescue package reportedly involves a series of
step-by-step actions and public statements but there were
indication the IRA is not yet prepared to bow to the unionist
demand for a handover of weapons -- which the guerrilla group has
traditionally seen as a form of surrender -- in advance of the
formation of a ruling executive, Reuters said.
</P>
<P>
It is suggested the IRA might appoint a link-man to liaise with
a disarmament commission, headed by Canadian former General John
de Chastelain, which would be seen by all sides as the start of a
process of disarmament.

lots on 10 November, beating the previous record set on 8 October
by more than 20,000 lots.
</P>
<P>
The number of lots traded represents more than 180 million
barrels of oil, or nearly two and a half times total daily world
oil consumption, the IPE said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> BT Profit Hits New Highs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) - British Telecommunications Plc
(BT) increased its profits in the second quarter of its financial
year to 890 million pounds (1.45 billion US dollars), 3.9 percent
higher than in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
That was ahead of analysts' expectations. Sales were also
higher than expected - up to 5.329 billion pounds compared with
4.403 billion pounds last time, BT announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sales growth was driven by the expansion of its mobile
phone group BT Cellnet, which added 1.4m customers, and internet
and multi-media traffic which doubled in six months.
</P>
<P>
BT said call growth was the strongest this decade although
price wars curbed turnover to less impressive figures.
</P>
<P>
Inland call sales rose by 2.4 percent in the six months.
Internationally, call turnover was up 5.5 percent, it added.
</P>
<P>
BT's Chairman Iain Vallance said the global communications
industry was going through a period of unprecedented structural
and technological change and said earnings growth had been
achieved despite mobile costs and the costs of developing new
businesses.
</P>
<P>
"Growth prospects in the UK and internationally remain good but
we face increasing competition as the globalisation of our
industry continues," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pak Rules out Taliban Involvement in Rocket Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has ruled out the
possibility that the Afghan Taliban militia were behind a series
of rocket attacks in Islamabad Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Foreign Office Friday asserted that
"there can be no doubt that these terrorist acts have been
perpetrated by elements hostile to the interests of Pakistan and
Afghanistan in addition to creating a sense of instability and
insecurity."
</P>
<P>
"We have noted the statement by the Taliban leadership strongly
condemning these explosions," the statement said, adding that
"these acts of terrorism will not be allowed to create
misunderstanding with friendly countries and misgivings in our
external relations."
</P>
<P>
Taliban supreme leader Mulla Mohammad Omar earlier Friday
condemned the rocket attacks, describing them as "a conspiracy" to
harm Taliban's relations with Pakistan and to increase tension
between Afghanistan and the United Nations and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Six rockets attacks, which occurred two days before a
U.S.-proposed U.N. Security Council resolution envisaging
sanctions against Afghanistan takes effect, were apparently
targeted at U.N. and U.S. installations in Islamabad, police said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan "strongly condemned" the rocket firing in Islamabad as
"acts of premeditated and wanton terrorism," said the Foreign
Office statement.
</P>
<P>
Investigations will expose those "evil forces who cannot
succeed in their nefarious designs," it said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is committed to combating terrorism and will spare no
efforts to expose and punish those responsible for this
reprehensible crime, it stressed.

DURBAN, South Africa, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian

<HEADLINE> Renewed Sanctions Disprove U.S. Goodwill Overture, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani said on Friday the recent renewal of
U.S. sanctions against Iran has once again disproved the
U.S. goodwill overture to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Friday prayers congregation on the campus of
Tehran University, Rafsanjani said the Islamic Republic of Iran
will never succumb to those sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"The decision by Washington has again disproved the allegedly
good intentions of the Americans in their dealings with Iran,"
the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has recently renewed the economic
sanctions imposed in 1979 on Iran following the takeover of the
U.S. embassy in Tehran by Iranian students on the heydays of the
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the sanctions were renewed because the troubled
relations between Washington and Tehran had not been "fully
restored."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, chairman of the powerful advisory State Expediency
Council, said the behavior of the U.S. governments has been
markedly against what they have preached.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government intimated its willingness for talks with
the Iranian government and showed good-will feelings in its
international political propaganda, he said, but at exactly the
same time Washington extended its sanctions against Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian former president accused the U.S. government of
trying every device to lead the political situation in Iran to a
different course and ruin the Iranian national unity and
independence.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, several senior U.S. officials
extended overtures to Iran for "unconditional dialog" to improve
relations between the two countries which were severed in 1980.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian officials repeat would be "meaningless."

<HEADLINE> Three WBA Titles at Stake on Holyfield-Lewis II Under Card </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Sharmba Mitchell puts his
WBA super lightweight title on the line and two other champions
defend their belts on the undercard of Saturday's rematch between
Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell (45-2, 29KOs) faces Elio Ortiz of Venezuela. Also
defending titles on the undercard are WBA cruiserweight champion
Fabrice Tiozzo and WBA lightweight title holder Steffano Zoff of
Italy.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell is riding a 14-fight winning streak. He captured the
WBA title in impressive fashion in October 1998 by scoring a
unanimous decision over Khalid Rahilou in France.
</P>
<P>
Ortiz, fighting in the United States for the first time, is
ranked third by the WBA in the super lightweight division. The 25-
year-old Venezuelan has an 18-3 record with 14 knockouts.
</P>
<P>
In the cruiserweight title tilt, two-time champion Tiozzo looks
to resume his injury-plagued career when he meets Ken Murphy of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Tiozzo has recorded knockout victories in his two title
defenses, topping American Terry Ray in one round and Brazil's
Ezequiel Paixao in two.
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's other title fight, the lightweight strap could
change hands for the third time in 18 months when Zoff makes his
initial defense against mandatory challenger Gilberto Serrano of
Venzuela.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Warns Against Political Struggles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani on Friday warned against factional struggles
in the country as the wrangling between the rival moderate and
conservative factions reached a new peak in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Friday prayer congregation on the campus of
Tehran University, he called on political rivals in Iran to stop
quibbling among themselves, but to work for creating a peaceful
society on the threshold of the sixth elections for Majlis (
parliament) slated for February.
</P>
<P>
Political bickering in Iran would bring smile on the face of
the people in Washington, but those smiles would never bring peace
or security to Iran, he warned, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, currently chairman of the powerful advisory State
Expediency Council, underlined that Iran needs peace and political
stability so that the people would be able to go to the polls and
cast their votes for the candidate of their choice in a totally
peaceful environment.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's warning came one day after the Iranian
conservative Special Cleric Court convicted the famous reformist
cleric Abdullah Nouri, a close ally to the moderate President
Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The court announced late Thursday that Nouri, Managing
Director of the Khordad daily, was found guilty on 15 cases and he
would not deserve any ease of punishment.
</P>
<P>
The court started trial on Nouri on October 30 and closed the
hearing on Wednesday by cutting off his defense against the
charges ranging from publishing anti-religious materials and
sacrilegious articles to insulting the late Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
The trial was publicly believed here as a move by the powerful
conservatives for his disqualification from the forthcoming Majlis
elections due for February and a blow to the moderates.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, former interior minister and vice president for
Development aor the parliament.
</P>
<P>
It was widely believed that Nouri might be elected the Majlis
speaker if the reformist moderates win the parliamentary polling.
</P>
<P>
However, with his conviction, Nouri will go to prison to join
his friend Gholam Hussein Karbaschi, former Tehran Mayor, who has
been jailed on graft charges by the conservative judiciary since
May.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Growth Jumps in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. productivity
Growth jumped in the third quarter while growth in labor costs
rose moderately, according to the Labor Department's report
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that productivity, defined as the amount of
output for each hour of work, increased at a 4.2 percent annual
rate from July through September. That was a bigger-than-expected
rebound from a sluggish second quarter and the largest gain since
4.4 percent in the first quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, unit labor costs, considered a key measure of
wage pressure, picked up just 0.6 percent, the slowest quarterly
increase so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The acceleration in productivity was expected by economists
because of a resurgence in the pace of economic growth in the
third quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has said that the
nation's central bankers will be particularly alert to
productivity changes as they prepare to meet Nov. 16 to consider
whether to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The third quarter gain in productivity followed a small 0.6
percent gain in the second quarter and a 2.7 percent rise in the
first quarter.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior police official in
Islamabad Friday suspected the involvement of foreign hand in a
series of rocket attacks in the Pakistani capital city.
</P>
<P>
"The modus operandi and the intended targets show that these
were acts of terrorism and involvement of foreign hand could not
be ruled out," Senior Superintendent Police Nasir Khan Durrani
told Radio Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He, however, did not pinpoint "the foreign hand."
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations indicated that all the incidents
were inter-linked and attacks were carried out by one group. He
said the rockets used appeared to be locally made.
</P>
<P>
The police official said that security arrangements have been
beefed up in the city following the terrorist attacks. "Strict
vigil will be observed at all the entry points of the federal
capital to guard against the anti-state elements," Durrani
asserted.
</P>
<P>
Six rockets targeting U.N. and U.S. installations rocked
Islamabad Friday morning, most of them having failed to hit the

<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Central
Military Commission Jiang Zemin called today for cross-century
advancement of military work at a meeting of the chiefs-of-staff..
</P>
<P>
Safeguarding security and unification is of primary importance
to any nation, and a powerful national defense and military
strength is a solid backing for national security, said Jiang, who
is also president of the state and general secretary of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that China opposes any unjust wars, but in
just wars such as safeguarding its security and unity, it will
fight until victory.
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese army strategy should be fully developed to
prepare the military for possible war, adding that people are the
critical factor for winning a war, while weaponry should also be
improved and strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Command centers, called the "brains of an army" by late Chinese
leaders Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, should be given strategic
importance in army-building and be made into highly efficient
military decision-making institutions, according to Jiang, who
also called for greater efforts to foster a team of military
talent for staff chiefs.
</P>
<P>
The five-day meeting of chiefs-of-staff was concluded this
afternoon. Those present at today's meeting included Vice Chairmen
of Central Military Commission Hu Jintao, Zhang Wannian, Chi
Haotian, and several members of the Central Military Commission.

DURBAN, South Africa, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian
President Olusegun Obasanjo proposed on Friday that the
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting should adopt an economic

relief for poor countries.

If it was not possible to adopt such a charter in Durban, the
Commonwealth secretariat should work toward such a charter being
adopted at the next summit, Obasanjo added.

The Harare Declaration adopted by the heads of government at

<HEADLINE> IMF Projects World Economy Growth by 3.5 Pct in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Global economic and
financial conditions have improved markedly after the turbulence
in emerging economies in 1997-98 and the global growth in 2000 is
projected around 3.5 percent, according to the International
Monetary Fund's (IMF) latest World Economic Outlook (WEO).
</P>
<P>
While introducing the IMF's bi-annual flagship publication to
reporters here Friday, Deputy Director of the IMF's Research
Department Flemming Larson said the assessment and outlook is the
product of a comprehensive inter-departmental review of world
economic developments, which draws primarily on information the
IMF staff gather through their consultations with member
countries.
</P>
<P>
The WEO, which is prepared for the IMF/World Bank Interim
Committee and Annual Meetings, notes that growth projections for
1999 have been revised up significantly for all the Asian crisis
economies and Japan as well, and the economic downturn in Brazil
and Russia have been shallower than expected.
</P>
<P>
A recovery in world oil prices and the arrest of declines in
many other commodity prices have provided relief for some
commodity-exporting countries, the projected strengthening of
growth in Europe "seems to be materializing" and "growth remains
impressive amid few signs of emerging price or wage pressures" in
the United states, WEO adds.
</P>
<P>
Listing economic growth forecasts on regional basis, WEO says
Asia is seen advancing 3.1 percent in 1999 and around 5 percent in
2000, Africa is now projected growing at a 3.1 percent rate in
1999 and at about 4.8 percent in 2000, the Western Hemisphere is
projected to record 0.1 percent growth in 1999 and around 3.9
percent in 2000, and for Europe and the Middle East growth is
projected around 1.8 percent this year and 3.1 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
WEO also underlines that many challenges remain to be addressed
to ensure the recovery is sustainable and more balanced.
</P>
<P>
It states "there is particular reason for concern about the
unbalanced pattern of growth observed recently among the major
industrial countries and about the economic and financial
consequences worldwide if the eventual demand in the United States
turns out to be sharper than is generally expected at present."
</P>
<P>
"While the return to broad price stability remains an important
policy achievement, macroeconomic instability has persisted in
much of the world economy, continuing to post challenges for, and
in many ways making new demands on, economic policies," it adds.
</P>
<P>
WEO also warns that "If growth were to weaken significantly in
the United States without offsets in Japan and Europe, there would
also be reason for concern about the sustainability of the
recoveries underway in the Asian economies recently in crisis, and
much of Latin America would be particularly vulnerable under such
a scenario."
</P>
<P>
It also notes that an added risk in the global economy relates
to "potential financial market reactions to actual or perceived
Y2K compliance problems in emerging markets."

<HEADLINE> HK Government Signs Contract on Electronic Service  Delivery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
Friday signed a contract with Timbo Star Investment Limited on
implementing the first phase of the government's Electronic
Service Delivery (ESD) scheme.
</P>
<P>
With the fulfillment of the contract, the public will be able
to enjoy on-line services delivered by 10 government departments
and public agencies in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
The services to be delivered under the first phase of the
scheme include payment of government bills, submission of tax
returns, purchase of tax reserve certificates, job searches,
renewal of driving and vehicle licenses, voter registration, as
well as information look-up for tourists.
</P>
<P>
The ESD scheme is a key initiative under the "Digital 21" IT
Strategy to promote a wider use of IT in the community.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, Timbo Star will provide the system to
deliver ESD services for the government for five years. The
contract can be extended for two more years on the same terms at
the option of the government.
</P>
<P>
"The company is planning to complete the implementation of the
project within 11 months," said K.C. Kwong, secretary for
information and technology and broadcasting at the contract
signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"We have full confidence in its capability and commitment and
we can expect that the first phase of the ESD scheme will be up
and running in October 2000," he said.
</P>
<P>
Timbo Star is a joint venture of Hutchison Communications
Limited and Compaq Computer Limited.
</P>
<P>
Kwong said that the implementation of the ESD scheme has also
another important mission -- to familiarize the public with the
conduct of electronic business, give them confidence in such
transactions and encourage them to purchase goods and services
offered by the private sector over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"Our vision is to make Hong Kong a leading digital city in the
globally connected world in the 21st century. Implementation of
the ESD scheme will be an important step towards achieving that,"
he stressed.

</P>
<P>
The reform catered to the strong aspirations and demands of
millions of serfs, which accounted for 95 percent of the Tibetan
population at that time, Gyabo said during his meeting with the
delegation from the Canadian External Affairs Ministry, headed by
Jille Sinclair, director in charge of global affairs in the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Gyabo also attributed the backward economy of Tibet to poor
natural conditions as well as the frequent disturbance caused by
the Dalai Lama-led group.
</P>
<P>
He said the central government has made large appropriations
for the maintenance of many of Tibet's important historic sites
and temples, and that Tibetan medicine, culture and traditions
have been properly protected.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian visitors are expected to remain in the region for
three days.

<HEADLINE> Renovation of Famous Chinese Warship Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Renovation of the famous
Zhongshan Warship officially began today at the Hubei Shipyard in
central China to mark the 133rd anniversary of the birth of Dr.
Sun Yat-sen, the great forerunner of the Chinese Democratic
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
The renovation project, approved by the State Administration of
Cultural Heritage in July this year, is estimated to cost about 12
million yuan (1.44 million U.S. dollars) and is expected to be
completed in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The Zhongshan Warship was named after Sun Yat-sen whose name in
Mandarin Chinese is Sun Zhongshan.
</P>

sunk in the Yangtze River in Wuhan during China's War of
Resistance Against Japan (1937-1945).
</P>
<P>
It was raised out water on January 28, 1997 and was immediately
sent to Hubei Shipyard for preservation.
</P>
<P>
Li Jianqiu, chief of the renovation team, told Xinhua that the
renovation project will follow two principles: to ensure the
warship's framework remains unchanged, and to restore its original
look.
</P>
<P>
The Hubei Shipyard has also pledged to make all efforts to
renew the warship's original appearance by observing every details
of the ship and taking photos of every detail, even every nail.

COLOMBO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of government troops
Friday reinforced northern town of Vavuniya after Tamil rebels
warned of fresh attacks, informed sources said here.
</P>
<P>
The sources said many buses carrying troops were seen pouring
into the town and some troops in the town are moving around in
armored cars and vehicles.
</P>

closed in the Vavuniya town on Friday, reports reaching here from
north said.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross and the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees remained in the town but
reports said they were closely watching the development of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate danger of the town falling into the
hands of Tamil rebels but it could now be within striking distance
of long range artillery, said military sources here.
</P>
<P>
Government troops have already acted to enhance the deployment
with regard to the security of the town, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Vavuniya, the frontier town, about 250 km northeast of the

MANILA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Five were shot dead and eight
others captured, including four wounded, during a six-hour
encounter between government troopers and New People's Army (NPA)
rebels on Thursday in southern Philippines, a military report said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that about 30 soldiers, after learning that
several rebels were staying in a temporary training camp in Bohol
province, surprised the 50 or so NPA rebels at 5 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, gunfire lasted until 11 a.m. When the
smoke cleared, five rebels were found dead. Eight others were
captured, four of them wounded.
</P>
<P>
The PNA intensified its attack against the government after it
withdrew the peace talks with the government following the
Philippine Senate's ratification of the Philippines-U.S. Visiting
Forces Agreement (VFA).
</P>
<P>
The VFA paved the way for the resumption of large-scale
military exercises between the two countries in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, the government soldiers clashed with another
armed rebel group, Revolutionary Proletarian Army (RPA), in the
southern city of Bacolod. During the encounter one rebel was

BEIRUT, November 12 (Xinhua) -- At least four members of the
pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) were wounded Friday during
Lebanese guerrillas' attacks in south Lebanon, security sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen were injured when their outposts in Sujud and
Arab Salim inside the Israeli occupied border zone in south
Lebanon came under mortar fire by the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has claimed
responsibility for the attacks, which were the heaviest in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli warplanes bombed Hezbollah's suspected
hideouts inside the zone by firing missiles on villages and hills
accompanied by artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
It is still unknown if civilians were killed or wounded in the
assaults.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by Hezbollah has
since been fighting to oust Israelis and its ally SLA from the
country.

<HEADLINE> WHO Launches Global Strategies for Mental Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) launched its Global Strategies for Mental Health here today
in an effort to ease the "burden" of mental disorders and
neurological illnesses affecting 400 million people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The WHO Director-General, Dr. Gro H. Brundtland, said these
strategies are aimed at improving population coverage and the
quality of psychiatric and neurological care throughout the world,
particularly in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Mental and neurological disorders can be eased only by raising
the awareness of the public, medical professionals, and policy
makers, while improving treatment of these illnesses, she said.
</P>
<P>
"By raising awareness about the importance of mental problems,
the WHO hopes to heighten the profile of mental health on the
political, health, and development agenda of the governments of
our 191 member states, of international agencies, as well as of
national and international non-governmental organizations," she
told a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The WHO will also fight social stigma and misconceptions and
discrimination associated with neuropsychiatric conditions, as
well as promote the human rights of mentally ill persons.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, psychiatric disorders and neurological diseases were
estimated to account for almost 12 percent of all deaths and lost
productivity due to all diseases and injuries globally. This
percent is expected to increase to 15 percent by 2020 if action is
not taken.
</P>
<P>
The WHO estimates that five of the ten leading causes of
disability worldwide, in both industrialized and developing
countries, are mental problems, namely severe depression,
schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, alcohol dependence, and
obsessive-compulsive disorders.
</P>
<P>
The director-general stressed that more community-based mental
health services will be established in both urban and rural areas,
and wider use of effective intervention and essential drugs also
will be promoted.
</P>
<P>
Currently, one third of the earth's population has no access to
essential drugs such as anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, and
anti-psychotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Brundtland said Beijing is a "good choice" for the launch
of the strategies, not only because China is the largest WHO
member state and a developing country, but also because it is
experiencing dramatic social changes, which means increasing
challenges in the battle against mental disorders.

<HEADLINE> Cement Demand Rising in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua)-- The demand for cement in China
is expected to rise in the next three years, thanks to the
increase of state investment in the infrastructure sector,
according to the Administration of Building Materials Industry.
</P>
<P>
China will invest 750 billion US dollars in developing
infrastructure in the next three years, with the annual growth
rate of fixed assets investment topping 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
This investment will go for transportation, residential housing,
irrigation works, and water conservancy facilities, and these
construction projects will need an enormous amount of cement.
</P>
<P>
The administration predicts that the country's demand for
cement will reach 648 million tons next year, offering great
opportunities for Chinese cement enterprises now suffering a slump.
</P>
<P>
China plans to build more than 4,000 kilometers of expressways,
which will also boost the demand for high-quality cement.

be used for poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the Commonwealth Heads of Government
Meeting here Friday, the outgoing secretary-general said that the
disparities between the rich and the poor in the organization had

"Globalization may have brought about a phenomenal expansion in
world trade and investment, for countless millions, the stark
reality is one of deepening poverty."
</P>

The collapse of primary commodity prices and the heavy burden
of debt also hampered development of the developing countries,
Anyaoku said.

century with insecurity and they hoped the meeting to seek a way

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Treasury Bureau Exceeds Revenue Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Treasury
Bureau has exceeded its revenue target for the first 10 months of
the year, with actual collection registered at 22.4 billion pesos
(560 million U.S. dollars), 1.456 billion pesos (36.4 million
dollars) higher than its target.
</P>
<P>
The excess has helped mitigate the rise in the government's
budget deficit, National Treasurer Leonor Briones said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to Briones, for October alone, the bureau collected
852 million pesos (21 million dollars), 120 million pesos (3
million dollars) higher than its target.
</P>
<P>
As of October this year, the government already incurred a
deficit of 96.8 billion pesos (2.4 billion dollars), 13.5 billion
pesos (337.5 million dollars) higher than the programmed 83.3
billion pesos (2.08 billion dollars) due to the
higher-than-programmed expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The deficit is attributed largely to the government's
aggressive spending for infrastructure projects to help boost
economic activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Bureau of Treasury records show that total revenue collections
for the 10-month period amounted to 398.4 billion pesos (9.96
billion dollars) while expenditure was at 495.2 billion pesos
(12.38 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> India Downplays Clinton's Remarks on Indo-U.S. Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- India Friday sought to
downplay the assessment by U.S. President Bill Clinton that
Indo-U.S. dialogue on disarmament and non-proliferation issues had
yielded "little progress."
</P>
<P>
Referring to media stories about a report from the U.S.
administration to the U.S. Congress, a spokesman of the External
Affairs Ministry said: "It is not our general practice to comment
on such reports."
</P>
<P>
In a message to the U.S. Congress on Thursday, Clinton said
that India's draft nuclear doctrine "suggests that India intends
to make nuclear weapons an integral part of the national defense."
</P>
<P>
It is significant that Clinton's first public assessment of the
bilateral talks between the two countries came just ahead of the
scheduled ninth round of talks between U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott and Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant
Singh in London on November 16 and 17.
</P>
<P>
"We have been engaged in an on-going dialogue on disarmament
and non-proliferation issues with the U.S. and other
interlocutors. These talks are predicated on India's maintaining a
minimum credible nuclear deterrent," the Indian spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, at the conclusion of the last round
of talks in New Delhi in January this year, both sides had
expressed satisfaction at the outcome of the parleys.
</P>
<P>
The London round would enable the two sides to take forward
discussions on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), Fissile
Materials Cut-off Treaty (FMCT), defense posture and other
nuclear-related issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Washington has been insisting that India should sign the CTBT
and New Delhi has maintained that it would strive for the
widest-possible consensus on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The London round of talks will be Jaswant Singh's first meeting
with Talbott after assumption of office of the new Indian
government led by the National Democratic Alliance.

LONDON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Friday that a peace agreement in Northern Ireland was "
within our grasp" and urged negotiators in the province not to
give up.
</P>
<P>
"We have never come this far before. We've never been this
close to a lasting settlement in Northern Ireland. It is there
within our grasp," Blair said at the Commonwealth summit in Durban,
South Africa, the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
"For the sake of some more talking and some more thinking, and
more dialogue between people, we shouldn't let that prize for the
future slip out of our grasp," he added.
</P>
<P>
Feuding political parties in Northern Ireland returned to
critical talks Friday after reports that the powerful pro-British
Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) had turned down a compromise formula
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The discussions are being led by U.S. mediator George Mitchell,
who is seeking to break a deadlock over Irish Republican Army
disarmament and a new power-sharing government in the province.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks on Northern Ireland's political deadlock were
adjourned until next week, Mitchell announced Friday, adding they
had reached "the final and most critical phase."
</P>
<P>
"I have asked the parties to pause over the weekend and reflect
on the magnitude of the decisions they have to make. We will
resume on Monday morning," he said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> India Announces New Textile Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government Friday
announced a new five-year textile exports quota policy to gear up
the industry to face global competition after the dismantling of
Multifibre Arrangement in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Textile Minister Kashiram Rana said that the policy abolishes
non quota entitlement for textiles, rationalizes quota for past
performance and raises quota for new investments to encourage
modernization.
</P>
<P>
The export-friendly policy aims at "stability and continuity
with competition," he said, adding it is designed to simplify
procedures for better utilization of quota and greater
transparency.
</P>
<P>
The policy will be effective from January 1, 2000 to December
31, 2004, coinciding with the ending of quota regime under the
Multifibre Arrangement (MFA).
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization (WTO) Textiles and Clothing
Agreement has provided for a ten-year phase out for textile quota
system under MFA which ends on December 31, 2004. Thereafter the
world trade on textiles will be totally free without quota to
integrate it into the WTO regime.
</P>
<P>
Textiles accounted for one third of India's exports and these
changes will help encourage modernization of the industry to face
the challenges of competition, Rana said.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Cambodian PM Says Great Progress Achieved in Reform Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen said that the Royal Government of Cambodia has made great
strides in many fronts, especially in implementing its "triangular
strategy" since the coalition government was formed last November.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the remarks during an interview on Thursday with a
Xinhua Press Group, headed by Zhang Guoliang, chief editor of the
Hong Kong Branch of Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"What we have achieved in nearly one year includes mobilizing
every active factor to consolidate our country's peace and unity,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have formed a new coalition government, and for the first
time in Cambodia's history we have no civil war and won the true
peace and stability. We are the country without a separatist
regime and anti-government forces," Hun Sun added.
</P>
<P>
"We love our peace and stability just like cherishing our eyes
with loving care," Hun Sen stressed, adding that those countries
which had suffered from foreign aggression, colonization or
enslavement highly treasure the independence, sovereignty and
peace they have achieved.
</P>
<P>
"To quicken our steps to integrate ourselves into the
international community is another achievement of our triangular
strategy," Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has regained its U.N. seat and has finally become a
member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Aid
relations with donor countries and international financial
organization, such as the IMF, are moving back towards normalcy.
"So we can be proud to say that the royal government has won
everything we had lost. We have achieved the desired results," the
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The third strategy, or its achievement," said Hun Sen, "is to
take advantage of active factors, both internal and external, and
concentrate every force on developing the economy and eliminating
poverty."
</P>
<P>
As an "economic government" named by Hun Sen, the royal
government has also scored some exciting achievements in other
fields over the past year.
</P>
<P>
Having implemented reform programs and maintained the
macroeconomics stability, "we are confident that the Cambodian
economy has rebounded and real GDP growth would be at least four
percent as forecast. Inflation will be controlled within six
percent, while the exchange rate is fairly stable," he said.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth has also changed the structure of
Cambodia's tax revenue. During the course of the year, the total
domestic tax revenue has increased to account for 55 percent of
the nation's total tax revenue, compared with 44 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"We will make further efforts to reduce the customs tariffs to
make preparations for joining ASEAN's Free Trade Area," Hun Sen
said.
</P>
<P>
On the recent drop in foreign investment, the prime minister
explained that it was affected by Asia's financial crisis. He
expressed his belief that with the recovery of the region's
economy, foreign investment in Cambodia will be growing steadily.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Government of Cambodia has also achieved encouraging
achievements in demobilization, civil service and judicial system
reforms and crackdowns on such corrupt acts as large-scale illegal
logging and illegal possession of state-owned lands, the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The total economic situation in Cambodia is not very good nor
very bad. We should continue our reform process," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Beat United States 3-1 in Women's World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KANAZAWA, Japan, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Unbeaten defending
champions Cuba droped a set against the United States to record
their eighth victory in the 12-nation women's volleyball World Cup
round-robin tournament here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The back-to-back Olympic and World champions won 25-12, 26-24,
21-25, 25-13 but encountered some stiff resistance from the
Americans despite coach Mick Hayley's decision to field his bench
players for virtually the whole match.
</P>
<P>
The match looked like it would be over very soon after the
Caribbeans ran away with the opening set, but the United States
had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
After an early Cuban lead in the second set, the 1984 Olympic
finalists came back strongly and even led 22-21, but a reception
error on the second Cuban setpoints blew the American chances away.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States built up a huge lead in the third
set and never relinquished the advantage. Cuba reacted to the
dropped set by moving into full power again to seal victory.
</P>
<P>
"My team performed well," U.S. coach Haley said.
</P>
<P>
Hayley's Cuban counterpart Antoino Perdomo certainly didn't
look happy between the third and fourth sets. But dropping a set
against the United States will not pose any problems to the Cubans
if they remain unbeaten but the set ratio will be the deciding
factor when teams finish level.
</P>
<P>
"The United States was not playing with the regular team,"
Perdomo said. "But they were relaxed and made a good fight."

<HEADLINE> Anti-Drug Conference Calls for Use of Internet in Drug Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 12 (Xinhua) -- International drug prevention
activists Friday called for the use of Internet as new means for
addressing drug problems.
</P>
<P>
The message was learned at a press conference after the 2nd
Global Conference on Drug Abuse Primary Prevention, which was held
here between November 8 and 12.
</P>
<P>
In a declaration signed at the end of the conference, some 380
participants from 43 countries and six international organizations
listed 21 initiatives that should be taken by their individual
countries.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that governments work with mass media to develop
relevant drug and substance abuse prevention message and
strategies and set up award and incentives for media contributions
in the anti drug arena.
</P>
<P>
The conference also sent a strong message of adopting the new
technologies in drug prevention by setting up drug abuse
prevention websites and other Internet facilities.
</P>
<P>
John Gilligan, representative from Drug Prevention Network of
Americas, highlighted the importance of primary drug prevention,
saying if a person doesn't touch drugs before the age of 21, the
possibility that he or she will not use drug in his or her
lifetime will be at 99 percent.
</P>
<P>
Participants also suggested that sports and other recreational
facilities be provided for people, especially youngsters living in
poor communities, so that they will not turn to drugs.
</P>
<P>
The next conference will be held in September next year in
Palermo, Italy.

<HEADLINE> 6 Blasts Hit Pakistani Capital Injuring 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 12 (Xinhua) -- At least six rocket blasts,
mainly targeting U.N. and U.S. installations, struck Islamabad
almost simultaneously at around 11:15 a.m. local time (06:15 GMT)
Friday, injuring four people, police said.
</P>
<P>
The blasts occurred separately near the Saudi-Pak Tower which
houses some U.N. offices, the U.S. embassy, the American Center,
the World Food Program (WFP) office, Shaheed-e-Millat Secretariat,
and at the hills close to Punjab House, residence of Punjab chief
minister in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said there was a seventh blast in the
Pakistani capital but the location is so far not known.
</P>
<P>
Senior police officer Nasir Durrani told Xinhua that it was too
early to blame any organizations or individuals for the rocket
attacks. Investigations will be carried out by experts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the injured was a security guard of the American Center
who was rushed to hospital for medical aid and later said to be
out of danger.
</P>
<P>
Police said the blasts were not too intense to harm buildings
around.
</P>
<P>
The police and witnesses said that rockets were fired from the
launchers fitted in three vehicles parked near the Saudi-Pak
Tower, the American Center and the U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the firing of the rockets, these vehicles were found
burnt through some remote-controlled device, an official of civil
administration said. Two-barreled launchers were found fitted in
the burnt vehicles, he said.
</P>
<P>
High officials of military, police and civil administration,
bomb disposal squads, fire-brigade, rescue agencies and personnel
of security and intelligence agencies rushed immediately to the
spots and cordoned off the areas around the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Police found an unexploded rocket about two feet long, which
had smashed into the front screen of a Toyota car parked near the
WFP office at the Embassy Road.
</P>
<P>
Another rocket which landed in the hills at the back of Punjab
house exploded with a bang, setting trees on fire and sending huge
smoke into the air, police said.
</P>
<P>
The police and witnesses said the flying rockets were blowing
whistles before landing, creating panic among those present
around.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Most of the major cities in
China reported slightly worse air quality this week, according to
the weekly air-quality report issued today by the China
Environmental Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
Coal firing in northern China from November 5 to 11 has
resulted in an increased emission of pollutants, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The unfavorable weather condition over the past week slowed
down the spread of pollutants in northern regions where most of
China's worst polluted cities are located.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the air quality in Beijing, Urumqi, Lanzhou,
Zhengzhou, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Chongqing, Lanzhou, Hangzhou and
three other cities was fair, while the air quality in north China
's Hohhot was classified as poor.
</P>
<P>
A total of 30 major cities, mostly in south China, including
Shanghai, reported good air. Xiamen, Beihai and Haikou reported
excellent air quality.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, Hohhot, Xining and 30 other cities blamed suspended
particles as the major pollutant. Nitrogen oxide was the major
pollutant in Guangzhou, Suzhou, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Zhuhai and
Hefei, while Chongqing, Changsha and Guiyang claimed sulfur
dioxide as the major problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), today spoke highly of the proposals raised by
China's top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
Proposals by the CPPCC have been sound this year, and the hard
work of everyone involved in this effort is greatly appreciated,

Raising proposals is an important part of the work of the CPPCC
as part of its advisory functions, an important way for CPPCC
members to act as political advisors, and also an important
channel for the government and the ruling Party to make decisions
in a scientific and democratic way, according to Li, who is also a
Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Students Urged to Help Protect Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A group of junior middle
school students in Beijing, who recently attracted nationwide
publicity by appealing to the Chinese government for better
environmental protection, called on the country's over 100 million
fellow students today to do more for the environment of the
country and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In an eight-point proposal, these environmently conscious
students urged fellow students across China to pursue an
environmentally friendly lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of her classmates from the No. 2 Middle School
attached to the North China Jiaotong University, Liang Sisi
announced today the initiative to a group of correspondents from
China's leading media organizations.
</P>
<P>
The proposal urges students not to litter and help keep the
environment clean and save water and energy.
</P>
<P>
It also recommends not using eating utensils such as disposable
chopstics and take-away styrofoam food boxes to reduce the
consumption of wood and pollution.
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls on the students to spread an environmentally-
friendly message and to encourage households to purchase
environmentally-friendly products such as CFC-free refrigerators
and phosphorus-free detergent.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuqing, deputy director of the State Environmental
Protection Administration of China, welcomed the initiative.
Wang said the administration, together with relevant ministries of
the central government, are considering new policy initiatives
aimed at preserving natural resources and protecting the
environment, including banning the use of disposable chopsticks,
as proposed by the students in their proposal and their September
letter to Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the students also made an eight-point proposal
calling for better public awareness of protecting the environment,
new measures to protect forests, and more efficient use of the
water and energy resources as well as more efforts to curb
pollution in the country.
</P>
<P>
In his comments written on the letter on October 20, the
premier said it is so moving that the kids are so concerned about
protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
Zhu's comments and the letter was widely quoted in leading
newspapers around the country.

<HEADLINE> China's Exports Up 4.3 Percent in January-October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- China's exports increased 4.3
percent to 155.2 billion US dollars in the first ten months of the
year, according to figures released by the General Administration
of Customs (GAC).
</P>
<P>
The overall import and export volume in January-October
reached 286.6 billion US dollars, up 10.6 percent, and imports
during the period grew 19.2 percent to 131.4 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In October, exports hit 18.2 billion US dollars, up 23.8
percent, while imports surged 18.2 percent to 13.8 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October, China's total trade surplus stood at 23.
8 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The growth of exports was brought about by greater exports of
goods processed in China and more exports from State-owned
enterprises, according to the GAC.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China's exports to Asian partners came out of the
red to register positive growth.
</P>
<P>
But China's exports of clothing, textile fabric, and toys
declined by a small margin.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, imports of goods for processing in China grew
13.7 percent in October, showing that the new management policy
for the processing industry, which became effective from October 1,
has been effective, according to some analysts.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Reshuffles Senior Police Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
Friday appointed Lee Moo-young as chief of the National Police
Agency to replace Kim Kwang-shik as part of a program to eradicate
corruption in police institutions.
</P>
<P>
The government also named Suh Sung-geun to be head of the
Inchon Police Administration to succeed Shin Bo-ki.
</P>
<P>
Before the promotion, Lee Moo-young was the head of Seoul
Police Administration while Suh was the president of the Central
Police School.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle was made following the October 30 fire in a bar
in Inchon which killed 55 people and wounded 58, most of them
teenagers who should not have been allowed into the bar or served
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
A police investigation showed that police officers and other
public servants took bribes from the bar owner in return for
keeping silence over his illegal operation of the bar.
</P>
<P>
Next week, the government will reshuffle police leaders at
other regional administrations.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the National Police Agency announced all
officers at police stations in charge of managing entertainment
industries will be replaced before November 20 this year and
unveiled a 13-point program to eradicate corruption in police
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Under the announcement, at least 1,000 police officers will be
replaced.

<HEADLINE> Diversity of Consumption Among Urban Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A latest survey shows that the
consumption style of urban Chinese has become more diversified.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the China Business Climate Monitoring
Center under the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on some 50,
000 urban Chinese in 20 cities across China, the survey revealed
that as the income of urban Chinese rises, their notions of
consumption varies substantially.
</P>
<P>
The monthly spending on food and articles of daily use by urban
residents has decreased considerably compared with several years
ago. Their average expense on food is 427 yuan and on items of
daily use 113 yuan. Expenses on education, culture, entertainment
and tourism increased significantly.
</P>
<P>
However, amount of spending varies among different income
groups. For example, 14 percent of all informants said they spend
more than 200 yuan on education and entertainment each month,
while 51 percent said their spending on entertainment is less than
50 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In Shenzhen, urban Chinese monthly spending on food and
entertainment nearly doubled that of Zhengzhou in central China's
Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that more than 90 percent of urban
residents now own televisions, washing machines and refrigerators.
Many other consumer durables such as household electric appliances
are also common in many family households.

<HEADLINE> Investors to Gain More Access to China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- In the next decade China will
let some of its non-competitive industries, especially
manufacturing industries, be operated by international companies
as it expands its market access to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
This is a strategic choice that China has made to sustain rapid
economic growth in the first decade of the next century, said
Professor Zhang Xiaoji, economist of the government think tank
Development Research Center (DRC) of the State Council, at a Sino-
U.S. enterprise dialogue forum held today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has given out signals recently that it
will allow overseas investors to take part in the auction of
Chinese enterprises and to merge or acquire state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, director general of the Foreign Economic Relations
Department of DRC, said that Chinese companies in the chemical and
electronic industries may join large international companies
instead of competing with these powerful giants.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that Chinese companies need not produce such
products as photographic film and silicon-based products. He noted
that competition among foreign companies in these areas will bring
quality products to Chinese consumers at low prices.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that allowing foreign investors to gain more access
to the market is part of a bid to enter the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Dow Corning Corporation of the United States, one of the
sponsors of the dialogue forum, has already set up a solely-owned
silicon-based material factory in Shanghai in east China and
forced its local competitors to cut their prices.
</P>
<P>
Dow Corning is a world leading supplier of silicon-based
technologies and entered the Chinese market in 1973. By the end of
1998, Dow Corning had invested 20 million US dollars in China.
</P>
<P>
"Strategic Partnership and Innovation for Success in the 21st
Century" was the theme of today's forum. As part of the company's
Dialogue on Business--China Program Plan, Dow Corning held another
forum "Serving Customers in a Changing Asian Market" in China in
November, 1998.

<P>
SENDAI, Japan, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia rolled over
Croatia in straight sets to hold an eight-match perfect record in
the 12-nation women's volleyball World Cup round-robin tournament
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The European and Grand Prix champions won 25-22, 25-10, 25-17
but needed a wake up call from coach Nikolai Karpol following a
sluggish start.
</P>
<P>
Russia trailed by five points for most of the opening set
before taking the lead for the first time at 23-22 and then
Lioubov Chachkova quickly wrapped it up with two consecutive
service aces.
</P>
<P>
The Russian machine was now in full power and there was never
any prospect of Croatia mounting a fresh challenge and reversing
the result of September's European championship final.
</P>
<P>
Russia libero Natalia Morozova was voted the Most Impressive
Player and Chachkova emerged as their top scorer with 17 points.
</P>
<P>
Karpol admitted that his players were slow to respond. "There
was not enough time to prepare our players for the beginning of
the first stage of the match, their bodies weren't awake," he said.
"So at first we couldn't get going, but then it started getting
better and better. I think our players did a good job."
</P>
<P>
It was Croatia's sixth defeat, but coach Ivica Jelic was not
over critical. "We played well, but errors in serving and
reception started rising gradually and we didn't attack well."

<HEADLINE> China to Add Anti-Cult Education to Rural Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Health
(MOH) plans to include anti-cult and anti-feudalism education in a
five-year campaign in the rural areas, said MOH Minister Zhang
Wenkang at a national conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, which was launched in 1994, is aimed at helping
villagers gain medical knowledge, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The official said they will try to create an awareness that the
evil nature of cults like that of Falun Gong is still rampant in
some localities.
</P>
<P>
In some backward areas, patients still believe in China's
traditional God of the Earth while in some cases, family members
still share one towel.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, over 108,000 video tapes and audio
tapes and 75,000 copies of health care textbooks have been
distributed among villagers across the country.

<P>
SENDAI, Japan, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Italy held off a
challenge from Peru to secure their fifth win out of eight matches
in the 12-nation women's volleyball World Cup round-robin
tournament here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was Italy's fourth successive victory, but they had a harder-
than-expected battle against the South American wild card entry
before winning 25-17, 25-14, 23-25, 25-15.
</P>
<P>
The Italians looked destined for a straight-set success against
a team whose only victory has been against Tunisia, the weakest
squad in the competition.
</P>
<P>
But lack of concentration crept in and Peru snatched the third
set even after Italy had made up five-point deficit to level at 21-
21. However, coach Angiolino Frigoni's players regained their
momentum in the next set and raced away to victory.
</P>
<P>
Elisa Galastri was voted the Most Impressive Player and also
led the scoring with 15 points, one more than Peru's Diana Soto.
</P>
<P>
Frigoni had mixed feelings about his team's performance. "We
played well in the first and second sets, but we lost our
concentration in the third," he said. "Fortunately, we came back
again in the fourth to win."
</P>
<P>
Peru's South Korean coach Park Man Bok said: "We were behind in
the beginning and lost the first and second sets when our play was
just so so. But in the third we made a good result in our blocking.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Tibetan Hospital
opened a new outpatient department here today to cater to the
increasing demand by patients for treatment by Tibetan doctors.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a new fitness center designed for overseas
patients was opened in the new outpatient department building.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan medicine, with thousands of years of history, is known
for its unique techniques and effectiveness in treating some kinds
of diseases. The 4,000-meter-plus Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is one of
the few areas reputed to be pollution-free in the world, and many
plants and animals in this region are effective for curing
cardiovascular diseases, asthma, skin diseases, and rheumatism.
</P>
<P>
The hospital, since its founding in November 1992, has treated
more than 300,000 patients, including about 10,000 from more than
30 foreign countries and overseas regions.
</P>
<P>
China has 134 hospitals practicing various ethnic traditions,
including 56 hospitals specializing in Tibetan medicine, according
to an official from the State Administration of Chinese
Traditional Medicine.

<HEADLINE> PLA Macao SAR Garrison Leaders Educated And Capable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- As the handover of Macao draws
near, people are increasingly interested in the garrison troops of
the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) to be deployed in the
territory, especially in its leaders,
</P>
<P>
Both Major General Liu Yuejun, the commander, and Major General
He Xianshu, the political commissar, of the garrison troops, are
educated army generals who both have university degrees, according
to today's Liberation Army Daily.
</P>
<P>
The commander, now 45, loves reading and is an avid computer
fan, spending much of his leisure time on the computer. His name "
Yuejun" betrays his original family home (Shandong Province). The
commander was born in a PLA barrack in Guangdong Province. "Yue"
is a short name for Guangdong, while "jun" means army.
</P>
<P>
Liu was granted one second-grade award for his meritorious
activities in a border battle of self-defense and six third-grade
awards for directing his troops in drills and anti-flooding
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Major General He Xianshu, the political commissar, is among
those who have been moved from the Hong Kong SAR Garrison to the
Macao SAR Garrison. "It is a life-long honor to have served in
both of the garrisons," he said. Before he was assigned to his
present post, the 52-year old He headed the political department
of the HK SAR Garrison.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, He appeared on the Central Television Show, not as an
army officer but a skillful 40-year amateur player of the erhu, a
traditional, folk two-string spiked fiddle.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Rejects Israeli Redeployment Maps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat has rejected the maps on the 5 percent
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank which is scheduled for
Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the "Voice of Palestine" radio reported Friday, Arafat
is still studying the maps "carefully." He has been contemplating
the maps since Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was angered by the proposed nature reserve in the maps,
which would be handed to the PNA, was within the desolate Judia
dessert. He demanded that the nature reserve, representing 2.8
percent of the area, should be in an important area.
</P>
<P>
The maps were brought by Oded Eran, chief Israeli negotiator,
to his Palestinian counterpart Saeb Erekat during their meeting in
Jerusalem on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Eran and Major General Shlomo Yenai, chief of the planning
division of the Israeli army, met Friday with Arafat to brief him
on the maps.
</P>
<P>
Later, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak sent his special envoy
to Gaza in an effort to convince Arafat to agree to the maps.
However, according to Israelis, they do not have to get Arafat's
endorsement before executing the maps.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Arafat would bring up the issue during his
meeting with Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami later
Friday in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
According to the maps, Israel will hand over 2 percent of the
West Bank to full Palestinian civil security jurisdiction and
subject another 3 percent to joint control with the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
Territories under Palestinian control and joint control are
mostly near the town of Jenin, Tolkarm, Ramallah, Hebron and
Nabulus.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Benefit from U.N. Health Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will benefit
from a United Nations Foundation project aimed at preventing the
leading causes of death for children under five years of age, U.N.
Information Service in Dar es Salaam said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement available here Friday, this project
is one of the interrelated projects seeking to prevent diseases
like malaria, acute respiratory infections, diarrhea, measles, and
malnutrition by improving family and community health practices.
</P>
<P>
Under the three-year project, the U.N. Children's Fund and the
World Health Organization in partnership with the Tanzanian Health
Ministry will train village health workers, traditional
practitioners, birth attendants, community-based distributors,
shopkeepers, religious leaders, water attendants and others.
</P>
<P>
Those trained will work subsequently with care givers at the
household level to provide information, knowledge and skills about
children's health, such as the usefulness of bed nets, oral
re-hydration solution, and immunizations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the project trains primary school teachers on how
to seek medical advice and how to channel information about health
to households through the child-to-child and child-to-parent
approach.
</P>
<P>
The project is part of a 51-million-U.S. dollar investment
announced by the United Nations Foundation last week for several
U.N. programs with emphasis on children's health efforts.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, along with Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria and
Zimbabwe, will also benefit from a 15-million-dollar project to be
implemented by the WHO over three years on educating communities
to save children's lives.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, the WHO Africa Regional Office will assist
country- level public health personnel to develop, implement and
evaluate community-based programs in the above mentioned
countries.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania will also be one of the recipient countries of a
2.4-million- dollar project seeking to deliver vaccine to more
children by improving the management skills of national and
sub-national level directors of public health immunization
services.
</P>
<P>
Other UNF projects related to Tanzania include the
fortification of staple foods with Vitamin A and iron in Tanzania,
determining whether zinc supplementation decreases child mortality
and morbidity in Tanzania and India, the use of Vitamin A as a
supplement for infant health, and youth-to-youth communication at
HIV/AIDS in Tanzania.

NICOSIA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Finance Minister
Takis Clerides said his country is planning to ease restrictions
on foreign investment to allow total ownership of public companies
by foreigners, the Cyprus Weekly newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a recent London conference, Clerides said the
acquisition of shares in public companies by non-Cypriots is
permitted, by up to 50 percent in banks and 49 percent in other
sectors.
</P>
<P>
"The upper limits for the sectors other than banking are
currently under review and the scope of increasing them to 100
percent is being considered," he said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Cyprus has moved ahead with the liberalization
of foreign investment and the simplification of procedures of
approving direct foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said political decision has already been taken to
provide information, guidance and assistance to foreign investors.

<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A gelada cub became one
month old yesterday in the northeast province of Jilin.
</P>
<P>
The cub,born on October 11, was covered with black thin hair,
is 20 centimeters long and in good health.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a gelada gave birth to a cub in
Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hongchun, a zoo-keeper of Changchun Propagation Park, said
that it was rare for a gelada to be born in northeast China where
the winters are extremely cold.
</P>
<P>
The cub's mother kept a vigilant eye on its baby. Liu was thus
unable to determine the gender of the cub.
</P>
<P>
Zoo-keepers offered nutritious food for the new mother to help
feed her cub with enough milk.
</P>
<P>
Two electronic heaters were also put into the feeding rooms to
keep mother and cub warm.
</P>
<P>
The male gelada, aged seven, and the female, aged six, were
relocated to Changchun in October 1996 from Sendai, Japan, when
the two cities became sister cities.

 MOSCOW, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian former Premier,
leader of Fatherland-All Russia coalition Yevgeny Primakov said
Thursday that so far he has not decided whether to run for
president next year.
</P>
<P>
"I have not decided to run the year 2000 presidential race,"

However, he said that his age was not an obstacle for the race.
"I am 70 and I do not conceal it. I wish all young people to live
to this age and remain energetic," he said.

Primakov denied rumors that Fatherland-All Russia may collapse
after the Duma elections. "I don't think it will be so. Fatherland-

<P>
Primakov gave a generally positive assessment of the Cabinet
of Vladimir Putin.  "Though there are weaknesses in the efforts
of the cabinet, of course, especially in the economy and social
life, I think what Putin is doing in Chechnya is generally correct,
" he said.

<HEADLINE> Angola to "Opportunely" Realize General Elections: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos has pledged to "opportunely" realize the electoral
census, as preparation for the general elections, official sources
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos made the statement on the occasion of Angola's
National Day which falls on November 11, saying that his
government will accelerate the constitutional reform, review the
electoral legislation and opportunely realize the elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president stressed that conditions should be
created for guaranteeing law and order for the legislative and
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The last elections in the southern African country were held in
1992.
</P>
<P>
But Jonas Savimbi, head of the rebel National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), accused the government of being
fraudulent as the government gained the lead in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the UNITA refused to accept the result of the
elections, which dragged Angola into another round of civil
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
At this moment, the government has gained military advantage
over the rebels after a 38-day general offensive in the central
plateau, traditional rebel bastions, starting from September 14.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, dos Santos said that the "immediate task" for
the government is to relieve the serious humanitarian crisis,
pledging that his government will implement a national program on
humanitarian assistance and strive for more international
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The president said that his government will continue the
economic reform and the negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the south central province of Huila
Thursday, dos Santos encouraged the Armed Forces of Angola to
continue to pursue the smashed rebels in flight and accomplish the
task of restoring peace and stability in Angola.

DURBAN, South Africa, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain has
promised to contribute 14 million pounds (about 23 million U.S.

<P>
The AIDS vaccine research group welcomed Britain's gesture and

Against Aids will continue to elude us," said Victor Zonana,
vice-president of the research group.
</P>
<P>
The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative said it was
encouraged by the creation of South African AIDS Vaccine
Initiative and the declaration by Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee of the need for a "mission-like" program to
develop an AIDS vaccine.

<HEADLINE> Technology to Lift Heavy Fog in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Local scientists in Beijing
have succeeded in developing the technology to deal with the heavy
fog that often hampers the traffic in winter, Beijing Daily
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, scientists working with meteorological departments
have been engaged in the research project and to date, Beijing is
the first and only city in China to have developed the technology.
</P>
<P>
In the new technology, liquid nitrogen, as cold as minus 195.8
degrees centigrade, is used to turn the winter fog into tiny
snowflakes.
</P>
<P>
The city has so far conducted three successful tests on two
local airports in Beijing. In one case, 61 minutes after the
spraying of 10 tons of nitrogen in the air, Capital International
Airport which had been forced to close due to heavy fog was re-
opened.
</P>
<P>
According to meteorological departments, Beijing experiences 10.
5 days of heavy fog each year causing financial losses of more
than six million yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
Thick fog not only brings difficulties to airports and
expressways, but also to other industries. In February 1990,
severe fogs led to the accumulation of polluted materials causing
the breakdown of 51 power supply cables in north China including
Beijing. Some 200 local factories halted operation due to the
short supply of electricity.

<P>
According to a motion passed Thusday, the unrest seemed to be

reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the area is so bad that it is frightening away

The Niger Delta has long been a hotbed of ethnic feuds and
violence, which has claimed thousands of lives over the past two

<P>
KANAZAWA, Japan, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Brazil overcame South
Korea 3-0 to take a big step towards qualifying for the Sydney
Olympic Games on the eighth day of the women's volleyball World
Cup round-robin competition.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 Olympic bronze medalists had the attacking power to
pierce South Korea's defence for a 25-21, 25-23, 25-12 victory,
improving to 7-1 with three matches to go.
</P>
<P>
The top three teams in the 12-team tournament will qualify for
next year's Olympics and Brazil is currently third behind joint
leaders Cuba and Russia.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, with four wins behind them, provided some early
headaches for the Brazilians who included the experienced Ana
Moser in the starting six.
</P>
<P>
Some attacking errors by the South Koreans was enough to give
Brazil the opening set. But it was the South Americans who
produced the errors in the second set, wasting a 13-7 lead to
allow the Asian rival to come back.
</P>
<P>
However, Brazil regained the momentum to go two up on their
first setpoint at 24-23. After that South Korea were never able to
mount another challenge.
</P>
<P>
"We were not able to do anything against the Brazilian height,"
said Kim Cheol-Youg, head coach of the South Korean team.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian coach Bernardo Rezende said: "We are very happy to
win the match. We had a good fight. We could keep our
concentration."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Public
Security has recently issued a notice calling for tighter control
on the manufacturing, storage, and sale of firecrackers to prevent
potential fire disasters.
</P>
<P>
The notice pointed out that with Spring Festival, China's most
important festival, approaching, the illicit manufacturing of
fireworks is entering its yearly peak season. Some firecracker
manufacturers even "hire children as workers", which invariably
leads to fire disasters.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that departments concerned should organize a
thorough inspection on the manufacturers and sellers of
firecrackers, prohibit illicit firecrackers and punish those who
violated the law.
</P>
<P>
"Police departments at all levels should give particular
attention to child labor," the statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry also said that departments concerned must
intensify publicity awareness campaigns about the dangers of
firecrackers.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Criminal
Police Organization (ICPO)-Interpol ended its 68th general
assembly here Friday with the adoption of Seoul Declaration to
cooperate against international crimes.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul Declaration is designed to fight against corruption,
block
financial support to terrorists and strike hard the smuggling of
cultural properties.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration, the Interpol urged its member nations to
conduct ethics test in recruiting police officers and strengthen
cooperation among them to root out corruption.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption can destroy the efficient function of any society
and diminish the ability of law enforcement to accomplish its
mission,"said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
The assembly also adopted a conduct code calling for all police
officers to enforce laws fair and to refrain from abusing their
authority.
</P>
<P>
"The Seoul Declaration has a special meaning because it
contains common ethics and conduct codes for police officers
worldwide for the first time as every state has so far adopted
such codes by itself," Interpol President Toshinori Kanemoto said
at a press conference after the closing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The assembly has chosen Greece as the venue of its 69th meeting
next year and Hungary as its 70th in 2001
</P>
<P>
More than 630 delegates from 163 Interpol member countries,
including police chiefs and home affairs ministers, attended the
five-day meeting and discussed measures to fight against
increasingly sophisticated global crimes, such as terrorism, drug
trafficking, organized crime, traffic in human beings and the
smuggling of stolen works of art.
</P>
<P>
The International Criminal Police Commission, the predecessor
of the Interpol, was first set up in 1923 in Vienna, Austria to
ensure and promote the widest possible mutual assistance between
all criminal police authorities.
</P>
<P>
It was renamed ICPO-Interpol in 1956. The United Nations
Economic and Social Council (UNESCO) recognized it as an
international organization of the United Nations in 1971.

Hongleong Group that bought the Hilton on a public bidding will

<HEADLINE> Kenya Determined to Fight Bureaucracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
determined to fight bureaucracy and reduce interference in the
private sector in order to boost the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Bureaucracy in government offices had hindered investment
growth, head of Civil Service Richard Leakey said in Nairobi
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Leakey urged businessmen seeking assistance to go directly to
accounting officers or permanent secretaries who have to deliver
service or go.
</P>
<P>
"If you cannot find assistance from the permanent secretaries,
come to my office," the East African Standard newspaper Friday
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He noted that delays in the judicial systems made the search
for justice even more difficult and called for a law reform to
ensure efficiency in the field.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional review, which had preoccupied the minds of
most politicians, should not stand in the way of the specific law
reforms, he added.
</P>
<P>
Leaky was appointed as top civil servant in July this year by
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi as part of the recovery plan
designed to bring the flagging economy back on track.

<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) Garrison of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA) is a martial and civilized force capable of
defending Macao after its handover to the motherland on December
20.
</P>
<P>
Major General Liu Yuejun, the commander, and Major General He
Xianshu, the political commissar, made these remarks in an
exclusive interview with Xinhua Thursday. They both disclosed that
all preparations have been made for the garrison's deployment in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
In early October, the garrison passed an overall inspection and
approval by a PLA headquarters team led by Chief of the General
Staffs Fu Quanyou. This shows that the troops are well equipped
and trained.
</P>
<P>
Over the last few months, the Macao Garrison, the youngest of
all PLA combat units, have carried out strict training schedule.
The garrison has achieved excellent results in all kinds of
training and tests by the PLA headquarters and the Guangzhou
Military Area Command.
</P>
<P>
The leadership of the garrison troops attaches great importance
to create the awareness about the relevant laws and regulations on
the Macao SAR and the garrison. The soldiers and officers have
been ordered to cherish their mission and abide to its laws and
ethics.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that troops receive medicare and daily food supplies,
the garrison has set up a logistic base in Zhuhai, which borders

<HEADLINE> MILF Rebels Say Will Continue Talks With Philippine Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) said Friday it will continue its peace
talks with the Philippine government despite sporadic clashes
between government forces and MILF guerrillas in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF political affairs chief, stressed in a
statement that negotiations "should not be disrupted by peace
saboteurs as we are for peace, not war."
</P>
<P>
On October 25, the government and the MILF opened formal peace
negotiations after they reached agreements regarding the general
cessation of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
However, since Monday, government soldiers and MILF rebels have
exchanged fires in Carmen town in Cotabato province. Three
soldiers and four MILF rebels were killed and scores of others
wounded from both sides.
</P>
<P>
According to Cotabato Governor Emmanuel Pinol, government
troops have driven away some 1,000 MILF rebels who took control of
a village during the height of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Pinol also announced the opening of the local Carmen-Bukidnon
road which was closed to traffic in the past several days due to
continuous fighting between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Meantime, members of the government-MILF Coordinating Committee
on the Cessation of Hostilities (CCCH) visited Carmen town to try
to find out "who fired the first shot."

<HEADLINE> Salesman Confirmed Dead in Fire at Nanjing Railway Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Authorities have confirmed
that the only person who was killed in the fire early this morning
at the railway station in Nanjing was a salesman.
</P>
<P>
The salesman, whose name has not been disclosed, was about 40
years old and operated a rented stall at the waiting room of the
station before the fire broke out, an official said, adding that
there are no more casualties.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire is yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
Normal passenger and cargo transport operations have not been
affected by the fire, said station master Qian Peihong. By 11:00 a.
m. today, the station had handled more than 60 passenger trains,
with some 10,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which started at about 1:00 a.m. in a video
entertainment room on the second floor of the station, completely
destroyed the 2,200-sq-m passenger waiting room, cut electricity,
and resulted in the death of the unnamed businessman.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters and local officials were on the scene within five
minutes and brought the flames under control at around 2:15 a.m.,
according to eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
Railway station workers, equipped with flashlights and candles,
evacuated all passengers from the waiting room shortly after the
breakout of the fire.
</P>
<P>
By 7:30 this morning, power had been restored and the booking
office, whose computer system was not affected, resumed business.
</P>
<P>
Baggage offices have been vacated to serve as temporary waiting
rooms, and more waiting rooms are being built on the station
square.
</P>
<P>
The station, a major stop on the Beijing-Shanghai railway line,
was built in 1968 in the capital of Jiangsu Province, east China.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Suha Arafat, the wife of Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat, attacked Israel Thursday for allegedly
polluting the environment and thereby causing a host of health
problems among Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office responded angrily to her
remarks by issuing a statement which said: "Poisoning the public
atmosphere does not contribute to the success of the negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Hamas has stopped carrying out suicide bombing operations
in Israel for tactical reasons, according to the assessment of
the defense establishment.
</P>
<P>
The organization now appears to prefer planting bombs, having
reached the conclusion that the use of suicide bombers enables
Israel to find those behind the attacks by means of DNA tests
performed on the bodies of the suicides.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli and Palestinian final-status negotiating teams met
in Ramallah Thursday for four hours and emerged with a joint
statement saying that progress had been made.
</P>
<P>
The two sides expect to finalize the working agenda for the
coming weeks at the next meeting, which is to be held Sunday, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Central Party convened a solidarity meeting Thursday
night after the party, which was formed only before the May
election, has reportedly reached the edge of breaking up.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Roni Milo, the number four figure in the
party, called on party leader Yitzhak Mordechai to quit. In his
response, Mordechai said it was time for Milo to resign.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Newspaper Bans Tobacco Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Boston Globe, a unit
of the New York Times Co., became one of a small but growing group
of U.S. newspapers to ban advertisements for tobacco products on
Thursday, the Globe said.
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer justify carrying advertisements that promote
a product when the harm it causes is so evident," the Globe's
publisher, Richard H. Gilman, said in a written statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Even though tobacco remains legal, its effect on public health
is clear," Gilman added.
</P>
<P>
Relatively few U.S. newspapers now reject tobacco product ads,
the Globe said. Among those that will not accept such ads are the
Globe's parent New York Times, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin,
Christian Science Monitor, and Seattle Times.
</P>
<P>
The Globe's ban is effective immediately for its newspaper
pages, and January 1 for pre-printed sections published by others
and carried in the Globe.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Future Depends on Youth's Health, Says VP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Vice President
Megawati Soekarnoputri Friday expressed concern about the health
problem of youths, saying the country has placed its hope and
future on them.
</P>
<P>
"We have put our hope and future on the youths," Megawati said
in Cirebon, about 300 km east of Jakarta, in the commemoration of
the 35th National Health Day, the Antara news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
She said the government should work together with the public in
health development through various programs, adding that dengue
fever is still a major health problem for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, she said, it needs serious prevention efforts
through sanitary improvement programs and mosquito eradication.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever, an acute tropical disease transmitted by
mosquitoes, leaves its victims with fever, rash and severe pains
in the joints and back. The cholera-like disease causes vomiting
and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
The vice president also urged fellow countrymen to carry out
the national sanitary program in all villages and cities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Health Minister Achmad Sujudi said the economic
crisis since 1997 has made it more difficult for the public to
meet basic requirements for sanitation.
</P>
<P>
"They put in priority the basic needs. While only 67.3 percent
of villagers can enjoy clean water, and 54.3 percent use privies,"
Sujudi said.

KAMPALA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan will borrow 22.38 U.S.

<HEADLINE> Gulf States Need Huge Investments in Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) countries will need more than 60 billion U.S. dollars to
fund their infrastructure and project requirements in the next 20
years, accounting for a quarter of the total needs in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
The funding requirements of the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
could be the highest in the GCC, at 26 billion dollars for
projects in areas such as petrochemicals, commercial real estate,
urban and civic development, gas pipeline, gas field development,
refining, power generation, ports and airports and residential
housing.
</P>
<P>
Both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will have project requirements of
11 billion dollars, according to Abdullah El Kuwaiz, general
manager of Bahrain-based Gulf International Bank, who was quoted
by UAE papers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will invest substantially in areas such as
telecommunication, petrochemicals, oil, gas and refining, roads,
water desalination and supply, power plants and waste water
treatment units.
</P>
<P>
Next in line is Qatar, 8 billion dollars, followed by Oman, 7
billion dollars, and Bahrain, 1.3 billion dollars, El Kuwaiz said.
</P>
<P>
Due to lower oil prices several month before, government
budgets were slashed and both capital and current spending were
reduced. This has encouraged the private sector to get more
involved.
</P>
<P>
Low oil revenues had also encouraged Gulf governments to
introduce or increase fee structures on the up-to-now free or
subsidized facilities like water and electricity, El Kuwaiz said.
</P>
<P>
However, according to him, oil and gas sectors will continue to
play a major role in the Gulf, although attempts to
diversification have been accelerated.

<P>
HARARE, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The latest rate of Zimbabwe's
inflation has reached a new record high of 70.4 percent, remaining
a major hitch in the road to economic recovery, the Herald daily
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa has likened the inflation
spiral to the silent killer high blood pressure and called for
"total" and "immediate"

response to the problem.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth pattern in inflation has slowed down from
0.9 percentage points between August and September to 0.7
percentage points in October.
</P>
<P>
A slowdown in inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index
 (CPI) confirms the popular view that inflation could have reached
its peak.
</P>
<P>
Substantial increases in food and non-food items measured on
the CPI pushed the September rate of inflation to 69.7 percent.

JERUSALEM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel's trade deficit in
the first 10 months of 1999 was 27 percent higher than that of
the same period of 1998, according to figures released by the
Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) Friday.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit reached 593 million U.S. dollars in October,
bringing the year-to-date deficit to 6.156 billion U.S. dollars,
CBS said, adding that by comparison, the trade gap for all of
1998 was 5.809 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports in October totalled 2.5 billion dollars, while exports
were 1.9 billion, causing the monthly deficit to balloon 41 percent
from its its October 1998 level.
</P>
<P>
CBS said that trade volume in sectors other than ships,
aircraft, diamonds and fuel was down in October because of the
port strike during the last third of the month.

<P>
BANGKOK, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand may be able to start
to pay debts obliged to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
earlier than agreed schedule, but that will be after next year,
Thai News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongkol Sonakul, governor of the Bank of Thailand, was
quoted as saying that Thailand could be able to pay its external
debts to the IMF after the year 2000, when the country will have
to earmark a reserved fund to tackle any possible millennium bug
problems that could occur.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's early repayment to the IMF will begin after the
country has completely resolved its Y2K problems, Chatumongkol
added.
</P>
<P>
The planned early payment to the U.S.-based institution would,
however, be discussed among authorities concerned so as to come up
with appropriate timetables and resolutions, as conditions and
terms of loans under the IMF bailout package were different, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The IMF agreed to give a bailout package of 17.2 billion U.S.
dollars to Thailand after the country was first hit by its worst
economic crisis in 50 years in mid-1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba blamed the West for Africa's poverty, saying that slavery
has continued to afflict Africa despite the end of colonialism.
</P>
<P>
The West has continued to restrict imports from Africa to raw
materials only, Chiluba said Thursday before departing for the
Commonwealth Heads of Government Summit in Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's message to the Commonwealth will be that Africa does
not need sympathy but that measures to benefit the continent
should be introduced, The Post newspaper Friday quoted Chiluba as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of poverty around," he said. "It's not pitying
Africa that we need."
</P>
<P>
Asked on what was expected to come out of the summit, the
president said what Africa wants is not sympathy but to develop on
the same level with West nations.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Auction Artwork </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is scheduled to hold
three auctions in the remaining months of the year.
</P>
<P>
At auction will be some 500 pieces of artwork including
paintings, calligraphy, china, and jade articles.
</P>
<P>
Many of these works are rarely seen on the market, such as
several paintings by well-known Chinese artists Fu Baoshi and Xu
Beihong.
</P>
<P>
Local auctioneers said they are optimistic about prospects for
the auctions because an increasing number of Chinese investors
have turned to collecting art since the country lowered interest
rates this year.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of some Southeast Asian economies, which have been
major sources of investment in the auction market in Shanghai, has
also strengthened their confidence, the auctioneers said.

<HEADLINE> Research on Suicide Needed: Chinese Psychiatrists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese psychiatrists today
called on the entire society to pay close attention to suicide
that takes 200,000 Chinese lives each year.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics released by the Ministry of Health indicate
that among every 100,000 Chinese people, 22 will kill themselves
each year.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the 200,000
suicides in China makes up roughly one fifth of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Attending the WHO's Mental Health Awareness Raising Conference
in Beijing, Zhang Xinbao, a psychiatrist with the Nanjing Cerebral
Hospital, said that depression, schizophrenia and other mental
illnesses are major factors leading to suicide.
</P>
<P>
A survey reveals that in China suicide costs more lives than
road accidents to top the list of accidental deaths. However,
Zhang said that effective preventative measures could greatly help
reduce the rate of suicides.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the meeting said they are not satisfied with
existing suicide prevention measures in China. Only a few cities
such as Nanjing, Guangzhou and Tianjin have set up suicide
prevention institutes.
</P>
<P>
Zhai Shutao, who initiated the country's first crisis
prevention center in Nanjing, said that medical, social and
psychological experts should make concerted efforts to help the
most needy, including mental patients, prisoners and alcohol
abusers.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhai hopes to set up an organization that deals with
suicide prevention at the state level, involving public security,
civil affairs and education departments and women and youth
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The professor also suggested strictly controlling farm
chemicals which were invariably used as a means by many Chinese
when taking their life. If poisonous farm chemicals were difficult
to obtain, suicides in China would be drastically reduced by half,
Zhai said.

Special Administrative Region (SAR), said today the garrison
troops are composed mainly of ground forces from the People's
Liberation Army.
</P>

To facilitate the handling of navy and air force defense
affairs, the troops have also enlisted small number of officers

The number of the garrison troops to be stationed in the Macao
SAR will not exceed 1,000 and the equipment they will carry
essentially consists of light weapons.
</P>
<P>

the basic task of the troops is to be in charge of Macao's defense.
Liu detailed the basic tasks as follows: preventing and resisting
aggression; safeguarding the security of the Macao SAR;
undertaking defense services; managing military facilities and
handing related foreign military affairs.
</P>
<P>
The troops will also be called in to defend when the National
People's Congress declares a state of war or a state of emergency
is declared by the Macao SAR, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Garrison Law, the garrison troops will help
maintain local order and help disaster relief efforts when asked
by the Macao SAR government.

<HEADLINE> Mideast to Need 555 More Aircraft in 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- With an annual air travel
growth of 4.6 percent, the Middle East region will require 555
more aircraft during the next 20 years, costing a total of 49
billion U.S. dollars, a Boeing Company official has said.
</P>
<P>
Boeing is well-positioned to stay as the leading aircraft
supplier to the Middle East, which will account for some 2.8
percent of the total world aircraft market in the next two
decades, Mark Cooper, Boeing regional communications director, was
quoted by the Khaleej Times daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Boeing currently has a market share of some 74 percent in the
Middle East where it has delivered 329 units so far, compared to a
total of 114 units by its European rival Airbus.
</P>
<P>
According to Cooper, the demand for medium long-haul aircraft
is expected to grow significantly in the region in the next 20
years.
</P>
<P>
Boeing's partnership with the Middle East airlines has been
growing from strength to strength, Cooper said. It has delivered
nine 777-200s to the Emirates airlines during 1996-98, and three
777-300s are to be delivered in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Boeing's other airline partners in the region include EgyptAir,
Kuwait Airways and Saudi Arabian Airlines. "We are firmly
committed to making these partnerships continue long into the
future," Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Boeing would be well represented at the
forthcoming five-day Dubai 2000 air show, which will open on
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Navy Honors Spielberg, Hanks for "Saving Private Ryan" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Navy bestowed its
highest civilian honor on movie giants Tom Hanks and Steven
Spielberg for their work on the World War II film "Saving Private
Ryan" when marking Veteran's Day on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under Secretary of the Navy Jerry Hultin awarded Hanks, the
movie's star, and Spielberg, its director, the Distinguished
Public Service Award aboard the U.S.S. Normandy at Port Everglades,
south of downtown Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
"If you saw 'Saving Private Ryan', you know how many people
paid the price," said Hultin.
</P>
<P>
The film "dramatically increased the American public's
awareness and appreciation of the sacrifices made by U.S. veterans
during the Battle of Normandy," the Navy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Saving Private Ryan", which this year won five Oscars
including Spielberg's second for best director, told the story of
a battle-weary platoon's search for a U.S. soldier -- the only
survivor of four brothers -- behind enemy lines after the Normandy
invasion.
</P>
<P>
Its vivid portrayal of American troops storming France's
beaches on D-Day stirred audiences around the world.
</P>
<P>
The Normandy ship was named for the bloody battle in which
allied forces landed in France to begin advancing on Germany. The
landing at Normandy is the movie's scene.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Parliament Passes Appropriation Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan parliament has approved
 the Appropriation Bill of 127 billion shillings (around 1.7
billion U.S. dollars) for use by the government in the current
financial year, media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bill, passed by the parliament Thursday, is the final law
that authorizes budgetary funds to be released from the
consolidated fund for the operations of government ministries
scheduled to end in June next year.
</P>
<P>
Moving the motion on the bill, Finance Minister Chris Okemo
appealed to the members of parliament to pass the bill so that his
ministry could withdraw the fund to ensure the ministries operate.
</P>
<P>
The bill went through in three readings in just less than 30
minutes immediately after the finance minister moved in.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan parliament Thursday also passed the Constitution of
Kenya (Amendment) Bill which would enable the House to run its own
affairs as the common practice within the Commonwealth.

JAKARTA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Floods and erosion due to
damages in the upper reaches of rivers and forest areas inundated
main roads which link Palu and Luwuk in Indonesia's Central
Sulawesi for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Floods, mud and gravels, had also caused damage to local
people's agricultural land in a village in Poso district,
according to Antara News Agency Friday.
</P>
<P>
To avoid further damage, the provincial administration had
built a dike and a bridge to control the Podi river's water flow,
but the dike and bridge collapsed soon after due to poor
construction work, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, similar disasters forced the local administration to
relocate some 600 residents from the village to a neighboring one.

<HEADLINE> Large Gas Reserve to Be Discovered in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- American gas exploration company
Unocal said it expects to discover a large reserve of gas at its
Moulavibazar-2 and -3 wells, and the Ratna field in the Habiganj
district of Bangladesh, The Financial Express reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The American company said the Moulavibazar-2 well has already
been drilled and drilling of the Moulavibazar-3 well will be
completed in a week. It also expects a big discovery at the Ratna
field of Habiganj, 180 kilometers northeast of the country's
capital.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Terry Burdeen, president of Unocal Bangladesh
Ltd., as saying, "We are expecting a multi-TCF (trillion cubic
feet) discovery at the two wells in Moulavibazar."
</P>
<P>
The Unocal chief told the press Wednesday that the real reserve
could be assessed only after an analysis of the drilling data
which would be finalized 30 days after completion of the tests.
</P>
<P>
On the prospect of the Ratna site in Habiganj, Burdeen said the
American company expects "a significant and large reserve at Ratna
which could be larger than Bibiana."
</P>
<P>
The Bibiana discovery is branded as a world-class discovery. It
is estimated to have a reserve of 3-5 TCF of which 80 percent is
recoverable.
</P>
<P>
Ratna will be drilled next month or in January 2000.

BANGKOK, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai is suffering from fatigue as a result of overwork and lack
of sleep, the local newspaper The Nation quoted a medical source
as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chuan abruptly canceled an appointment Thursday with the
producer of a local television station because of extreme
tiredness. His personal doctor conducted a thorough checkup in the
morning and recommended that he cancel the entire day's activities
and take more rest.
</P>
<P>
Chuan, 61, has been overworking lately and on several nights he
slept for only three hours, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Other factors, such as the lack of exercise and pollution in
his neighborhood, were also quoted as reasons for his fatigue.
</P>
<P>
Chuan had rejected the suggestion of his aides to move to the
official prime ministerial residence, saying it would be a waste
of money.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister now lives in a house rented by himself.
</P>
<P>
He likes practicing shadowboxing at his home, but work has kept
him away from his favorite exercise lately.
</P>
<P>
Chuan's aides have expressed concern that the prime minister
risks suffering from koroshi, which in Japanese means death
resulting from overwork which causes hypertension leading to
life-threatening diseases.
</P>
<P>
Since his trip to Japan between October 24 and 27, Chuan has
been constantly on the move, either on government or party work.

would be conducted only for one day, instead of two days in
previous elections, Omar said.
</P>
<P>
According to Omar, the 1998 Electoral Rolls with about 9.7
million voters verified on January 7 this year would be used for
the coming general election.
</P>
<P>
The present parliament was dissolved effective Thursday, seven
months before its five-year term expires.
</P>
<P>
Legislative assemblies of the 11 states in Peninsular Malaysia
were also dissolved effective Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The country's two other states, Sarawak and Sabah in East
Malaysia, hold their state elections separately and they already
held theirs in 1996 and March this year respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the last general election held in April 1995, the ruling
Barisan Nasional (BN) (National Front) coalition led by Mahathir
Mohamad won 162 of the total 192 seats in the parliament.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asia's Poverty Reduction Remains Tough Job (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
... more rural electrification projects and fewer big power
plants."
</P>
<P>
Why the number of poor people has kept increasing in Asia
despite the fast economic development in the past decades?
</P>
<P>
Population growth is adding to the absolute number of the poor,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
Although the proportion of people in poverty in China, India,
Indonesia, Bangladesh and Pakistan declined from 25 percent to 21
percent in the past 13 years, their population increased by 25
percent, from 2.162 billion to 2.71 billion. As a consequence, the
number of people in poverty in the five countries rose from 549
million to 572 million.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the war against poverty in percentage has won, but not so
in numbers, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Asian financial crisis has reversed decades of
development in some countries, making the poverty reduction task
even tougher, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, trends in poverty reduction in the region had
been positive, especially in East and Southeast Asia. However,
since the financial crisis in 1997, declines in the gross domestic
product of the economies in the region have stalled progress. In
Southeast Asia alone, more than 10 million people have joined the
ranks of the poor in the wake of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Besides, many people in the Central Asian countries have
slipped into poverty with the economic disruptions of transition.
The small island countries in the Pacific remain vulnerable
because they are remote, prone to natural disasters, and have
limited ability to deal with external economic shocks.
</P>
<P>
As the number of the poor is still increasing in Asia, experts
are learning lessons from poverty reduction efforts in the past
and studying the best way to eradicate extreme poverty in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"While sustained economic growth is clearly the only viable
engine driving poverty reduction, experience shows that the rising
tide does not lift all boats equally. Some let in water and some
are fully stuck in the mud," Jean-Michel Severino, vice president
for the East Asia and Pacific region of the World Bank, said
Tuesday at the opening of a four-day "Manila Social Forum," which
looks for ways to resolve social policy issues.
</P>
<P>
He proposed more investment in education and the establishment
of a social safety net for the poor, because "rapid growth cannot
be the primary safety net, provider of jobs and income security
(for the poor) in the future."
</P>
<P>
With its new strategy, the ADB will concentrate on the rural
and social sectors as the great majority of the poor live in the
countryside. The bank will also invest more to provide the poor,
especially women, with access to essential services, such as
health and education.
</P>
<P>
"These investments are often the most effective way to break
the cycle of poverty," said an ADB statement issued earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
But experts said the Asian countries most seriously affected by
the economic crisis will have to spend the first years of the
coming millennium trying to return to their pre-crisis levels of
poverty incidence.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield, Lewis Ready for Rematch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Evander Holyfield thought
he earned at least a draw in his heavyweight title unification
bout with Lennox Lewis in March. He was pretty much the only one.
</P>
<P>
Now Holyfield has a chance to erase the memory of one of the
worst decisions in boxing history when he and Lewis meet Saturday
night at the Thomas and Mack Center.
</P>
<P>
In their earlier meeting, Lewis, the WBC champion from London,
embarrassed Holyfield, the WBA and IBF titleholder.
</P>
<P>
Lewis (34-1-1, 27 knockouts) dominated nearly every round but
somehow, the bout was scored a draw. The result was so appalling
it sparked inquiries and allegations by both boxing and
governmental regulating bodies.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield (36-3-1, 25 KOs) looked old and overmatched against
the less experienced Lewis. He predicted a third-round knockout
yet barely survived that long. This time, he vows to return to the
form that earned him a reputation as a warrior.
</P>
<P>
"I will win handily," Holyfield said. "I will win this fight
and will win it convincingly. No one will have any reasons to make
excuses. I have been led by the Holy Spirit and it will be a great
fight. It may be my last performance and it might not be my last
performance."
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, Lewis endured criticism for not stopping the 37-
year-old Holyfield in March.
</P>
<P>
"I'm boxing to knock him out," Lewis, 34, said. "If the
opportunity presents itself to knock him out early, I will. The
first fight was disappointing and a travesty. The second fight
will be more entertaining because we both know each other more."
</P>
<P>
The fighters, each expected to receive roughly $15 million for
the pay-per-view showdown on TVKO, weighted in tonight. Lewis got
on the scale first and tipped it at 242 pounds, while Holyfield
checked in at 217.
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas officials have locked veteran judges Chuck Giampa,
Bill Graham and Jerry Roth into the main event with Mitch Halpern
serving as referee.
</P>
<P>
After posting a pair of rousing victories against former
champion Mike Tyson and knocking out former titleholder Michael
Moorer, Holyfield has looked sluggish in going the distance
against Vaughn Bean and Lewis.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to Saturday," Holyfield said. "I am the
undisputed champion of the world right now and after the fight I
will be picking up my belt. There are not nothing wrong with being
second best, Lennox."
</P>
<P>
"Did Evander say that he is undisputed champion?" Lewis asked.
"No way, you can't say that before a fight. When I said I am going
to take more chances, what I meant to say was Evander is going to
get hit more. This will be the last time to see Evander sing
before he gets into the ring. He said he is not going to make
excuses, and I won't. On Saturday, you will see a great fight and
you will see the new heavyweight champion of the world."
</P>
<P>
In the first fight, Lewis used his jab to hammer away at
Holyfield. While most expect Holyfield to try and engage Lewis in
a war, the WBC champion easily could use his reach and height
advantages to keep his opponent at bay.
</P>
<P>
"I am excited about the fight," said Lewis' trainer, veteran
Emanuel Steward. "I expect to see the last champion of the century.
I wouldn't want to miss it as a fan. This fight will be exciting
and I believe it will be a knockout. I don't want to hear any
excuses after this one."
</P>
<P>
Holyfield's coach Don Turner countered: "I hope Lewis comes out
and fights the way Steward wants him to fight because that's the
way Evander wants him to fight."

<HEADLINE> China, Australia to Jointly Develop Coal-Bed Methane in Shanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The China United Coal-Bed
Methane Corp. Ltd. (CUCBM) and Lowell Petroleum Co. of Australia
signed a production contract here today to co-develop methane
resources in Shanxi Province, north China.
</P>
<P>
The designated Liulin block, covering 198 sq. km., is estimated
to contain 30 billion cu. m. of coal-bed methane reserves.
According to CUCBM's vice-president Sun Maoyuan, the block's
methane resources have a fair permeability and lie at a moderate
depth, both favorable for industrial development.
</P>
<P>
Liulin block, located in the coal-rich Hedong Coal Mine,
contains around three trillion cu. m. of potential methane
reserves, accounting for eight percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that up to now his company has signed five contracts
with four foreign partners on jointly tapping coal-bed resources
in Hedong Coal Mine. The five contracted blocks, neighboring each
other, cover a combined area of 8,700 sq. km. in Hedong. CUCBM
hopes to build the coal mine into the country's largest coal-bed
methane production base.
</P>
<P>
CUCBM has awarded seven contracts to foreign investors,
including the Liulin contract. Lowell is CUCBM's first foreign
partner from a country other than the United States.
</P>
<P>
China's total coal-bed methane resources are estimated at 35
trillion cu. m., equivalent to 45 trillion tons of standard coal
and equal to the country's conventional gas resources, ranking
third in the world.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Visit U.S. Troops in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Thursday that he will go to the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo to visit the U.S. troops stationed there during his coming
tour of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the decision after the White House decided to
shorten his stay in Greece out of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to thank our troops and see how they're doing, to
support the United Nations' operation there and to see how we're
doing in helping the peace to take hold and meeting basic human
needs," Clinton told reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will visit the U.S. military base in southern-central
Kosovo known as Camp Bondsteel, a site surrounded by barbed wire,
concrete barriers and guard towers.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government is expected to object to the visit. The
Washington Post quoted a Yugoslav diplomat at the United Nations
as saying, "Kosovo is not an independent state that anybody can
just jump in."
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report said Clinton has wanted to visit
Kosovo ever since the U.S.-led NATO ended its bombing of
Yugoslavia in June.
</P>
<P>
Thousands were killed and many facilities were destroyed in the
78-day bombing. A U.S.-led multi-national force was deployed in
Kosovo after Belgrade withdrew its forces from the province.
</P>
<P>
Officials said Clinton's Kosovo visit probably would be limited
to a matter of hours at the end of his European trip, which begins
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had originally planned to visit Greece this weekend and
stay there for two nights, but had to delay and shorten it at the
recommendation of the Greek government due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
According to the new itinerary, Clinton will leave on Sunday
and visit Greece on November 18-19. The trip will bring the
president to Bulgaria, Italy and Turkey, where he will attend a
summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to return to Washington on November 23.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Govt to Raise Electricity Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government may
soon announce a hike in the electricity tariff by 30 percent, The
Kathmandu Post Friday quoted a source from the Nepal Electricity
Authority (NEA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The announcement should come by next week, according to the
source.
</P>
<P>
The source disclosed that the Nepali government is under great
pressure from donor countries to raise the electricity price by 65
percent within the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
"The new tariff is being fixed due mainly to donors' pressure,"
he said, referring to the "five-point conditions" set by the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) which, among others, asked the government
to increase the electricity tariff by "up to 65 percent" within
the 1999/2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The ADB will provide a loan of 50 million U.S. dollars to
finance rural electrification under the NEA's seventh
electrification plan.
</P>
<P>
"The German government and the World Bank have also pledged
more contribution, if we hike the price of electricity," he added.
</P>
<P>
Average electricity price at present stands at 4.95 rupees (7
U.S. cents) per unit. The price will go up to 6.5 rupees (9 cents)
per unit. Only 15 percent of the country's 22 million people are
now supplied with electricity.

ZHUHAI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese military
official said here today that the garrison troops to be stationed
in the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) are of no lesser
position than those stationed in the Hong Kong SAR.

<P>
To meet the demands for defense in the Macao SAR and Hong Kong
SAR, the two garrison troops are different in composition, size,
establishment and equipment, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Garrison Law of the Macao SAR, the Central
Government covers the expenses of the troops, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing-Based Scholars Lash Out at Falun Gong Cult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A group of famous Chinese
scholars here have lashed out at the Falun Gong cult, stressing
that the fight against it will be a long and complicated one.
</P>
<P>
At a forum here sponsored by the People's Daily, Qiushi
Magazine and Guangming Daily, the scholars noted that people
should not underestimate the damage done by Falun Gong to the
Party, the state and the people.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative for the nation to be thorough in exterminating
the evil influence of the cult, the scholars maintained.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Hao Lixin of the People's University of China said that
cults are cancers in modern society, and that the Falun Gong
organization has every feature of a cult.
</P>
<P>
Only when this cancer is removed can the Chinese nation enjoy
long-term stability and the people a happy life, Prof. Hao said.
</P>
<P>
Huang Nansen, a philosophy professor at Beijing University,
theorized why some Falun Gong practitioners were still clinching
to leader Li Hongzhi's heresies. One of the major reasons is that
Falun Gong has waved the banner of religion and claimed that its
founder is a great god, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Falun Gong has never been a religion: Religions are
characterized by tolerance and harmony, while the Falun Gong cult
is self-absorbed and dangerously aggressive, Huang noted.
</P>
<P>
Academician He Zuoxiu of the China Academy of Sciences said
that like every cult, Falun Gong has undermined social stability
and endangered people's spiritual health.
</P>
<P>
As a pioneer fighter against Falun Gong, He noted that there
are some political forces at home and abroad that are using the
cult as a means of expanding their own selfish interests.
</P>
<P>
"We must be vigilant against this matter in our fight against
the Falun Gong cult," he said.

<HEADLINE> Some 3.5 Million Children Work Illegally in Central America: ILO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- As many as 3.5 million
children aged between five and 15 are working illegally in Central
America, an official from the International Labor Organization (
ILO) said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Carmen Moreno, Coordinator of the International Program for the
Eradication of Child Labor (IPEC) of the ILO, said during a
conference attended by Latin labor ministers that 18 to 20 million
child laborers are working in Latin America and the situation is
especially serious in Brazil, Peru and Chile.
</P>
<P>
He said the ILO has 34 programs which attempt to take children
out of the labor market and return them to school, but he admitted
that it is difficult.
</P>
<P>
The ILO said the majority of child labors are engaged in small
informal businesses, at homes, and on farms. It is hard to find
and classify them.
</P>
<P>
ILO member countries have approved an agreement that would
forbid employing children under 15 years of age, while regulating
the labor of young people between the ages of 15-18 in order to
prevent the worst kinds of child labor. The agreement is under
consideration by Central American parliaments for ratification.

KIEV, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's foreign trade volume (
service not included) in the first nine months of 1999 slumped to
16.68 billion U.S. dollars, 19.9 percent lower compared to the

</P>
<P>
According to a report recently released by the Ukrainian
National Statistics Committee, in the past nine months, the

<P>
The trade deficit of the past nine months was 150 million
dollars less than the same period last year and positive signs are
witnessed in the third quarter as far as merchandise and service
export is concerned, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine trades with 179 countries and regions worldwide.

</P>
<P>
The report said that the swap imports and exports also dropped
in the past nine months, down 3.4 percent and 4.3 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
As to the trade structure, the report pointed out that the
country has been importing more energy while exporting more

Ukraine's foreign trade volume (including service) in 1998 was
32.5 billion dollars, down 13.2 percent from a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Austria Pledges Not to Obstruct EU's Eastward Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Austria will not interfere with
the expansion of the European Union (EU), Austrian Foreign
Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a meeting of the International Financial and
Economic Forum, Schuessel said that no one could or would block
the EU's expansion. But he said he hopes to have further
discussions on the issues of energy and communication with the EU,
since the expansion process would have more impact on those two
fields.
</P>
<P>
On energy, he said that new nuclear power stations built by
Austria's neighbors must meet the latest safety standards and the
old ones must also reach the EU's safety standards.
</P>
<P>
Austria has insisted that its eastern neighbor countries should
close down their nuclear power stations as early as possible. It
has warned the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia that if they
disagreed, Austria would veto their EU membership bid.
</P>
<P>
Austria has agreed to accept the EU's compromise after several
negotiations, but it adheres strictly to its views on nuclear
power and communications.

<HEADLINE> Russia Promoting Ties with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov said Thursday Russia will continue its
efforts to promote ties with the European Union (EU) and hailed
the progress made this past year.
</P>
<P>
The Russia-EU ties have been pushed to a new level in the past
year, as programs set by both sides entered a stage of
implementation, he told a press conference after talking with his
Finnish counterpart Tarja Halonen.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov arrived here Thursday for a two-day stay and will attend
a foreign minister's meeting on Friday aimed at EU's northward
extension and enhancing cooperation among the EU, Russia and the
Baltic states.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Minister expressed interest in the project
during his afternoon talks with Halonen. He said it might set a
model for future European security and cooperation, and for
developing relations between European countries.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers exchanged views on a wide range of
issues including bilateral ties, EU-Russia ties, the North
Caucasus situation and the upcoming Istanbul summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
Ivanov regarded the OSCE summit in Istanbul as very important
for European security, adding that Russia would like to play its
part in reinforcing security and stability in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he reiterated Russia's stance on the Chechen issue,
saying Moscow will continue taking necessary measures against
terrorism in this breakaway republic, while seeking a political
solution to the crisis there.
</P>
<P>
Russia would like to accept the humanitarian assistance
provided by the international communities, he added.

<HEADLINE> Private Schools Grow Fast in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of private
schools has grown rapidly to reach 353 in Romania, which ranks
first in East Europe.
</P>
<P>
Among them, private kindergartens and elementary schools have
seen the biggest growth, accounting for 72 percent of the total,
an official in charge of the country's pre-college evaluation and
registration committee told reporters on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Private professional schools are more successful than other
private schools, he added.
</P>
<P>
Romania has been encouraging private education in order to
reduce the financial burden of the state and provide more chances
for students.
</P>
<P>
However, reports said that due to costly tuition fees and
unstable teaching quality, most parents still want to send their
children to public schools.

<HEADLINE> Germany Vows to Accelerate Eastern Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- German Federal Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder promised Thursday to encourage development in
eastern Germany amid complaints that nine years after the
reunification, eastern Germany is falling far behind.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder admitted in his statement that the sense of
disappointment and neglect are growing among the eastern
population.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder noted that sustainable reunification of the two
Germanys can be realized only when a balanced pace of development
is achieved, hence the improvement of living standards in eastern
Germany is the prime target of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
After the federal program to help the eastern economy expires
in 2004, the government will continue its preferential investing
policies with a focus on promoting education and infrastructure
construction in eastern Germany.
</P>
<P>
On the reunification of the former East and West Germany in
1990, the federal government promised to balance the living
standard of the two parts within 3-5 years.
</P>
<P>
During these years, an average of 100 billion Germany Marks
poured into the sluggish eastern economy per year.
</P>
<P>
However, after years of investment and reform, the eastern part
of Germany is still falling behind with double the jobless rate
and 80 percent of the average salary compared to the west.
</P>
<P>
Amid growing complaints of high costs and financial burdens
among the people in west Germany and a sense of being neglected
among the people of east Germany, Gregor Gysi, chairman of the
parliamentary group of the Democratic Socialist Party, voiced
disappointment on the government's work and urged a time table for
narrowing the living standard gap.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Reports Steady Increase of Foreign Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investments in Croatia
are expected to exceed 1 billion U.S. dollars, keeping a steady
upward trend since 1993, the People's Bank of Croatia said in a
report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Croatia attracted 873 million dollars of foreign investments
last year. From 1993, the foreign investments flowing into the
country have been increasing steadily and totaled 2.2 billion
dollars by 1998, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Preferential conditions offered by the Croatian government play
a part in the continuous inflow of foreign investments, the report
said. One policy grants import tax waivers to foreign investors
who have operated in Croatia for five years.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Launch Tourism Campaign Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
launch a major tourism campaign overseas in a bid to restore the
country's tourism image in the eyes of the world community,
according to The Jakarta Post Friday.
</P>
<P>
The image promotion program is the follow-up of a "rescue
program" which was carried out in the past two years to restore
Indonesia's tourism image after it was hard hit by political and
economic turmoil, Director General for Tourism I. Gede Ardika
said.
</P>
<P>
He said State Minister of Tourism and Arts Hidayat Zailani will
make a trip to a number of countries in Asia and Europe, including
Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Japan, Australia, the
United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
They are main markets for the Indonesian tourism industry, in
addition to countries of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations.
</P>
<P>
According to Ardika, the government will ask the Indonesian
Tourism Promotion Board to coordinate the program with the
industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign tourism experts also called on the
Indonesian government to launch a tourism campaign overseas.
</P>
<P>
Pierre-Etienne Vaernewyck, economic and commercial attache of
the Belgian Embassy here, said Indonesia's lack of adequate
tourism promotion had resulted in misperceptions about the
country.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Austrian National Tourist Office in Jakarta
Oskar Andesner said Indonesia was less known than Bali due to
incomprehensive information released to overseas markets,
including Austria.
</P>
<P>
In order to attract more tourists to Indonesia, the government
should improve its overseas promotion on destination areas other
than Jakarta and Bali, said Grels Zakrisson, the counselor of
commercial affairs at the Swedish Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreigners visiting Indonesia dropped to 3.5
million in 1998 from 5.1 million in 1997 due to escalating
political instability.
</P>
<P>
In line with positive developments during the last couple of
months, the government revised its forecast of total inbound
arrivals this year to about 5 million from an initial estimate of
between 3.9 million and 4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
Inbound arrivals are predicted to reach 354,500 in November and
404,530 in December.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asia's Poverty Reduction Remains Tough Job (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) announced earlier this week a new poverty reduction
strategy, which aims to help eradicate extreme poverty in Asia and
the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
With emphasis on economic growth in earlier years, the ADB, a
multilateral development bank, financed Asia's urgent need for
physical infrastructure, such as electricity, roads, irrigation
systems, school buildings and health centers.
</P>
<P>
But now, the Manila-based bank will shift its focus from
assisting its members in economic growth to poverty reduction,
because millions of Asians are surviving on less than 1 U.S.
dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
The ADB's move reflected the urgency of poverty reduction in
the region, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three decades, Asia's economic growth has
significantly reduced the proportion of people in extreme poverty.
According to an ADB study, the proportion of people in poverty in
China, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Pakistan declined from 25
percent in 1985 to 21 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, close to 900 million of the world's poor live in Asia
and nearly one in three Asians is poor, the study says.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the development gains of the past few decades, Asia is
still home to 900 million extremely poor people. This is
unacceptable. Public policy and action can change this and we are
refocusing our work with the single, over-arching goal of
eliminating poverty from the region," said Tadao Chino, president
of the ADB, when announcing the bank's new poverty reduction
strategy Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chino said his bank, which finances roughly 6 billion dollars
worth of projects and programs yearly, will readjust its project
focus. At least 40 percent of all public sector lending will be
poverty interventions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Future projects will have to show that they directly or
indirectly benefit large numbers of very poor people," said ADB
Vice President Peter Sullivan, who prepared the bank's new
strategy. "This means we'll be doing more farm-to-market roads and
fewer expressways, more rural electrification projects and fewer
big power plants."

<HEADLINE> Nordic Nations Agree on Regional Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Nordic nations reached a
broad consensus on regional integration here Thursday at the end
of a three-day 51st session of the Nordic Council and decided to
hammer out a concrete action plan.
</P>
<P>
In a report, entitled "Norden Without Boundaries," the premiers
of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland agreed that with
rapid development in and out of the Nordic region, closer
cooperation among European countries as well as emergence of new
technology and improved communications, Nordic countries are
facing new opportunities and challenges that call for the virtual
removal of all boundaries.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the most prominent obstacles blocking
intercommunication are legal inconsistencies, especially in the
areas of taxation, social assurance and the labor market.
</P>
<P>
The leaders put forward concrete proposals in curbing
impediments in these fields and stressed the importance of setting
up a Northern Europe with no boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson expressed his hope that
the Nordic countries could share an equal rate of income tax on an
early date to promote free flow of personnel.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Prime Minster Kjell Magne Bondevik said in the report
that a united Northern Europe could wield greater influence in
international affairs than an individual nation.
</P>
<P>
Danish Premier Poul Rasmussen echoed him by saying that five
swans fly farther than a single swallow.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the premiers promised to work out an action
plan on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the Nordic Council in 1952, the five
nations have vowed to break up boundaries in regional cooperation
in all sectors. But the principles of cross-border cooperation
have largely remained on paper, prompting the leaders to decide on
actions at this session.

<HEADLINE> Suicide Cases Increase in Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of people committing
suicide in Bulgaria went up over the past few years, with 1,500
dying by suicide last year, exceeding the traffic accident toll
for the first time, sociological experts said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The experts were attending a conference on "Suicide Prevention
in the Period of Transition: Opportunities and Problems." The
conference was co-sponsored by the country's Psychology Center and
the General Staff of the Bulgarian Army.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Bulgaria's suicide rate rose to 18.3 per 100,000,
against 16 per 100,000 in 1989. The experts said family conflicts
prevailed in triggering suicides, while drug-related suicides are
also on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Among those who took their own lives, pensioners accounted for
44.4 percent, while even minors committed suicide, with the
youngest under 10 years of age.
</P>
<P>
Krassimir Ivanov, from the psychology center, noted that the
Bulgarian press covers as little as five percent of civilian
suicides, whereas almost every such case in the army is reported,
leading to a wide-spread negative impression on the army.
</P>
<P>
Servicemen kill themselves most often while on duty. Impaired
mental health and family conflicts are the two most common causes.
Since 1982, 98 regular and 315 conscripts have committed suicide
in the Bulgarian Army.
</P>
<P>
One of the experts, Associate Professor Lilyana Tsoneva,
presented the draft of a national program on suicide prevention
to the conference that called for joint efforts from several
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
A mandatory registration of suicide cases is already in force.

<HEADLINE> Romania Making Strides Toward Y2K Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Romania has made great
strides in resolving potential problems from the impending Y2K
crisis at some key computer units such as the Cernavoda nuclear
plant, which may now enter the 21st Century safely, a senior
official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sergiu Iliescu, director of Romania's communication and
information department, told reporters that the country has become
82 percent compliant according to international standards
regarding risks posed by Y2K, quoting an estimate by a Canadian
company that helped Romania solve its computer problems.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the departments of energy and communication,
and the public sector -- which are the key agencies trying to
avert Y2K problems -- have introduced new computer systems, the
possibility of being affected by the bug has been reduced to the
lowest point.
</P>
<P>
Cernavoda nuclear plant, which has been a major concern of many
regarding Y2K, has recently passed a simulation test, Iliescu
added.
</P>
<P>
Romania has invested more than eight million U.S. dollars in
achieving Y2K compliance.
</P>
<P>
Romania established a national committee on preparing for Y2K
in December last year. Since then the country has achieved a high
degree of compliance because of assistance from the World Bank and
the small number of computer systems operating in the country.

<HEADLINE> NATO New Chief Urges Hungary to Continue Military Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting NATO Secretary-
General George Robertson said here Thursday that NATO's three new
members -- Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland -- should
maintain the pace of their military reforms in order to meet the
requirements of the Western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Orban
Viktor, the former British defense secretary told reporters that
despite its admission by NATO, Hungary still needs to establish a
new defense system and raise its defensive capability.
</P>
<P>
Military reforms are also a task for other NATO member states,
he said, adding that only a small number of these countries' 6,
000 bombers can conduct all-weather flights.
</P>
<P>
Orban said Hungary is carrying out unprecedentedly large-scale
military reforms which focus on army restructuring and its
financial system. He said such reforms would improve the country'
s defense capability.
</P>
<P>
Robertson also held talks with Hungarian President Goncz Arpad
during his two-day working visit here ending Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Robertson will fly to Poland to continue his first tour to all
NATO members since he took office as the NATO chief last month.

<HEADLINE> 29 Killed in Violence in North Maluku, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- At least 29 persons have been
killed and eight more seriously injured in the most recent clashes
between Muslims and Christians in the towns of Soa Siu and Ternate
in North Maluku, Indonesia, local police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Maluku police spokesman Maj. Jekriel Philip said some 14
churches and 275 houses, including 27 owned by police officers,
were also set on fire in the violence.
</P>
<P>
The communal clashes first erupted in the predominantly Muslim
Soa Siu on November 3 and spread to the nearby town of Ternate on
November 6. Ternate is the capital of North Maluku, one of the
country's three newly established provinces.
</P>
<P>
Jekriel said only one man had been arrested by the North Maluku
Police.
</P>
<P>
The situation in both areas was slowly returning to normal, he
was quoted by The Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, the Indonesian Communion of Churches (PGI) Thursday
called on people in the strife-torn Maluku to stop the months of
communal violence.
</P>
<P>
"We call on ulemas, priests and members of all religions to
realize how deep we have been dragged into the wave of
self-destruction," PGI said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It added that people in Maluku were "trapped in a short-term
political interest that was deliberately and sophisticatedly
played by certain groups."
</P>
<P>
The Maluku islands have seen religious violence since the
beginning of the year and as a result, tens of thousands of people
have fled to other provinces.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A potential rematch of the
heavyweight bout between Los Angeles Lakers center Shaquille O'
Neal and Houston Rockets forward Charles Barkley will not take
place on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the original skirmish between two of the NBA's 50
Greatest Players in the Lakers' 89-88 win on Wednesday has
resulted in one-game suspensions for both players. O'Neal also was
fined $10,000 and Barkley $5,000.
</P>
<P>
The teams will completed their home-and-home series on Friday
night in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The Altercation occurred with 9:03 left in the second quarter.
Barkley grabbed a rebound under his own basket and was hit in the
head by O'Neal before firing the ball at O'Neal's head.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal countered with an errant roundhouse left, and Barkley
went low on the big man, trying to lift the 320-pounder by his
legs before the rest of the players on the court jumped into the
mix.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, Charles didn't want to play and he did something
unsportsmanslike and I reacted," O'Neal said after the game. "He
did one of his stupid things and got ejected. I am frustrated at
myself for losing my self-control. He will be the first one to
tell you he's very lucky a couple of guys grabbed me."

<P>
HANOI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The 8th plenum of the Communist
Party of Vietnam Central Committee (CPV CC) decided to give two
high-ranking party cadres disciplinary warning in connection with
their involvement in recent major legal cases.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique issued on Thursday, the plenum
decided to serve warnings to Cao Si Kiem, a CPV CC member, former
governor of the State Bank of Vietnam, and deputy director of the
CPV CC's Commission for Economic Affairs, and Ngo Xuan Loc, a CPV
CC member and deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The plenum, which was convened in Hanoi from November 4 to
November 11, also proposed that the National Assembly relieve Ngo
Xuan Loc of his post as deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
However, the communique gave no details of the cases.
</P>
<P>
Evaluating the implementation of the country's socioeconomic
development plan for 1999, the plenum noted that in face of many
difficulties and challenges, Vietnam has been able to maintain its
political, economic and social stability, continued to register
economic growth, harvested bumper rice crops, overfulfilled the
exports plan and made progress in the hunger elimination and
poverty reduction program.
</P>
<P>
The plenum also recognized that the country has not yet been
able to prevent the slowing down of the economic growth rate and
the quality of economic development and the economy's
competitiveness and efficiency are still low.
</P>
<P>
As for the tasks set for the year 2000, the plenum decided to
make great efforts to stop the slowdown in the economic growth
rate and strive for a higher economic growth rate than in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the direction for preparing documents for the Ninth
Congress of CPV, the plenum agreed on the major issues to be
included in the Political Report, the Socioeconomic Report and the
Report on Revising the Party Statute.

Government advocacy should be strengthened in order to curb the
alarming spread of the disease that has killed about 14 million
people by the end of 1998, the conference said.
</P>
<P>
Eyob Kemil, chief of the Metropolis Health Bureau of Ethiopia,

Although a HIV/AIDS prevention office has been established six
months ago, it has failed to mobilize the public in the fight
against the pandemic, he said.
</P>

Educating the people about HIV/AIDS should be strengthened,
Eyob said, adding that the metropolis will stage a public rally
aimed at raising awareness, and organize panel discussions on the

<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain Thursday urged
Pakistan's military rulers not to stage a show trial of ousted
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and said it would oppose any use of
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement that Pakistan
must respect the rights of Sharif and other ministers arrested in
last month's military coup.
</P>
<P>
Shariff was accused Thursday of hijacking and kidnapping, which
might carry the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Cook, who is in Durban, South Africa, to take part later in the
day at a meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group,
said the trial should be fair and open.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a genuine legal case, then it should be pursued
through due process of law with a fair and open trial before a
civilian court. Britain opposes the use of the death penalty,
whatever the offense," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"A show trial will do nothing to encourage confidence that the
military genuinely intend to restore democracy," Cook said.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Activate Labor Market With 43 Billion Marks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Federal Labor Office
Thursday said it would in the year 2000 spend more than 43 billion
marks (23 U.S. billion dollars) for an "active labor market
policy."
</P>
<P>
The sum grows by 1.6 billion compared with the budget this
year. It is scheduled to be passed next Thursday by the management
council of the office.
</P>
<P>
Aiming to lower the jobless rate over 10 percent, spending of
the Nuremberg-based office in further education and training
programs has grown by 4 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
The decision was backed by Germay's powerful labor union
movements that expected some 1 million new jobs thanks to these
measures.
</P>
<P>
"It is a positive signal for those jobless and those threatened
by jobless," said Ursula Engelen-Kefer, vice chief of the German
Labor Unions' Association (DGB).

<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Steve McManaman has been ruled
out of both legs of England's Euro 2000 play-off against Scotland.
</P>
<P>
McManaman suffered a recurrence of his long-standing groin
injury in training on Wednesday and despite hopes that he might
recover in time for next Wednesday's second leg at Wembley,
further tests have forced him to return to Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Fellow midfielder Ray Parlour took part in England's training
session but will still return to Arsenal for further treatment on
a hamstring problem in the hope that, unlike McManaman, he will be
available for selection at Wembley.
</P>
<P>
The absence of McManaman means that Kevin Keegan is likely to
turn to Phil Neville or possibly Steve Guppy as his left wing-back
if, as expected, he chooses to employ a back three formation at
Hampden on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Villa Chairman Hits Back at Rumor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- "Appalled" Aston Villa chairman
Doug Ellis has hit back at rumors that he went behind his manager'
s back and made a three million pounds bid for two Peterborough
United players.
</P>
<P>
Reports suggested that Ellis approached the Division Three club
and inquired about talented youngsters Matthew Etherington and
Simon Davies without the knowledge of Villa boss John Gregory.
</P>
<P>
But a statement from Ellis explained: "I am absolutely appalled
at this article which seeks to suggest I had a clear-the-air
meeting with John following a bid I had supposedly made."
</P>
<P>
It added: "The article is without any foundation whatsoever.
Indeed I was so incensed by comments attributed to Barry Fry (
Peterborough manager) that I spoke to him personally this morning.
</P>
<P>
"In his own inimitable way he was spitting expletives that his
name should be used to substantiate a totally fabricated approach.
</P>
<P>
"He confirmed to me that he had never spoken to the journalist
concerned and he reaffirms he has not had any contact with me
whatsoever regarding any of his players."
</P>
<P>
Ellis was said to have made the offer after watching
Etherington- linked earlier in the season with Manchester United -
and Davies in action in Peterborough's recent league clash at
Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
But the chairman added: "My recent visit to Sincil Bank was the
result of my chairmanship of the Technical Control Board and
followed an invitation by the Lincoln chairman, John Reames, to
see their school of excellence.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover my meeting yesterday with John Gregory was a
perfectly normal run-of-the-mill meeting which we have on a
regular basis every week."
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation about Gregory's future as manager of
Villa after a run of just two points from six games has sent them
slipping into the bottom half of the Premiership.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed With Dow Falling Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended
mixed Thursday as investors were worried about inflation and
enthusiastic over the technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 2.44 at 10,595.30,
expanding its loss of 19.58 points Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 8.00 at 1,381.46 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 41.33 at 3,197.29, setting its ninth
record in the past 10 tradings.
</P>
<P>
With a higher-than-expected 0.3 percent rise in the core rate
of inflation in October, investors were still worried about the
possibility of rising interest rates. The fears of higher rates
sank the Dow Wednesday and dragged the blue chip index lower again
today.
</P>
<P>
But investors enthused over the good performance of high tech
companies, pushing the Nasdaq index higher. Dell Computer rose in
expectation of better earnings to be released after the close of
session while Tandy Corp., the parent company of Radio Shack, also
moved higher after Microsoft announced its decision to set up
retail areas in up to 7,000 Radio Shack stores and invest 100
million U.S. dollars in RadioShack.com.
</P>
<P>
New issues of stock performed well. Charter Communications
continued to rise on the Nasdaq after it made its initial public
offering Wednesday. United Parcel Service rose after it debuted in
the largest domestic IPO in history Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 0.37 at 629.39 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 3.42 at 819.23. But the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 1.23 at 447.49.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,753 down, 1,271 up and 517
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 871.24 million shares from 981.29
million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Trading was halted briefly in the morning to observe the
Veterans Day on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. The bond
market was closed in observance of the day.

<HEADLINE> UK Hereditary Peers Bid Farewell to Lords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of hereditary peers
bid farewell to the House of Lords Thursday, marking the end of
800 years of Britain's parliamentary tradition.
</P>
<P>
The passing of the House of Lords Bill marked the last day of
work for 600 hereditary peers. The proceedings to push through the
bill took less than two hours, without a final vote.
</P>
<P>
Some peers were close to tears in the somber atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The House of Lords adjourned for 40 minutes for the bill to
receive Royal assent and this was followed by the formal closing
of the parliamentary session.
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise agreed by the House of Commons, 92
hereditary peers will stay in a transitional chamber. They will
stay on in the House of Lords with about 500 other life peers,
appointed by governments over the last 40 years, whose position is
unaffected.
</P>
<P>
Lords Leader Baroness Jay paid tribute to the hundreds of years
of service hereditaries and their ancestors had given Parliament.
</P>
<P>
"In this house, hereditary peers have served honorably and held
the highest office. Throughout the centuries they served this
nation with distinction," Jay, leader of the ruling Labor Party in
the House of Lords, told the assembled peers.
</P>
<P>
But she said the forces of tradition had to give way to
modernization of Britain's democracy.
</P>
<P>
Blair has appointed a Royal Commission to look into its future,
which reports in December. According to press leaks it will
recommend that only a small proportion of the upper house should
be elected, a formula which has already been bitterly criticized
by pro-democracy campaigners.

language, religion and history.
</P>
<P>

most Latin American countries will gather in Havana for the annual
Ibero American Summit.

UNITED NATIONS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Thursday once
again requested U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to intervene
with the United States and Britain and the countries that provide
facilities for continuing violation of its airspace.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Annan, Iraq's Ambassador to the United Nations,
Saeed Hasan said violations of Iraq's airspace by the United
States and British aircraft based in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
Turkey continued and the aircraft in question engaged in acts of
aggression, reconnaissance activities and acts of provocation.
</P>
<P>
These actions are continuing to bring death and injury to
hundreds of civilians and to cause serious damage to private and
public property, Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
These aggression actions are flagrant violations of the Charter
of the United Nations and of international law, posing threat to
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.N. chief to intervene with these countries, with
a view to bringing a halt to the actions.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas in
Colombia kidnapped six journalists and a cameraman in Cesar
department, north of the country, the local radio RCN said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The journalists were kindnapped Wednesday in Atanquez
municipality while they were looking for reports about an
incursion of rightest paramilitaries in the area, affirmed the
radio station.
</P>
<P>
Radio RCN attributed the capture of the journalists to front
rank 59 of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the
main insurgent group in the country.
</P>
<P>
The source identified the victims as three correspondents and
three cameramen of the television news program CM&AMP;, TV channels RCN
and Caracol and the daily El Pilon.
</P>
<P>
The insurgents didn't explain reasons for their kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
Last October 29 at Barrancabermeja oil port (Santander
department), the FARC kidnapped seven journalists in order to
denounce paramilitary activities in Magdalena Medio zone and freed
them five days later.
</P>
<P>
Another guerilla group, the National Liberation Army, held for
nine days in Valle del Cauca department Reuters photographer Henry
Romero and freed him on November 3.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappings and pressures to journalists were repudiated
last week by around 30 communication media that signed a
"discretion accord" for dealing moderately with reports on
Colombian conflicts.

<HEADLINE> New York Students Adopt School in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Students at a small private
international school in Manhattan, central New York City, have
launched a program to "adopt" an impoverished school and its
students and teachers in NATO-bombed Kosovo, the Yugoslav
province.
</P>
<P>
With help from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP),
students at the Dwight School plan a first winter emergency
shipment of coats and computers for Thanksgiving to the Gjin
Gazulli electro-technical school, which is just outside Pristina,
capital of the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
The school is struggling to provide education for almost 1,100
Kosovo youths aged 14-18. As winter closes in, there is no money
for fuel to heat the school building, no insufficient clothing for
the students and teachers shivering inside and almost no library
books.
</P>
<P>
Laboratory equipment is in short supply and there are no
computers. The school, like others serving ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo, was among the schools under the 78-day air strike by NATO,
beginning on March 24.
</P>
<P>
A small group of students in Dwight, on Manhattan's west side,
initiated the project with the help of their science teacher Evan
Flamenbaum, UNDP officials said.
</P>
<P>
The students are members of the school's International Fellows
club. Dwight has 380 students, of whom 40 percent are nationals of
countries other than the United States.
