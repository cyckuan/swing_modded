	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Police issued a nationwide postal
alert after finding 21 more parcel bombs at a Canberra mail
processing center where a bomb exploded early Wednesday morning.
	   A postal worker was slightly injured by shrapnel when a package
detonated. A search of the building found 21 more bombs.
	   Police ruled out a political or diplomatic link to the bombs.
	   Sources close to the investigation said the matter was related
to a personal dispute. Staff at the Australian Tax Office were
warned not to open any suspicious packages.
	   Australian Federal Police said an identical parcel bomb was
discovered in Sydney on Tuesday, taking to 23 in all the number of
bombs found so far.
	   The Sydney parcel was detonated by bomb squad police after the
person to whom it was delivered became suspicious.
	   Federal Police Superintendent Geoff Hazel said the bomber
targeted a specific segment of the community but he declined to
identify them publicly for fear of compromising the investigation.
	   The parcels are white and similar in size to a computer disc
storage box, bearing a 2-dollar stamp and a 30-cent stamp.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Police on Wednesday warned all 17,000
Australian tax officials to beware of letter bombs after one
exploded in a post office, slightly injuring a worker, and 21 more
were found by postal workers.
	   Tax Commissioner Michael Carmody said he was taking steps to
ensure his employees' safety after parcel bombs were found
addressed to the homes of 23 staff, including very senior officers.
	   ``We want to take precautions to make sure no staff members are
put at risk,'' he said.
	   Carmody refused to say whether he was one of the Australian
Taxation Office officers targeted.
	   Australian Federal Police Superintendent Geoff Hazel said, ``Any
explosive, no matter how small, in the right situation, could kill
you.''
	   Another letter bomb was found Tuesday in Sydney. It was
detonated by bomb squad police after the person to whom it was
delivered became suspicious.
	   A postal worker was slightly injured by shrapnel when a package
detonated after being thrown into a sorting bin Wednesday morning
in Canberra.
	   The parcels are white and similar in size to a storage box that
would hold five computer discs, bearing a 2-dollar stamp and a
30-cent stamp.
	   All items in the Canberra Mail Center, totaling about one
million, were being examined by Australia Post after Wednesday
morning's letter bomb blast.

Pinochet's wealthy neighbors prepare for attention and security

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet has moved under guard into
an exclusive community of business leaders and stockbrokers,
raising concerns among his wealthy neighbors that demonstrators and
police patrols will soon be invading the neighborhood.
	   Pinochet, who is fighting extradition to Spain on genocide and
terrorism charges, moved into Wentworth Estate on Tuesday, a day
after he was released from a hospital.
	   ``My first reaction when I heard the rumors was, 'Oh, God, how
safe is it going to be to live here?''' a female neighbor, speaking
on condition of anonymity, told The Times.
	   The Sun reported in Wednesday's editions that the resident
association of the neighborhood, a compound of 600 luxury homes set
amid a famed golf course and woodlands, planned to meet soon to
discuss the security implications of their newest neighbor.
	   Pinochet, 83, arrived after dark Tuesday at a nine-room private
home, located about 20 miles (30 kms) west of London, in an
ambulance escorted by armed police. The owner of the home was not
immediately known.
	   Pinochet was forced to find a place to stay while he fights
extradition after the Grovelands Priory, the north London hospital
where the general had been staying since Oct. 29, publicly
announced Monday that he no longer required medical care and should
find new accommodations immediately.
	   ``I can confirm that General Pinochet is now in residence in a
house in the Wentworth estate,'' North Surrey police chief Carl
Crathern said. ``I am unable to discuss the details regarding any
of the security arrangements that are in place.''
	   While there was no word on who owns the home, British newspapers
reported Wednesday that the owner insisted Pinochet's supporters
take out insurance on bomb, rocket and firearm damage.
	   Pinochet, who was arrested Oct. 16 in a central London hospital
where he had undergone back surgery, is wanted by a Spanish judge
to stand trial over the deaths and torture of political opponents
by secret police during his 1973-90 rule.
	   Britain's Home Secretary Jack Straw must decide by Dec. 11
whether to let extradition proceedings start, or send Pinochet
home.
	   Even if Straw blocks the extradition, Spain is expected to use
the only form of appeal open to it _ a judicial review of Straw's
decision. If Straw sends the extradition request forward, the court
battle could last for months, since British law allows Pinochet to
appeal at every step.
	   Chile's government has stepped up efforts to get Pinochet freed.
In Spain, Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza concluded a
lobbying trip Tuesday to press Britain and Spain to halt the
extradition effort.
	   While he stopped short of promising a trial for Pinochet in
Chilean courts, Insulza insisted that it was a strong possibility.
Meanwhile, about 85 Pinochet supporters were expected to arrive in
London from Chile on Wednesday to continue the lobbying.
	   Human rights activists and leftist politicians in Chile,
however, dismissed talk of a trial for Pinochet at home, saying the
general's immunity and military connections made a fair trial there
unlikely. They urged Britain not to let Pinochet go. And
demonstrations, previously held outside the hospital, were expected
to continue near the Wentworth Estate.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the police after Pinochet seized power
in a military coup that toppled democratically elected Marxist
President Salvador Allende.

Grenadian leader dismisses Parliament but gives no election date

<TEXT>
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Faced with loss of control of
Parliament and claims of nepotism, corruption and a threat to kill
a political opponent, Prime Minister Keith Mitchell effectively
dismissed Grenada's legislature Tuesday.
	   He did not set a date for new elections. But his announcement on
national television means people in the former British Caribbean
colony must go to the polls within 90 days.
	   Mitchell's announcement came two days after Foreign and Legal
Affairs Minister Raphael Fletcher resigned, charging that
government contracts at inflated prices were improperly being given
to friends and supporters of the government.
	   Mitchell has accused Fletcher of being backed by Libya in a
sinister plot to bring down the government and have himself elected
prime minister.
	   In addition, Fletcher is now under police guard following a
radio report that the government had ordered him killed.
	   Both men have denied all the allegations.
	   Neverthelesss, the suggestion of a Libyan connection has raised
fears that the United States, which has declared Libya a terrorist
state, might block aid to Grenada through international agencies
like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
	   In 1979, the United States invaded Grenada in the chaos
surrounding a failed Marxist revolution, saying the island was in
danger of becoming a satellite of Cuba.
	   Tuesday night, Mitchell formally asked the Gov. General, Sir
Daniel Williams, to dissolve the Parliament, a formality. Williams
is the representative of Britain's monarch in this independent
country, which is part of the Commonwealth of former British
colonies.
	   While Mitchell mentioned no election date, business sources
close to the prime minister, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said elections could be held within three weeks.
	   Fletcher's resignation, combined with the simultaneous defection
of a legislator to an opposition party, left Mitchell with control
of only seven of the 15 seats in Parliament.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Arab was stabbed to death Wednesday in
Jerusalem and Israeli police say they are investigating the
possibility that the killer was an Israeli who has already murdered
one Arab and wounded five.
	   ``There are a number of items of evidence on the scene of the
crime which suggests that the motive for the crime was
nationalist,'' said Jerusalem police commander Yair Yitzhaki.
	   The victim, aged 41, was not immediately identified.
	   The murder took place in Abu-Tor, a mixed Arab and Jewish
neighborhood on the border between east and west Jerusalem.
	   The victim lived close to the scene of the murder and was
walking to work when he was stabbed. Before dying he told a family
member his attacker was wearing a mask, Israel radio reported.
	   In the past year six east Jerusalem Arabs have been stabbed, one
fatally, while walking to work in the Jewish neighborhood of Mea
Shearim. The killer has not been caught. Police are investigating
whether the killer in Abu-Tor was the same person, Yitzhaki said.

Mexican governor makes first offer of talks with EPR rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OAXACA, Mexico (AP) _ The new governor of southern Oaxaca state
has offered to start talks with the leftist Popular Revolutionary
Army, a small guerrilla group that federal officials have refused
to negotiate with for more than two years.
	   During his inaugural address Tuesday, Gov. Jose Murat Casab said
the rebels would have to renounce violence _ including attacks
against police and army patrols _ for talks to start.
	   ``The government's door will be open to start a serious and
respectful dialogue, under whatever mechanisms necessary ... as
long as any violent attitude is discarded and the law is
respected,'' Murat said.
	   ``I invite them to join with us to seek just and dignified
agreements, find political, economic and social alternatives,'' he
said.
	   Since the Popular Revolutionary Army, known by its initials in
Spanish as the EPR, first appeared in June 1996, the federal
government has called the group ``common criminals'' and refused to
negotiate with them.
	   The group is not related to the leftist rebels with whom the
government has held sporadic negotiations in Chiapas state.
	   The EPR has been blamed for the killings of dozens of soldiers
and police in Oaxaca and neighboring Guerrero state over the last
two years.
	   State police and army troops have also been accused of human
rights violations in raids against presumed rebel support bases in
the mountains of Oaxaca.
	   Murat _ whose predecessor was also a member of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party but who refused to talk with
rebels _ did not say whether he would continue such raids.

Anwar trial disrupted by contempt hearing against lawyer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with lawyer apologizing, trial resuming,
other details and background &QL; 
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The trial of jailed politician
Anwar Ibrahim was put on hold briefly Wednesday as the judge turned
his attention to a second defense lawyer who accused prosecutors of
fabricating evidence against Anwar.
	   Manjeet Singh Dhillon, charged with contempt of court,
represents Anwar's former tennis partner, Nallakaruppan Solaimalai.
Nalla, as he is called, is charged with possession of ammunition,
which carries a mandatory death sentence.
	   Nalla was detained under the Internal Security Act just before
Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest.
	   On Monday, a warrant was issued by the court for Manjeet Singh
after he wrote a letter accusing prosecutors of trying to force
Nalla into a plea bargain by giving false evidence against Anwar
about alleged sexual trysts.
	   Manjeet Singh quickly apologized Wednesday. High Court Judge
Augustine Paul accepted the apology and resumed the trial, which is
now in its fourth week.
	   Attorney General Mohtar Abdullah said he was dropping charges
against Manjeet Singh because he had restored the honor of the
prosecutors with his apology.
	   ``My honor and my life both go in one,'' Mohtar said, quoting
Shakespeare. ``Take my honor and you take my life.''
	   Manjeet Singh's letter formed the basis for an affidavit for
which Zainur Zakaria, a prominent lawyer on Anwar's defense team,
has been sentenced to three months in jail.
	   Paul found Zainur in contempt for having maligned the two top
prosecutors in the Anwar case. Zainur, who rejected Paul's demand
that he apologize, will go to jail if he loses his appeal hearing
on Friday.
	   Authorities say 125 bullets were found in Nalla's house during a
police investigation of allegations published in the book, ``Fifty
Reasons Why Anwar Ibrahim Cannot Become Prime Minister.''
	   The book alleges that Nalla set up sexual flings for Anwar while
the 51-year-old politician was still deputy prime minister and heir
apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Proceedings against Nalla are separate from Anwar's trial.
	   Anwar faces four counts of abuse of office. He will face trial
later for one more charge of corruption and five counts of illegal
sex acts.
	   Both Anwar and Nalla deny the charges against them.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar Sept. 2, saying he had conducted his own
investigation and determined Anwar was morally unfit to lead the
country.
	   Anwar's sacking led to his demands for political reforms and
dozens of anti-government protests, rocking the normally placid
Southeast Asian capital.
	   His jailing and beating while in police custody have drawn
international attention to the case, which is being monitored by
foreign media, diplomats and human rights activists.
	   The proceedings against Zainur and Manjeet Singh, both eminent
defense attorneys and former presidents of the Malaysian Bar
Council, have stunned the legal community.

Cathay Pacific pulls out of talks with Philippine Airlines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways
said Wednesday it is pulling out of negotiations for a possible
buy-in of ailing Philippine Airlines.
	   ``We're not willing to continue negotiations with PAL in its
current form,'' said Peter Foster, Cathay Pacific's regional
manager for the Philippines and Taiwan.
	   ``We're very sad. We tried very hard to make it work,'' Foster
told The Associated Press.
	   He declined to cite any reason but said the company would
explain its decision in a statement to be released later Wednesday
by Cathay Pacific's head office in Hong Kong.
	   PAL earlier accepted a preliminary investment offer from Cathay
Pacific, and the companies announced Nov. 10 that they would draw
up a comprehensive plan to rehabilitate the debt-laden Philippine
flag carrier.
	   Since then, the companies have had disagreements over management
control of PAL and the number of PAL workers to be laid off,
according to Philippine government officials.
	   PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 after failing to
persuade its largest union to accept a management-proposed recovery
plan under which their collective bargaining agreement would be
suspended for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent share of the
company's stock.
	   The union later decided to accept the plan, allowing PAL to
resume domestic flights on Oct. 7 and international flights later.
As part of the plan, the union agreed to allow an unspecified
number of workers to be retrenched as long as the laid-off workers
get separation benefits agreed by both sides.
	   In June, PAL was embroiled in a crippling three-week pilots'
strike that brought the company close to financial ruin. At the
height of the strike, PAL laid off 5,000 of its 13,000 workers to
minimize its losses.
	   PAL says it is unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of
debt due to mounting losses worsened by its labor problems and
Asia's currency crisis.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Arab was stabbed to death Wednesday in
Jerusalem and Israeli police say they are investigating the
possibility that the killer was an Israeli who has already murdered
one Arab and wounded five.
	   ``There are a number of items of evidence on the scene of the
crime which suggests that the motive for the crime was
nationalist,'' said Jerusalem police commander Yair Yitzhaki.
	   The victim was Osama Musa Natche, 41, a Jerusalem city cleaning
worker and a father of six children.
	   The murder took place in Abu-Tor, a mixed Arab and Jewish
neighborhood on the border between east and west Jerusalem.
	   The victim lived close to the scene of the murder and was
walking to work when he was stabbed. Before dying he told a family
member his attacker was wearing a mask, Israel radio reported.
	   ``A masked man jumped out from behind a bus and stabbed him
several times,'' his cousin Abd el-Raouf Natche told Israeli army
radio.
	   In the past year six east Jerusalem Arabs have been stabbed, one
fatally, while walking to work in the Jewish neighborhood of Mea
Shearim.
	   Police believe the same person committed all six stabbings and
that he is an Israeli Jewish nationalist. The police are
investigating whether the killer in Abu-Tor was the same person,
Yitzhaki said.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways
said Wednesday it is pulling out of negotiations for a possible
buy-in of ailing Philippine Airlines.

flag carrier.
	   Since then, the companies have had disagreements over management
control of PAL and the number of PAL workers to be laid off,
according to Philippine government officials.
	   President Joseph Estrada said he would try to arrange a meeting
of the two airlines and convince them to resume negotiations.
	   ``As much as PAL is the flag carrier, we should see to it that
PAL will always fly. If PAL will close down, so many businesses
will be affected,'' Estrada said.
	   Estrada's executive secretary, Ronaldo Zamora, earlier said
PAL's chairman and chief stockholder, Lucio Tan, has gone to the
United States to try to resume negotiations with Northwest
Airlines, one of PAL's prospective investors.
	   In another blow for Tan, the Philippine government filed tax
evasion charges Tuesday accusing the tycoon of nine counts of tax
evasion and seeking a total of 25.6 billion pesos (dlrs 653
million) in unpaid taxes in relation to another holding, Fortune
Tobacco Corp.
	   PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 after failing to

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Arab man was stabbed to death as he walked
to work Wednesday, possible by a Jewish assailant who is suspected
in a string of attacks on Arabs, police said.
	   ``There are a number of items of evidence on the scene of the
crime which suggests that the motive for the crime was
nationalist,'' said Jerusalem police commander Yair Yitzhaki.
	   The victim was Osama Musa Natche, 41, a Jerusalem city cleaning

	   The murder took place in Abu-Tor, a mixed Arab and Jewish
neighborhood on the border between east and west Jerusalem. Natche,
who lived close to the scene of the killing, told a family member
before he died that the attacker was wearing a mask, Israel radio
reported.
	   ``A masked man jumped out from behind a bus and stabbed him
several times,'' his cousin Abd el-Raouf Natche told Israeli army
radio.
	   Six Arab residents of east Jerusalem have been stabbed over the
past year, one fatally, while walking to work in the Jewish
neighborhood of Mea Shearim.
	   Police say an Israeli Jewish nationalist committed all six
stabbings, and were investigating whether the killer in Abu-Tor was
the same person, Yitzhaki said.

minor league pitcher Arnold Gooch.
	   Another free agent, catcher Carlos Hernandez, was close to a
two-year contract with San Diego worth about dlrs 10 million.
	   A source familiar with the Ventura negotiations, speaking on

contract with the Mets worth dlrs 8 million annually and said it

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Tightly wrapped against the cold that
seeps through the damp walls of Kabul's children's hospital,
4-month-old Aminullah struggles to survive.
	   Doctors say the malnourished boy, who is barely the size of a
newborn, has little chance of making it through the frigid Afghan
winter, when temperatures sink well below freezing.
	   The winter will be much harder this year after international aid
groups pulled out of the capital city rather than follow rules
imposed by the Taliban religious army.
	   ``I don't know what to do. ... He is so hungry,'' says
Aminullah's mother, Huzra, as she rocks him gently back and forth
at the Indira Gandhi Hospital, a multi-story cement building where
the wind whistles through the cold hallways.
	   The hospital has few supplies. The pharmacy is bare. The only
ambulance has been locked away on the compound of one of the many
aid groups that left the city earlier this year.
	   After two decades of war in Afghanistan, Kabul is a desperate
city. Entire neighborhoods lie in ruin. Food stalls in the market
are often full, but too expensive for the poorest.
	   The glucose drip attached to Aminullah's hand was bought in the
market and the dirty woolen blanket Huzra pulls tightly around her
shoulders was brought from her home in the ruins of Kabul.
	   In front of the Ministry of Public Health, workers load about a
dozen pieces of firewood onto a battered steel food trolley and
push it a little over a mile (two kilometers) to the children's
hospital.
	   ``Every day the children are complaining that they are cold ...
but we have no fuel, no wood, nothing,'' says hospital
administrator Maulvi Hajji Nasruddin. ``We have no way to get
anything. ... We have only God.''
	   In July, dozens of aid groups pulled out of Kabul to protest a
Taliban order forcing them to relocate to abandoned school
dormitories.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Police on Wednesday warned all 17,000
Australian tax officials to beware of letter bombs after one
exploded in a post office, slightly injuring a worker, and 21 more
were found by postal workers.
	   Tax Commissioner Michael Carmody said he was taking steps to
ensure his employees' safety after parcel bombs were found
addressed to the homes of 23 staff, including very senior officers.
	   ``We want to take precautions to make sure no staff members are
put at risk,'' he said.
	   Carmody refused to say whether he was one of the Australian
Taxation Office officers targeted.
	   Australian Federal Police Superintendent Geoff Hazel said, ``Any
explosive, no matter how small, in the right situation, could kill
you.''
	   Another letter bomb was found Tuesday in Sydney. It was
detonated by bomb squad police after the person to whom it was
delivered became suspicious.
	   A postal worker was slightly injured by shrapnel when a package
detonated after being thrown into a sorting bin Wednesday morning
in Canberra.
	   The parcels are white and similar in size to a storage box that
would hold five computer discs, bearing a 2-dollar stamp and a
30-cent stamp.
	   All items in the Canberra Mail Center, totaling about one
million, were being examined by Australia Post after Wednesday
morning's letter bomb blast.

Troops on guard in Indonesian provincial capital after mosques
</HEADLINE>
burned
 &UR; By SAM MARTINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUPANG, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of troops and police Wednesday
guarded a troubled provincial capital where rioters burned and
ransacked 15 mosques.
	   There were no reports of new unrest in Christian-dominated
Kupang, the latest site of religious violence in the world's most
populous Muslim nation.
	   The riots on Monday raised fears that attacks on places of
worship will escalate in Indonesia, which has already endured
sporadic outbreaks of unrest because of economic and political
turmoil.
	   In apparent retaliation, Muslim mobs on Tuesday smashed windows
of two houses where Christians worshipped in Banjarsari, 155 miles
(250 kilometers) southeast of Jakarta.
	   The violence in Kupang, the capital of East Nusa Tenggara
province, disrupted commerce as many traders shut their shops for
fear of widespread looting.
	   Truck drivers stayed away from the docks, leaving sacks of rice
unloaded in shipholds. The Christian-dominated city of 120,000
people lies 1,875 kilometers (1,172 miles) southeast of Jakarta in
a poor, arid region.
	   The Kompas daily newspaper said staple foods such as rice and
noodles were scarce and that shoppers in the marketplace could not
find fresh vegetables.
	   Frightened Muslims with sickles and swords guarded their homes
and mosques.
	   The attacks on Kupang's mosques were in retaliation for the
burning and ransacking of 22 churches by Muslim mobs in Jakarta on
Nov. 22, when 14 people were killed, some hacked to death.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
with the rest following Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or other faiths.
Some cities in the sprawling archipelago nation have Christian
majorities.
	   Police said they had detained alleged instigators of Monday's
rioting, but did not say how many people were being questioned.
	   The military, its credibility sagging because of human rights
abuses, is overstretched as it tries to keep order across the
turbulent Southeast Asian nation.
	   Islamic leaders have urged their followers not to retaliate with
more violence.
	   Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the
national philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia
declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.

Philippine exports plunge 8.7 percent in October
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Philippines registering balance of payments
surplus in last 4 grafs

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ In the first major slump in
Philippine exports since the start of Asia's currency crisis,
exports shrank 8.7 percent in October from the previous month to
dlrs 2.542 billion, the government announced Wednesday.
	   Export growth was also sharply lower on an annual basis,
dropping to 9.3 percent in October from 19 percent in September,
the National Statistics Office said.
	   The Philippines had enjoyed annual export growth of more than 20
percent for much of the past several years, showing remarkable
resilience to the effects of the 17-month-old currency crisis.
	   But economists said they expected a slowdown in export growth
because of weaker worldwide demand following the slowdown in the
global economy.
	   Luz Lorenzo, economist for ATR Securities Inc., said the
Philippines also faces increased competition from Asian neighbors
who are making efforts to increase exports to recover from the
regional financial crisis.
	   ``We may have to share our gains with our neighbors,'' she said.
	   Joey Cuyegkeng, economist for ING Barings Securities Philippines
Inc., also blamed the agricultural sector for the slowdown in
export growth.
	   Agricultural production contracted 3.1 percent in the third
quarter of this year because of the aftereffects of a prolonged
drought which was followed by strong typhoons.
	   For the first 10 months of the year, exports rose 18 percent to
dlrs 24.39 billion, the statistics office said.
	   Lorenzo said she expects Philippine export growth will slip to
16 percent for the entire year compared to the 1997 level.
	   Electronics and components accounted for 56 percent of total
October exports, grossing dlrs 1.43 billion, 32 percent more than
the year-earlier level.
	   The second top export category was garments, which generated
dlrs 165 million, down 1.4 percent from the year-earlier level.
	   Computer parts and peripherals accounted for dlrs 127.1 million
of October exports, 18 percent less than a year before.
	   The United States remained the country's top export destination,
accounting for 33 percent of total October shipments, or dlrs 849.5
million, 6.7 more higher than the year-earlier level.
	   Japan followed with a 14 percent share totaling dlrs 351.2
million, 12 percent less than the year-earlier level, a reflection
of Japan's weakening economy.
	   The government announces import figures separately each month.
	   According to preliminary data from the central bank Wednesday,
the Philippines posted a balance-of-payments surplus of dlrs 935
million in the first eight months of the year.
	   The payments surplus swung from a dlrs 1.77 billion deficit in
the same period a year ago.
	   The balance of payments measures the flow of resources between
the domestic economy and the rest of the world. Its main components
are the current account, which covers the trade balance, and the
capital account, which includes stock investments.
	   The turnaround in the balance-of-payments account was made
possible by a dlrs 38 million current-account surplus in the eight
months through August, also a reversal from the year-earlier
period's deficit of dlrs 3.4 billion.

Commune stirs controversy over lifestyle, allegations of abuse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARI YAMAGUCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TSU, Japan (AP) _ As birds chirp in the soft morning sun, a
dozen high school girls wearing baggy, indigo trousers plant
onions. Boys harvest spinach in a nearby greenhouse.
	   The farm is the centerpiece of the Yamagishi-ism Society, a
fast-growing communal group whose followers share their harvests,
renounce all personal possessions and claim to strive only for the
common goals of friendship and harmony.
	   But the rapid growth of the society is generating very little
harmony outside of its communes and renewing concerns about the
popularity of cults and cult-like groups despite a cult-led nerve
gas attack on Tokyo's subways just a few years ago.
	   Leaders of the Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth) cult masterminded
a nerve-gas attack on the Tokyo subways in 1995. A dozen people
died and thousands were sickened.
	   Sociologist Kimiaki Nishida, a professor at Shizuoka University
and an expert on cults, said Japan's prolonged economic slump has
created the perfect climate for cults. Disillusioned by harsh
economic realities, he said, people are more willing to join cults
or tightly organized groups outside of the mainstream.
	   About 5,000 people, half of them children, live in nearly 40
Yamagishi communes throughout Japan. Another 30,000 members live
outside the communes. The group also has communes in Brazil,
Switzerland, Germany, the United States, Thailand, Australia and
South Korea.
	   The communes were founded by Miyozo Yamagishi, a chicken farmer
who established it in 1952 as a non-religious entity aiming at the
creation of a rural utopia.
	   The group strongly denies being a cult, and does not profess any
specific religious beliefs.
	   ``We are like a big family,'' said Yamagishi spokesman Yoshiaki
Hori.
	   Not all agree with that.
	   ``They are dangerous,'' Nishida said. ``If pressured, they could
go the same way that Aum went.''
	   Yamagishi is not new.
	   It has long been a well-known name in Japan because its dairy
products and vegetables are sold widely from the back of vans or in
the food section at upscale department stores. Yamagishi's annual
sales total nearly 20 billion yen (dlrs 170 million).
	   But a series of former followers have come forth recently saying
the utopian image the group tries to cultivate is a sham.
	   They say members are closely controlled and forced into a life
of secrecy, subservience and often abuse.
	   Followers must leave their family, donate all their savings,
real estate and other assets to the commune to earn full-fledged
membership. Children age five or older are separated from their
parents and live in dorms, where they sleep two-to-a-bed.
	   After nine years of education at public schools, most are given
farming or cattle raising assignments on a commune. Boys and girls
are strictly separated.
	   No one is paid for their work, and everything in the commune is
free.
	   Long-simmering tensions with villagers near Yamagishi projects
came under the national spotlight this summer after Yamagishi asked
government approval to build a school inside its Toyosato commune
on the fringes of this rural city in central Japan.
	   The request brought a wave of protests from social activists,
and led to public hearings and a government investigation into
allegations of child abuse.
	   In March, a group of lawyers said they had found evidence that
some 30 children living at a different commune in Hiroshima were
abused.
	   The children were sent to work in the fields without breakfast
before going to school, and constantly complained of hunger during
class, Hiroshima Bar Association Chairman Hiroshi Kurata said in a
statement.
	   Some teachers at their school allegedly saw the children chewing
fish bait and rubber bands.
	   Kurata said children were also put into solitary confinement,
slapped in the face or kicked in the legs for minor offenses.
Letters to the children were inspected, and they were deprived of
freedom to write or call relatives without allowances to do so, the
bar association said.
	   Yamagishi denied all allegations.
	   ``People may say many things, but that is totally untrue,'' said
spokesman Hori.
	   Yamagishi's communes are not closed to the media, but tours are
strictly guided and screened.
	   During one recent tour, Hirokazu Shinohata, 31, was presented to
a reporter as a typical commune member.
	   He said he joined the commune a year after quitting his
engineering job at a major construction company.
	   ``I constantly suppressed my feelings to perform company
duties,'' he said, adding that he was disgusted by the industry's
bid-rigging and bribery scandals.
	   ``Now I seldom get mad,'' he said. ``I live in paradise.''

Arab killed in Jerusalem. Police suspect killer is Israeli
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Arab man was stabbed to death as he walked
to work Wednesday, possible by a Jewish assailant who is suspected
in a string of attacks on Arabs, police said.
	   ``There are a number of items of evidence on the scene of the
crime which suggests that the motive for the crime was
nationalist,'' said Jerusalem police commander Yair Yitzhaki.
	   The victim was Osama Musa Natche, 41, a Jerusalem city cleaning
worker and a father of six children.
	   The murder took place in Abu-Tor, a mixed Arab and Jewish
neighborhood on the border between east and west Jerusalem. Natche,
who lived close to the scene of the killing, told a family member
before he died that the attacker was wearing a mask, Israel radio
reported.
	   ``A masked man jumped out from behind a bus and stabbed him
several times,'' his cousin Abd el-Raouf Natche told Israeli army
radio.
	   Six Arab residents of east Jerusalem have been stabbed over the
past year, one fatally, while walking to work in the Jewish
neighborhood of Mea Shearim.
	   Police say an Israeli Jewish nationalist committed all six
stabbings, and were investigating whether the killer in Abu-Tor was
the same person, Yitzhaki said.

Drug smuggler killed in clash with police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ One drug smuggler was killed and five others
arrested in clashes with anti-narcotics police in northern
Mazandaran province, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
	   Police seized 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of narcotics and broke
up four drug-trafficking rings, the agency reported late Tuesday.
It did not identify the drugs.
	   The confrontations took place Sunday and Monday, the agency
said.
	   Large drug hauls are common in Iran, which launched a major
crackdown against drugs in 1988. Hundreds of traffickers have been
killed, detained or executed since then.
	   Iran lies on a route used by traffickers to transport drugs such
as opium, hashish and heroin from Afghanistan and Pakistan to
markets in the Gulf and Europe.

Dollar lower against yen at mid-afternoon, stocks up moderately

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, mid-afternoon dollar, bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen Wednesday
following its slip on overseas markets, while Japanese stocks
rebounded for the first time in four trading days.
	   The dollar bought 121.74 yen at mid-afternoon, down 1.17 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 122.17 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 151.21
points, or 1.02 percent, ending the day at 14,986.62. On Tuesday,
the Nikkei closed down 48.29 points, or 0.32 percent.
	   The dollar lost ground in the absence of fresh market-moving
news after sliding in New York following a report that showed U.S.
manufacturing down for a sixth consecutive month in November.
	   On the stock market, share prices rose, but most investors
remained on the sidelines to monitor parliamentary debate on a
government-sponsored supplementary budget to spur the nation's
sagging economy.
	   Market players said trading was stuck in a narrow range amid a
lack of fresh news on the government's economic policies.
	   Investors also were reluctant to make significant moves ahead of
the sale of shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. and next
week's ``special quotation'' settlement of December futures and
options, which often forces the market to move erratically, traders
said.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 4.89 points, or 0.43 percent, to 1,147.15. The TOPIX
closed down 1.24 points, or 0.11 percent, the day before.
	   The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond was
quoted at 1.155 percent, up from Tuesday's close of 1.140 percent,
driving its price down to 105.53 yen from the previous day's
105.68.

Delegation representing world parliaments blocked in Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SURAYA ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A team representing parliaments
worldwide prepared to leave Malaysia in a huff Wednesday after the
government blocked its efforts to collect information about a
jailed opposition lawmaker.
	   ``The delegation expresses its deep regret and disappointment at
the stance adopted by the authorities,'' said a statement by the
Geneva-based Inter-Parliamentary Union, an association of 136
parliaments from around the world.
	   A three-member team arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Monday to
determine why Lim Guan Eng, deputy secretary-general of the
Democratic Action Party and a member of Parliament for 12 years,
was imprisoned in August.
	   The team had expected to meet with Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, the foreign minister and the chief minister of
the southern state that Lim represented in Parliament.
	   But in three days the representatives were only able to see the
speaker of the national legislature. A requested meeting with the
jailed opposition leader was also turned down.
	   Lim, 38, was convicted last year of sedition and for printing
false news in a pamphlet distributed in 1995 entitled, ``The True
Story.'' In it, he criticized the government's decision not to
press statutory rape charges against Abdul Rahim Tamby Chik, a
former chief minister of Lim's home state, Malacca.
	   The pamphlet questioned why the 15-year-old girl involved in the
scandal was detained for more than two years, but not Abdul Rahim,
a powerful member of Mahathir's governing party.
	   Since he became the first sitting Malaysian lawmaker to be
sentenced to prison in August, when he lost an appeal against his
sentence, Lim's case has raised concerns about political
intolerance in Malaysia.
	   ``The delegation's intention was to gather information from all
interested parties to give the IPU and its member parliaments a
comprehensive and clear perception of Mr. Lim Guan Eng's
situation,'' the statement said.
	   The IPU has campaigned for a full pardon for the jailed
parliamentarian. Malaysia is a member of the global body.
	   ``We are not trying to interfere with the domestic policy of
government,'' said Clyde Holding, a former Australian member of
parliament who is part of the visiting team.
	   Human rights groups have noted that Mahathir's treatment of his
former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was further proof that
the government crushes any political dissent.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 and is on trial for 10 counts of
abuse of power and sexual misconduct.
	   Anwar denies the charges and says they were fabricated so that
Mahathir could get rid of him and end a challenge to an unbroken
17-year rule.
	   Lim and his father, the opposition leader in Parliament, have
for years been outspoken critics of Mahathir's leadership.
	   Lim is serving two, concurrent 18-month prison terms.

Strong earthquake topples thousands of houses, official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A strong earthquake toppled more than 8,000
buildings in the impoverished hills of China's rural southwest,
leaving 20,000 people homeless, a local official said Wednesday.
	   Few injuries and no deaths have been reported from the
magnitude-5.1 quake that struck Yunnan province's Xuanwei county
Tuesday shortly after 3:30 p.m. _ when farmers were in the fields
and students on recess, said Wei Hui of the local Civil Affairs
Bureau.
	   Among the 8,000 buildings that collapsed, many belonged to poor
farming families scattered across 24 villages, said Wei. He added
that some families lost many of their pigs and cows.
	   Many buildings, including those in the county seat, were cracked
or listing and will have to be pulled down, said Wei.
	   Yunnan Vice Gov. Niu Shaoyao, who was in Xuanwei inspecting the
aftermath of a coal mine accident that killed 38 miners Sunday,
joined local authorities in checking on rescue and repair efforts.
	   The quake was the third to strike Yunnan in two weeks. A pair of
powerful quakes on Nov. 20 killed five people, injured 4,000 and
left 25,000 homeless in the Ninglang region along the border with
Sichuan province, 300 kilometers west of Xuanwei.
	   Many of those left homeless in the Ninglang quake are still
shivering through nights of freezing temperatures with little or no
shelter.

Chauffeur testifies he was Anwar's `homosexual slave'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout with driver testifying he was Anwar's
`homosexual slave,' details; EDITS to trim
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In the most riveting testimony to
date in the dramatic corruption and sex trial of jailed politician
Anwar Ibrahim, his wife's former driver testified Wednesday that he
was Anwar's ``homosexual slave.''
	   Azizan Abu Bakar told the court that everything he said in a
sworn statement made Aug. 5, 1997 _ when Anwar was still deputy
prime minister and finance minister _ was true.
	   Azizan, 38, was asked to read from that statement.
	   ``In the name of Allah ... I have become a victim of homosexual
acts by Anwar Ibrahim, who now holds the position of deputy prime
minister,'' Azizan read to a stunned courtroom.
	   ``This heinous act was committed several times in 1992 against
my will. It regularly took place in luxury hotels ... without the
knowledge of the public and his wife.''
	   Azizan was the driver for Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, from 1989
to 1992. He is now a sales executive in a trading company.
	   ``I had on several occasions tried to resist,'' Azizan
continued. ``His chronic behavior caused me great mental stress.
The feeling of guilt finally overcame me whenever I had to gaze on
Azizah, who had such high moral character. Finally I made the
decision to stop from becoming a homosexual slave to this man,
Anwar Ibrahim, whom I regard as an animal.''
	   Sodomy is a crime in this predominantly Muslim country.
	   Anwar showed no visible signs of reaction during the graphic
testimony. During the lunch break he hugged his daughter while
Azizah looked on solemnly.
	   Anwar faces four counts of abuse of office. He will face trial
later for one more charge of corruption and five counts of illegal
sexual acts. He denies the charges, calling them part of a
high-level conspiracy to ruin his political career.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar Sept. 2, saying he
had conducted his own investigation into his alleged sexual deeds
and determined Anwar was morally unfit for office.
	   Anwar's sacking led to his demands for political reforms and
dozens of massive antigovernment protests, rocking the normally
placid Southeast Asian nation.
	   His jailing and beating while in police custody have drawn
international attention to the case, which is being monitored by
foreign media, diplomats and human rights activists.
	   Earlier witnesses for the prosecution, high-level police and
intelligence officers testified that Anwar abused his power by
forcing police to get a retraction from Azizan.
	   Although Anwar secured a retraction, which was then forwarded to
Mahathir, Azizan testified Wednesday that he stood by his original
statement.
	   ``I made this statement voluntarily without any form of
prompting, urging or pressure from any party,'' Azizan said.
``Everything is true, for the sake of the community, the nation.
Amen.''
	   Earlier in the day, the court proceedings came to a temporary
halt when High Court Judge Augustine Paul turned his attention to a
second defense lawyer who accused prosecutors of fabricating
evidence against Anwar.
	   Manjeet Singh Dhillon, charged with contempt of court,
represents Anwar's former tennis partner, Nallakaruppan Solaimalai.
Nalla, as he is called, is charged with possession of ammunition,
which carries a mandatory death sentence.
	   Nalla was detained under the Internal Security Act just before
Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest.
	   On Monday, a warrant was issued by the court for Manjeet Singh
after he wrote a letter accusing prosecutors of trying to force
Nalla into a plea bargain by giving false evidence against Anwar
about alleged sexual trysts.
	   Manjeet Singh quickly apologized Wednesday. Paul accepted the
apology and resumed the trial, which is now in its fourth week.
	   Manjeet Singh's letter formed the basis for an affidavit for
which Zainur Zakaria, a prominent lawyer on Anwar's defense team,
has been sentenced to three months in jail.
	   Paul found Zainur in contempt for having maligned the two top
prosecutors in the Anwar case. Zainur, who rejected Paul's demand
that he apologize, will go to jail if he loses his appeal hearing
on Friday.

Singapore's burgeoning cruise industry prepares for millionth
</HEADLINE>
customer

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's goal to become the regional hub for
the cruise industry looks to be on track as it prepares for its one
millionth customer this year after only seven years in operation, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   ``The figure is equal to the entire Mediterranean traffic in
1997,'' Kathleen Gan, manager of the Singapore Cruise Center, was
quoted as saying by The Straits Times.
	   The regional economic crisis, which has generally kept Asians at
home, has not damaged Singapore's cruise business significantly.
Lower exchange rates have lured Europeans, Americans and
Australians instead, said the report.
	   Yeo Ning Hong, chairman of the government-owned PSA Corporation,
which runs the cruise center, remains optimistic about the huge
Asian market.
	   ``Before the economic slowdown, about 500 million middle-income
Asians were expected to be able to afford leisure travel by the
year 2000,'' Yeo was quoted as saying. ``But even if only a small
fraction _ say 10 to 20 percent _ can travel, we are still looking
at 50 million to 100 million Asians.''
	   PSA has recently upgraded the cruise center, which berths cruise
liners and promotes the industry, at a cost of 23 million Singapore
dollars (dlrs 14 million), said the newspaper. It can now
accommodate mega-liners and handle up to 1.5 million passengers a
year.
	   Several large cruisers operate out of Singapore, including the
1,800-capacity Legend of the Seas, which is run by the world's
second largest cruise operator, the Miami-based Royal Caribbean
Cruises.

Newest Taliban edict warns bus drivers to hide women passengers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban religious army on
Wednesday ordered bus drivers to hide female passengers behind
curtains _ the latest edict in the group's campaign to impose its
strict interpretation of Islamic law on this central Asian country.
	   The Taliban also warned bus drivers against fraternizing with
female passengers, telling jokes or displaying posters.
	   In a broadcast on Taliban-run Radio Shariat, the group ordered
buses carrying only women to be encased in curtains. It also said a
curtain should hide the driver from the female passengers.
	   Men and women must travel in separate buses in Kabul, with about
half of the estimated 200 buses in the capital reserved for each
sex. Women are barred from driving.
	   But drivers have been lax in following the Taliban's rules.
	   For example, the broadcast said some drivers have been playing
music, an offense that is punishable by a public beating. Other
drivers have had long hair and or wore ``shiny clothes.''
	   ``The driver should be dressed in simple clothes, nothing shiny
and his hair should be short and he should wear a cap and not be
seen by his women passengers,'' said the broadcast.
	   The deputy head of the religious police, Maulvi Mohammed Sharif
Haqqani, also warned bus drivers to hire only young boys below 15
to collect bus fare from women. Even then, the boys should not
mingle with the women.
	   The Taliban now controls 90 percent of Afghanistan. As it has
imposed its harsh rule, the Taliban has been especially restrictive
toward women, forcing them off the job, out of school and into long
robes called burqas that cover them from head to toe.
	   On Wednesday religious police patrolled the bus depots in the
city to ensure the latest edicts were being enforced.
	   ``It is like a cage . . . no one can see the driver and no one
can see the women,'' said one bus driver, who gave his name only as
Mushtaq.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Tens of thousands of black-coated Hasidic Jews
attended the wedding of the heir to one of the most powerful
ultra-Orthodox leaders in Israel.
	   The courtyard of the Banot Yaacov religious school in Jerusalem
was packed Tuesday with men wearing black fur hats as Israel
Menachem Alter, 19, was married to Esther Eiger, 17, granddaughter
of the one of the head of the Hasidic dynasty of Lublin.
	   Surrounding streets were closed, causing a major traffic jam.
	   Some guests stood on soft drink crates or watched through
binoculars to get a better look at the ceremony. Others packed the
flat rooftops of nearby buildings.
	   A fortunate 10,000 were invited to the reception at the
religious college of the proud father, Rabbi Yaacov Arieh Alter.
Tons of food and bottles of wine were distributed to the estimated
20,000 in the streets outside, as the world's most famous Hasidic
singers performed over a loudspeaker system.
	   It was described as the biggest celebration in Jerusalem since
Rabbi Alter's own wedding, 53 years ago.
	   Rabbi Alter is one of the most powerful figures in the United
Torah Judaism party, which has four seats in Israel's parliament.
	   He is also the head of the biggest Hasidic group in Israel,
known as the Gur court.

China holds high-profile dissidents, colleagues demand release
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Calling China deceitful for signing human rights
treaties while stifling dissent, 190 Chinese dissidents demanded
Wednesday that the government release campaigners trying to set up
an opposition party.
	   Police freed two campaigners Wednesday morning after their
second night in detention, but kept in custody three of China's
most prominent dissidents _ Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai _
all outspoken organizers of the would-be China Democracy Party.
	   Xu and Qin were taken away by police Monday night in coordinated
raids in two cities that delivered the sternest blow to the 5-month
campaign to establish the party and challenge the ruling Communist
Party's ban on opposition politics.
	   Qin was arrested for plotting to overthrow the government, a
crime that could land him in jail for life. Xu was taken away on
warrants that identified him as a criminal suspect, while Wang,
detained a month ago, was also formally arrested Monday although
his family has not been told the charge.
	   Their campaign drew inspiration from China's signing of key U.N.
human rights treaties, partly done to improve relations with the
United States and other Western countries.
	   ``By these acts, China's government and relevant authorities
have brazenly violated international treaties and universal human
rights principles,'' said an open letter signed by 190 dissidents
in 22 provinces and cities and faxed to foreign news agencies.
	   ``On the one hand, they are deceiving and cheating international
public opinion while on the other hand they are suppressing and
persecuting domestic political dissidents,'' said the letter.
	   The letter demanded the release of Xu, Qin, Wang and any others
taken into custody.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin called
Xu's detention ``a serious step in the wrong direction'' and called
for his release. He said Xu had been ``for peacefully exercising
fundamental freedoms guaranteed by international human rights
instruments.''
	   Two other democracy party supporters taken into custody in
central Wuhan city along with Qin _ Chen Zhonghe and Xiao Shichang
_ were released Wednesday morning, said He Xintong, Xu Wenli's
wife. She added that police questioned the pair about the party as
well as Qin's human rights monitoring organizations.
	   Qin and Xu are towering figures in China's persecuted dissident
community. Their activism dates to the seminal Democracy Wall
movement of the 1970s. Wang heralds from 1989's influential
Tiananmen Square democracy movement, in which he was a student
leader. All have spent time in prison, Xu for 12 years, much of it
in solitary confinement.
	   Xu's wife said she does not know where he is being held and, in
her 20-year experience with the authorities, believes they are
unlikely to tell her.
	   Released in 1993, Xu picked up his campaigning for political
change soon after his parole ended last year. He has tried to use
China's nascent legal system and the international treaties it
signed to push for reform.
	   ``My husband is innocent and there's nothing he can be
criticized for,'' said his wife, He Xintong. ``They're going to
have to expend a lot of effort to make him a criminal.''
	   Qin's family was notified Wednesday to send clean clothes and
quilts to him, a sign authorities were preparing for a long
detention, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights
and Democratic Movement in China reported.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Tens of thousands of black-coated Hasidic Jews
attended the wedding of the heir to one of the most powerful
ultra-Orthodox leaders in Israel.
	   The courtyard of the Banot Yaacov religious school in Jerusalem
was packed Tuesday with men wearing black fur hats as Israel
Menachem Alter, 19, was married to Esther Eiger, 17, granddaughter
of the one of the head of the Hasidic dynasty of Lublin.
	   Surrounding streets were closed, causing a major traffic jam.
	   Some guests stood on soft drink crates or watched through
binoculars to get a better look at the ceremony. Others packed the
flat rooftops of nearby buildings.
	   A fortunate 10,000 were invited to the reception at the
religious college of the proud father, Rabbi Yaacov Arieh Alter.
Tons of food and bottles of wine were distributed to the estimated
20,000 in the streets outside, as the world's most famous Hasidic
singers performed over a loudspeaker system.
	   It was described as the biggest celebration in Jerusalem since
Rabbi Alter's own wedding, 53 years ago.
	   Rabbi Alter is one of the most powerful figures in the United
Torah Judaism party, which has four seats in Israel's parliament.
	   He is also the head of the biggest Hasidic group in Israel,
known as the Gur court.

Jakarta city officials call for no protests during holy Islamic
</HEADLINE>
month

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Members of Jakarta's city council have
asked protesters not to take to the streets during Ramadan, the
forthcoming Muslim holy fasting month, a news report said
Wednesday.
	   Ramadan is expected to start on Dec. 9 and is observed by
Muslims as a period of spiritual reflection and prayer.
	   ``Staging a street rally in the city would certainly cause heavy
traffic congestion, which, in turn, could easily make other people
angry,'' said councilor Ida Mawaddah Noor, as quoted by The Jakarta
Post newspaper.
	   The paper said other councilors backed the call for no protests
during Ramadan.
	   For months noisy demonstrations have been a daily part of life
in Indonesia's capital as many push for democratic reform and
express their views on a wide range of issues.
	   Often the protests are peaceful. But some have ended in clashes
with security forces and bloodshed.
	   Student protests, followed by deadly riots, helped to force
authoritarian President Suharto to quit last May.
	   Troops blocked a protest march and shot nine students to death
on Nov. 13.
	   Often marches cause major traffic jams in the already congested
city of 11 million.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
making it the world's most populous Islamic state.

Cambodian leader urges unity in armed forces, Khmer Rouge defection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo PHN101

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Prime Minister Hun Sen called
Wednesday for Cambodia's splintered armed forces to quickly
reintegrate and again urged die-hard Khmer Rouge rebel fighters to
defect to the central government.
	   The ranks of the armed forces split when Hun Sen deposed his
co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a bloody coup in
1997. But the prince and Hun Sen have agreed to a modified
power-sharing deal in a new government accepted by Parliament this
week. Under it, the factions are to reunify.
	   Speaking at the Defense Ministry, Hun Sen said that ridding the
military of politics and eliminating the lingering presence of the
Khmer Rouge movement from Cambodia would pave the way for a more
peaceful future.
	   ``If the plan can be realized as soon as possible, it will not
just reduce the bloodshed, it will expand peace and stability
needed for development,'' Hun Sen said.
	   Hun Sen is sole prime minister in the new government and
Ranariddh is president of the National Assembly. The arrangement
broke three months of deadlock following Parliamentary elections in
July.
	   Part of the deal is to reintegrate the smaller pro-Ranariddh
forces into the army. With aid from Khmer Rouge rebels, hundreds
held out for months in strongholds on the Thai-Cambodian border
against Hun Sen's more powerful forces.
	   Hun Sen's reforms envision a neutral, smaller, more professional
fighting force. Several top generals are senior members in the
chief political parties.
	   One of Ranariddh's generals, Serey Kosal, returned to Phnom Penh
from exile a few days ago, FUNCINPEC official Ahmad Yahya said.
	   Serey Kosal and top resistance commander Nhek Bunchhay were
convicted for treason in a show trial in March, but were given full
pardons under the recent coalition deal.
	   Integration of the army has been slow to start as the Defense
Ministry works to verify troop lists forwarded by the pro-Ranariddh
forces, said Gen. Ham Kin, the ministry's chief of personnel.
	   Nhek Bunchhay claims to have 20,000 troops under his command.
Independent estimates are well under half that.
	   Complicating reintegration is the suspected presence on the
lists of Khmer Rouge guerrillas who fought Hun Sen alongside the
resistance.
	   Hun Sen's army has refused to bring Khmer Rouge troops in, but
the prime minister repeated Wednesday that he would welcome the
defection of rebel fighters from their one-legged commander, Ta
Mok.
	   Hun Sen said there would be no more special deals given to
defectors, adding that he had rejected an offer from rebels living
in the border jungles to quit fighting in exchange for autonomous
control of their areas.
	   Former senior Khmer Rouge leader Ieng Sary was given autonomous
control of a swathe of resource-rich territory in northwestern
Cambodia in 1996 in exchange for leading thousands of rebels to
defect, crippling the Khmer Rouge movement.
	   The Khmer Rouge caused the deaths of as many as 2 million
Cambodians when they ruled between 1975 and 1979.

Government responds cautiously to offer of talks from rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The government castigated the
political opposition for urging it to accept an offer of peace
talks with Tamil rebels, saying the rebel group was ``a pack of
murderers,'' the state-run Daily News reported Wednesday.
	   But Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar stopped short of
rejecting the proposal for talks and indicated the government was
still weighing its position.
	   Kadirgamar's remarks in Parliament Tuesday were the first
reaction to a suggestion last week by the leader of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam for preliminary talks to end the country's
15-year-old civil war, which has left more than 57,000 people dead
and more than one million displaced.
	   ``We cannot forgive the LTTE for what they are doing to their
own people, (and) ... you are saying that we should jump into
negotiations with a pack of murderers,'' Kadirgamar was quoted as
saying, replying to suggestion from the main opposition United
National Party that the government should favorably respond to the
rebel offer.
	   ``Terrorist organizations do talk at some stage. The PLO did.
The IRA did,'' he was quoted as saying. But he said he was unable
to give a yes or no answer about talks, because such decisions are
not taken ``at a spur of the moment.''
	   In an unexpected change of tone, Tamil rebel commander
Velupillai Prabhakaran said in a speech Friday he was prepared for
preliminary peace talks through third-party mediation.
	   The influential Tamil United Liberation Front, a political party
allied with President Chandrika Kumaratunga's People's Alliance,
also has urged the government to seize the opening offered by
Prabhakaran.
	   In 1995, the Tigers broke off peace talks after three months.
The government accused the rebels of using the time to resupply,
while the Tigers accused the government of negotiating in bad faith
and refusing to deal with immediate issues.
	   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 18.5 million
people, say they suffer discrimination at the hands of the
Sinhalese majority.

Russia agrees to return art looted by Nazis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS. UPDATES with French rejecting plea to auction works
of art held by government. &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA MYERS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Russia agreed to return to Holocaust victims
or their heirs art looted by the Nazis, but the French rejected a
plea to auction more than 2,000 works of art the government has
held since World War II.
	   A senior U.S. official called Russia's plan a ``breakthrough''
at an international conference to set informal standards for the
return of stolen assets.
	   But the French delegation rejected a plea Tuesday from a top
official of the Museum of Modern Art and the World Jewish Congress
to auction, for the benefit of Holocaust victims and their
families, more than 2,000 pieces of looted works the government has
held at museums since World War II.
	   ``It has been impossible to give back,'' Louis Amigues, a
leading member of the French delegation, said in an interview,
despite the publication of the list of looted art on the Internet
for the past year.
	   Amigues, like French President Jacques Chirac, said the
government would not consider auctioning the paintings and other
works to aid Holocaust victims. ``It is not the French way,'' he
explained. ``The French way is to try and find the owners or their
heirs. The art belongs to them and nobody else.''
	   The four-day conference, a mostly closed meeting that continues
Wednesday, involves 44 countries, the Vatican and more than a dozen
groups, including Jewish, art, history and insurance organizations.
	   On Tuesday, Moscow's representative, Valery Kulishov, surprised
the conference by pledging to try to identify and return ``victim
art'' looted from individuals and religious and community centers
by the Nazis and then taken as ``reparations'' by the Soviet
government for damage caused and lives lost at Germany's hands.
Russia said nothing about returning ``trophy art'' taken from
institutions.
	   Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, head of the U.S.
delegation that organized the conference, called the Russian
gesture ``a real breakthrough.'' He noted that Moscow also agreed
to a U.S.-proposed set of principles that would require return of
looted art, if possible, or restitution.
	   ``The political will exists now'' for returning the art,
Eizenstat declared at a news conference. He added that delegates
seemed to have ``a collective sense of urgency to participate.''
	   In Russia's case, time will be short for individuals to make
claims, according to a law passed by the Duma in April that gives
people 18 months to make a government-to-government request for
restitution, Eizenstat said. The Russians told delegates they are
willing to speed up their work and asked for help in setting up a
database to determine the history of plundered artworks, he said.
	   The Nazis looted an estimated 150,000 pieces of art from Western
Europe during the war and some 500,000 pieces from Eastern and
Central Europe, the delegates were told.
	   Ronald Lauder, chairman of the board of the Museum of Modern Art
and an official with the World Jewish Congress, estimated 110,000
pieces of art worth dlrs 10 billion to dlrs 30 billion are still
``missing'' and said virtually every large museum, institution and
private collection contains some. A review of 225 museum catalogs
over the summer by his group found 1,700 looted pieces of art, he
said.
	   Lauder called on governments and museums to return the art or
auction it to help Jewish groups and Holocaust survivors and their
families.
	   ``It is time for museums to set the same standard for ownership
that they expect of themselves for authenticity,'' he told
delegates. ``Is the art genuine? Is the art genuinely theirs?''
	   The U.S. Association of Art Museums formed a panel in June to
address the problem.

Morgues in Thailand overflowing with unclaimed bodies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Public health officials on the Thai
resort island of Phuket said Wednesday that cremations of unclaimed
bodies are being held up because police can't determine many of
their identities.
	   As a result, the morgues have more bodies than they can handle.
	   Most of the corpses were found in forests or floating off
beaches. They are unidentified victims of accidents or unsolved
murders, said an official at a provincial health office in Phuket,
690 kilometers (428 miles) south of Bangkok.
	   He said many were Thai migrant workers and some were illegal
workers from neighboring countries. Police usually send the bodies
to morgues in government hospitals while investigating the crimes
and searching for their identities.
	   ``Each month, we receive between 10-20 dead bodies from police
and we have to wait until the court orders us to eliminate them,''
said an official at Vatchira Hospital in Phuket who spoke only on
condition of anonymity.
	   The legal process usually takes months and destroying a corpse
can't be done without a court order, he said.
	   In the meantime, police have tried to help by burying the bodies
temporarily on the grounds of temples.
	   A local Chinese charity foundation, which has helped by burying
the bodies temporarily in public cemeteries, also says they are
running out of room, according to the hospital official.
	   Boonriang Chuchaisaebgrat, the head of Phuket Public Health
Office said public cemeteries are full, while private ones refuse
to accept the unclaimed bodies as they believe it is a cause of a
bad luck, according to Wednesday's Bangkok Post newspaper.

South Korean underwear maker wins suit involving late actor James
</HEADLINE>
Dean

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean court on Wednesday
rebuffed an attempt by a relative of James Dean to collect damages
from a local company that produces a line of underwear bearing the
late actor's name.
	   A cousin of Dean, Marcus Winslow Jr. of Jonesboro, Ind., filed
suit in South Korea in 1994, claiming he represented Dean's family
and estate and had commercial and other rights to the name and
image of the icon of American cinema.
	   Winslow accused J. Enterprise Ltd. and its owner, Joo
Byoung-jin, of violating trademark laws by producing ``James Dean''
underwear and opening more than 100 stores to market them.
	   On Wednesday, Judge Kim Duk-jin of the Seoul Appellate Court
said that the plaintiff lacked evidence that he represented Dean's
estate.
	   But Kim added his ruling leaves unsettled a legal dispute over
whether the country should recognize the right of relatives to
protect the names, images and reputations of dead celebrities.
	   South Korea lacks laws to deal with such disputes, Kim said.
	   Joo said he had registered James Dean's name as a legitimate
trademark with the Korean Industrial Property Office, and refused
to pay royalties for using the name.
	   Winslow had demanded that all of Joo's James Dean trademarks be
invalidated. He sought damages of 400 million won (dlrs 307,000).
	   J. Enterprise began selling women's and men's James Dean
underwear in 1990. With last year's sales at dlrs 87 million, the
company is now South Korea's second largest underwear maker. It
also markets another underwear brand.
	   Dean, who died at age 24 in a 1955 car crash, is well known in
South Korea for his films ``Rebel Without a Cause,'' `East of
Eden'' and ``Giant,'' and some cafes and restaurants in Seoul are
named after him.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A court in the eastern port city of Nakhodka
sentenced two police officers to a relatively light 15 years in
prison for the grisly murder of a teen-age girl in 1996, a Russian
news agency reported Wednesday.
	   The officers, Viktor Pronechkin and Valery Vankunchinov, were
convicted of killing 14-year-old Svetlana Fadeyeva, who had refused
to have sex with them, ITAR-Tass said. The two stabbed her more
than 200 times with a knife and screwdriver.
	   It was not clear when the sentence was handed down.

Insecticides haven't killed all Asian Games bugs: Officials

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A plague of insects filling up the main
swimming pools at the 13th Asian Games has been cut in half by
spraying insecticides, but officials said Wednesday that's not good
enough.
	   ``I want something more drastic, because this is embarrassing,''
said assistant pool manager Amthon Plaengtaisong. ``I want to see
no insect in the swimming pool the day racing starts.''
	   Large-scale spraying was carried out Monday and is scheduled
again for Saturday at the pool and other venues. Officials claimed
chemicals being used will be harmless to the thousands of athletes
and spectators turning out daily after the games open Sunday.
	   ``Please don't worry, we are taking care of it,'' said Kamala
Sangsrithong, manager of the aquatic center. ``I assure you that
this insect problem will be overcome before the games start.''
	   A recently assembled pest-control unit is trying to beat back
the insects at the pools and other venues of the main Thammassat
University-Rangsit venue, where most of the sports will be played.
	   The nearby land is marshy and bright lights at night draw in
swarms of bugs. Occasional rain has increased breeding.
	   ``Special squads have been formed along with pool attendants to
watch over the pool around the clock to clean up the dead insects
in the water,'' Kamala said.
	   Other than using insecticides, the officials are seeking help
from university experts to find more environmentally friendly
measures, Amthon said.
	   Amthon said the pest-control team was aware of bugs in the area
but did not realize the problem would so bad _ and could have been
worse had not bushes and weeds sheltering insects been uprooted in
recent months.
	   Swimming and diving competitions starts Monday with a total of
32 gold medals up for grabs.

Teachers strike in Siberia, hospital workers in Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Teachers in several Siberian towns went on strike
Wednesday, protesting the government's failure to pay them.
Hospital workers in Russia's Far East went on a hunger strike, also
demanding back pay.
	   In Siberia, 6,000 teachers went on strike in the Irkutsk region,
shutting down 123 schools, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. In one
town, Ulkan, the teachers began a hunger strike, according to
teachers' union spokesman Yuri Bekshtanovsky.
	   In the Far East, more than 40 hospital workers in the town of
Elban joined a hunger strike called the day before by emergency
medical workers in the nearby city of Amursk. Workers at the Elban
hospital said they hadn't been paid for six months, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Teachers in eight schools in the surrounding Khabarovsk region
went on strike Tuesday and teachers in other schools called a
``pre-strike alert,'' threatening to walk off their jobs if they
aren't paid, the news agency said.
	   Such strikes are common in Russia, where many workers go unpaid
for months at a time. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has promised
to begin repaying wages of all public sector workers next year.

Report: China's army joins U.S. forces in search and rescue
</HEADLINE>
exercise &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A contingent from China's military joined U.S.
forces for the first time in a search and rescue exercise conducted
on Wednesday, a local report said.
	   Boats from the Hong Kong garrison of China's People's Liberation
Army joined 220 U.S. air force and coast guard personnel off Hong
Kong's outlying Lantau island, the Hong Kong Standard reported.
	   U.S. forces included personnel from the Joint Rescue
Coordination Center in Honolulu, the Kulis Air National Guard Base
in Alaska, and Kadena Air Base in Japan. The U.S. Coast Guard
cutter ``Rush'' joined them from Honolulu.
	   Officials at the U.S. Consulate were not available for immediate
comment on the report.
	   PLA boats planned to move into the South China Sea along with
the U.S. Coast Guard cutter in response to a simulated plane crash
off Lantau island 130 kilometers (80.6 miles) south of the
territory, the paper said.
	   This was the first large scale search and rescue exercise since
the opening of the dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport on the
island and also the first since Hong Kong's handover to Chinese
rule last July, it added.
	   The U.S. Navy, Coast Guard and Air Force have conducted annual
exercises with Hong Kong search and rescue teams since 1976. China
and the U.S. signed joint agreements to conduct military exercises
when U.S. President Bill Clinton visited Beijing in July.

Cave-in at gold mine in Vietnam kills 25 workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A gold mine cave-in killed 25 workers in
northern Vietnam, a provincial police officer said Wednesday.
	   The incident occurred Monday night in Thai Nguyen province when
the shaft mine _ 12 meters deep and dozens of meters in diameter _
collapsed, the officer said.
	   Five bodies have been recovered and police were continuing to
search for others, he said. Most of the victims were farmers hired
by private mine developers.
	   Several thousand workers have flocked to the jungle site since
the provincial government granted gold mining licenses to private
developers in September, he said.
	   Dozens of gold mining accidents have been reported so far
nationwide because of a lack of safety precautions by such
developers.
	   Seven illegal gold miners in central Quang Nam province were
killed two weeks ago when their tunnel collapsed.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In the most riveting testimony to
date in the dramatic corruption and sex trial of jailed politician
Anwar Ibrahim, his wife's former driver testified Wednesday that he
was Anwar's ``homosexual slave.''
	   Azizan Abu Bakar told the court that everything he said in a
sworn statement made Aug. 5, 1997 _ when Anwar was still deputy
prime minister and finance minister _ was true.
	   Azizan, 38, was asked to read from that statement.
	   ``In the name of Allah ... I have become a victim of homosexual
acts by Anwar Ibrahim, who now holds the position of deputy prime
minister,'' Azizan read to a stunned courtroom.
	   ``This heinous act was committed several times in 1992 against
my will. It regularly took place in luxury hotels ... without the
knowledge of the public and his wife.''
	   Azizan was the driver for Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, from 1989
to 1992. He is now a sales executive in a trading company.
	   ``I had on several occasions tried to resist,'' Azizan
continued. ``His chronic behavior caused me great mental stress.
The feeling of guilt finally overcame me whenever I had to gaze on
Azizah, who had such high moral character. Finally I made the
decision to stop from becoming a homosexual slave to this man,
Anwar Ibrahim, whom I regard as an animal.''
	   Sodomy is a crime in this predominantly Muslim country.
	   Anwar showed no visible signs of reaction during the graphic
testimony. During the lunch break he hugged his daughter while
Azizah looked on solemnly.
	   Anwar faces four counts of abuse of office. He will face trial
later for one more charge of corruption and five counts of illegal
sexual acts. He denies the charges, calling them part of a
high-level conspiracy to ruin his political career.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar Sept. 2, saying he
had conducted his own investigation into his alleged sexual deeds
and determined Anwar was morally unfit for office.
	   Anwar's sacking led to his demands for political reforms and
dozens of massive antigovernment protests, rocking the normally
placid Southeast Asian nation.
	   His jailing and beating while in police custody have drawn
international attention to the case, which is being monitored by
foreign media, diplomats and human rights activists.
	   Earlier witnesses for the prosecution, high-level police and
intelligence officers testified that Anwar abused his power by
forcing police to get a retraction from Azizan.
	   Although Anwar secured a retraction, which was then forwarded to
Mahathir, Azizan testified Wednesday that he stood by his original
statement.
	   ``I made this statement voluntarily without any form of
prompting, urging or pressure from any party,'' Azizan said.
``Everything is true, for the sake of the community, the nation.
Amen.''
	   Earlier in the day, the court proceedings came to a temporary
halt when High Court Judge Augustine Paul turned his attention to a
second defense lawyer who accused prosecutors of fabricating
evidence against Anwar.
	   Manjeet Singh Dhillon, charged with contempt of court,
represents Anwar's former tennis partner, Nallakaruppan Solaimalai.
Nalla, as he is called, is charged with possession of ammunition,
which carries a mandatory death sentence.
	   Nalla was detained under the Internal Security Act just before
Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest.
	   On Monday, a warrant was issued by the court for Manjeet Singh
after he wrote a letter accusing prosecutors of trying to force
Nalla into a plea bargain by giving false evidence against Anwar
about alleged sexual trysts.
	   Manjeet Singh quickly apologized Wednesday. Paul accepted the
apology and resumed the trial, which is now in its fourth week.
	   Manjeet Singh's letter formed the basis for an affidavit for
which Zainur Zakaria, a prominent lawyer on Anwar's defense team,
has been sentenced to three months in jail.
	   Paul found Zainur in contempt for having maligned the two top
prosecutors in the Anwar case. Zainur, who rejected Paul's demand
that he apologize, will go to jail if he loses his appeal hearing
on Friday.

Indonesian security forces block students heading to Suharto's
</HEADLINE>
house
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with details on with student protests
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 1,000 Indonesian students staged
separate protests Wednesday near a military headquarters building,
the office of the country's attorney general and the home of
ex-President Suharto.
	   In recent weeks, students have repeatedly held rallies near the
house of Suharto, who quit in May after riots and protests against
his 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   Activists want Suharto, a 77-year-old former army general, to be
charged with corruption and human rights abuses.
	   ``Put Suharto on trial,'' chanted 300 students who drove in
buses toward Suharto's house but were blocked by riot police
officers. Some demonstrators waved red and white Indonesian flags.
	   One group of protesters roughed up a suspected plainclothes
policeman.
	   President B.J. Habibie, Suharto's successor, has ordered a new
probe into the wealth of his onetime mentor. But a panel of
investigators has yet to be formed and opponents question whether
the process will be impartial.
	   An earlier investigation by the attorney general's office turned
up no evidence of wrongdoing and student protesters labeled it a
whitewash. Critics say Suharto's family built billion-dollar
business empires at least partly with state resources.
	   Also Wednesday, several hundred students demonstrated outside
the office of Attorney General Andi Mohamad Ghalib to demand a
trial of Suharto.
	   Another group of at least 100 students rallied at the
headquarters of the army's strategic command to demand a thorough
investigation of the Nov. 13 shooting deaths of nine student
protesters by security forces.
	   For months, noisy demonstrations have been a daily part of life
in Indonesia's capital city as many push for democratic reform and
express their views on a wide range of issues.
	   Habibie, who has promised general elections next year, said
Wednesday that reform could only come through the legal process.
	   ``Indonesians have to implement reforms through constitutional
means because it is impossible to implement reforms on the
street,'' he said.
	   A newspaper reported Wednesday that members of Jakarta's city
council have asked protesters not to take to the streets during
Ramadan, the forthcoming Muslim holy fasting month.
	   Ramadan is expected to start on Dec. 19 and is observed by
Muslims as a period of spiritual reflection and prayer.
	   ``Staging a street rally in the city would certainly cause heavy
traffic congestion, which, in turn, could easily make other people
angry,'' said councilor Ida Mawaddah Noor, as quoted by The Jakarta
Post newspaper.
	   The paper said other councilors backed the call for no protests
during Ramadan.
	   Marches often cause major traffic jams in the already congested
city of 11 million.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
making it the world's most populous Islamic state.
	   Indonesia, which is suffering its worst economic crisis in
decades, has endured several outbreaks of religious violence
recently. Muslim mobs burned and ransacked Christian churches in
Jakarta last month and Christian rioters in Kupang, a provincial
capital, targeted mosques this week.

Russian prime minister lobbies IMF chief for more loans

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus
met top Russian officials Wednesday, but he wasn't expected to
announce the release of frozen loans that Moscow badly wants to pay
off mounting debts.
	   The stakes are high: Russia owes billions of dollars to workers,
pensioners and foreign creditors and wants the IMF to provide a new
installment on a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package that was
negotiated in the summer, shortly before the latest economic crisis
hit.
	   But the IMF has been demanding a realistic recovery plan from
the Russian government and has so far been unimpressed with
Moscow's efforts.
	   Camdessus arrived Tuesday night and met with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, and they planned additional talks Wednesday.
	   Speaking to reporters Wednesday morning, Primakov sought to
lower expectations.
	   ``Don't measure the significance of Camdessus' visit by how much
money he brought,'' Primakov said. ``He has come with an attache
case containing documents, not cash.''
	   ``We are exchanging opinions,'' Primakov said, adding that he
was satisfied with their initial meeting Tuesday evening. ``You
shouldn't think that the question of giving money to Russia will be
solved now.''
	   The IMF put the loan installments on hold after Russia's
government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in
August. Primakov's government has moved cautiously, refraining from
any radical measures and hoping that the IMF and other lenders will
offer help.
	   The government delayed a debate this week on next year's budget
as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet
expenses.
	   While the Cabinet insisted the delay was not connected with
Camdessus' visit, Russian media have suggested the government put
off action on the budget because it is still holding out hope of
receiving IMF money. The latest budget draft assumes Russia will
receive the IMF loan.
	   If the Russian government doesn't receive foreign help soon, it
will be forced to start printing money, which would drive up
inflation and further imperil Russia's fragile economy, Primakov
and other officials warned.
	   An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's
revenue forecast for next year was overly optimistic. It also
disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes, offer
subsidies to ailing industries and increase state regulation of the
economy.
	   However, First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov insisted on
Wednesday that Russia will go its own way and assailed the IMF for
what he called its unfair assessment of the government's
intentions.
	   ``They assess every step toward reason as a step toward
administrative controls over the economy,'' Maslyukov told
reporters, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   He said that Russia's main goal now is ``to make the free-market
economy socially-oriented by means of state regulation.''
	   Russia has so far received only about dlrs 5 billion of the
bailout package, which also involves the World Bank and the
Japanese government.

Philippines to provide legal help to suspected drug pusher in
</HEADLINE>
Singapore

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government will
provide legal and financial help to a Filipino woman who is facing
the death penalty in Singapore on charges of drug trafficking,
officials said Wednesday.
	   Sally Tigue, 32, and her Singaporean boyfriend were recently
arrested in Singapore on charges of selling methamphetamine, also
called ``shabu'' or ``ice.''
	   If convicted, they would be the first people to face execution
since the Asian city-state, known for its tough drug laws,
introduced the death penalty for methamphetamine trafficking last
April.
	   ``All efforts are being exerted to ensure that due process of
the law is observed,'' said presidential spokesman Jerry Barican.
	   Barican reminded Filipinos traveling abroad to comply with the
laws of the countries they are visiting.
	   Despite Philippine government appeals, in 1995 Singapore
authorities hanged a Filipino maid, Flor Contemplacion, after
finding her guilty of killing another Filipino maid and a young
Singaporean boy.
	   Singapore insisted Contemplacion confessed, but many Filipinos
believed she was a victim of injustice.
	   Mass protests forced the Philippine government to withdraw its
ambassador, and Singapore responded by doing the same. Relations
were normalized in 1996 with the exchange of new ambassadors.

Speedway expected to announce Formula One race

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Tradition used to be a part of the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
	   For years, the Indianapolis 500 was the only racing event
contested on the 2 1/2-mile (4 kms) oval. Then stock car racing
arrived in 1994 with the Brickyard 400 Winston Cup race. Last year,
the International Race of Champions brought its series here for the
first time.
	   Formula One was expected to officially join the program at a
news conference on Wednesday, with the first race expected in 2000.
	   The international series hasn't held a race in the United States
since 1991.
	   George and Formula One president Bernie Ecclestone have been
discussing an Indianapolis race for months.
	   ``Formula One is something that we would love to have, and we're
still hoping to get an agreement. We certainly are not giving up
the idea,'' George said recently.
	   Speedway officials declined to confirm the news conference
concerned an agreement with Ecclestone.
	   George has declined to be specific over the negotiations, but he
reportedly was seeking a multiyear commitment.
	   The agreement would call for a major financial commitment by
George, including about dlrs 10 million to host the race and
another dlrs 15 million to build a road course in and around the
existing track.
	   The race is expected to be held in late September or early
October.
	   Indianapolis wasn't the only city that considered luring the
series. Other cities believed to have made bids were San Francisco,
Las Vegas and Atlanta.
	   ``The difference with us and (the other cities) is that we have
everything in place to do a deal,'' George said earlier. ``No one
else does.''
	   The only Formula One race in North America now is the Canadian
Grand Prix in Montreal in June. Ecclestone wanted to run a race in
the United States close to the Canadian Grand Prix so the series
would have to make only one trip to North America.
	   However, that timing did not work for George.
	   The Indy 500 was the only race at the Speedway until 1994, when
the Brickyard 400 was added as part of NASCAR's Winston Cup series.
This year, the International Race of Champions made Indy part of
its series.
	   The race would be known as the U.S. Grand Prix at Indianapolis.
It would require major track renovations that probably would begin
right after the 1999 Brickyard 400, which is held on the first
Saturday in August.
	   George earlier proposed using the track's existing first and
second turns and most of the front straightaway, although a new
section of track for a road course would have to be built in the
infield. Also, installing the necessary 24 pit-side garages would
require removing a portion of the grandstand behind the existing
pit road.

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks post slight gain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with late dollar, bond prices and trader
quotes.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks rebounded Wednesday after three
days of losses, fueled by an apparent late burst of buying by
public funds. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 151.21
points, or 1.02 percent, ending the day at 14,986.62. On Tuesday,
the Nikkei closed down 48.29 points, or 0.32 percent.
	   The dollar bought 121.88 yen in late afternoon trading, down
0.90 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York level of 122.17 yen overnight. It fell as low as 121.51 yen
and rose as high as 122.10 yen in Tokyo.
	   A late round of buying in the stock futures market helped push
up prices in the cash market, traders said. The sudden rally may
have been triggered by an injection of public pension fund money,
they speculated.
	   Most investors remained on the sidelines, however, to monitor
Parliamentary debate on a government-sponsored supplementary budget
designed to spur the nation's sagging economy.
	   ``The market is waiting for a sense that the economy has
bottomed out'' before pushing the market higher, said Kazuhiro
Nomura, head of trading at Paribas Capital Markets.
	   Investors also were reluctant to make significant moves ahead of
an expected sale of more shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp. and next week's ``special quotation'' settlement of December
futures and options, traders said.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section rose 4.89 points, or 0.43 percent, close at 1,147.15. The
TOPIX fell 1.24 points, or 0.11 percent, the previous day.
	   Volume on the first section was estimated at 324.08 million
shares, down from 393.41 million shares Tuesday. Advancers beat
retreaters 743 to 418, with 135 issues closing unchanged.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar fell against
the yen in the absence of fresh market-moving news after its slide
on overseas markets in reaction to the release of disappointing
U.S. economic data.
	   The National Association of Purchasing Management reported
Tuesday that the manufacturing sector in the United States slowed
for a sixth consecutive month in November.
	   The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond was
quoted at 1.155 percent, up from Tuesday's close of 1.140 percent,
driving its price down to 105.53 yen from the previous day's
105.68.

Deutsche Bank to buy Credit Lyonnais Belgium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Deutsche Bank, just days after
announcing its takeover of Bankers Trust, said Wednesday it will
buy Credit Lyonnais Belgium for about 1 billion marks (dlrs 590
million).
	   Deutsche Bank said it expects the Belgium deal to close in the
first quarter of 1999. Credit Lyonnais Belgium, a subsidiary of
France-based Credit Lyonnais SA, will be renamed Deutsche Banks.
	   The Frankfurt-based bank said it plans to fully integrate its
Belgian activities with those of Credit Lyonnais Belgium, although
it plans to retain the Belgian bank's management.
	   With the acquisition of Bankers Trust, the eighth-largest bank
in the United States, Deutsche Bank will become the world's largest
financial institution.
	   The Bankers Trust deal, announced Monday, is the largest
takeover of a U.S. financial institution by a foreign bank. With
assets of more than dlrs 800 billion, the combined bank would
surpass UBS AG of Switzerland, currently the largest bank, and the
recently formed Citigroup Inc., the largest U.S. financial services
company.

Former U.S. vice president says reforms needed to help Asia recover
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TARA SUILEN DUFFY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A sustained economic recovery from the Asian
financial crisis depends on regional governments' willingness to
reform problematic policies that brought on the turmoil, former
U.S. Vice President Walter Mondale told a group of business leaders
in Hong Kong on Wednesday.
	   ``We must disabuse these institutions from the political and
other sometimes corrupt influences that direct capital based on
political relationships'' instead of market fundamental and sound
financial judgment, he said.
	   If that can be done, Asian nations will be poised to return to
healthier and more sustainable economic growth, said Mondale, who
is a former Ambassador to Japan and now serves as a Japan advisor
to Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs and Co.
	   Many Asian nations must strengthen their banking and financial
systems and need more trade-experienced officers who can handle the
complexity of modern international capital flows, he said in an
address to the American Chamber of Commerce.
	   ``The massive flow of capital into Asia that fueled that
remarkable Asian miracle has been reversed in a dramatic, rapid and
cruel way,'' Mondale said, adding that it also exposed many
systemic problems that fall ``under the general, rough rubric of
`crony capitalism.'''
	   Japan's initiatives to reinvigorate the economy are essential to
Asia's recovery, he said. But he noted that Japan seemed more
interested in promoting protectionism than restructuring.
	   Japanese officials recently told him privately that they doubted
whether a new nearly dlrs 200 billion economic stimulus package
would be enough to put the country on track for sustainable
economic recovery unless ``they could move towards a more open
system'' to provide an added boost, he said.
	   Mondale also said that the strong U.S. economy has helped to
lessen the problems of the Asian financial crisis.
	   ``The problems we're facing in the world have been much less
worse than they would have been because the U.S. has been growing
and has been open.''
	   Mondale, who has also served as a U.S. envoy to Indonesia, said
that although the Southeast Asian country is making progress
dealing with its economy, it still has political and social
structural problems.
	   ``The need for some of these countries to shape safety nets is
all very, very important.''

Gerg thinking about the big trophy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CLARK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN, California (AP) _ Hilde Gerg is an Olympic
gold medalist and a World Cup champion. Now she's got her eye on
the biggest trophy, that of World Cup overall champion.
	   ``Last year I was third in the overall and you think this year
you can perhaps be second or even first, but it's not easy,'' Gerg
said. ``You have to look at how the other girls are skiing.''
	   And the other girls, notably the Austrians, are skiing very well
indeed. Austria's Renate Goetschl won consecutive downhills at Lake
Louise, Alberta, last weekend, and Alexandra Meissnitzer added the
super-G victory at the Canadian resort to a giant slalom triumph
the previous week at Park City, Utah.
	   While Goetschl is primarily a downhiller, Meissnitzer excels in
the downhill, super-G and GS and would appear to be the more
serious challenger for the overall title, skiing's top prize.
	   ``Alexandra Meissnitzer is skiing very well at the moment,''
Gerg said. ``But it's a long season and we will see.''
	   Last season, when Gerg finished third behind teammates Katja
Seizinger and Martina Ertl, Meissnitzer skied to a fifth-place
finish and Goetschl was seventh.
	   Gerg excels in the same events as Meissnitzer, and they'll go
after each other in Thursday's super-G at this California resort.
There's a slalom on Friday in which Gerg, the Olympic champion,
will be among the contenders while Meissnitzer takes the day off.
	   Meissnitzer has had things her way so far, but Gerg might be
ready to change that.
	   ``Mammoth Mountain is a very good slope for me, steep and
difficult,'' said Gerg, who has a victory, a second, a third and a
fifth from previous visits here.
	   Gerg was third in the super-G behind Meissnitzer in Canada, and
teammates Martina Ertl and Regina Haeusl each had fourths in the
downhills won by Goetschl. While not victories, those placements
are reason for German hope early in the season.
	   The German women have been very good in the 1990s, but last year
``was a dream season for us,'' said Gerg, who added a gold medal in
slalom and a bronze in the combined in the Olympics at Nagano,
Japan.
	   ``What happened happened. The success I've had, nobody can take
it from me. It's mine,'' she said. ``But we also want to continue
to ski well. We want to say it wasn't only one season.
	   ``It's very nice to have it, but now it's not going to be so
easy. But I think it's good to have to fight; it's not so bad if
it's not always so easy.''
	   Gerg admits that some of Germany's early problems can be blamed
on the absence of two-time overall champion Katja Seizinger, out
with a knee injury.
	   ``Every girl is skiing for herself, but on the team it's not so
easy to tell who is the leader,'' she said. ``With Katja it was
always easy; if she said something, that meant it was right.''

Researchers say radiation may slow condition that causes blindness
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 1600 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By TAMMY WEBBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Low doses of radiation can slow vision loss in
many patients with a difficult-to-treat condition that blinds
thousands of people every year, a researcher said.
	   The condition, age-related macular degeneration, affects about
170,000 Americans, usually over age 60, and affects more women than
men. The researcher, Dr. Robert Sagerman, was to present results of
his study Wednesday at the annual meeting of the Radiological
Society of North America.
	   ``If this treatment delays progression of the condition by even
two years, it's worth it,'' said Sagerman, professor of radiation
oncology at the Health Science Center at the State University of
New York, Syracuse.
	   Radiation can be used only in the ``wet'' type of macular
degeneration, in which tiny blood vessels break through the
membrane behind the retina and leak blood and fluid, blurring
central vision while leaving peripheral vision intact.
	   The macula, in the center of the retina, is exposed to a low
dose of radiation once a day for up to two weeks, which closes off
blood vessels and stabilizes vision.
	   In Sagerman's study of 146 patients, 90 percent reported that
their vision remained stable after six months, with no side
effects, he said.
	   Laser therapy currently is the standard, but only 15 percent to
20 percent of patients can have the treatment, doctors said.
	   Physicians not involved in the study warned that the long-term
effects of radiation therapy are unknown. Randomized clinical
trials are needed to determine the therapy's effectiveness before
it is recommended, said Dr. Robert Kalina, an ophthalmology
professor at the University of Washington.
	   Sagerman's study had no control group _ patients who get no
treatment _ and participants will be followed for only two years.
	   ``Radiation effects on blood vessels in the optic nerve and on
the retina can show up months or years after treatment,'' Kalina
said. ``Radiation therapy is less precise than laser treatment, so
it treats a wider area and has more potential to have harmful
effects.
	   ``I'm not saying it doesn't work; there's just not enough
information to say it is really a useful treatment.''
	   Sagerman said the dosage used during treatment is low, about
one-fourth of the radiation dosage used for eye cancers. And
because patients already are older _ the average age in his study
was 75 _ long-term negative effects are not a top concern, he said.
	   He said it would be difficult to conduct a clinical trial
because the condition will certainly worsen without treatment, and
nobody wants to be in a control group.
	   ``We have all these people getting older and losing their
eyesight who don't want to wait for a study,'' he said.

German-backed consortium to buy majority share of Uganda Telecom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Uganda has invited an international
consortium to begin negotiations for the purchase of 51 percent of
the state telecommunications company, the International Finance
Corp. said Wednesday.
	   The sale of the majority share of Uganda Telecom Ltd. is part of
Uganda's sweeping economic restructuring and privatization process
that President Yoweri Museveni launched after taking power in 1986.
	   The IFC, the commercial lending arm of the World Bank, has been
acting as financial advisor to the government in the process.
	   The consortium, made up of WorldTel, the International
Telecommunication Union's investment fund, and Detecon, a Deutsche
Telekom subsidiary, bid dlrs 23 million in cash and deferred
payments as the sole bidder in an international tender for shares
of the company, the IFC said.
	   The statement said the sale of the majority share of Uganda
Telecom was the final stage in the privatization of the
telecommunications sector.
	   The process began in 1991 when Uganda Posts and
Telecommunications was split into Uganda Posts, Uganda Telecom Ltd.
and Post Bank.
	   Two private cellular telephone companies _ Celtel and Mobile
Telecommunications Network of South Africa _ are already operating
in the nation of 22.5 million.
	   MTN, which has invested half of an estimated dlrs 70 million in
Uganda, will introduce fixed telephone services early next year.
	   In a report released last week, the IFC said the number of fixed
telephone connections in Uganda will more than double by 2002 to 1
for every 50 people.
	   The said the government will temporarily retain the 49 percent
of shares in UTL which it will eventually sell to private
investors. No one was willing to talk about the value of UTL.
	   The report said 410 of UTL's 1,600 employees would be laid off
after privatization.
	   The demand for telephone lines is projected at 380,000 by 2006
from the current installed base of 51,829 lines, last week's report
said.
	   International inbound traffic is expected to increase from 16
million minutes in 1997 to 176 million minutes in 2006.
	   During the same period, international outbound traffic will
increase from 6 million minutes in 1997 to 92 million minutes in
2006, the report said.

Crown Prince Abdullah to head Saudi delegation to GCC summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Crown Prince Abdullah will head the
Saudi delegation to the annual Gulf Cooperation Council summit
being held in the United Arab Emirates this year, the Arab News
reported Wednesday.
	   The two-day summit, which begins Dec. 7, is expected to draw the
heads of state of the other GCC countries.
	   The GCC is an economic and political alliance which groups Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.
	   This is the fourth summit Abdullah will attend instead of his
ailing brother, King Fahd.
	   Fahd suffered a stroke in 1995 and has largely turned over
day-to-day running of the kingdom to Abdullah, his designated
successor.
	   This year's summit also will be attended by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, South African President Nelson
Mandela and Esmat Abdel-Meguid, secretary-general of the Arab
League.
	   It is the first time dignitaries from outside the Gulf states
have been invited to attend a summit.
	   The Emirates apparently invited the outsiders to give a higher
profile to the summit and to introduce them to the workings of the
GCC.

Aboriginal body furious over Olympic snub
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney Olympics organizers are under
fire from their Aboriginal advisers after choosing a white
Australian to fill a board vacancy.
	   SOCOG president and state government Olympics Minister Michael
Knight was the target of the National Indigenous Advisory
Committee's (NIAC) anger Wednesday after SOCOG chose a former
athlete to replace Rod McGeoch on the board.
	   McGeoch stood down last week citing a campaign of ``personal
vilification'' by unnamed board colleagues. He was replaced by
1950s sprint star Marjorie Jackson-Nelson.
	   NIAC met at SOCOG headquarters Wednesday and chairwoman Lois
O'Donoghue, who had publicly pitched for the board position, said
the committee felt it was being treated as a token by SOCOG.
	   NIAC sent a resolution to Knight earlier this year asking that
an indigenous person be appointed to the board if a vacancy
occurred.
	   ``I don't want to use the word betrayed (but) we are most
unhappy with Minister Knight and his government in the way this
matter was handled,'' said O'Donoghue after Wednesday's meeting.
	   ``He knew of our position and we expected that he would
represent our position adequately and in full to the premier and to
the cabinet. He did not do it.''
	   Knight said NIAC had been given no guarantees that an indigenous
person would be the next appointed to the SOCOG board if another
vacancy occurred.
	   ``We're not doing a tradeoff here, we're not saying if you don't
demonstrate we'll give you something in return,'' Knight said.
``(But) we continue to take a strong stance of supporting a wide
range of indigenous issues.''
	   McGeoch was one of five people appointed to the SOCOG board by
the NSW government and his replacement also had to be approved by
the Carr government and the Australian Olympic Committee.
	   If the board was to be increased to 16 members, there would need
to be a change of legislation.
	   When asked why there needed to be an indigenous presence on the
board, O'Donoghue said, ``the SOCOG board needs a great deal of
sensitizing about the indigenous people of this country and what we
would like portrayed to the world and no-one else can do that.''
	   Prominent Aboriginal activist Charles Perkins said he had
considered resigning from NIAC in protest but had decided to
remain.
	   Last week he described the decision to overlook O'Donoghue as
``blatant racism.'' He was asked again Wednesday if he believed
there was racism involved and said, ``It does seem to be that way
inclined.''
	   O'Donoghue stressed that NIAC was opposed to an indigenous
boycott of the 2000 Games and the committee would do all it could
to prevent that.
	   ``(But) protest is a different matter. Every bugger wants to
stand on a soapbox on an occasion like this to press their
particular course and they will,'' O'Donoghue said.

Manila adopts new guidelines to prevent abuse of female reporters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Guards protecting Philippine
President Joseph Estrada began following new guidelines on
Wednesday in response to sexual harassment complaints from female
reporters.
	   Acting Press Secretary Icasiano Gutierrez said the new policy
was set at a meeting Tuesday among reporters and senior officers of
the Presidential Security Group.
	   During so-called ``ambush interviews'' when reporters approach
Estrada for comments as he walks from one meeting to another, fewer
guards will stand between the president and the journalists who
regularly cover him, Gutierrez said.
	   Instead, most guards will stand outside the circle of reporters,
he said.
	   The decision comes after a number of female journalists, who
make up more than half of the presidential press corps, complained
that guards intentionally touched their breasts or buttocks while
pushing them away from Estrada.
	   On Tuesday, Estrada apologized to reporters after being informed
of the complaints.
	   ``I'm sorry for what happened. I did not know that,'' Estrada
said. ``That will not be repeated, but in the spirit of Christmas,
let us forgive them.''
	   Gutierrez said videotapes of the reported incidents will be
reviewed and appropriate action taken against offenders.
	   Isabel de Leon, a reporter for the Manila Bulletin and former
head of the presidential press corps, said the problem arose
because ``overzealous'' presidential guards put themselves between
Estrada and the reporters.
	   ``We had to stick our recorders and mikes in between the
outstretched arms of the presidential guards,'' she said. ``That is
clearly a situation where guards can take advantage of women
reporters.''
	   De Leon said the corps has recorded at least 10 cases of sexual
abuses by presidential guards.
	   She said that under the new agreement, female reporters can
either immediately slap the face of an offending guard or file a
complaint with his superior officer.
	   Gutierrez said he has scheduled a party for members of the press
corps and the presidential guards to make them more familiar with
each other.
	   ``We are one family. We have to live with each other,'' he said.
	   The chief of the Presidential Security Group, Ruben Domingo,
also apologized Tuesday for his men's actions but said any offenses
were ``not intentional.''
	   Domingo said many of the guards were new to their jobs and the
incidents were due to ``their aggressiveness to do their task.''
	   ``It was overzealousness bordering on disrespect,'' he said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A major Japanese insurer said Wednesday it is
looking into a possible tie-up with U.S. discount brokerage Charles
Schwab and Co.
	   A leading financial daily, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, reported
that Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co. and Schwab plan to set up
an Internet-brokerage venture in Japan.
	   Tokio Marine said a final decision has not been reached.
	   If the deal materializes, Tokio Marine will be the first
Japanese nonlife insurer to enter the securities business under the
so-called Big Bang, a much publicized program by the Japanese
government to ease regulations and stimulate competition.
	   Three other companies, like Tokio Marine also members of the
Mitsubishi industrial group, will invest in the new brokerage, the
Nihon Keizai reported.
	   The paper said the two companies are expected to work out an
agreement by the end of December.
	   The joint venture is expected to be capitalized at between 10
and 20 billion yen (dlrs 82 to 164 million), with Charles Schwab
holding a 50 percent share and Tokio Marine 30 percent.
	   Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp. and
Meiji Life Insurance Co. are likely to take stakes of 5 percent or
10 percent each, Nihon Keizai said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan Tobacco Inc. said Wednesday it will take part
in the dlrs 206 billion settlement between U.S. states and the
tobacco industry for health care reimbursements.
	   Japan Tobacco will chip in about dlrs 1.4 million a year
starting in 2000, as its share in the settlement reached last month
between 46 states and four major U.S. tobacco companies, but its
share may increase over the years, spokesman Yoshiro Go said.
	   Japan Tobacco will also comply with other provisions of the
settlement, including restrictions on advertising and the targeting
of minors, but such terms will not affect its business in Japan, he
said.
	   Although it has not been sued in the United States, Japan
Tobacco decided to join the settlement Monday because that was seen
as a better business decision in the long term, Go said.
	   Japan Tobacco sells about 800 million cigarettes a year in the
United States, for a market share of about 0.15 percent.
	   At home, where it sells 256 billion cigarettes a year, or about
77 percent of the market, it is facing four lawsuits over alleged
tobacco-related illnesses.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways
said Wednesday it is pulling out of negotiations for a possible
buy-in of ailing Philippine Airlines.
	   ``We're not willing to continue negotiations with PAL in its
current form,'' said Peter Foster, Cathay Pacific's regional
manager for the Philippines and Taiwan. He said the negotiations
have been going on for six weeks.
	   Foster declined to cite any reason but said the company would
explain its decision in a statement to be released later Wednesday
by Cathay Pacific's head office in Hong Kong.
	   PAL earlier accepted a preliminary investment offer from Cathay
Pacific, and the companies announced Nov. 10 that they would draw
up a comprehensive plan to rehabilitate the debt-laden Philippine
flag carrier.
	   Since then, the companies have had disagreements over management
control of PAL and the number of PAL workers to be laid off,
according to Philippine government officials.
	   President Joseph Estrada said he would try to arrange a meeting
of the two airlines and convince them to resume negotiations.
	   PAL says it is unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of
debt due to mounting losses worsened by its labor problems and
Asia's currency crisis.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia has defied the Asian
economic crisis and recorded economic growth of 5 percent,
according to figures released Wednesday.
	   Australia's gross domestic product rose 1 percent in the three
months to September 30 from the previous three months, and rose 5
percent year-on-year, the Australian Bureau of Statistics
announced.
	   News of the growth came just hours after the country's central
Reserve Bank cut official interest rates by 0.25 percentage points,
to 4.75 percent.
	   Prime Minister John Howard said the figures were a reminder that
Australia had become the economic strongman of the western Pacific.
	   ``We've got booming economic growth, we've got the lowest
interest rates in 30 years and we've just introduced a tax reform
package that is going to build an even stronger Australian
economy,'' Howard told reporters.
	   A key factor was robust exports. While 70 percent went to Asia
before the crisis struck last year, Australian exporters have
managed to find new customers in Europe and North America.
	   Strong spending by consumers and business owners also fueled the
economy, the bureau reported.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Apple Computer will open an office in
Thailand to boost its marketing efforts as its troubled Thai
distributor cuts back on promotional budgets, the Bangkok Post
reported Wednesday.
	   Thailand is the U.S. computer-maker's second largest market in
Asia with 85,000 users, 90 percent of whom use Apple products for
design and publishing work, company officials were quoted as
saying.
	   Apple executives are hoping to increase sales with the
introduction of their new iMac model, the newspaper said.
	   Graham Long, Apple's president of Asia Pacific operations, was
quoted as saying that its Thai distributor, Sahaviriya Office
Automation, was doing less marketing than in the past.
	   He cited no reason for Sahaviriya's reduced marketing role, but
the company has been hard hit by Thailand's economic and financial
crises.
	   ``We are now being more aggressive in marketing Apple,'' Long
was quoted as saying by the Post. He also said the company had
recently opened an office in South Korea.

Israel trying three Lebanese on charges of aiding guerrillas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Three Lebanese, including an officer in an
Israeli-backed militia, are being tried in Israel for helping
Hezbollah guerrillas who are fighting to oust Israeli troops from
south Lebanon.
	   A military court statement Wednesday said the three passed
intelligence to Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim guerrilla group, for
more than a year and also supplied them with explosive charges.
	   The trial is being held behind closed doors, but the court
released the names of two of the accused, Bulos Abu-Zeid, an
officer in the Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army and Ibrahim
Abu-Zeid. The third defendant was not named.
	   Israeli troops occupy a strip of land in south Lebanon to
protect Israel's northern border from attacks by the Hezbollah.
	   The military prosecutor submitted confessions signed by the
accused, but they said these were not given voluntarily, and the
court is currently considering whether the confessions are
acceptable.
	   Israel's Shin Bet security service is permitted by law to use
what is called ``moderate physical and psychological pressure'' but
many Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners have said their confessions
were extracted under torture.

Transatlantic newcomer suspends flights after 3 months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Geneva-based Swiss World Airways,
facing financial troubles, has suspended flights until further
notice, a Swiss federal aviation official said Wednesday.
	   The firm started scheduled flights from Geneva to Newark, New
Jersey, in September following months of bureaucratic and financial
delays.
	   It has been operating six return flights a week with its single
Boeing 767 jet.
	   SWA was founded in 1996 following national flag carrier
Swissair's controversial decision to cut costs by transferring most
long-haul flights to Zurich. The move caused outrage among the
French-speaking population of western Switzerland.
	   Swissair still operates a daily return flight between Geneva and
New York.
	   SWA had planned to operate its first flight last December, but
delays in sorting out contractual issues delayed government
clearance.
	   State authorities in western Switzerland and private investors
helped finance the airline and company executives planned to
acquire more aircraft.
	   Geneva state authorities on Monday refused to bail SWA out. The
company requested a suspension of flights Tuesday, said Daniel
Ruhier of the Swiss Office of Federal Aviation.
	   The office is awaiting more details from the airline on its
future, he added.

Athletes consider stripping after funding rejection
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ An Australian synchronized swimming
competitor is considering an offer to pose nude in Playboy Magazine
because a lack of government funding, a spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Synchronized Swimming Australia president Peter Young, speaking
after a request for an extra funding was knocked back Wednesday,
said an approach had been made to a member of the national team.
	   ``We actually have received an offer,'' Young said. ``But the
team won't be (stripping) and it won't be an officially sanctioned
action by the association.
	   ``If anyone does it, it will be on an individual basis and it
will be a matter of them obtaining finances to help pay their way
through the team.''
	   Government funding for synchronized swimming will drop from
Australian dlrs 255,000 (U.S. dlrs 160,000) in 1997-98 to
Australian dlrs 107,000 (U.S. dlrs 67,000) in 1999-2000. Just under
half that figure goes to national coach Debbie Muir, a former
Canadian Olympic gold medalist, who gets Australian dlrs 50,000
(U.S. dlrs 31,000) a year.
	   Young sought another Australian dlrs 200,000 (U.S. dlrs 126,000)
from the government up until the September 2000 Games in Sydney.
	   A spokesman for Sports Minister Jackie Kelly said Young did not
raise the possibility of swimmers appearing in Playboy if the
funding was not increased.
	   ``It raises the question of how serious the proposal is and
whether this is just a media stunt,'' the spokesman said. ``I would
have thought that they risk putting off potential sponsors if they
appear desperate.''

President expected to name Salim Hoss as new premier
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ President Emile Lahoud was expected on
Wednesday to name the American-educated economist Salim Hoss as the
next prime minister of Lebanon.
	   Hoss secured a majority of recommendations from the Parliament
after the current premier, Rafik Hariri, bowed out in a power
struggle with Lahoud.
	   Hoss, a member of Parliament for Beirut who turns 69 on Dec. 20,
has held the premiership on four previous occasions.
	   Hariri's Cabinet has been serving in a caretaker capacity since
Lahoud's inauguration last week.
	   Hariri, 53, a billionaire businessman, launched the multibillion
dollar reconstruction of Lebanon during his six years in office and
restored economic confidence in postwar Lebanon.
	   But he rejected Lahoud's request to form a new government after
Lahoud's survey of Parliament members _ required by the
constitution _ gave him a majority but not the overwhelming support
he had had in the past.
	   Lahoud on Tuesday began a new poll of the Parliament, and this
time Hoss apparently got majority backing.
	   Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said Hoss had the support of 95
of the 128 lawmakers in the half-Christian, half-Muslim
legislature.
	   A presidential decree appointing Hoss was expected later
Wednesday.
	   Hoss is a Sunni Muslim, like every prime minister under
Lebanon's power-sharing arrangement. The president is a Maronite
Catholic, and the Parliament speaker is a Shiite Muslim.
	   His style of government is expected to be quite different from
the flamboyant Hariri.
	   Hoss is expected to maintain a good working relationship with
Lahoud, the 62-year-old assertive army commander who was elected by
an overwhelming vote in Parliament. Lahoud has pledged to clean up
the graft-riddled administration.
	   With security established across much of the country after the
1975-90 civil war, Hoss takes over the premiership with economic
development and government reform as the major challenges.
	   Hoss will have to calm markets made nervous by the sudden
departure of Hariri.
	   The Central bank, fearing a run on the Lebanese pound, has
expressed readiness to intervene with its foreign currency
reserves.
	   Like almost all politicians in Lebanon, Hoss is an ally of
Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon, where Syria still
maintains some 30,000 troops.
	   Hoss, who earned an advanced degree in business and economics
from Indiana University at Bloomington, has a reputation as an
honest politician
	   He first served as prime minister in 1976 in the early days of
the civil war and also was prime minister in 1987, after Prime
Minister Rashid Karami was assassinated. He was named to the post
again in 1989 under President Rene Mouawad and the following year
under President Elias Hrawi.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A contingent from China's military joined U.S.
armed forces for the first time in a search and rescue exercise
conducted Wednesday, U.S. and Hong Kong officials said.
	   Boats from the Hong Kong garrison of China's People's Liberation
Army joined 220 U.S. air force and coast guard personnel off Hong
Kong's outlying Lantau island, the Civil Aviation Department said
in a statement.
	   U.S. forces included personnel from the Joint Rescue
Coordination Center in Honolulu, the Kulis Air National Guard Base
in Alaska, and Kadena Air Base in Japan. The U.S. Coast Guard
cutter ``Rush'' joined them from Honolulu, the statement added.
	   U.S. Consulate officials said both the U.S. and China were
invited by the Hong Kong government in ``a humanitarian effort to
create a climate of working together.''
	   ``If the need for a rescue arises, we will all have a way of
communicating with each other,'' said Information Officer Barbara
Zigli of the U.S. Consulate.
	   The statement from the Hong Kong civil aviation authorities also
said that Macau, Thailand, Brunei, and Singapore were invited to
attend as observers.
	   PLA boats planned to move into the South China Sea along with
the U.S. Coast Guard cutter in response to a simulated plane crash
off Lantau island 130 kilometers (80.6 miles) south of the
territory, the statement added.
	   This was the first large scale search and rescue exercise since
the opening of the dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport on the
island and also the first since Hong Kong's handover to Chinese
rule last July.
	   The U.S. Navy, Coast Guard and Air Force have conducted annual
exercises with Hong Kong search and rescue teams since 1976. China
and the U.S. signed joint agreements to conduct military exercises
when U.S. President Bill Clinton visited Beijing in July.

	   UTARLAI, India (AP) _ Barely six months after shocking the world
with a series of underground nuclear tests, India is holding its
largest military exercise of the decade near its border with rival
Pakistan.
	   More than 60,000 soldiers, 300 tanks and 160 aircraft are
participating in the 10-day exercise in the state of Rajasthan, 400
miles (650 kms) southwest of the capital, New Delhi.
	   Indian military officers said on condition of anonymity that
Pakistan had mobilized nearly 20,000 troops along the border in
response to the exercises. The claim was denied by an official in
Pakistan's Defense Ministry in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad,
who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Lt. Gen. H.M. Khanna, the Indian military commander, called the
exercises, which began over the weekend, ``a review of our doctrine
in the situation of nuclear balance.''
	   India conducted its nuclear tests in nearby Pokharan in May.
Pakistan responded with its own tests two weeks later, raising
fears of a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent. India and
Pakistan have fought three wars since they won independence from
Britain in 1947,
	   Brigadier D.K. Babbar said soldiers were being trained in
nuclear and chemical warfare but insisted the training was ``not
something new.''
	   The troops of both nations were more than 80 miles (130 kms)
apart, in keeping with international norms for military exercises,
Indian military officers said on condition of anonymity.
	   Eleven years ago, India held a large military exercise that
raised fears of another war between the hostile neighbors. Talks
eventually defused the tensions.
	   Pakistan protested vehemently when India announced plans to hold
this year's exercise, and the issue was discussed during a series
of talks in New Delhi.

Ex-Mountie and drug suspect recaptured in Portugal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ A former Mountie accused of taking more than dlrs
500,000 (dlrs U.S. 325,000) in payoffs as a mole for a Colombian
drug cartel has been arrested in Portugal after dodging authorities
for several years.
	   Jorge Leite, who allegedly took bribes and sabotaged drug
investigations while with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's drug
squad in Montreal, is being held in a Lisbon jail pending trial,
the Toronto Star reported Wednesday.
	   Leite, 48, was picked up by Portuguese police Friday. An
international Interpol warrant had been issued for him when he
failed to show up for trial in Portugal earlier this year.
	   He appeared before a Portuguese judge Monday, RCMP Insp. Yves
Roussel said Tuesday.
	   ``A trial date should be fixed before Christmas,'' he said.
	   Leite was charged by Portuguese police earlier this year with
corruption and fraud.
	   The charges relate to crimes he allegedly committed while with
the Mounties between March and May of 1991. Leite was first charged
in Canada in 1993 with one count of bribery, one count of fraud and
one count of breach of trust.
	   According to information the Mounties have filed in courts in
Canada and Portugal, Leite is said to have received more than dlrs
500,000 (dlrs U.S. 325,000) in cash and benefits while working as a
mole for the Cali drug cartel.
	   During a three-month period in 1991 _ just before he fled Canada
_ Leite is alleged to have provided Colombian drug barons with RCMP
intelligence on drug investigations and individuals on at least 49
different occasions.
	   He left Canada in May 1991, just ahead of internal affairs
investigators, who suspected he was the mole who had warned drug
lords about impending drug busts.
	   Portugal does not extradite its nationals, but agreed to put
Leite _ who has dual nationality _ on trial after intensive
lobbying by the Canadian government.
	   Leite faces 14 years in prison in Portugal if convicted.

South Korean Buddhist monks fight over money, power
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By KYONG-HWA SEOK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The gray-robed monks of the Chogye
Buddhist order are generally a meditative lot, spending long hours
in silent search of spiritual enlightenment.
	   But not lately.
	   For the past three weeks, thousands of them have been fighting
each other with fists, rocks, fire bombs and clubs over matters far
more temporal and mundane: power and money.
	   Their frequent clashes at the order's main temple in downtown
Seoul have been captured by television cameras, sending surreal
images such as this into millions of South Korean homes:
	   In the middle of a melee, a portly, middle-aged monk swings a
collapsible metal chair at a fellow monk wearing a bright yellow
construction hard hat atop his shaven head.
	   Or this:
	   A monk wearing what appears to be combat boots tries to scale a
barricade barring the main door of the order's administrative
building. From above, a rival dumps the contents of a chamber pot
on his head.
	   The latest brawl this week left 37 people injured, some
seriously, and the two main sanctuaries on the temple grounds badly
damaged.
	   It also left many of South Korea's 8 million lay Buddhists
dismayed.
	   At the heart of the dispute is a political struggle for control
of the Chogye order, the largest in South Korea. An early
resolution does not appear likely and riot police stood guard
around the temple Wednesday against a new outbreak of trouble.
	   It began when the head of the order, Song Wol-ju, sought a third
four-year term. Opponents seized his office early last month,
effectively blocking his re-election.
	   ``Their main concern is certainly not the religion itself. It is
so-called worldly desires _ money and power,'' said Kwon Ki-jong, a
professor of Buddhism studies at Seoul's Dongkuk University.
	   Under public pressure, Song later offered to resign but his
followers refused to give in and tried to oust opponents from the
temple grounds.
	   ``This whole dispute was caused by some greedy, corrupt,
power-oriented monks. We are determined to reform the order at any
cost,'' said Wol Tan, a spokesman for the anti-Song monks.
	   ``The people who have seized the office building are not monks
but hoodlums. We cannot possibly let them lead the order. And it is
clear which side the public supports,'' said Ji Sun, a spokesman
for Song.
	   The public, however, appears to support neither side.
	   ``The monks are more like politicians than monks. And they know
that the winner gets everything and the loser gets nothing,'' said
Yoon Won-chul, a professor of religious studies at Seoul National
University.
	   The winner gets to control an annual budget of 12 billion won
(dlrs 9.2 million), billions of won (millions of dollars) in
property and appoint 1,700 monks to various duties.
	   Losers in past struggles were accused of corruption and deprived
of their status as monks.
	   Yoon said it is an open secret that many monks, once they take
control of an order, begin to amass wealth _ houses and expensive
cars _ through donations by worshipers.
	   He also said many Korean Buddhist monks are not well educated
and if they leave their temples they are ill equipped to support
themselves in the outside world.
	   ``Those who are not interested in power and money stay in their
temples and rarely make public appearances. And hearing about this
dispute, they will become even more reluctant to be involved,''
Yoon said.
	   ``In the meantime, the order's high-ranking jobs get filled with
monks who are much more interested in power than the religion
itself. It is a vicious cycle,'' Yoon said.
	   Wednesday, as several monks strolled the temple grounds strewn
with garbage, broken lumber, the burned remains of Molotov
cocktails and other debris, an angry laywoman shouted at them:
	   ``This is a place for Buddha. You hoodlums get out of here!''
	   ``Monks are supposed to be spiritual guides to people. They
should be ashamed of what they are doing,'' she lamented. ``What
would Buddha say about this?''

Russia seeks loan money from IMF, but none expected
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus
met top Russian leaders Wednesday, but he wasn't expected to
announce the release of frozen loans that Moscow badly wants to pay
off mounting debts.
	   The stakes are high: Russia owes billions of dollars to workers,
pensioners and foreign creditors and wants the IMF to provide new
installments on a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package. The loans were
negotiated this summer, but have been on hold since the latest
economic crisis hit in August.
	   The IMF has been demanding a realistic recovery plan from the
Russian government and has so far been unimpressed with Moscow's
efforts.
	   Camdessus arrived Tuesday night and met with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, and they held additional talks Wednesday.
Speaking to reporters Wednesday morning, Primakov sought to lower
expectations.
	   ``Don't measure the significance of Camdessus' visit by how much
money he brought,'' Primakov said. ``He has come with an attache
case containing documents, not cash.''
	   ``We are exchanging opinions,'' Primakov said, adding that he
was satisfied with their initial meeting Tuesday evening. ``You
shouldn't think that the question of giving money to Russia will be
solved now.''
	   The IMF froze the loan installments after Russia's government
devalued the ruble and defaulted on some debts in August. Moscow is
still seeking all, or at least part, of a dlrs 4.3 billion
installment that was originally planned for September.
	   Primakov's government has moved cautiously, refraining from any
radical measures and hoping that the IMF and other lenders will
offer help.
	   The government delayed a debate this week on next year's budget
as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet
expenses.
	   The Cabinet insisted the delay was not connected with Camdessus'
visit, but the Russian media have suggested the government put off
action on the budget because it still believes the IMF money could
come soon. The latest budget draft assumes Russia will receive the
IMF loan.
	   If the Russian government doesn't get foreign help soon, it's
expected to start printing money, which would drive up inflation
and further imperil Russia's fragile economy, Primakov and other
officials warned.
	   An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's
revenue forecast for next year was overly optimistic. It also
disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes, offer
subsidies to ailing industries and increase state regulation of the
economy.
	   However, First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov insisted
that Russia will go its own way and assailed the IMF for what he
called its unfair assessment of the government's intentions.
	   ``They assess every step toward reason as a step toward
administrative controls over the economy,'' Maslyukov was quoted as
saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Russia has so far received only about dlrs 5 billion of the dlrs
22.6 billion bailout package, which also involves the World Bank
and the Japanese government.
	   Meanwhile, Central Bank chairman Viktor Geraschenko outlined the
country's economic woes in an address Wednesday to parliament's
upper house, the Federation Council.
	   Russia's economy has shrunk about 5 to 6 percent compared to a
year ago and inflation is up an estimated 70 percent compared to
last December, he said. The government will try to limit inflation
to 30 percent next year, he added.

Army says it has recaptured border outposts from rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The government said Wednesday that its
troops recaptured two positions from rebel units near the border
with Eritrea.
	   The army inflicted heavy casualties on the rebels Tuesday and
drove the rest back, according to a statement from the army.
	   It said the soldiers seized ammunition and weapons left by the
fleeing rebels.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the rebel side.
	   On Tuesday, the rebels said they fought off a four-pronged
government attack in the Nuba Mountains in west-central Sudan.
	   An alliance of northern political parties and the Sudan People's
Liberation Army has been waging a guerrilla war along the Eritrean
border since 1996 to try to topple Sudan's Islamic regime.
	   Lt. Gen. Omar el-Bashir took power in a military coup in 1989
and installed an Islamic government.
	   The SPLA has waged an insurrection since 1983 to try to win
greater autonomy for the South's Christians and animists. More than
1.5 million Sudanese have died in the fighting and resulting
famines.

Transatlantic newcomer suspends flights after three months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Just three months after taking to the
skies, Geneva-based Swiss World Airways has suspended flights
because of financial troubles, a Swiss aviation official said
Wednesday.
	   The airline started flying flights between Geneva and Newark,
New Jersey, in September following months of bureaucratic and
financial delays. It had been operating six return flights between
the two cities a week with its single Boeing 767 jet.
	   After unsuccessfully asking Geneva state authorities to bail the
airline out, the company requested a suspension of flights Tuesday,
said Daniel Ruhier of the Swiss Office of Federal Aviation. The
office is awaiting more details from the airline on its future, he
added.
	   SWA was founded in 1996 following national flag carrier
Swissair's controversial decision to cut costs by transferring most
long-haul flights to Zurich. The move caused outrage among the
French-speaking population of western Switzerland.
	   Swissair still operates a daily return flight between Geneva and
New York.

Cambodia sends delegation to lobby for U.N. seat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor Nam
Hong will lead a delegation Friday to New York to lobby for the
swift return of the Southeast Asian nation's seat at the United
Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Ministry said Wednesday
	   After gaining Parliamentary approval for his coalition
government Monday, Prime Minister Hun Sen said reclaiming
Cambodia's vacant U.N. seat would be a top priority of his new
administration.
	   The Foreign Ministry would not provide further details about Hor
Nam Hong's trip, a key step toward gaining international legitimacy
for the new government and restarting suspended foreign aid.
	   Cambodia's status at the U.N. has been in limbo since Hun Sen
ousted his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a coup
last year.
	   Rival diplomats loyal to each man presented competing claims to
the U.N.'s Credential Committee after the coup. The committee
deferred its decision on who should occupy it, leaving the seat
vacant.
	   The committee postponed a decision a second time in October
after disputes over Hun Sen's narrow victory in July's
parliamentary election failed to produce a new government.
	   Ranariddh bowed to international pressure last month and struck
a coalition deal in which Hun Sen became sole prime minister and
the prince was named National Assembly president.

French police detain 20 people in immigration crackdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French police arrested 20 people suspected of
involvement in illegal immigration from Sri Lanka in pre-dawn raids
Wednesday in Paris and the suburbs, police said.
	   At least 6 of the 20 people arrested were without valid
residency permits to allow them to legally live in France.
	   The arrests were made on a warrant aimed at breaking up a ring
suspected of smuggling Sri Lankan citizens into France, police
said.
	   French police believe two networks were at work, one bringing
Sri Lankans through Russia, Germany and then to France and the
other bringing them to France via Austria and Italy.
	   For the past two years, several dozen illegal immigrants have
managed to arrive in France from Sri Lanka, paying up to 50,000
francs (dlrs 8,865) for the journey, police said.
	   For 10,000 francs (dlrs 1769) extra, the immigrants would be
smuggled into Britain.
	   Several of the leaders of the ring were detained in Wednesday's
raids.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has granted more residency permits
to illegal immigrants than the previous conservative government. It
has legalized the status of some 76,000 illegal immigrants but has
rejected residency requested by more than 64,000 others.

Philippine peso hits six-month high; stocks fall on profit-taking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso breached the
psychologically important level of 39 pesos per dollar Wednesday
and hit a six-month high on strong dollar inflows, traders said.
	   The main stock index, meanwhile, fell 1.9 percent on
profit-taking.
	   The bulk of the dollar inflows were from Filipinos working
overseas, traders said.
	   The peso hit a high of 38.940 pesos per dollar in midafternoon
trading, its highest level since reaching 38.830 pesos to the
dollar on June 3.
	   The dollar averaged 39.101 pesos for the day, down from 39.342
pesos Tuesday. It ranged between 38.940 pesos and 39.270 pesos and
was last traded at 39.010 pesos.
	   An estimated 4.5 million Filipinos work abroad and sent home at
least dlrs 6 billion last year. Their foreign-exchange remittances
provide an important contribution to the Philippine economy, and
are expected to help support the peso over the rest of the year.
	   The Philippine Central Bank wasn't active in the spot market and
held its overnight borrowing and lending rates at 13.375 percent
and 15.375 percent, respectively.
	   In stock trading, shares declined as investors continued to cash
in on recent gains in the absence of positive, market-moving news,
traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 35.79 points,
or 1.9 percent, to 1,886.00, adding to its 53.57-point, or 2.7
percent, loss Tuesday.
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers 80 to 34, while 31 were
unchanged.
	   Anticipation of worse-than-previously-expected November
inflation data also gave investors an excuse to unload their
holdings, said Edwin Siao, trader for institutional sales of Abacus
Securities Corp.
	   Economists earlier projected the inflation rate for October at
10.1 percent, down from the previous month's 10.2 percent. But
traders said speculative talk that circulated in the market
Wednesday indicated a higher inflation rate for October was
possible.
	   The inflation data is due to be released either Friday or
Monday.
	   Siao said the market's recent correction wasn't surprising since
it has showed considerable strength of late, boosting most share
prices to overbought levels.
	   ``We were even expecting the market correction to take place
sooner,'' he said.
	   ``The current market correction is healthy. Toward the end of
the year, the market will come out strong,'' he said.
	   Siao said while there may not be any sign at this point of a
full economic recovery, investor sentiment has become more upbeat.
	   ``Many are starting to feel that the economy may not be as bad
as earlier feared and that we may in fact be in a better position
than other regional economies,'' he said.
	   Traders said much of the optimism on the part of investors
stemmed from the third quarter economic data released last week,
which yielded a 0.8 percent gross national product growth rate,
much better than earlier expectations of a contraction or flat
growth.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two people died of hypothermia overnight in Moscow
as temperatures dipped to minus 19 Celsius (minus 2 Fahrenheit), a
news report said Wednesday.
	   Temperatures have been lower than normal in recent weeks, and 48
people have frozen to death on the streets of the Russian capital,
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Many of the victims are homeless people who either fall asleep

OSCE ministers focus on group's toughest challenge: Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) - The Kosovo observer mission of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation and Europe was at the top
of concerns to be addressed by the group's two-day foreign
ministerial meeting that opened Wednesday.
	   The OSCE is sending 2,000 unarmed observers to the strife-torn
province of Yugoslavia to ensure adherence to a truce that was
agreed to under the threat of NATO airstrikes in October.
	   ``Kosovo is the latest, and probably the largest, of the
challenges facing the OSCE. Its role in Kosovo highlights its
importance as an instrument for practical crisis management,'' said
Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik in an opening
statement.
	   The organization, whose 54 members include the United States,
has been expanding its scope since the end of the Cold War and
Bondevik, whose country takes over the OSCE's rotating chairmanship
in January, said ''Our ability to manage crises, and assist
democratic and economic reforms, is greatly enhanced.''
	   But Bondevik said the group cannot carry out its tasks alone,
and needs the cooperation of the United Nations, NATO, and the
Council of Europe.
	   In Kosovo, hundreds have been killed and up to 300,000 mainly
ethnic Albanians have been displace since Serbia launched a
crackdown on separatists in February. Kosovo is a province of
Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslavia's President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a
U.S.-brokered truce that is shaky and troubled by sporadic
violence. The deal included allowing 2,000 members of the Kosovo
Verification Mission into the province under NATO protection.
	   About 400 observers are already in place, and will continue to
arrive at the rate of about 250 a week until the total is reached
in late January, according to Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut
Vollebaek.
	   At the opening of the Oslo meeting, Polish Foreign Minister
Bronislaw Geremek, the current chairman of the OSCE, said the
difficult and risky task of sending observers to Kosovo is an
important test for the organization.
	   ``Next year will be crucial to the role of the OSCE in the
public eye,'' he said.
	   Although the Seventh Ministerial Meeting of the OSCE drew
foreign ministers from about 45 countries, some key countries _
including the United States and Britain _ sent lower ranking
delegations.
	   At the end of the meeting, the ministers hope to adopt a
declaration that includes resolutions giving full support to the
mission in Kosovo.

Thailand to open first Islamic Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's first Islamic bank will open
on Dec. 14, and if it succeeds, more will follow, a senior official
at the Government Savings Bank said on Wednesday.
	   ``We will make a further assessment from the operation of the
first branch, and we are optimistic that commercial banks will soon
take part in the Islamic banking system,'' said Narrin Koeydul,
director for the GSB's southern region where most Thai Muslims
live.
	   In line with Islamic principles, the bank will not charge or pay
interest to borrowers and depositors. Instead, profit from
investments made with deposits will be redistributed to depositors.
	   The banks will also only lend money for ventures that comply
with Islamic law.
	   ``One would not be able to borrow money from the bank and open
up a liquor store,'' said Narrin, noting that drinking alcohol
violates the Muslim religious tradition.
	   The first branch will open in Satun Province, 970 kilometers
(602 miles) south of Bangkok, bordering Malaysia. Satun is one of
the four southern provinces where about 80 percent of the local
population is Muslim.
	   Though the opening is a move in the right direction for
Thailand's Muslim community, the plan lacks vision because it
doesn't cater to investors, said Ismail Ali, former dean of Islamic
Studies at Prince Songkhla University.
	   ``The operation involves mainly deposits and savings,'' Ali
said. ``The government needs to understand that the bank can
provide the private sector with the necessary tools for them to
make their business grow,'' he said.
	   To ensure that the current system remains in line with Islamic
principles, each branch will have a committee made up of Muslim
scholars to determine whether or not funding requests violate the
teachings of Islam.
	   Thai banking officials studied the Islamic banking model in
Malaysia, which also serves non-Muslims, before giving the green
light of an Islamic bank in Thailand.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 1,000 Indonesian students
converged outside the presidential palace Wednesday in the boldest
anti-government protest since security forces shot nine
demonstrators last month.
	   Other groups of students demonstrated outside several government
buildings and near the home of former President Suharto, who
resigned in May after riots and protests against his 32-year
authoritarian rule.
	   The rally at the heavily guarded palace of Suharto's successor,
President B.J. Habibie, appeared to take security forces by
surprise.
	   Students in a convoy of cars and buses slipped into the area via
a side street and began chanting anti-military slogans as riot
officers with sticks and shields looked on. Five small tanks
wheeled into position in front of the palace.
	   ``Hang Suharto,'' shouted the protesters, who want the
77-year-old former army general to be charged with corruption and
human rights abuses.
	   They also demanded that military chief Gen. Wiranto be held
accountable for the Nov. 13 shooting deaths by troops of nine
student protesters during a government assembly on political
reform.
	   ``We will keep protesting until we have justice,'' said Yoke,
one of the demonstrators.
	   More than 160 soldiers who were involved in the clashes with
students have been confined to their barracks for three weeks and
the military says they could face court-martialing.
	   Earlier in the day, security forces blocked 300 students who
drove in buses toward Suharto's house, a frequent target of
protests. Some protesters roughed up a suspected plainclothes
policeman.
	   Habibie has ordered a new probe into the wealth of Suharto, his
onetime mentor. But a panel of investigators has yet to be formed
and opponents question whether the process will be impartial.
	   An earlier investigation by the attorney general's office turned
up no evidence of wrongdoing and student protesters labeled it a
whitewash. Critics say Suharto's family built billion-dollar
business empires partly with state resources.
	   Also Wednesday, several hundred students demonstrated outside
the office of Attorney General Andi Mohamad Ghalib to press for a
trial of Suharto.
	   Another group gathered outside the office of the national
election council to demand that general elections, scheduled by
Habibie next year, be held on time.
	   Habibie has allowed new political parties to form and taken
other steps to dismantle Suharto's rigid political system, but
students say he is moving too slowly on democratic reforms.
	   Habibie said Wednesday that reform could only come through the
legal process and that there were limits to what street protests
could achieve.
	   ``Indonesians have to implement reforms through constitutional
means because it is impossible to implement reforms on the
street,'' he said.
	   A newspaper reported Wednesday that members of Jakarta's city
council have asked protesters not to take to the streets during
Ramadan, the forthcoming Muslim holy fasting month.
	   Ramadan is expected to start on Dec. 19 and is observed by
Muslims as a period of spiritual reflection and prayer.
	   ``Staging a street rally in the city would certainly cause heavy
traffic congestion, which, in turn, could easily make other people
angry,'' said councilor Ida Mawaddah Noor, as quoted by The Jakarta
Post newspaper.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
making it the world's most populous Islamic state.
	   Indonesia, which is suffering its worst economic crisis in
decades, has endured several outbreaks of religious violence
recently.
	   Muslim mobs burned and ransacked Christian churches in Jakarta
last month and Christian rioters in Kupang, a provincial capital,
targeted mosques this week.

Bosnia rail workers strike against unpaid wages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Hundreds of rail workers in
the Muslim-Croat half of Bosnia went on strike Wednesday to protest
unpaid wages. But, with hardly any trains rolling anyway, the
strike is expected to affect few customers.
	   The strikers promised to keep operating trains that service
NATO-led peace troops, the army and some users in central Bosnia
because they all pay for the service. Only a few local runs, which
service a handful of commuters, are expected to halt.
	   The railway workers, who haven't been paid for four months, also
protest the failure of the government, and international officials
charged with reconstruction, to link the railway service across
Bosnia and to other countries.
	   The post-war unification of the Bosnian railroad network is
required under the 1995 peace agreement. But Bosnian Serbs insist
on a separate railroad company for their half of the country.
	   The international community has invested more than dlrs 15
million to repair tracks, junctions and bridges on main railway
lines across Bosnia and blame feuding politicians for functioning
is political.
	   The 3 1/2 year war stopped in 1995 with a peace agreement that
divided the country in two halves, one for the Bosnian Serbs and
the other to be shared by the Muslims and the Croats.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A drunken late night dispute over a
microphone in a Phnom Penh karaoke parlor ended in a rain of
bullets and the death of two military policeman, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   Luy Sony, 30, and Sam Sinal, 31, were shot several times by
three assailants early Tuesday morning after they refused to give
up the parlor's single karaoke microphone to another table, the Koh
Santepheap newspaper reported.
	   A waitress' insistence that the heavily drunken soldiers share
it enraged one of the men, who stormed into the back of the parlor,
grabbed an ax and smashed the microphone.
	   The three other men then rose from their chairs, drew pistols
and shot Luy Sony six times and Sam Sinal twice before fleeing the
scene.
	   Municipal authorities recently blamed an increase in violent
crime on the proliferation of illegally owned weapons. Statistics
show that 297 people died in crimes in the first nine months of the
year, more than all of 1997.
	   Cambodia is awash with weapons left over from decades of civil
war and strife. Assault rifles and handguns are a common sight.
Firearms, ammunition and even hand grenades can be cheaply bought
at markets.

Vietnamese authorities burn 25 tons of ``poisonous'' cultural items
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Hundreds of spectators watched as Ho Chi
Minh City officials burned 25 tons of ``poisonous'' cultural items
Tuesday, including movies, music and billboards, an official from
the city's culture department said.
	   The items, which depicted illicit violence and sex, included
16,683 videotape cassettes, 13,454 compact discs, 3,238 video
compact discs, 1,559 music cassettes and 9,742 books, along with
magazines, billboards and gambling machines, the official said
Wednesday.
	   Twenty trucks were needed to haul it all to the city's
incineration ground, which also is where criminals sentenced to the
death penalty are executed.
	   The items were confis1cated by Customs officials at the city's
international checkpoints and during crackdowns on cultural items
over the past year, he said.
	   It was the fourth such destruction in three years since the
government launched a campaign against social vices, including
``poisonous'' cultural items, drug addiction, prostitution and
gambling.
	   Incineration was chosen after items run over by steamrollers at
the first two events were looted by spectators, the official said.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The estranged wife of Royal
Philips Electronics' chief Wednesday left the hospital where she
was treated for injuries suffered in a brutal attack last month.
	   Hansje Boonstra-Raatjes checked out of the hospital and went to
a secret location to continue her recovery from the Nov. 13
abduction and attack, Dutch television reported.
	   Boonstra-Raatjes, 62, who is separated from Philips president
Cor Boonstra, was kidnapped, brutally beaten, handcuffed, strangled
and left for dead in a deserted parking lot in the coastal Dutch
town of Hoek van Holland.
	   She suffered a broken arm, broken fingers, a serious head injury
and was nearly blinded in one eye, according to media reports.
	   Dozens of police detectives are on the case, but investigators
have not yet determined who was behind the attack and have made no
arrests. Although kidnapping has been mentioned as the most likely
motive, no ransom note was ever found.
	   Boonstra-Raatjes reportedly told authorities she was bundled
into a car in the northern Belgian city of Antwerp, close to the
Dutch border. Belgian police have searched homes in the area.
	   Philips is Europe's largest maker of consumer electronics.

<SLUG> Parliament committee agrees to cut subsidies to racist parties </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A parliamentary committee unanimously
agreed Wednesday on a bill to cut subsidies to parties judged
racist, following weeks of haggling over public funding for the
extreme right Vlaams Blok party.
	   The Vlaams Blok and Dutch-speaking conservatives stayed away
from the vote in protest, allowing the bill to proceed without
opposition. The bill now goes to the full House of Representatives
on Dec. 10, where it will likely be approved with the backing of
eight of the ten parties.
	   The bill became a hot issue especially since the next elections
are set for next June. Polls indicate the Vlaams Blok could further
erode the electoral base of the traditional parties.
	   The Vlaams Blok has made major advances in Dutch-speaking
Flanders during the 1990s. It won 12.2 percent of the Flemish vote
in 1995 with an anti-immigrant, Flemish nationalist program.
	   Under Wednesday's committee proposal, Belgium's highest
administrative court, the Council of State, will be given power to
judge if parties should be considered racist. A party will have a
month to appeal on procedural grounds.
	   The agreement came after changes to an initial project, which
some parties considered far too general to survive a court
challenge.
	   Under Belgian law, political parties are restricted from seeking
private funding and instead receive cash handouts from the state
based on their election results.
	   This year, the Vlaams Blok receives 52 million francs (dlrs 1.53
million) a year from the party subsidy coffers. Prime Minister's
Jean-Luc Dehaene's Dutch-speaking Christian Democrat party is the
top recipient with 108 million francs (dlrs 3.18 million).
	   The center-left coalition of Christian Democrats and Socialists,
both split in Dutch- and French-speaking parties, together receive
315 million francs (dlrs 9.26 million).
	   The Vlaams Blok said it did not want to back the proposal since
it claimed it was doubtful it would get a fair hearing. The
Dutch-speaking Conservatives objected on legal grounds.

North Korean military threatens the United States
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea's military leaders accused
the United States Wednesday of plotting a second war in the divided
Korean Peninsula and said they were ready to fight back.
	   The General Staff of the North's Korean People's Army said
Washington was heightening tension by demanding inspections and
talks aimed at preventing the North from developing nuclear weapons
and long-range missiles.
	   ``What they seek in this is to find a pretext to ignite the
train of war,'' an unidentified General Staff spokesman said in a
statement carried by the North's official Korean Central News
Agency.
	   ``We neither want nor avoid a war. If a war is imposed, we will
never miss the opportunity,'' he added. ``It must be clearly known
that there is no limit to the strike of our People's Army and that
on this planet there is no room for escaping the strike.''
	   The communist state's news media frequently publish
saber-rattling rhetoric. But it was unusual for its military, the
most hardline organ of the North Korean regime, to make a public
statement, Seoul officials said.
	   North Korea is feared to be developing long-range missiles
capable of reaching all of Japan and parts of the United States.
	   Such concerns escalated when North Korea fired a rocket on Aug.
31. Believed to be a test of its Taepo Dong missile, the rocket
flew over Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean.
	   The North Korean statement came two days before the United
States and North Korea resume talks about an underground North
Korean site suspected of being used to produce nuclear weapons.
	   In the talks scheduled for Friday through next Tuesday in New
York and Washington, the U.S. will demand unconditional inspections
of the underground project.
	   North Korea has asked Washington to pay dlrs 300 million for the
right to inspect the site.
	   The North's 1.1 million-strong military is the world's fifth
largest. It forms the backbone of the North Korean government, with
leader Kim Jong Il ruling the country as the head of the military.

Thompson sets world, U.S. short-course records in World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) _ Stanford's Jenny Thompson has
broken her own world short-course record in the 100-meter butterfly
and her U.S. record in the 50 freestyle at the FINA Swimming World
Cup.
	   Thompson swam the 100 butterfly in 56.90 seconds Tuesday night,
breaking her previous mark of 57.79. Later, she finished the 50
freestyle in 24.56, beating her U.S. record of 24.78.
	   ``I was really tired from training and I lifted weights
yesterday, I was really sore and I just wanted to get through
this,'' Thompson, a five-time Olympic gold medalist, said of her
butterfly performance.
	   ``I came off the 50 and I knew I was ahead quite a bit, I didn't
really think I might be on world record pace.''
	   Thompson, 25, was named to the USA Swimming National A team for
an unprecedented 12th consecutive year.
	   In men's competition, Jeremy Linn set an American record with a
50 breaststroke swim of 27.11. Linn avenged a 1996 Olympics loss to
Fred deBurghgraeve of Belgium, who finished second in 27.37.
	   Linn and deBurghgraeve both swam under world-record time in the
100 breaststroke in Atlanta, but deBurghgraeve touched first and
won the gold.
	   Gary Hall Jr., another gold medalist in 1996, failed a drug test
May 15 and was provisionally banned by FINA, the international
governing body for the sport, on June 15. However, a Federal Court
in Phoenix on Monday issued a restraining order that allowed Hall
to compete in the World Cup.
	   Hall finished 13th in the 100 freestyle (50.46) and 11th in the
50 butterfly (25.23). He didn't qualify for the finals in either
event. He will swim the 50 free on Wednesday.

Chauffeur testifies he was Anwar's `homosexual slave'

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In the most riveting testimony to
date in the dramatic corruption and sex trial of jailed politician
Anwar Ibrahim, his wife's former driver testified Wednesday that he
was Anwar's ``homosexual slave.''
	   Azizan Abu Bakar told the court that everything he said in a
sworn statement made Aug. 5, 1997 _ when Anwar was still deputy
prime minister and finance minister _ was true.
	   Azizan, 38, was asked to read from that statement.
	   ``In the name of Allah ... I have become a victim of homosexual
acts by Anwar Ibrahim, who now holds the position of deputy prime
minister,'' Azizan read to a stunned courtroom.
	   ``This heinous act was committed several times in 1992 against
my will. It regularly took place in luxury hotels ... without the
knowledge of the public and his wife.''
	   Azizan was the driver for Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, from 1989
to 1992. He is now a sales executive in a trading company.
	   ``I had on several occasions tried to resist,'' Azizan
continued. ``His chronic behavior caused me great mental stress.
The feeling of guilt finally overcame me whenever I had to gaze on
Azizah, who had such high moral character. Finally I made the
decision to stop from becoming a homosexual slave to this man,
Anwar Ibrahim, whom I regard as an animal.''
	   Sodomy is a crime in this predominantly Muslim country.
	   Anwar showed no visible signs of reaction during the graphic
testimony. During the lunch break he hugged his daughter while
Azizah looked on solemnly.
	   Anwar faces four counts of abuse of office. He will face trial
later for one more charge of corruption and five counts of illegal
sexual acts. He denies the charges, calling them part of a
high-level conspiracy to ruin his political career.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar Sept. 2, saying he
had conducted his own investigation into his alleged sexual deeds
and determined Anwar was morally unfit for office.
	   Anwar's sacking led to his demands for political reforms and
dozens of massive anti-government protests, rocking the normally
placid Southeast Asian capital.
	   His jailing and beating while in police custody have drawn
international attention to the case, which is being monitored by
foreign media, diplomats and human rights activists.
	   Earlier witnesses for the prosecution, high-level police and
intelligence officers, have testified that Anwar abused his power
by forcing police to get a retraction from Azizan.
	   On Wednesday, Azizan said police had asked for evidence to back
his allegations that Anwar had sodomized him.
	   ``I told the police that a woman can prove her virginity,''
Azizan testified. ``But I am a male, therefore, I find it difficult
to prove.''
	   Although Anwar secured a retraction, which was then forwarded to
Mahathir, Azizan stressed that he stood by his original statement.
	   ``I made this statement voluntarily without any form of
prompting, urging or pressure from any party,'' Azizan said.
``Everything is true, for the sake of the community, the nation.
Amen.''
	   Azizan said Anwar continued to intimidate him even one year
after the retractions were obtained. He was repeatedly harassed by
two of Anwar's friends last August, who asked him to sign yet
another letter of retraction, Azizan claimed.
	   ``Dreading Anwar and his men, I signed,'' he said.
	   Earlier in the day, the court proceedings came to a temporary
halt when High Court Judge Augustine Paul turned his attention to a
second defense lawyer who accused prosecutors of fabricating
evidence against Anwar.
	   Manjeet Singh Dhillon, charged with contempt of court,
represents Anwar's former tennis partner, Nallakaruppan Solaimalai.
Nalla, as he is called, is charged with possession of ammunition,
which carries a mandatory death sentence.
	   Nalla was detained under the Internal Security Act just before
Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest.
	   On Monday, a warrant was issued by the court for Manjeet Singh
after he wrote a letter accusing prosecutors of trying to force
Nalla into a plea bargain by giving false evidence against Anwar
about alleged sexual trysts.
	   Manjeet Singh quickly apologized Wednesday. Paul accepted the
apology and resumed the trial, which is now in its fourth week.
	   Manjeet Singh's letter formed the basis for an affidavit for
which Zainur Zakaria, a prominent lawyer on Anwar's defense team,
has been sentenced to three months in jail.
	   Paul found Zainur in contempt for having maligned the two top
prosecutors in the Anwar case. Zainur, who rejected Paul's demand
that he apologize, will go to jail if he loses his appeal hearing
on Friday.

	   Hoss became a contender for the post after the current prime
minister, Rafik Hariri, bowed out in a power struggle with Lahoud.
	   Hariri's Cabinet has been serving in a caretaker capacity since
Lahoud's inauguration last week.
	   Hariri, 53, a billionaire businessman, launched the multibillion
dollar reconstruction of Lebanon and restored economic confidence
after the country's devastating 1975-90 civil war.
	   But during his six-year tenure, the country sank deep into debt
and ordinary Lebanese complained that the benefits of
reconstruction did not filter down to them.
	   Hariri was asked by Lahoud last week to form a new government.
But he rejected the request after the president's survey of
Parliament members _ required by the constitution _ gave the
incumbent prime minister a majority but not the overwhelming
support he had in the past.
	   Lahoud on Tuesday began a new poll of the Parliament, and this
time Hoss got majority backing.
	   Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said Wednesday that Hoss had the
support of 95 of the 128 lawmakers in the half-Christian,
half-Muslim legislature.

Report: Asian ship owners urge governments to fight maritime piracy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Asian ship owners strongly urged all
governments in the region to ensure their territorial waters and
ports are safe for transiting ships, the Business Times reported
Wednesday.
	   ``There should be greater cooperation and increased surveillance
among the enforcement authorities of the littoral states to prevent
piracy and armed robberies,'' Firdaus Widjdi, chairman of the
Federation of Asean Shipowners' Association, was quoted as saying
by the paper.
	   Firdaus was addressing the organization's annual meeting in
Singapore on Tuesday.
	   The International Maritime Bureau has recently expressed its
concern over the growing number of piracy cases in Asia. Of 126
attacks or attempted attacks worldwide this year, 72 took place in
Asian waters.
	   Firdaus said he was particularly concerned with the case of
Malaysian tanker Petro Ranger, which was hijacked by Indonesian
pirates earlier this year.
	   Although 12 Indonesians suspected of hijacking the tanker were
detained by the authorities in China, where the tanker was found
discharging its cargo, they were later released.
	   Experts have warned that the Asian crisis could see an increase
in similar incidents.
	   ``Governments should be made aware that ship owners are bringing
economic benefits to their countries and if nothing is done about
it, shipping and trade will suffer,'' Firdaus said.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore slugline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A parliamentary committee unanimously
agreed Wednesday on a bill to cut subsidies to parties judged
racist, following weeks of haggling over public funding for the
extreme right Vlaams Blok party.
	   The Vlaams Blok and Dutch-speaking conservatives stayed away
from the vote in protest, allowing the bill to proceed without
opposition. The bill now goes to the full House of Representatives
on Dec. 10, where it will likely be approved with the backing of
eight of the ten parties.
	   The bill became a hot issue especially since the next elections
are set for next June. Polls indicate the Vlaams Blok could further
erode the electoral base of the traditional parties.
	   The Vlaams Blok has made major advances in Dutch-speaking
Flanders during the 1990s. It won 12.2 percent of the Flemish vote
in 1995 with an anti-immigrant, Flemish nationalist program.
	   Under Wednesday's committee proposal, Belgium's highest
administrative court, the Council of State, will be given power to
judge if parties should be considered racist. A party will have a
month to appeal on procedural grounds.
	   The agreement came after changes to an initial project, which
some parties considered far too general to survive a court
challenge.
	   Under Belgian law, political parties are restricted from seeking
private funding and instead receive cash handouts from the state
based on their election results.
	   This year, the Vlaams Blok receives 52 million francs (dlrs 1.53
million) a year from the party subsidy coffers. Prime Minister's
Jean-Luc Dehaene's Dutch-speaking Christian Democrat party is the
top recipient with 108 million francs (dlrs 3.18 million).
	   The center-left coalition of Christian Democrats and Socialists,
both split in Dutch- and French-speaking parties, together receive
315 million francs (dlrs 9.26 million).
	   The Vlaams Blok said it did not want to back the proposal since
it claimed it was doubtful it would get a fair hearing. The
Dutch-speaking Conservatives objected on legal grounds.

Kremlin says Yeltsin may return to work Monday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin is expected to remain
hospitalized through the end of the week, but may return to the
Kremlin next Monday, a top aide said Wednesday.
	   The president, who is suffering from pneumonia, has been
handling limited paperwork and holding telephone conversations at
the government clinic where he's been recovering for the past 11
days.
	   Yeltsin was expected to hold a telephone conversation on
Wednesday with French President Jacques Chirac. Later this week,
the president plans to meet Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the
president's deputy chief of staff Yuri Yarov was quoted as saying
by the Interfax news agency.
	   ``The president is making his schedule himself,'' said Yarov,
adding that the president could be back at work next Monday.
	   Another Yeltsin's aide, Oleg Sysuyev, said Tuesday that Yeltsin,
known as a restless patient, is urging doctors to discharge him as
soon as possible.
	   ``Doctors are having trouble keeping the president in the
hospital,'' Sysuyev said.
	   Yeltsin's repeated health problems have raised doubts about his
ability to lead Russia out of its worst economic crisis in the
post-Soviet era.
	   Last week, the Kremlin acknowledged for the first time that
Yeltsin suffered several heart attacks in 1996 before he underwent
bypass surgery. The Russian media had been reporting this for some
time.
	   Renat Akchurin, the surgeon who operated Yeltsin, said that the
current bout of pneumonia, the second in as many years, is
apparently due to the president's weakened immunity and his age,
not heart problems.
	   Akchurin, speaking in an interview with the weekly Argumenty i
Fakty, said he has not examined Yeltsin for eight months, but
believed that heart problems were unlikely.
	   The doctor urged Yeltsin to heed doctors' advice and warned
about possible complications.
	   ``Pneumonia sometimes brings even healthy people to a tragic
end,'' Akchurin said. ``For those with a record of heart illness,
it always has a quite serious character.''
	   Yeltsin has made only rare public appearances in recent months,
and was visiting the Kremlin only two or three days a week before
he fell ill. Primakov has taken over many day-to-day duties in
Yeltsin's absence.

Journalist killed, 2 injured in road accident in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A car carrying three Norwegian journalists
ran off the road and overturned on Wednesday, killing one of the
journalists and injuring the other two, an Iraqi official said.
	   The accident occurred 350 kilometers (210 miles) west of
Baghdad.
	   The crew was traveling to the Iraqi capital from Amman, Jordan,
along a route that is one of the few ways into the country because
of U.N. sanctions that ban air travel.
	   The crew was from Norway's TV2, said Mohsin Tarfa, acting
director of the Iraqi Press Center in Baghdad.
	   Officials at TV2 in Oslo declined to identify the journalists
until their families were notified.
	   The two injured Norwegians were taken to a hospital in Baghdad,
Tarfa said.
	   Nearly all visitors to Iraq must take the 12-hour journey
through the desert from Amman to Baghdad.

Strong earthquake topples thousands of houses in China, official
</HEADLINE>
says
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with color, comments from Ninglang quake area.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A strong earthquake toppled more than 8,000
buildings in the impoverished hills of China's rural southwest,
leaving 20,000 people homeless, a local official said Wednesday.
	   Few injuries and no deaths have been reported from the
magnitude-5.1 quake that struck Yunnan province's Xuanwei county
Tuesday shortly after 3:30 p.m. _ when farmers were in the fields
and students on recess, said Wei Hui of the local Civil Affairs
Bureau.
	   The quake was the third to strike Yunnan in two weeks.
Authorities are struggling to treat the 4,000 injured and house and
care for the 25,000 people left homeless by a pair of powerful
quakes on Nov. 20 in the Ninglang region, 300 kilometers (180
miles) west of Xuanwei.
	   Among the 8,000 buildings that collapsed in Xuanwei, many
belonged to poor farming families scattered across 24 villages,
said Wei. He added that some families lost many of their pigs and
cows.
	   Many buildings including those in the county seat were cracked
or listing and will have to be pulled down, said Wei.
	   Yunnan Vice Gov. Niu Shaoyao, who was in Xuanwei inspecting the
aftermath of a coal mine accident that killed 38 miners Sunday,
joined local authorities in checking on rescue and repair efforts.
	   In mountainous Ninglang, many of those left homeless by the
quakes two weeks ago are suffering through nights of freezing
temperatures in huts of wood and plastic sheeting. Small town
hospitals have set up makeshift wards in parking lots to cope with
the hordes of injured.
	   ``The government is doing a pretty good job distributing rice,
basic food and some blankets,'' Odilon Couzin of Doctors Without
Borders told Associated Press Television News in a tour of the
disaster area earlier this week.
	   ``What we are mostly worried about is the weather, because it
can get very, very cold here and once it starts snowing the road
can be blocked and the people will have nothing,'' Couzin said.
	   In almost every village in the mountainous area near the Sichuan
border, a few mud, brick and wood houses collapsed. Despite the
widespread devastation, only five people are reported to have died
in the twin quakes. Villagers said the quakes' timing _ a
5-magnitude shock followed by a 6.2-magnitude wallop _ kept
casualties down.
	   ``When the first one struck we all ran out of the house. Then
the second one hit, and it was then that the house collapsed,''
said one woman, a member of China's Yi minority, as she squatted by
her ruined home in Lan Yiqing Valley.

`Love Boat' passengers heading home with ship detained
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) _ The romance of being stranded aboard the
``Love Boat'' finally ran out Wednesday and the cruise line began
making plans to fly passengers home.
	   The ship made famous by the popular 1977-86 American television
show ``The Love Boat'' has been held in port near Athens since Nov.
26, when police say they found 25 kilograms (56 pounds) of heroin
aboard.
	   Authorities said they needed the Pacific Princess in port while
they completed the investigation. Two crew members have been
charged with drug trafficking. It was not clear when the ship would
be cleared to leave.
	   The more than 600 passengers _ mostly Americans _ have been
staying aboard the ship and taking daily tours around Athens and
nearly islands.
	   The ship's owner, London-based P&AMP;O Cruises, planned to book
flights home for passengers beginning Wednesday, said company
spokesman Peter Smith.
	   The Pacific Princess arrived in Piraeus from Istanbul, Turkey,
as part of a two-week cruise in the Mediterranean.

Paul Grayson to miss South Africa clash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England stand-off Paul Grayson has failed to
recover from a knee injury and will miss Saturday's Test against
South Africa at Twickenham.
	   Grayson, who limped off during last weekend's 12-11 defeat to
Australia, will be replaced by Mike Catt.
	   But England coach Clive Woodward said Wednesday that Catt will
not assume Grayson's goal-kicking duties. Catt failed to convert
the only try against Australia, allowing the Wallabies to pull out
a late victory.
	   Instead, Matt Dawson will do the goal-kicking Saturday.
	   Nick Beal comes in at fullback for Matt Perry, who suffered a
concussion against the Wallabies and will be sidelined for three
weeks.
	   Woodward also brought in Dan Luger at the expense of out-of-form
Austin Healey.
	   Will Greenwood, like Grayson, has not recovered from a recent
groin injury and is out. That means Phil de Glanville will continue
in the center.
	   The Springboks will set a world record of 18 consecutive Test
victories if they beat England on Saturday. They would eclipse the
New Zealand All Blacks' 17-match winning streak between 1965 and
1969.

Netanyahu asked Clinton to step into dispute with Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu complained in
a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton that the Palestinians have
repeatedly violated the Wye River peace agreement, officials said
Wednesday.
	   At the same time, Palestinian officials accused Israel of
violating the Wye River summit accord by not freeing jailed
Palestinian activists and by confiscating West Bank land.
	   There are concerns that the escalating tension could result in a
new round of violence in advance of Clinton's planned trip to
Israel and the Palestinian lands later this month.
	   In Jerusalem, a 41-year-old Palestinian street cleaner, Osama
Musa Natche, was stabbed to death in a mixed neighborhood on the
border between the Arab and Jewish sectors of the city.
	   Israeli police said they were investigating the possibility that
the killer was an Israeli who has already murdered one Palestinian
and wounded five in earlier attacks.
	   ``There are a number of items of evidence on the scene of the
crime which suggests that the motive for the crime was
nationalist,'' said Jerusalem police commander Yair Yitzhaki.
	   In a two-page letter sent Sunday, Netanyahu asked Clinton to
step in and use his influence to halt the Palestinian violations.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu, said the sending of
the letter indicates that ``there is a danger to the peace process
if the violations continue.'' But he said that, as of now, the
Clinton visit to the region Dec. 12-15 was ``a go.''
	   In the letter, Bar-Illan said, Netanyahu objected to recent
statements, including one by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, that
a Palestinian state would be declared on May 4, 1999.
	   The daily Maariv newspaper said Netanyahu asked Clinton to
publicly distance himself from Arafat's statements and persuade the
Palestinian leader to withdraw his remarks.
	   The Wye accord, negotiated with Clinton's help in October, urges
both Israel and the Palestinians to refrain from unilateral steps
that would prejudge the outcome of talks on a permanent peace
accord that are scheduled to be complete by next May 4.
	   The Palestinians issued a series of complaints about Israeli
violations of the Wye accord reached in October. It obligates
Israel to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank in three stages
by the end of January in exchange for Palestinian security
measures, including a crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, said Wednesday that Israel's
plans to construct more than a dozen access roads for Jewish
settlements in the West Bank was not approved at the Wye River
summit. Israel's Cabinet approved the building to improve security
for Jewish communities isolated by the planned withdrawals.
	   Thousands of acres of Palestinian land are being expropriated
for the road projects.
	   ``I want to make it very clear that there is no such agreement
because no rational Palestinian would agree to the confiscation of
land for roads,'' Abbas said on the Voice of Palestine radio.
	   Palestinians protested Israel's appointment of a low-level
delegation to deal with the issue of a further withdrawal after the
13 percent pullback. They said this was an indication that Israel
was not taking Palestinian concerns seriously.
	   The Palestinians also complained that Israel broke a promise
concerning prisoner releases. Under the Wye accord, Israel is to
free 750 prisoners in three stages.
	   In the first stage last month, Israel freed 250 prisoners, but
150 of them were common criminals. Arafat wants all of those
released to be Palestinians jailed for anti-Israeli activities.
	   Bar-Illan said the criteria for the releases were agreed on at
the Mideast summit and that Israel was in compliance. Netanyahu has
said he would not release prisoners involved in attacks on Israelis
or members of Islamic militant groups.
	   Despite the renewed acrimony, Clinton's visit to Israel and the
Palestinian areas appeared to be proceeding on schedule.
	   The highlight is Clinton's attendance on Dec. 14 of a special
session of the Palestine National Council, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile, in Gaza City. Local Palestinian legislators
and members of Palestinian factions will also be present.
	   In the session, Israel wants the Palestinians to reaffirm in a
vote the revocation of clauses in the Palestine Liberation
Organization's founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   Palestinians officials insist there will be no formal meeting of
the PNC and that there is no need for a vote since the clauses were
already deleted two years ago. Netanyahu has said he will accept
nothing short of a vote.
	   It was not clear Wednesday whether formal invitations to the PNC
members living abroad have already been issued.
	   However, the Palestinian Authority has asked Israel to grant
entry permits for 25 PNC members who in the past were barred from
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Among those on the list is Farouk Kaddoumi, a top PLO official
opposed to peace with Israel, and Nayef Hawatmeh, leader of the
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical PLO
faction.
	   After the Gaza meeting, five percent of the West Bank is to be
transferred from sole Israeli control to joint jurisdiction.

Taiwanese police net 10 for vote buying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Ten people were arrested Wednesday on
suspicion of buying votes for Saturday's elections, as authorities
crack down on a traditional problem in the island's politics.
	   Police in eastern Hualien county arrested and detained nine
people, including local county council members and a Presbyterian
minister, whom they suspected of buying the votes of members of
mountain tribal communities.
	   Residents were first offered jugs of cooking oil, and if they
accepted, they then were approached with cash bids of 500 Taiwan
dollars (U.S. dlrs 15) for each vote, newspapers reported.
	   And in suburban Taipei county, a man was arrested for
distributing up to 500 wristwatches to handicapped voters in return
for pledges to support a legislative candidate.
	   In both cases, the names of the candidates were not identified.
	   They were the first vote-buying arrests ahead of Saturday's
elections for the 225-seat national legislature along with the
mayorships of Taipei and Kaohsiung and their city councils.
	   Vote buying by candidates has long been a major source of
electoral fraud, which leads to corruption as elected office
holders seek to earn back their investments through influence
peddling or graft.
	   So far in this campaign season, 476 reports of vote buying have
been investigated, an overall drop from previous years, according
to prosecutors who declined to provide comparative figures.
	   Four cases of election-related violence have been looked into,
along with 36 cases of threats and intimidation _ reflecting much
more orderly campaigns than Taiwan has seen in the past.
	   Vote buying is considered more serious in rural areas where
community networks are stronger, but even in the capital Taipei,
authorities have been scrambling to look into numerous reports of
vote buying in the legislative and city council races, said Chou
Chi-jung, spokesman for the Taipei District Prosecutors office.
	   However, investigators have yet to uncover any solid evidence,
Chou said.
	   With over 400 candidates running, this year's elections provide
a monumental challenge for investigators who have in the past have
successfully forced vote buying underground.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The president named the U.S.-educated
economist Salim Hoss as the next prime minister of Lebanon on
Wednesday.
	   Hoss accepted the appointment, telling reporters after meeting
President Emile Lahoud: ``We are facing big challenges which we
should confront.''
	   He said his government would work to reduce the budget deficit
and continue efforts to end Israel's occupation of part of southern
Lebanon.
	   His first task would be to appoint a Cabinet, he added.
	   Lahoud issued a decree appointing Hoss after he secured a
majority of recommendations from the Parliament.
	   Hoss, a legislator from Beirut who turns 69 on Dec. 20, has held
the premiership on four previous occasions. He survived a 1987 car
bombing that killed a bodyguard in his motorcade.
	   Hoss became a contender for the post after the current prime
minister, Rafik Hariri, bowed out Monday in a power struggle with
Lahoud. Hariri has been serving in a caretaker capacity since
Lahoud's inauguration last week.
	   Hariri, 53, a billionaire businessman, launched the multibillion
dollar reconstruction of Lebanon and restored economic confidence
after the country's devastating 1975-90 civil war.
	   But during his six-year tenure, the country sank deep into debt
and ordinary Lebanese complained that the benefits of
reconstruction did not filter down to them.
	   Hariri was asked by Lahoud last week to form a new government.
But he rejected the request after the president's survey of
Parliament members _ required by the constitution _ gave the
incumbent prime minister a majority but not the overwhelming
support he had in the past.
	   Lahoud on Tuesday began a new poll of the Parliament, and this
time Hoss got majority backing.
	   Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said Wednesday that Hoss had the
support of 95 of the 128 lawmakers in the half-Christian,
half-Muslim legislature.
	   Hoss is a Sunni Muslim, like every prime minister under
Lebanon's power-sharing arrangement. The president is a Maronite
Catholic, and the Parliament speaker is a Shiite Muslim.
	   His style of government is expected to be quite different from
the flamboyant Hariri.
	   Hoss is expected to maintain a good working relationship with
Lahoud, the 62-year-old assertive army commander who was elected by
an overwhelming vote in Parliament. Lahoud has pledged to clean up
the graft-riddled administration.
	   With security established across much of the country after the
1975-90 civil war, Hoss takes over the premiership with economic
development and government reform as the major challenges.
	   Hoss will have to calm markets made nervous by the sudden
departure of Hariri.
	   The Central bank, fearing a run on the Lebanese pound, has
expressed readiness to intervene with its foreign currency
reserves.
	   Like almost all politicians in Lebanon, Hoss is an ally of
Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon, where Syria still
maintains some 30,000 troops.
	   Hoss, who earned an advanced degree in business and economics
from Indiana University at Bloomington, has a reputation as an
honest politician
	   He first served as prime minister in 1976 in the early days of
the civil war and also was prime minister in 1987, after Prime
Minister Rashid Karami was assassinated. He was named to the post
again in 1989 under President Rene Mouawad and the following year
under President Elias Hrawi.

South Africa to stage tournament for next three years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Johannesburg's Ellis Park was selected Wednesday
as the vene for the 1999 rugby league World Nines.
	   The Rugby League International Federation confirmed South Africa
as the hosts for the tournament for the next three years, starting
the weekend of Feb. 5-6.
	   As part of the federation's plans to raise the profile of rugby
league in South Africa, Britain will play a Test match against New
Zealand at Ellis Park on the way home from the Tri-Nations Series
in Australia the weekend of Nov. 12-13.
	   South Africa will participate in the next World Cup, plans for
which were also unveiled.
	   Federation delegates backed the Rugby Football League's plans
for a 16-team competition to be held in Britain in the fall of
2000.
	   As in 1995, the RFL will field separate England and Wales teams
but this time Scotland and Ireland, which took part in the
second-tier Emerging Nations competition last time, are set to
compete with the big teams.
	   Other teams will be Australia, New Zealand, France, Papua New
uinea, Tonga, Western Samoa, Fiji, Cook Islands, New Zealand
Maoris, South Africa and Russia.
	   A 16th entrant is likely to be determined by a play-off
involving such minnows as Lebanon, Morocco, United States, Canada,
Japan and Italy.

Journalist killed, 2 injured in road accident in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A car carrying three Norwegian journalists
ran off the road and overturned Wednesday, killing one of the
journalists and injuring the other two, an Iraqi official said.
	   The accident occurred 210 miles (350 kms) west of the capital,
Baghdad.
	   The crew was traveling to the Iraqi capital from Amman, Jordan,
along a route that is one of the few ways into the country because
of U.N. sanctions that ban air travel.
	   The crew was from Norway's TV2, said Mohsin Tarfa, acting
director of the Iraqi Press Center in Baghdad.
	   Officials at TV2 in Oslo declined to identify the journalists
until their families were notified.
	   The two injured Norwegians were taken to a hospital in Baghdad,
Tarfa said.
	   Nearly all visitors to Iraq must take the 12-hour journey
through the desert from Amman to Baghdad.

Cathay Pacific pulls out of talks with Philippine Airlines

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Cathay Pacific Airways said Wednesday it had
pulled out of talks to buy a stake in ailing Philippine Airlines _
making the uncertain future at PAL even cloudier.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he would try to coax
the two sides back together, but it was unclear whether Cathay was
out of the picture for good.
	   ``There is now a real risk of PAL going bust, and this time for
real,'' said airline analyst John Hetherington of Paribas Asia
Equity Ltd. ``PAL is back in the unfortunate position of finding a
new suitor.''
	   But another industry expert suggested the talks between Hong
Kong's flag carrier and PAL might still be ``pretty fluid.''
	   ``This game has been going on for quite a while,'' said airline
analyst Peter Tang at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd.
	   Cathay said it had withdrawn its bid to pour up to U.S. dlrs 100
million into debt-ridden PAL because of ``certain issues which
could not be resolved,'' according to a statement from company
secretary P.A. Moore.
	   Moore would not elaborate on the stumbling blocks. But
Philippine officials said Cathay and PAL had run into difficulties
in two areas: who would manage PAL and how many workers would lose
their jobs.
	   Cathay executives did not immediately return a reporter's
telephone inquiries about whether they would consider fresh talks
with PAL. Cathay shares were little changed in trading Wednesday's
on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
	   Estrada appeared unwilling to give up on PAL, which stopped
flying in a labor dispute in September but soon got back into the
air.
	   ``As much as PAL is the flag carrier, we should see to it that
PAL will always fly. If PAL will close down, so many businesses
will be affected,'' Estrada said.
	   Meanwhile, PAL executive vice president Manolo Aquino said the
carrier has been developing contingency plans to return to
financial health without help from other airlines.
	   ``It isn't a cause for concern,'' he told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   PAL will submit a plan to the Philippine Securities and Exchange
Commission by Dec. 7, the carrier's deadline for finding a way to
make good on some U.S. dlrs 2.1 billion in debts that now are going
unpaid, Aquino said.
	   Early Wednesday, Cathay had expressed dissatisfaction over the
talks with PAL, saying it was ``not willing to continue
negotiations with PAL in its current form.''
	   ``We're very sad. We tried very hard to make it work,'' Peter
Foster, Cathay's regional manager for the Philippines and Taiwan,
told The Associated Press. Foster said the negotiations have been
going on for six weeks.
	   PAL earlier accepted a preliminary investment offer from Cathay
Pacific, and the companies announced Nov. 10 that they would draw
up a comprehensive plan to rehabilitate PAL.
	   Estrada's executive secretary, Ronaldo Zamora, earlier said
PAL's chairman and chief stockholder, Lucio Tan, had gone to the
United States to try to resume negotiations with Northwest
Airlines, one of PAL's prospective investors.
	   PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 after failing to
persuade its largest union to accept a management-proposed recovery
plan under which their collective bargaining agreement would be
suspended for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent share of the
company.
	   The union later decided to accept the plan, allowing PAL to
resume domestic and international flights in early October.
	   PAL says it is unable to pay all its debts due to mounting
losses worsened by its labor problems and Asia's currency crisis.

China's top court official says next year trials will be open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Court trial procedures throughout China must be
opened to the public starting next year, the country's top judicial
official was quoted as saying Wednesday.
	   Xiao Yang, president of the Supreme People's Court, said at a
national conference that courts must open up so that ordinary
people may observe deliberation over the evidence, legal arguments
and the announcement of verdicts.
	   China's courts so far have ignored guidelines calling for open
trials, sometimes because the judges do not have the skills needed
to do their jobs, the state-run Xinhua News Agency quoted Xiao as
saying.
	   A former justice minister, Xiao has pushed to wipe out
corruption and bring greater accountability to the largely closed,
often badly run court system since he became head of the top court
in March.
	   He recently warned judges should not accept gifts and attend
banquets while carrying out their duties.
	   ``Verdicts must be made public in a timely manner to avoid
under-the-table deals,'' Xinhua quoted him as saying.
	   Judges should also cite legal grounds for their verdicts in
order to help the public understand the legal system, he said.
	   While Chinese courts seldom use the jury system, lawmakers were
discussing laws about how to select jurors and what their rights
and duties should be, Xiao said.
	   Some courts in Beijing and other parts of the country recently
made hearings public. The government has indicated it will continue
to hold closed trials for people accused under the vague state
secrets law used to prosecute dissidents.

Australia's Antarctic supply ship stuck in ice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australia's Antarctic supply ship
Aurora Australis is stuck in pack ice off Antarctica with a damaged
propeller, Australia's Antarctic Division said Wednesday.
	   The director of the division, Tony Press, said the ship became
trapped in ice some days ago but the crew was in no danger and
there are plenty of supplies on board.
	   The Aurora Australis is carrying 69 expeditioners and 24 crew
members.
	   Press said it was unclear how long the ship will be stuck or
whether the crew had the necessary equipment to fix the ship's
damaged propeller.
	   ``It's temporarily caught in pack ice and that can change
depending on the weather,'' he said.
	   ``It's been caught in the ice for several days but the problems
with the propeller were only discovered the evening before last.''
	   The Aurora Australis was in the process of changing crews at
bases in Antarctica, as well as carrying out scientific
experiments, including field surveys, he said.
	   ``The ship had been making trips to the Antarctica for about 10
years,'' he said. ``It's not unusual for ships to be temporarily
caught in ice.''
	   The Australian government has been considering a two-ship policy
for its Antarctic bases, or possibly building Antarctic air strips
for supply by aircraft.

Indonesian union leader says Australia is Suharto's PR company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LORNE, Australia (AP) _ An Indonesian trade union leader
criticised the Australian government Wednesday, saying it was
behaving like an international public relations company for former
President Suharto.
	   In Australia for the Australian Council of Trade Unions annual
council meeting, Muchtar Pakpahan said the federal government was
defending the ``human rights violations of the corrupt Suharto
regime.''
	   ``The Australian government has become the public relations of
Suharto ... at the human rights summit meeting in Geneva last year,
only the Australians said that human rights in Indonesia were very
good,'' he told reporters.
	   Pakpahan's criticisms echoed those of Nobel Peace laureate Jose
Ramos Horta, who said Australia's most vocal protests against
Indonesian human rights violations were made during the term of the
former Labor government.
	   Jailed by the Suharto government for organizing unions,
Pakpahan, who is national chairman of the Indonesian Prosperity
Trade Union Federation Central Board, also said Prime Minister John
Howard's government had tried to block his visit to Australia.
	   ``When I went to the Australian Embassy to apply for a visa I
was told that because I had been jailed I would not be able to be
given one,'' he said.
	   ``To fight for democracy in a country like Indonesia you have to
expect to be jailed, so why is it that Australian officials want to
ban people fighting for a democracy.''
	   Pakpahan said his visa was granted after an appeal.
	   Indonesian trade unions needed financial and administrative
support and Australia was noticeably missing from the nations who
had provided such support, Pakpahan said.
	   ACTU assistant secretary Bill Mansfield said an approach would
be made to
	   the Australian government asking it to follow the lead of the
United States, Britain, the Netherlands, Norway and Finland.
	   ``Australia is the closest and largest economy to Indonesia and
if a country as far away as Finland can give help to the emerging
union movement, then surely we can,'' he said.
	   Indonesian unions also wanted to establish an alternate food
supply, to bypass what Pakpahan described as the ``corrupt food
chain'' that delivered rice at inflated prices to impoverished
Indonesians.
	   He had also asked the ACTU to provide his union movement with
money to fund training courses and build meeting rooms.

Deputy chief of Tajikistan's Central Bank kidnapped
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ The vice president of Tajikistan's
National Bank was kidnapped by several gunmen Wednesday in the
capital of this restive Central Asian nation.
	   Police said the assailants, wearing military fatigues, stopped
Navruz Valiyev's car, took him out and drove away. The motive for
the kidnapping was not immediately clear.
	   However, Valiyev recently ordered an increase in the minimum
capital requirements for the nation's commercial banks in a bid to
protect depositors' accounts. Several banks failed to meet them and
were forced to halt operations after the new requirements were
introduced in October.
	   Valiyev was also in charge of Tajikistan's talks with the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Tajikistan's economy is in shambles following a 5-year civil war
between the secular government, which is backed by Russia, and the
mostly Islamic opposition. A truce signed last year ended
large-scale hostilities, but there are still periodic clashes.

Gang ambushes Spanish trucks carrying pigs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A roadside gang ambushed two Spanish
trucks carrying 505 imported pigs late Tuesday, driving the
vehicles into a shallow ravine where they tipped over, killing and
injuring many of the animals.
	   Police said they had no information about who was behind the
attack, but suspicion fell on Portuguese pig farmers who in recent
weeks have stepped up their protests against falling pork prices.
	   The trucks were traveling on a narrow country road just after
midnight near Palmela, 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Lisbon,
when they were stopped by a group of about 15 men, police spokesman
Paulo Soares said.
	   Some wore hoods and one had a pistol, he said.
	   Two of the men boarded the trucks and drove them into the
ravine. The trucks fell onto their sides, crushing some pigs to
death and injuring others, Soares said.
	   Some pigs escaped and fled into the countryside, Soares said.
	   The trucks were on there way to an abattoir near Palmela from
Navarra in northern Spain.
	   Last week, riot police used water cannon, horses and dogs to
break up a demonstration of protesting pig farmers who had
blockaded a road in a rural town.
	   The farmers have also released piglets in the center of major
cities. They want the government to give them more financial aid
and place restrictions on pork imports.

Center-left leader emerges as favorite in speculation on new
</HEADLINE>
premier &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish President Suleyman Demirel planned
to meet with Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit on Wednesday, stoking
speculation that he'd ask the center-left leader to form a new
government.
	   Ecevit is said to have the support of Turkey's all-powerful
military and most analysts say he is the is the most viable
replacement for Mesut Yilmaz, who was ousted in a no-confidence
vote last week over a mafia scandal.
	   Daily Milliyet said Demirel was likely to announce his choice
before leaving Thursday for a one-day trip to Romania.
	   By tradition, the leader of the largest party in parliament
would get the nod. But the largest party is Islamic Virtue, which
is opposed by the military. Last year, the military ousted Turkey's
first Islamic-led government.
	   Ecevit said he didn't want Virtue in the government and
reiterated his proposal for a new secular coalition combining his
Democratic Left party with Turkey's two center-right parties. The
coalition would have a large majority in Parliament.
	   He said Wednesday that he opposes joining forces with Virtue
because of ``our commitment to secularism without concessions.''
	   The veteran politician could act as the glue between Yilmaz and
former premier Tansu Ciller, whose long-standing political rivalry
led to a government collapse in 1996. Ecevit is said to have
Yilmaz' support, but there are doubts about Mrs. Ciller.
	   General elections are scheduled for April 18.

Most Asian markets close higher, analysts say sustained rally
</HEADLINE>
questionable

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets, including the major
bourses in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore, ended higher Wednesday _
although analysts were unsure whether the recovery from recent
declines could be sustained.
	   Japanese stocks rebounded after three days of losses, fueled by
an apparent late burst of buying by public pension funds.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 151.21
points, or 1.02 percent, ending the day at 14,986.62. On Tuesday,
the Nikkei closed down 0.32 percent.
	   But analysts said most investors remained on the sidelines to
monitor Parliamentary debate on a government plan to spur the
nation's sagging economy.
	   ``The market is waiting for a sense that the economy has
bottomed out,'' said Kazuhiro Nomura, head of trading at Paribas
Capital Markets.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen. The
dollar bought 121.88 yen in late afternoon trading, down 0.90 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 122.17 yen overnight.
	   In Hong Kong, share prices rose modestly, snapping a three-day
losing streak that had taken 7.5 percent off the key stock index.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index ended up 0.8 percent at 10,055.78,
after plunging 4.1 percent on Tuesday.
	   Some analysts warned that buying interest remained quite low in
a market still seen as being fragile after Hong Kong residents were
warned last week to brace for more bad economic news as they
struggle through a recession.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Index rose 1.1 percent to
1,383.59 points. But dealers said the market was unlikely to climb
much further for the rest of the year.
	   The Malaysian stock market's recent rally continued as large and
small investors continued to scoop up stocks.
	   The blue-chip Composite Index closed up 1.5 percent at 526.75
points. It already has risen 25 percent since Nov. 24, and has
effectively doubled its value since Sept. 1, when the country
imposed capital controls.
	   In Bangkok, share prices plunged amid worries that some senators
would delay the passage of the long-awaited new bankruptcy and
foreclosure laws. Thailand's SET index fell 3.7 percent to 343.12.
	   Dealers said if Parliament doesn't pass those laws by March, it
will further delay fixing the country's ailing financial system and
dent international investors' confidence in Thailand's commitment
to reform.
	   Elsewhere:
	   JAKARTA: Indonesia's key JSX index closed up 2.4 percent at
396.964 points, spurred by hopes that interest rates will continue
falling.
	   MANILA: The PSE index fell 1.9 percent to 1,886.00 points,
adding to a 2.7 percent loss Tuesday, as the recent rally lost
steam. Anticipation of an announcement of higher inflation also
dampened buying interest.
	   SEOUL: South Korea's key index, the Kospi, closed 0.39 points
higher at 446.35 on the stronger Japanese yen, which makes local
exporters more competitive against their key Japanese rivals.
	   SYDNEY: Australia's benchmark All Ordinaries Index rose 1.0
percent to 2,761.0 points after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut a
key interest rate by 0.25 percent to 4.75 percent.
	   TAIPEI: Taiwan's Weighted Price Index ended 0.77 percent higher
at 7,157.22 points as short-term investors bought low-priced
plastics and textile stocks amid expectations of better earnings.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand's key NZSE-40 capital index finished 1
percent lower at 1,930.50. Commodity stocks led the fall.

Taiwan central banks offers reserves to cash-strapped banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Hoping to ease a tightening of credit to
commercial banks and businesses, Taiwan's central bank offered
Wednesday to mobilize its massive foreign currency reserves _ if
necessary _ to keep cash flowing.
	   The central bank said it was responding to a decision in late
November by U.S. credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service to
downgrade 10 of Taiwan's largest banks.
	   That prompted foreign banks to trim credit lines and raise
interest rates for local companies and banks, said J.S. Duann, a
deputy director of foreign exchange at the central bank.
	   The central bank's support gave the jittery credit market a
psychological boost _ although there were no specific promises for
how much money it might provide.
	   Whether or not the bank actually does dip into its massive cash
pile to spur lending in Taiwan, the move would lower the costs of
obtaining foreign currency for banks and businesses that now find
themselves short of cash amid a slowing economy and a drop in
exports, Duann said.
	   Despite criticizing recent government intervention in financial
markets, western bankers seemed mostly upbeat about the central
bank's action.
	   The move could help calm fears in the banking sector, where many
believe risks are growing as companies encounter cash flow
problems, bankers and economists said.
	   The central bank's stance ``will allow fundamentally sound banks
to get the foreign currency that they need,'' said John McGowan,
treasurer at Hong Kong Banking Corp.
	   The central bank's show of strength will also help allay rumors
of weaknesses among financial institutions, he said.
	   Buoyed by foreign reserves that now total U.S. dlrs 88.1 billion
and with little foreign debt, Taiwan has weathered the Asian
economic crisis far better than most countries in the region.
	   But the economy has been hit by plunging export growth and
slumping domestic demand, and is expected to grow just over 5
percent this year, down from 6.8 percent in 1997.
	   In the latest crisis, authorities announced an unprecedented 100
billion Taiwan dollar (U.S. dlrs 3 billion) bailout package for the
Taichung Business Bank after a run on deposits sparked by reports
of irregular loans.
	   The bank's chairman and some other directors were replaced in
the scandal that led to the third financial rescue plan authorized
by the Ministry of Finance for financial institutions in the last
few months.

 &UR; Israeli, Palestinians clash near West Bank settlement
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli soldiers opening fire on Palestinian
demonstrators near West Bank settlement as tensions increase.
Changes byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli troops on Wednesday opened fire on
Palestinian protesters demanding freedom for jailed activists after
the demonstrators beat an Israeli soldier and burned his car.
	   Two Palestinians were seen being placed in an ambulance, but the
extent of their injuries was not known.
	   The clash began when 150 Palestinians attacked an Israeli
soldier driving near the Jewish settlement of Beit El.
	   Jumping on the hood of the car, the protesters smashed his
windshield, dragged the soldier from the car kicking and seized his
M-16 automatic rifle. They poured kerosene on the car and set it
ablaze.
	   The Israeli soldier, wearing a green uniform, ran away, bleeding
from a head wound and with blood on his hands, as the demonstrators
threw stones at him. The Palestinians also took his mobile
telephone and a briefcase from the soldier.
	   Israeli police stationed at a joint position with Palestinian
counterparts fired pistols into the crowd while nearby Israeli
soldiers opened up with a barrage of rubber-coated metal bullets
and tear gas at the Palestinians. Police confirmed both live rounds
and rubber-coated ammunition was used.
	   The clash, which lasted about half an hour, followed the
stabbing death of a Palestinian street-cleaner in Jerusalem which
police said may have been carried out by an Israeli extremist.
	   There are concerns that the escalating tension could result in a
new round of violence in advance of Clinton's planned trip to
Israel and the Palestinian lands later this month.
	   In Jerusalem, a 41-year-old Palestinian street cleaner, Osama
Musa Natche, was stabbed to death in a mixed neighborhood on the
border between the Arab and Jewish sectors of the city.
	   Israeli police said they were investigating the possibility that
the killer was an Israeli who has already murdered one Palestinian
and wounded five in earlier attacks.
	   ``There are a number of items of evidence on the scene of the
crime which suggests that the motive for the crime was
nationalist,'' said Jerusalem police commander Yair Yitzhaki.
	   Israeli officials said Wednesday that Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu had complained in a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton
that the Palestinians have repeatedly violated the Wye River peace
agreement.
	   At the same time, Palestinian officials accused Israel of
violating the Wye River summit accord by not freeing jailed
Palestinian activists and by confiscating West Bank land.
	   In a two-page letter sent Sunday, Netanyahu asked Clinton to
step in and use his influence to halt the Palestinian violations.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu, said the sending of
the letter indicates that ``there is a danger to the peace process
if the violations continue.'' But he said that, as of now, the
Clinton visit to the region Dec. 12-15 was ``a go.''
	   In the letter, Bar-Illan said, Netanyahu objected to recent
statements, including one by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, that
a Palestinian state would be declared on May 4, 1999.
	   The daily Maariv newspaper said Netanyahu asked Clinton to
publicly distance himself from Arafat's statements and persuade the
Palestinian leader to withdraw his remarks.
	   The Wye accord, negotiated with Clinton's help in October, urges
both Israel and the Palestinians to refrain from unilateral steps
that would prejudge the outcome of talks on a permanent peace
accord that are scheduled to be complete by next May 4.
	   The Palestinians issued a series of complaints about Israeli
violations of the Wye accord reached in October. It obligates
Israel to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank in three stages
by the end of January in exchange for Palestinian security
measures, including a crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, said Wednesday that Israel's
plans to construct more than a dozen access roads for Jewish
settlements in the West Bank was not approved at the Wye River
summit. Israel's Cabinet approved the building to improve security
for Jewish communities isolated by the planned withdrawals.
	   Thousands of acres of Palestinian land are being expropriated
for the road projects.
	   ``I want to make it very clear that there is no such agreement
because no rational Palestinian would agree to the confiscation of
land for roads,'' Abbas said on the Voice of Palestine radio.
	   Palestinians protested Israel's appointment of a low-level
delegation to deal with the issue of a further withdrawal after the
13 percent pullback. They said this was an indication that Israel
was not taking Palestinian concerns seriously.
	   The Palestinians also complained that Israel broke a promise
concerning prisoner releases. Under the Wye accord, Israel is to
free 750 prisoners in three stages.
	   In the first stage last month, Israel freed 250 prisoners, but
150 of them were common criminals. Arafat wants all of those
released to be Palestinians jailed for anti-Israeli activities.
	   Bar-Illan said the criteria for the releases were agreed on at
the Mideast summit and that Israel was in compliance. Netanyahu has
said he would not release prisoners involved in attacks on Israelis
or members of Islamic militant groups.

Russian parliament calls for govt. officials to declare income
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament passed a bill Wednesday that
will require lawmakers and top government officials to fully
declare their income and assets each year.
	   The bill, designed to combat widespread corruption, won
unanimous approval in parliament's lower chamber, the State Duma.
To become law, it needs to be approved by parliament's upper
chamber and signed by President Boris Yeltsin.
	   The measure says all top officials must give details of their
income and assets, including information on personal debts, banking
transactions and stock ownership.
	   Yeltsin signed a similar order last year, and he and some other
senior government officials have made such declarations in the
past.
	   The new bill would broaden the practice, making it mandatory for
all Cabinet ministers and lawmakers as well as other officials.
	   Corruption has hampered Russia's free-market reforms and
contributed to the country's economic problems. A number of
officials have been accused or convicted of graft in recent years.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About Indonesian 1,500 students
slipped through heavy security and converged outside the
white-columned presidential palace Wednesday in the boldest
anti-government protest since the Southeast Asian country's
military shot nine demonstrators to death last month.
	   Waving flags and banners, they demanded former authoritarian
President Suharto be prosecuted for corruption and that a full
inquiry be held into the killing of their friends.
	   The standoff ended peacefully when a delegation of 18 student
leaders was escorted into the palace and met a senior government
official.
	   President B.J. Habibie refused to see them. Earlier Wednesday,
he criticized the rising tide of daily protests against him.
	   ``Indonesians have to implement reforms through constitutional
means because it is impossible to implement reforms on the
street,'' he said.
	   In another part of the capital city, riot squads blocked about
500 other students from marching on the national Parliament
building.
	   Others demonstrated outside several government buildings as well
as near the home of Suharto, who resigned in May after deadly riots
and protests against his 32-year autocratic rule.
	   The rally at the palace appeared to take security forces by
surprise even though thousands of troops have been camped in an
adjacent park for weeks.
	   Students in a convoy of dozens of cars and 18 buses slipped into
the area via a side street and then sat down on a road only meters
from the palace's manicured lawns and ornamental fountain.
	   They chanted anti-military slogans as riot officers with sticks
and shields looked on.
	   Five small tanks wheeled into position in front of the Dutch
colonial-built mansion as squads of heavily-armed presidential
guards assembled inside an ornate wrought iron fence.
	   Troop reinforcements were hurriedly trucked in as red-coated
ceremonial guards watched.
	   After about an hour of negotiations, the group of student
leaders was ushered into the palace and held talks with
presidential aide Erman Rajagujuk.
	   They demanded that military chief Gen. Wiranto be held
accountable for the Nov. 13 deaths of the nine students.
	   They also called for an inquiry into the slaying of four other
students shot to death by police in a protest just days before
Suharto quit.
	   They said Suharto should be investigated for corruption and sent
to trial before a general election is held next June.
	   Erman later told reporters Habibie would make an announcement on
Suharto's case within the next few days.
	   ``Hang Suharto,'' shouted the protesters, who want the
77-year-old former army general to be charged with graft and human
rights abuses.
	   ``We will keep protesting until we have justice,'' said Yoke, a
demonstrator.
	   Earlier in the day, security forces blocked 300 students who
drove in buses toward Suharto's house, a frequent target of
protests. Some protesters roughed up a suspected plainclothes
policeman.
	   Habibie has ordered a new probe into the wealth of Suharto, his
onetime mentor. But a panel of investigators has yet to be formed
and opponents question whether the process will be impartial.
	   An earlier investigation by the attorney general's office turned
up no evidence of wrongdoing and student protesters labeled it a
whitewash. Critics say Suharto's family built billion-dollar
business empires partly with state resources.
	   Also Wednesday, several hundred students demonstrated outside
the office of Attorney General Andi Mohamad Ghalib to press for a
trial of Suharto.
	   Another group gathered outside the office of the national
election council to demand that general elections, scheduled by
Habibie next year, be held on time.
	   Habibie has allowed new political parties to form and taken
other steps to dismantle Suharto's rigid political system, but
students say he is moving too slowly on democratic reforms.
	   Indonesia, which is suffering its worst economic crisis in
decades, has endured several outbreaks of religious violence
recently.
	   Muslim mobs burned and ransacked Christian churches in Jakarta
last month and Christian rioters in Kupang, a provincial capital,
targeted mosques this week.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
making it the world's most populous Islamic state.

 &UR; Israeli, Palestinians clash near West Bank settlement
 &UR; Eds: RETRANSMITS to CORRECT dateline. UPDATES with Israeli soldiers
opening fire on Palestinian demonstrators near West Bank settlement
as tensions increase. Changes byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops on Wednesday opened
fire on Palestinian protesters demanding freedom for jailed
activists after the demonstrators beat an Israeli soldier and
burned his car.
	   Two Palestinians were seen being placed in an ambulance, but the
extent of their injuries was not known.
	   The clash began when 150 Palestinians attacked an Israeli
soldier driving near the Jewish settlement of Beit El located just
north of the Palestinian city of Ramallah.
	   Jumping on the hood of the car, the protesters smashed his
windshield, dragged the soldier from the car kicking and seized his
M-16 automatic rifle. They poured kerosene on the car and set it
ablaze.
	   The Israeli soldier, wearing a green uniform, ran away, bleeding
from a head wound and with blood on his hands, as the demonstrators
threw stones at him. The Palestinians also took his mobile
telephone and a briefcase from the soldier.
	   Israeli police stationed at a joint position with Palestinian
counterparts fired pistols into the crowd while nearby Israeli
soldiers opened up with a barrage of rubber-coated metal bullets
and tear gas at the Palestinians. Police confirmed both live rounds
and rubber-coated ammunition was used.
	   The clash, which lasted about half an hour, followed the
stabbing death of a Palestinian street-cleaner in Jerusalem which
police said may have been carried out by an Israeli extremist.
	   There are concerns that the escalating tension could result in a
new round of violence in advance of Clinton's planned trip to
Israel and the Palestinian lands later this month.
	   In Jerusalem, a 41-year-old Palestinian street cleaner, Osama
Musa Natche, was stabbed to death in a mixed neighborhood on the
border between the Arab and Jewish sectors of the city.
	   Israeli police said they were investigating the possibility that
the killer was an Israeli who has already murdered one Palestinian
and wounded five in earlier attacks.
	   ``There are a number of items of evidence on the scene of the
crime which suggests that the motive for the crime was
nationalist,'' said Jerusalem police commander Yair Yitzhaki.
	   Israeli officials said Wednesday that Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu had complained in a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton
that the Palestinians have repeatedly violated the Wye River peace
agreement.
	   At the same time, Palestinian officials accused Israel of
violating the Wye River summit accord by not freeing jailed
Palestinian activists and by confiscating West Bank land.
	   In a two-page letter sent Sunday, Netanyahu asked Clinton to
step in and use his influence to halt the Palestinian violations.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu, said the sending of
the letter indicates that ``there is a danger to the peace process
if the violations continue.'' But he said that, as of now, the
Clinton visit to the region Dec. 12-15 was ``a go.''
	   In the letter, Bar-Illan said, Netanyahu objected to recent
statements, including one by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, that
a Palestinian state would be declared on May 4, 1999.
	   The daily Maariv newspaper said Netanyahu asked Clinton to
publicly distance himself from Arafat's statements and persuade the
Palestinian leader to withdraw his remarks.
	   The Wye accord, negotiated with Clinton's help in October, urges
both Israel and the Palestinians to refrain from unilateral steps
that would prejudge the outcome of talks on a permanent peace
accord that are scheduled to be complete by next May 4.
	   The Palestinians issued a series of complaints about Israeli
violations of the Wye accord reached in October. It obligates
Israel to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank in three stages
by the end of January in exchange for Palestinian security
measures, including a crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, said Wednesday that Israel's
plans to construct more than a dozen access roads for Jewish
settlements in the West Bank was not approved at the Wye River
summit. Israel's Cabinet approved the building to improve security
for Jewish communities isolated by the planned withdrawals.
	   Thousands of acres of Palestinian land are being expropriated
for the road projects.
	   ``I want to make it very clear that there is no such agreement
because no rational Palestinian would agree to the confiscation of
land for roads,'' Abbas said on the Voice of Palestine radio.
	   Palestinians protested Israel's appointment of a low-level
delegation to deal with the issue of a further withdrawal after the
13 percent pullback. They said this was an indication that Israel
was not taking Palestinian concerns seriously.
	   The Palestinians also complained that Israel broke a promise
concerning prisoner releases. Under the Wye accord, Israel is to
free 750 prisoners in three stages.
	   In the first stage last month, Israel freed 250 prisoners, but
150 of them were common criminals. Arafat wants all of those
released to be Palestinians jailed for anti-Israeli activities.
	   Bar-Illan said the criteria for the releases were agreed on at
the Mideast summit and that Israel was in compliance. Netanyahu has
said he would not release prisoners involved in attacks on Israelis
or members of Islamic militant groups.

One-quarter of a billion people at risk from desertification
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) _ Over 250 million people face hunger and
poverty as a result of expanding deserts around the world,
according to U.N. figures presented to delegates at a conference on
desertification Wednesday.
	   Africa is one of the worst affected regions, with almost
three-quarters of its landmass severely or moderately affected by
drought triggered by changing climate patterns and harmful
agricultural practices, the U.N. report said.
	   For years, scientists have warned of the desertification of
arable lands on the edge of existing deserts, including Africa's
Sahara and China's Gobi. Deforestation, over-cultivation and
drought mean each year deserts expand and engulf once arable land.
	   The consequences in Africa have been devastating.
	   More than 200,000 people have died since the early 1970s as a
result of starvation brought on by drought, while about dlrs 9
billion to African economies, the U.N. report said.
	   Leading scientists gathered this week in the West African nation
of Senegal say evidence of the Sahara's expansion proves their
earlier predictions correct.
	   Delegates at the conference, which opened Tuesday, are debating
ways to fight land degradation and reduce the affects of drought.
	   Senegal's President Abdou Diouf confirmed U.N. estimates that
about two-fifths of the residents of the Bakel region in the
northeastern part of the West African country had emigrated as a
result of long-term drought.
	   ``There are more people from the Bakel region now in France than
there are in the villages they left behind,'' the U.N. report said.
``Yet given the chance, people would prefer to stay.''
	   Nigeria, a country whose southern coastal region is in the humid
tropics, has 11 northern states which are threatened by
desertification, said Enoch Okpara, head of the Nigerian delegation
attending the conference.
	   ``It has taken a terrible toll on the lives of the people in the
affected areas,'' Okpara said, adding that since droughts began in
the 1970s ``millions of cattle and hundreds of human lives have
been lost.''
	   The conference continues until the end of next week.

Australia's Antarctic supply ship stuck in ice

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australia's Antarctic supply ship
Aurora Australis is stuck in pack ice off Antarctica with a damaged
propeller, Australia's Antarctic Division said Wednesday.
	   The director of the division, Tony Press, said the ship became
trapped in ice some days ago but the crew was in no danger and
there are plenty of supplies on board.
	   The Aurora Australis is carrying 69 expeditioners and 24 crew
members.
	   Press said it was unclear how long the ship will be stuck or
whether the crew had the necessary equipment to fix the ship's
damaged propeller.
	   ``It's temporarily caught in pack ice and that can change
depending on the weather,'' he said.
	   ``It's been caught in the ice for several days but the problems
with the propeller were only discovered the evening before last.''
	   The Aurora Australis was in the process of changing crews at
bases in Antarctica, as well as carrying out scientific
experiments, including field surveys, he said.
	   ``The ship had been making trips to the Antarctica for about 10
years,'' he said. ``It's not unusual for ships to be temporarily
caught in ice.''
	   The Australian government has been considering a two-ship policy
for its Antarctic bases, or possibly building Antarctic air strips
for supply by aircraft.

Hong Kong seizes U.S. dlrs 718,000 worth of pirated discs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong customs officials said Wednesday they
had raided an unlicensed video compact disc operation, seizing U.S.
dlrs 718,000 million worth of pirated discs.
	   Officers confiscated 270,000 video compact discs, including
Japanese television dramas and pornographic films, in Tuesday's
operation.
	   ``We believed the seizure is for distribution to notorious
shops'' in several Hong Kong districts, customs officials said in a
statement.
	   Hong Kong has come under international pressure, especially from
Japanese television program producers and U.S. officials, to do a
better job of protecting intellectual property. Washington has
placed the territory on a watch list of countries suspected of
copyright violations.
	   Despite frequent raids, stores selling pirated video compact
discs or CD-ROMs are common in Hong Kong, often reopening several
days after they have been raided.
	   Last year, customs officials seized 140 million Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 17.9 million) worth of counterfeit products and
arrested 1,538 suspects.

President names Salim Hoss as new prime minister

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The president named the U.S.-educated
economist Salim Hoss as the next prime minister of Lebanon on
Wednesday.
	   Hoss accepted the appointment, telling reporters after meeting
President Emile Lahoud: ``We are facing big challenges which we
should confront.''
	   He said his government would work to reduce the budget deficit
and continue efforts to end Israel's occupation of southern
Lebanon.
	   His first task would be to appoint a Cabinet, he added.
	   Lahoud issued a decree appointing Hoss after he secured a
majority of recommendations from the Parliament. Speaker Nabih
Berri said Wednesday that Hoss had the support of 95 of the 128
lawmakers in the half-Christian, half-Muslim legislature.
	   Hoss, a legislator from Beirut who turns 69 on Dec. 20, has held
the premiership on four previous occasions. He survived a 1987 car
bombing that killed a bodyguard in his motorcade.
	   Hoss became a contender for the post after the current prime
minister, Rafik Hariri, bowed out Monday in a power struggle with
Lahoud. Hariri has been serving in a caretaker capacity since
Lahoud's inauguration last week.
	   Hariri, a billionaire businessman, became prime minister in 1992
and launched the multibillion dollar program to rebuild Lebanon
from the devastation of the 1975-90 civil war. But his policy of
borrowing generously sank the country deep in debt and ordinary
Lebanese complained that the benefits of reconstruction had not
reached them.
	   When Lahoud sounded out legislators about re-appointing Hariri,
the prime minister received majority support, but not by the
overwhelming margin he had enjoyed in the past.
	   Hoss is a Sunni Muslim, like every prime minister under
Lebanon's power-sharing arrangement. The president is a Maronite
Catholic, and the speaker is a Shiite Muslim.
	   A soft-spoken, down-to-earth man, Hoss's style of government is
expected to be quite different from that of the flamboyant Hariri.
	   He is expected to have a good working relationship with Lahoud,
whose goal of ridding the administration of corruption he is known
to share. In his previous terms as prime minister, Hoss has earned
a reputation as an honest politician.
	   A graduate in business and economics from Indiana University at
Bloomington, Hoss will have his work cut out on the financial
front.
	   He will have to calm markets made jittery by the sudden
departure of Hariri. The central bank has said it will intervene to
support the Lebanese pound, which has been stable in the past few
days.
	   A harder task will be to cut the budget deficit, now estimated
to be running at 17 percent of the Gross Domestic Product _ the
value of all goods and services produced within the country.
	   Like almost all politicians in Lebanon, Hoss is an ally of
Syria, which maintains some 30,000 troops in Lebanon and is the
main power-broker in the country.
	   Lebanon has refused offers to negotiate a separate peace with
Israel, saying the Israelis must also make peace with Syria. Israel
has occupied a zone in south Lebanon, amounting to 10 percent of
the country, since 1985 as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on
its northern territory.
	   Hoss first served as prime minister in 1976, in the early days
of the civil war, and after the assassination of Prime Minister
Rashid Karami in 1987. He was named to the post again in 1989 under
President Rene Mouawad and the following year under President Elias
Hrawi.

German court upholds another sentence for neo-Nazi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ A court has ruled that a neo-Nazi in
jail for defamation of Jews should serve another three months for
asking a Holocaust survivor why the Nazis permitted him to live.
	   A district court in Karlsruhe on Tuesday rejected an appeal from
Guenter Deckert, 58, the former leader of the extreme-right
National Party of Germany but did not grant the eight-month term
state prosecutors had demanded.
	   Deckert received the additonal three months because he wrote to
a Jewish concentration camp survivor asking him out of ``historical
interest'' why Nazi leaders, ``who wanted to remove/destroy all
Jews ... permitted you to survive.''
	   In November, he was sentenced to four years and nine months for
defaming Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in
Germany, by calling him a ``Jewish Fuehrer.'' He also threatened to
kill a police officer sent to arrest him in 1995.

Israeli, Palestinians clash near West Bank settlement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES Israel-Stabbing. &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops on Wednesday opened
fire on Palestinian protesters demanding freedom for jailed
activists after the demonstrators beat an Israeli soldier and
burned his car.
	   Two Palestinians were placed in an ambulance, but the extent of
their injuries was not known.
	   The clash began when 150 Palestinians attacked an Israeli
soldier driving near the Jewish settlement of Beit El.
	   Jumping on the hood of the car, the protesters smashed his
windshield, dragged the soldier from the car kicking and seized his
M-16 automatic rifle. They poured kerosene on the car and set it
ablaze.
	   The Israeli soldier, wearing a green uniform, ran away, bleeding
from a head wound and with blood on his hands, as the demonstrators
threw stones at him. The Palestinians also took a mobile telephone
and a briefcase from the soldier.
	   Israeli police stationed at a joint position with Palestinian
counterparts fired pistols into the crowd while nearby Israeli
soldiers opened up with a barrage of rubber-coated metal bullets
and tear gas at the Palestinians. Police confirmed both live rounds
and rubber-coated ammunition were used.
	   The clash, which lasted about half an hour, followed the
stabbing death of a Palestinian street-cleaner in Jerusalem which
police said may have been carried out by an Israeli extremist.
	   There are concerns that the escalating tension could result in
new violence in advance of U.S. President Bill Clinton's trip to
Israel and the Palestinian lands later this month.
	   The stabbing of 41-year-old Palestinian street cleaner Osama
Musa Natche occurred in a mixed neighborhood of Jerusalem on the
border between the Arab and Jewish sectors of the city.
	   Israeli police said they were investigating the possibility that
the killer was an Israeli nationalist who has already murdered one
Palestinian and wounded five in earlier attacks.
	   Meanwhile, Israeli officials said Wednesday that Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu had sent a letter to Clinton accusing the
Palestinians of repeatedly violating the Wye River peace agreement
signed in October.
	   At the same time, Palestinian officials accused Israel of
violating accord by not freeing jailed Palestinian activists and by
confiscating West Bank land.
	   In a two-page letter sent Sunday, Netanyahu asked Clinton to use
his influence to halt the Palestinian violations.
	   The letter indicates that ``there is a danger to the peace
process if the violations continue,'' said David Bar-Illan, an aide
to the prime minister.
	   In the letter, Bar-Illan said, Netanyahu objected to recent
statements, including one by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, that
a Palestinian state would be declared on May 4, 1999.
	   The daily Maariv newspaper said Netanyahu asked Clinton to
publicly distance himself from Arafat's statements and persuade the
Palestinian leader to withdraw his remarks.
	   The Wye accord, negotiated with Clinton's help in October, urges
both Israel and the Palestinians to refrain from unilateral steps
that would prejudge the outcome of talks on a permanent peace
accord that are scheduled to be complete by next May 4.
	   The Palestinians issued a series of complaints about Israeli
violations of the Wye accord, which obligated Israel to withdraw
from 13 percent of the West Bank in three stages by the end of
January in exchange for Palestinian security measures.
	   Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, said Wednesday that Israel's
plans to construct more than a dozen access roads for Jewish
settlements in the West Bank was not approved at the Wye River
summit. Israel's Cabinet approved the building to improve security
for Jewish communities isolated by the planned withdrawals.
	   Thousands of acres (hectares) of Palestinian land are being
expropriated for the road projects.
	   ``I want to make it very clear that there is no such agreement
because no rational Palestinian would agree to the confiscation of
land for roads,'' Abbas said on the Voice of Palestine radio.
	   The Palestinians also complained that Israel broke a promise
concerning prisoner releases. Under the Wye accord, Israel is to
free 750 prisoners in three stages.
	   In the first stage last month, Israel freed 250 prisoners, but
150 of them were common criminals. Arafat wants all of those
released to be Palestinians jailed for anti-Israeli activities.
	   Bar-Illan said Israel has complied with the agreement. Netanyahu
has said he would not release prisoners involved in attacks on
Israelis or members of Islamic militant groups.

Indonesian union leader says Australia is Suharto's PR company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LORNE, Australia (AP) _ An Indonesian trade union leader
criticized the Australian government Wednesday, saying it was
behaving like an international public relations company for
Indonesia's autocratic former president, Suharto.
	   In Australia for the Australian Council of Trade Unions annual
council meeting, Muchtar Pakpahan said the federal government was
defending the ``human rights violations of the corrupt Suharto
regime.''
	   ``The Australian government has become the public relations of
Suharto ... at the human rights summit meeting in Geneva last year,
only the Australians said that human rights in Indonesia were very
good,'' he told reporters.
	   Pakpahan's criticisms echoed those of Nobel Peace laureate Jose
Ramos Horta, who said Australia's most vocal protests against
Indonesian human rights violations were made during the term of the
former Labor government.
	   Jailed by the Suharto-era government for organizing unions,
Pakpahan, who is national chairman of the Indonesian Prosperity
Trade Union Federation Central Board, also said Prime Minister John
Howard's government had tried to block his visit to Australia.
	   ``When I went to the Australian Embassy to apply for a visa I
was told that because I had been jailed I would not be able to be
given one,'' he said.
	   ``To fight for democracy in a country like Indonesia you have to
expect to be jailed, so why is it that Australian officials want to
ban people fighting for a democracy.''
	   Pakpahan said his visa was granted after an appeal.
	   Indonesian trade unions needed financial and administrative
support and Australia was noticeably missing from the nations who
had provided such support, Pakpahan said.
	   ACTU assistant secretary Bill Mansfield said an approach would
be made to the Australian government asking it to follow the lead
of the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, Norway and Finland.
	   ``Australia is the closest and largest economy to Indonesia and
if a country as far away as Finland can give help to the emerging
union movement, then surely we can,'' he said.
	   Indonesian unions also wanted to establish an alternate food
supply, to bypass what Pakpahan described as the ``corrupt food
chain'' that delivered rice at inflated prices to impoverished
Indonesians.
	   He had also asked the ACTU to provide his union movement with
money to fund training courses and build meeting rooms.

Tight security prevailed for Juventus

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Security was tight in Istanbul on
Wednesday ahead of the politically charged Champions League match
between Juventus of Turin and Galatasaray.
	   Around 22,000 police officers were being deployed for the game
amid fears that angry Turkish fans might resort to violence against
the Italians. Military units were on standby.
	   Turks are outraged at Italy for refusing to extradite a Kurdish
rebel leader.
	   Authorities also said they worried about a provocation by the
rebels aimed at staining Turkey's image.
	   Security officials were monitoring cameras placed at the
entrances of the hotel where the Juventus players were to rest
until the 9:45 p.m. (1945 GMT) match at and police escorts were
ready to escort the team in motorcades when they moved around the
city.
	   At Ali Sami Yen stadium, security officials planned body
searches of all spectators for weapons or items like loose change
which could be hurled at the field. Authorities banned fireworks
and banners.
	   On Tuesday, police stopped a group of fans sneaking into the
stadium with a banner reading: ``Italy! Extradite that bloody
terrorist to Turkey,'' daily Milliyet reported. Another newspaper
said two helicopters would be nearby to evacuate the Italian team
in case of violence.
	   Ocalan leads a guerrilla force which has been fighting for
Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey for since 1984. The
conflict has killed about 37,000 people.
	   UEFA, European soccer's governing body, had postponed the match
by a week because of anti-Italian sentiment in Turkey. Juventus
decided to go to Istanbul on Wednesday, instead of the day before
the match as is usual, and return home right after the game.
	   Juventus, which has reached the European Champions Cup final
three straight times and won once, needed a victory against the
Turkish team to keep its qualifying chances alive.
	   Galatasaray has seven points in Group B, one behind Norway's
Rosenborg. Juventus has four, but both teams have played one fewer
game than the Norwegians.

Jones, Godina win Owens Awards
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Marion Jones is getting pressure from all
around.
	   There's the pressure to break world records in the 100 and 200
meters, the pressure to be the savior of track and field and the
pressure from promoters to compete at their meets.
	   The 23-year-old Jones is not letting the pressure affect her.
	   ``I think the world records are possible, but I'm not going to
say they're going to happen,'' Jones said in a conference call
Tuesday, after being chosen winner of the Jesse Owens Memorial
Award as the outstanding woman athlete in the United States this
year.
	   ``Before my career ends, maybe they will happen. But I don't
need the pressure (of thinking about them).''
	   Florence Griffith Joyner owns the 100 and 200 records of 10.49
seconds and 21.34. This year, Jones ran 10.65 and 21.62, making her
the No. 2 performer behind the late FloJo.
	   Because of her sensational, albeit brief, career _ Jones has
been competing full-time for only 18 months. She, along with men's
Owens Award winner John Godina, and some other young athletes, are
being counted on to resurrect the sport in this country.
	   ``Track and field in the United States is in a terrible state,''
she said. ``But the idea of the younger athletes trying to bring
the sport back to the popularity of years ago is unfair.
	   ``We can run fast, jump high and throw far, but somebody else
has to contribute to bring back the sport. That's too much pressure
(for us).''
	   Godina agreed.
	   ``It's unfair to heap the problems in the sport on people who
were not there when the problems began,'' Godina, 26, said.
	   ``It's a challenge, but I think it can be brought back.''
	   Like the swift Jones, the powerful Godina was a world leader in
two events this year. He hurled the shot put 71 feet, 5 1/2 inches
(21.7805 meters) while going unbeaten in 17 competitions, and threw
the discus 229-4 (69.9 meters) while winning six of 12 meets.
	   Jones was even busier in 1998. She won a total of 36 consecutive
finals in the 60, 100, 200, 400 and long jump before finishing
second to Germany's Heike Drechsler in the long jump at the World
Cup in Johannesburg, South Africa, in her final competition.
	   Because of their prowess, the two are among the most highly
sought track and field athletes in the world. Promoters want _ and
need _ them to attract fans.
	   Nevertheless, both plan to compete less in 1999 than they did
this year.
	   Since the 200 is the only one of Jones' three major events that
will be a Grand Prix event next year, she plans to concentrate on
that race leading up to the World Championships at Seville, Spain.
There, she will go for four golds medals _ in the 100, 200, long
jump and a relay. She is skipping the entire indoor season.
	   Godina will throw at only three indoor meets, including the USA
Championships at Atlanta and the World Championships at Maebashi,
Japan. He then will compete on a limited basis on the lucrative
European outdoor circuit, so he will be at his peak for an
unprecedented shot put-discus double at the World Championships.
	   ``European trips can be a distraction,'' he said.
	   Both Jones and Godina completed rare achievements at this year's
USA Outdoor Championships. Jones won the 100, 200 and long jump,
the first such triple in 50 years. Godina took the shot put and
discus, the first such double in 43 years.
	   Those performances helped Jones win the Owens Award for the
second consecutive year and Godina to become the first weight man
to win the honor.
	   They will receive their awards Friday night at the Jesse Owens
banquet during the U.S. Track and Field convention in Orlando,
Florida.

Indonesian quake toll rises to 26 after woman's body found
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The death toll from a massive
earthquake that devastated a tiny Indonesian island rose to 26
Wednesday when searchers found the body of a female victim.
	   Seven villagers remain listed as missing, officials said.
	   A 6.5-magnitude quake rocked Mangole Island in the Maluku Sea on
Sunday night, flattening buildings and triggering landslides.
	   Six people were reported killed initially on the island, about
1,900 kilometers (1,180 miles) northeast of Indonesia's capital,
Jakarta.
	   The toll rose to 25 on Tuesday after reports came in from
isolated villages.
	   The latest victim was found near the island's ruined port.
	   Local government officials said more than 150 people were
injured and more than 858 homes and buildings damaged on Mangole
and neighboring Taliabu island.
	   Seismologists said more than 300 aftershocks had been detected
since Sunday's quake.
	   Mangole and Taliabu are part of the Maluku archipelago, known in
colonial times as the Spice Islands.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A car carrying three Norwegian journalists
ran off the road and overturned on Wednesday, killing one of the
journalists and injuring the other two, an Iraqi official said.
	   A diplomat at the Norwegian Embassy in the Jordanian capital
Amman said the driver, believed to be a Jordanian, also was hurt in
the crash.
	   The accident occurred 350 kilometers (210 miles) west of
Baghdad.
	   The car was traveling to the Iraqi capital from Amman along a
route that is one of the few ways into the country because of U.N.
sanctions that ban air travel.
	   In Oslo, officials at TV2 said that two of its staffers were
involved in the accident. They said cameraman Knut Andre Danielsen
was killed and reporter Anders Saether was injured, but not
seriously.
	   It was unclear for whom the other injured journalist worked.
	   Mohsin Tarfa, acting director of the Iraqi Press Center in
Baghdad, gave reporters details of the crash and said the injured
journalists were taken to a hospital in Baghdad for treatment.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the driver required
hospitalization, according to the Norwegian diplomat, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Nearly all visitors to Iraq must take the 12-hour journey
through the desert from Amman to Baghdad.

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ After 10 years and 256 billion lire (dlrs
150 million) in studies, it's deadline time for Italy's government
on an ambitious sea-barrier project to shield ever-sinking Venice
from the ever-rising Adriatic.
	   After years of waiting for a decision, let alone action, the
water-logged people of low-lying areas of Venice have had it up to
here with studies and up to here with flooding.
	   ``Yes, this high,'' the Rev. Mario Senigaglia of St. Stefano
says, chopping sideways with his hand to show the level of the
water that washed into his 14th-century church, scattering its
18th-century pews.
	   ``Here,'' merchant Elizabeta Rosato says, gesturing toward the
foot of her jewelry showcase to mark the height of floods that
regularly shut down the shops lining St. Mark's Square.
	   ``Up to here,'' vendor Vittorio Salis says at his pigeon-food
stand in the middle of the cobblestone square, indicating a point
on his rubber-booted legs well above pigeon level.
	   Venetians know it as ``acqua alta:'' high water. Pushed by tides
and wind, high water of 80 cms (32 inches) or more flooded St.
Mark's Square and other low-lying areas of the city 79 times in
1997. That would have been a record _ if not for the unprecedented
101 times the year before.
	   When acqua alta hits, ``We don't work,'' Salis says. ``The whole
city stops.''
	   Venice has been coping with acqua alta by relying increasingly
on plank walkways thrown down on metal sawhorses and on rubber
boots _ hotels hand them out to tourists for a deposit. When the
water level is too high, stranded tourists fret in their hotels and
idled workers stay home.
	   ``The lure of Venice is the water _ but certainly not to splash
around in,'' said James Quaile of Turnersville, New Jersey, lined
up with his family on a bleacher-like walkway leading into St.
Mark's.
	   Project Moses would confront the flooding at its source: the
Adriatic.
	   Engineers propose putting barriers 30 meters (98 feet) tall on
the seabed at three entrances to the lagoon. The barriers would
stay out of sight except during flooding, when the top 2 meters (6
feet) would jut out to block the waves.
	   The name of the project, evocative as it is of a biblical
parting of the waters, is simply a matter-of-fact reference to the
mobile gates.
	   An Environment Ministry committee's decision, already overdue by
weeks, is now expected soon.
	   Slowing the 4.4 trillion lire (dlrs 2.6 billion) project has
been the fact that Venice officials themselves are dubious or
downright dismissive. Flops like a never-finished scheme to build a
bridge to Sicily have soured many Italians on big projects, leaving
some fearing Project Moses would be another boondoggle-by-the-bay.
	   Armando Danella, a city director in the project, insists the sea
barriers are simply unnecessary.
	   ``There are inconveniences and damages in Venice due to the
flooding, but it is all relative,'' Danella was quoted by Italy
Daily newspaper as saying. ``No one is dying here.''
	   Rosata, the jewelry saleswoman, refers to that as the city
leaders' ``let-them-wear-gumboots'' attitude.
	   But many environmentalists and their political allies oppose the
project as well, saying global warming means the floodgates
eventually will be up more often than down, ultimately sealing the
city from the sea.
	   Venice, once the maritime power of the world, would be left an
artificial theme park for gondola-riding tourists.
	   Better, opponents say, to use less drastic measures, including
raising the foundations and pavements of Venice.
	   Project Moses' backers say drastic measures are what it takes:
With the city settling due partly to past groundwater pumping and
the oceans surging due partly to global warming, the sea now
lapping at St. Mark's Square is projected to rise anywhere from 13
to 94 cms (5 inches to 37 inches) by the end of the next century.
	   Salis, now ankle-deep in pigeons at his stand in the square,
thinks he sees what the future holds for Venice, unless something
big is done. ``Acqua alta,'' he says. ``Always _ acqua alta.''

U.N. Secretary-General meets Algerian president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met
with Algerian President Liamine Zeroual on Wednesday at the end of
a visit aimed at ending the conflict in the Western Sahara.
	   Over the past two days, Annan has worked to revive plans for a
U.N.-sponsored referendum on the Western Sahara territory, where
Algeria has supported rebels who say the region should be
independent.
	   Morocco claims the territory, which is the size of Italy. For
decades, Polisario Front rebels battled Moroccan troops for control
of the swath of desert along the Atlantic Ocean.
	   The referendum had been set for Dec. 7 but has now been moved to
December 1999. It has been delayed by disputes about who is
eligible to vote. Morocco insists some 65,000 people from three
tribes should be on the list that now carries some 90,000 names.
	   Annan visited Morocco and the Western Sahara territory claimed
by the kingdom in early November but returned to U.N. headquarters
in New York because of the Iraqi crisis.
	   He took up the trip again on Monday with a visit to the Smara
refugee camp, one of several camps in the bleak desert of southern
Algeria run by Polisario Front rebels seeking independence for the
Western Sahara.
	   Morocco annexed the former Spanish Sahara after Spain abandoned
it in 1975 and has spent vast sums developing the region.
	   In Smara, Annan said he got full agreement from Polisario chief
Mohammed Abdelaziz to new proposals on how to resolve the dispute
over who can take part in the referendum, but that Morocco wanted
further clarification.
	   Plans for a referendum began after the United Nations clinched a
cease-fire in 1991 between the Polisario and the Moroccan army.
	   Annan has said he hoped neighboring countries like Mauritania
could play a useful role in helping to resolve the crisis.
	   Annan was scheduled to leave for Tunis later Wednesday.

Gang ambushes Spanish trucks carrying pigs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A roadside gang ambushed two Spanish
trucks carrying 505 imported pigs, driving the vehicles into a
shallow ravine where they tipped over, killing and injuring many of
the animals.
	   Police said they had no information about who was behind the
attack Tuesday night, but suspicion fell on Portuguese pig farmers
who in recent weeks have stepped up their protests against falling
pork prices.
	   The trucks were traveling on a narrow country road just after
midnight near Palmela, 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Lisbon,
when they were stopped by a group of about 15 men, police spokesman
Paulo Soares said.
	   Some wore hoods and one had a pistol, he said.
	   Two of the men boarded the trucks and drove them into the
ravine. The trucks fell onto their sides, crushing some pigs to
death and injuring others, Soares said.
	   Some pigs escaped and fled into the countryside, Soares said.
	   The trucks were on there way to Palmela from Navarra in northern
Spain.
	   Last week, riot police used water cannon, horses and dogs to
break up a demonstration of protesting pig farmers who had
blockaded a road in a rural town.
	   The farmers have also released piglets in the center of major
cities. They want the government to give them more financial aid
and place restrictions on pork imports.

Philippine presidential guards reprimanded for alleged sexual

harassment
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES lead, 2nd grafs with reprimand of guards.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Elite military guards protecting
Philippine President Joseph Estrada were reprimanded Wednesday in
response to complaints of sexual harassment from female reporters.
	   The Presidential Security Group also instituted new guidelines
agreed to Tuesday by reporters and senior PSG officers, Acting
Press Secretary Icasiano Gutierrez said.
	   During so-called ``ambush interviews'' when reporters crowd
around Estrada asking for comments, fewer guards will stand between
the president and the journalists who regularly cover him,
Gutierrez said.
	   Instead, most of the guards now will stand outside the circle of
reporters, he said.
	   The decision follows complaints from a number of female
reporters, who make up more than half of the presidential press
corps, that guards intentionally touched their breasts or buttocks
while pushing them away from Estrada.
	   On Tuesday, Estrada apologized to reporters after being informed
of the complaints.
	   ``I'm sorry for what happened. I did not know that,'' Estrada
said. ``That will not be repeated, but in the spirit of Christmas,
let us forgive them.''
	   PSG deputy head Col. Rudolfo Diaz issued a reprimand Wednesday
to security detail members involved in the reported incidents.
	   Isabel de Leon, a reporter for the Manila Bulletin and former
head of the presidential press corps, said the problem arose
because ``overzealous'' presidential guards put themselves between
Estrada and the journalists.
	   ``We had to stick our recorders and mikes in between the
outstretched arms of the presidential guards,'' she said. ``That is
clearly a situation where guards can take advantage of women
reporters.''
	   De Leon said the corps has recorded at least 10 cases of sexual
abuses by presidential guards.
	   She said that under the new agreement, female reporters can
either immediately slap the face of an offending guard or file a
complaint with his superior officer.
	   Gutierrez said he has scheduled a party for members of the press
corps and the presidential guards to make them more familiar with
each other.
	   ``We are one family. We have to live with each other,'' he said.
	   The chief of the Presidential Security Group, Ruben Domingo,
also apologized for his men's actions but said any offenses were
``not intentional.''
	   Domingo said many of the guards were new to their jobs and the
incidents were due to ``their aggressiveness to do their task.''
	   ``It was overzealousness bordering on disrespect,'' he said.

Ukrainian nuclear disarmament leaves army officers homeless
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Viacheslav Havlytsky still recalls the day
when his nuclear weapons unit relinquished its last bomb in
exchange for a promise of new housing.
	   It was 1993 when Ukraine agreed to turn over its former Soviet
nuclear arsenal, the world's third-largest, to Russia for
dismantling. The United States, eager to promote nuclear
disarmament, agreed to fund construction of about 2,000 apartments
for officers who would be left jobless as a result.
	   But Havlytsky, a retired lieutenant colonel who served at a
nuclear weapons base, says the apartments have been misappropriated
by senior commanders for their own use.
	   ``We were deceived in the rudest possible way,'' Havlytsky said.
``Now no one needs us.''
	   The officers were told to choose among several cities where
apartments were to be built _ a generous offer in a country with
thousands of homeless military retirees and career officers.
	   The schedule for construction and distribution of apartments,
conducted with financial assistance from the United States, was
finally approved by the Defense Ministry in 1996.
	   Under the plan, officers in Havlytsky's detachment, which ran a
secret base for storing nuclear warheads, were to receive 159
apartments, with 93 to be ready by the end of 1997.
	   ``All the high-ranking guests who visited our base, including
the president and the defense minister, reassured us that each of
us would have a place to live,'' said retired Maj. Oleksandr
Kuzmych, another officer from Object S, the nuclear base's code
name.
	   But only 21 officers received apartments last year, and none so
far this year.
	   Havlytsky produced a letter from the U.S. Embassy saying the
apartments had been built. A written inquiry about the homes' fate
sent by The Associated Press to the Defense Ministry went
unanswered for a month.
	   When the officers asked when they would get their new homes,
they were told their old unit had been transferred to another
command that was not eligible for the apartment program.
	   ``We were told we can no longer count on apartments distributed
under the agreement because our base is not part of the former
nuclear force,'' Kuzmych said in an interview.
	   That was a shock to the officers, many of them in their forties,
who saw their hopes of starting a new life abruptly vanish.
	   Entangled in military red tape, they wrote numerous letters to
the Defense Ministry, trying to prove they should still be eligible
for new homes as direct participants in Ukraine's nuclear
disarmament.
	   But the response they received from the 43rd Army in July
contained little in the way of promises: ``One thousand
seventy-nine officers in our army do not have apartments, so we do
not have a possibility to consider allocating apartments for your
unit in the near future,'' it said.
	   The ex-officers believe they are victims of the country's
rampant corruption and say the apartments apparently were
distributed to top officers who were not supposed to get them.
	   Today, they stay with their families at military homes near the
former nuclear base, surviving on 120 hryvna (dlrs 35) monthly
pensions, of which 100 hryvna (dlrs 29) is spent on apartment fees.
	   The officers have tried to return to army service, but their
expertise as nuclear professionals is no longer needed in
nuclear-free Ukraine.
	   Havlytsky recalls how in May 1996 his unit bid farewell to the
last nuclear warhead before dispatching it to Russia.
	   ``We wrote `feeding mother' on it as we really depended on these
weapons for our living,'' he said. ``Now we understand how
prophetic we were then.''

UEFA suspends Parlour, Dixon after Champions League clash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Arsenal's Ray Parlour and Lee Dixon
have been suspended for at least one European match following
incidents during their club's defeat by Lens last week, UEFA said
Wednesday.
	   UEFA's control and disciplinary body also suspended Lens' Tony
Vairelles for one match for ``unsporting behavior.'' The French
champion's 1-0 win at Wembley put Arsenal out of the Champions Cup.
	   Arsenal midfielder Parlour was sent off in the final minute for
striking out at Cyril Rool. He was followed a minute later by
Vairelles for a foul challenge on Dixon.
	   Dixon's suspension was imposed for ``an elbow-strike in the back
of an opponent,'' UEFA said. The disciplinary body will take a
final decision in January on the length of the Arsenal players'
suspensions.
	   Rool and Lens defender Eric Sikora each received one-match
suspensions after receiving the season's second booking.

Cathay Pacific Airways misses revenue targets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Cathay Pacific Airways said Wednesday its
passenger revenue fell 24 percent below the company's target in
October, and initial figures from November look similarly bad.
	   Revenue from Southeast Asian routes was 27 percent below the
company's goal, with recent riots in Jakarta hurting business on
its Indonesian routes, Hong Kong's flag carrier said in an internal
newsletter.
	   The number of passengers on Cathay's flights has fallen sharply
in the past year because of stiffer competition from other Asian
airlines and because Hong Kong's strong currency dissuaded many
Asians from visiting the territory.
	   The company reported its first financial loss _ 175 million Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 22.4 million) _ from January to June of
this year. Cathay Pacific did not specify numbers for its revenues
or for the targets that it missed.
	   Still, there were some bright spots during October, the company
said. Cathay Pacific flew a higher number of high-paying business
travelers, so it missed its target in that segment of its
operations by less than it had in previous months.
	   Cathay Pacific also enjoyed stronger revenues on some Middle
East routes.
	   Revenue from Philippine routes also increased because of
troubles plaguing Philippine Air.
	   Separately, Cathay Pacific said Wednesday it had pulled out of
talks to buy a stake in PAL, which stopped flying for about two
weeks earlier this year due to a labor dispute.
	   Cathay also said revenue on its busy flights to Taiwan was 17
percent over an initial forecast. Revenue from Cathay's long-haul
Europe destinations is also on an upward trend, due partly to signs
of recovery in the German market.

FIBA upholds two-year ban on Puerto Rico's Jose Ortiz
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Basektball's world governing body FIBA
has upheld a two-year drug ban on Puerto Rican center and former
NBA player Jose Ortiz.
	   Ortiz tested positive for the banned steroid stanozolol during
the World Basketball Championship this summer in Athens. Stanozolol
is the same steroid that Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson tested
positive for at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Security was tight in Istanbul on
Wednesday ahead of the politically charged Champions League match
between Juventus of Turin and Galatasaray.
	   Around 22,000 police officers were being deployed for the game
amid fears that angry Turkish fans might resort to violence against
the Italians. Military units were on standby.
	   Turks are outraged at Italy for refusing to extradite a Kurdish
rebel leader.
	   Authorities also said they worried about a provocation by the
rebels aimed at staining Turkey's image.
	   Hundreds of police were on hand when the Italian team arrived at
the Istanbul airport Wednesday and police were on alert along the
route to their hotel. There were no signs of demonstrations.
	   Security officials also were monitoring cameras placed at the
entrances of the hotel where the Juventus players were to rest
until the 9:45 p.m. (1945 GMT) match at and police motorcades were
to escort the team to the stadium.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A car carrying three Norwegian journalists
ran off the road and overturned on Wednesday, killing one and
injuring the other two, an Iraqi official said.
	   A diplomat at the Norwegian embassy in the Jordanian capital,
Amman, said the driver, believed to be a Jordanian, also was hurt
in the crash.
	   The accident occurred 210 miles (350 kms) west of Baghdad.
	   The car was traveling to the Iraqi capital from Amman along a
route that is one of the few entry points into the country because
of U.N. sanctions that ban air travel.
	   In Oslo, Norway, officials at TV2 said two of its staffers were
involved in the accident. They said cameraman Knut Andre Danielsen
was killed and reporter Anders Saether was injured, but not
seriously.
	   It was unclear for whom the other injured journalist worked.
	   Mohsin Tarfa, acting director of the Iraqi Press Center in
Baghdad, said the injured journalists were taken to a hospital in
Baghdad for treatment.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the driver required
hospitalization, according to the Norwegian diplomat, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Nearly all visitors to Iraq must take the 12-hour journey
through the desert from Amman to Baghdad.

Foreign traders demand peace before investing in southern
</HEADLINE>
Philippines

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Foreign businessmen said Wednesday
they are willing to set up businesses in the southern Philippines
but the government should first restore peace and order in the
volatile region.
	   Despite many violent incidents in the past, many businessmen,
especially from the Middle East, said they remain interested in
investing in southern Mindanao Island, the traditional homeland of
the country's Muslim minority.
	   Delegates attending an international investment summit in the
southern port city of Zamboanga said they and their potential
businesses need to have guarantees of safety and security, said
Ahmed Mohammed Ali, head of the Saudi Arabian-based Islamic
Development Bank.
	   Ali said the two-day summit, which opened Wednesday under tight
security in the city, would give the delegates an idea of where to
invest in Mindanao, ``but they have to be sure about their safety
and security.''
	   ``The delegates want to see peace and order,'' he said.
	   Mindanao has rich natural resources and is the country's
second-largest island but violent attempts by several Muslim rebel
groups to turn it into a separate Islamic state, combined with
neglect by the central government in Manila, have made it one of
the most economically backward regions.
	   Kidnappings of local businessmen are rampant in many areas.
Government troops are still searching for the mother and maid of a
Taiwanese hotel chain owner, along with two Hong Kong men and a
Malaysian national abducted in two southern provinces in September.
	   About 500 delegates from 14 Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern
countries attended the summit organized by the Islamic Development
Bank, headed by Ali.
	   Nur Misuari, a former Muslim separatist guerrilla leader who is
now the governor of an autonomous Muslim area, said such
kidnappings are few and isolated but still occur due to widespread
poverty in Mindanao.
	   Ali said the IDB is planning to provide a dlrs 17 million grant
to the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao, which Misuari
governs, to fund schools, hospitals and roads. About one million
dollars would be set aside to train former guerrillas of the Moro
National Liberation Front how to run small businesses.
	   Misuari used to head the MNLF, which signed a peace agreement
with the central government in September 1996, ending a quarter
century insurrection that killed more than 120,000 people. After
that, the government opened talks with another rebel group, the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front. Those negotiations are continuing.

Parliament committee agrees to cut subsidies to racist parties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A parliamentary committee unanimously
agreed Wednesday on a bill to cut subsidies to racist parties,
following weeks of haggling over public funding for the extreme
right Vlaams Blok party.
	   The Vlaams Blok and Dutch-speaking conservatives stayed away
from the vote in protest, allowing the bill to proceed without
opposition.
	   The bill is expected to be passed by the full House of
Representatives on Dec. 10 with the backing of eight of the ten
parties.
	   The bill has become a hot issue with elections approaching next
June. Polls indicate the Vlaams Blok could further erode the
electoral base of the traditional parties.
	   The Vlaams Blok has made major advances in Dutch-speaking
regions, winning 12.2 percent of the Flemish vote in 1995 with an
anti-immigrant, Flemish nationalist program.
	   Under the proposal passed Wednesday, Belgium's highest
administrative court, the Council of State, would have authority to
judge if parties are racist. A party could appeal the decision.
	   The Vlaams Blok opposed the proposal, saying it would not get a
fair hearing if the bill is passed. The Dutch-speaking
Conservatives objected on legal grounds.
	   Under Belgian law, political parties are restricted from seeking
private funding and instead receive cash handouts from the state
based on their election results.
	   This year, the Vlaams Blok receives 52 million francs (dlrs 1.53
million). In comparison, Prime Minister's Jean-Luc Dehaene's
Dutch-speaking Christian Democrat party is the top recipient with
108 million francs (dlrs 3.18 million).

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Clinton administration plans to release
secret documents that could help Spain prosecute former Chilean
President Augusto Pinochet, adding to declassified archives that
link the anti-communist with chilling human rights abuses. Some
document Pinochet's security apparatus actions against foreigners
or conducted in foreign countries. Newly declassified material may
prove embarrassing to the United States by showing in yet greater
detail how Washington put its Cold War agenda of fighting leftists
in Latin America ahead of human rights concerns. On Tuesday night,
Gen. Augusto Pinochet moved under guard into an exclusive community
of business leaders and stockbrokers, raising concerns among his
wealthy neighbors that demonstrators and police patrols will soon
be invading the neighborhood. (US-PINOCHET, BRITAIN-PINOCHET)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A strong earthquake toppled more than 8,000
buildings in the impoverished hills of China's rural southwest,
leaving 20,000 people homeless, a local official said Wednesday.
Few injuries and no deaths have been reported from the
magnitude-5.1 quake that struck Yunnan province's Xuanwei county
Tuesday afternoon _ when farmers were in the fields and students on
recess, said Wei Hui of the local Civil Affairs Bureau. The quake
was the third to strike Yunnan in two weeks. Authorities are
struggling to treat the 4,000 injured and house and care for the
25,000 people left homeless by a pair of powerful quakes on Nov. 20
in the Ninglang region, 300 kilometers (180 miles) west of Xuanwei.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops on Wednesday opened
fire on Palestinian protesters demanding freedom for jailed
activists after the demonstrators beat an Israeli soldier and
burned his car. Two Palestinians were placed in an ambulance, but
the extent of their injuries was not known. The clash began when
150 Palestinians attacked an Israeli soldier driving near the
Jewish settlement of Beit El. Jumping on the hood of the car, the
protesters smashed his windshield, dragged the soldier from the car
and seized his M-16 automatic rifle. They poured kerosene on the
car and set it ablaze. The clash, which lasted about half an hour,
followed the stabbing death of a Palestinian street-cleaner in
Jerusalem which police said may have been carried out by an Israeli
extremist. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The president named U.S.-educated
economist Salim Hoss as the next prime minister of Lebanon on
Wednesday. Hoss accepted the appointment, telling reporters after
meeting President Emile Lahoud: ``We are facing big challenges
which we should confront.'' He said his government would work to
reduce the budget deficit and continue efforts to end Israel's
occupation of part of southern Lebanon. His first task would be to
appoint a Cabinet, he added. Lahoud issued a decree appointing Hoss
after a majority of lawmakers in Parliament expressed support for
him. Hoss, a legislator from Beirut who turns 69 on Dec. 20, has
served as prime minister on four previous occasions. He survived a
1987 car bombing that killed a bodyguard in his motorcade. Hoss
became a contender for the post after the current prime minister,
Rafik Hariri, bowed out in a power struggle with Lahoud.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About Indonesian 1,500 students
slipped through heavy security and converged outside the
white-columned presidential palace Wednesday in the boldest
antigovernment protest since the Southeast Asian country's military
shot nine demonstrators to death last month. Waving flags and
banners, they demanded former authoritarian President Suharto be
prosecuted for corruption and that a full inquiry be held into the
killing of their friends. The standoff ended peacefully when a
delegation of 18 student leaders was escorted into the palace and
met a senior government official. President B.J. Habibie refused to
see them. Earlier Wednesday, he criticized the rising tide of daily
protests against him. ``Indonesians have to implement reforms
through constitutional means because it is impossible to implement
reforms on the street,'' he said. (INDONESIA-PROTESTS)

move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets, including the major
bourses in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore, ended higher Wednesday _
but analysts did not know if the recovery could be sustained.
Japan's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 151.21
points, or 1.02 percent, ending the day at 14,986.62. In Hong Kong,
share prices rose modestly, snapping a three-day losing streak that
had taken 7.5 percent off the key stock index. The Hang Seng Index
ended up 0.8 percent at 10,055.78, after plunging 4.1 percent on
Tuesday. The Malaysian stock market's recent rally continued as
large and small investors continued to scoop up stocks. Meanwhile,
the U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen, buying 121.88 yen in
late afternoon trading, down 0.90 yen from late Tuesday. (ASIAN

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Exxon's purchase of Mobil was the richest deal
ever and will form the world's biggest company, but 9,000 jobs will
be lost worldwide. Exxon agreed Tuesday to acquire Mobil for dlrs
73.7 billion in stock, combining the biggest U.S. oil companies and
reuniting two of the biggest pieces left by the 1911 government
breakup of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil empire. The formation
of the new Exxon Mobil Corp. is the latest example of rapid
consolidation in the oil industry, where profits have been battered
by a deep price slump caused by worldwide overproduction and weak
demand. To boost profits,Exxon and Mobil expect that together they
will be able to save dlrs 2.8 billion annually, mostly by
eliminating overlapping businesses and workers. (US-EXXON-MOBIL)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus
met top Russian leaders Wednesday, but wasn't expected to release
frozen loans that Moscow badly wants to pay off mounting debts. The
stakes are high: Russia owes billions of dollars to workers,
pensioners and foreign creditors and wants the IMF to provide new
installments on a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package. The loans were
negotiated this summer, but have been on hold since the latest
economic crisis hit in August. The IMF has been demanding a
realistic recovery plan from the Russian government and has so far
been unimpressed with Moscow's efforts. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton, having fulfilled his
promise to ease sanctions on Pakistan, is pressing Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif to strengthen his nation's commitment to nuclear
nonproliferation. In advance of Wednesday afternoon's White House
meeting with Sharif, Clinton signed papers waiving until Oct. 21,
1999, the sanctions imposed after India and Pakistan tested nuclear
bombs last May. The long-anticipated waiver opened the way for U.S.
loans and investments in the two nations, some military-to-military
training and education, and crucial U.S. backing for the IMF's dlrs
5.5-billion economic bailout for Pakistan. (US-PAKISTAN)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Cathay Pacific Airways said Wednesday it had
pulled out of talks to buy a stake in ailing Philippine Airlines _
making the uncertain future at PAL even cloudier. Philippine
President Joseph Estrada said he would try to coax the two sides
back together, but it was unclear whether Cathay was out of the
picture for good. Cathay said it had withdrawn its bid to pour up
to U.S. dlrs 100 million into debt-ridden PAL because of ``certain
issues which could not be resolved,'' according to a statement from
company secretary P.A. Moore. Philippine officials said Cathay and
PAL had run into difficulties in two areas: who would manage PAL
and how many workers would lose their jobs. (PHILIPPINES-PAL)

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's central government ordered the arrest of
a prominent democracy campaigner and may use his contacts with
exiled Chinese dissidents to charge him with harming national
security, a colleague said Wednesday.
	   Two Beijing police officers spent 30 minutes telling Zha Jianguo
to stop trying to set up a political opposition party. Underscoring
the warning, they told him his colleague, Xu Wenli, won't be
released soon and may be charged for having links to ``reactionary
groups,'' Zha said.
	   Xu and another influential dissident, Qin Yongmin, were arrested
Monday night in police raids in two cities that delivered the
sternest blow so far to a five-month campaign to establish the
China Democracy Party and challenge the ruling Communist Party's
monopoly on power.
	   Qin was arrested for plotting to overthrow the government, a
crime that could land him in jail for life. A third Democracy Party
advocate, Wang Youcai, already in custody for a month, was also
formally arrested Monday although his family has not been informed
of the charges.
	   Zha, who helped Xu organize would-be party members in Beijing
and the nearby port of Tianjin, said police officers told him Xu's
arrest was ordered by the central government, not Beijing police.
	   He took the police reference to ``reactionary groups'' to mean
exiled dissidents in the United States. Under China's vague State
Security Law, such links may also be punishable by up to life in
prison.
	   Zha pledged to work with dissidents in China and exiles in the
United States to campaign ``to save Xu Wenli.''
	   On Wednesday, 190 dissidents from around the country demanded in
an open letter that the government release Xu, Qin and Wang Youcai,
saying the arrests run counter to U.N. human rights treaties China
has signed over the past 14 months.
	   The authorities ``are deceiving and cheating international
public opinion while on the other hand they are suppressing and
persecuting domestic political dissidents,'' said the letter faxed
to foreign news agencies.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin called
Xu's detention ``a serious step in the wrong direction'' and called
for his release. He said Xu had been detained ``for peacefully
exercising fundamental freedoms guaranteed by international human
rights instruments.''
	   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing asked the Chinese Foreign Ministry
for information on Xu but had not received a reply by late
Wednesday.
	   Two other democracy party supporters taken into custody in
central Wuhan city along with Qin _ Chen Zhonghe and Xiao Shichang
_ were released Wednesday morning, said He Xintong, Xu Wenli's
wife. She added that police questioned the pair about the party as
well as Qin's human rights monitoring organizations.
	   Qin and Xu are towering figures in China's persecuted dissident
community. Their activism dates to the seminal Democracy Wall
movement of the 1970s. Wang was a student leader in 1989's
influential Tiananmen Square democracy movement. All have spent
time in prison, Xu for 12 years, much of it in solitary
confinement.
	   Xu's wife said she does not know where he is being held and, in
her 20-year experience with the authorities, believes they are
unlikely to tell her.
	   Released in 1993, Xu picked up his campaigning for political
change soon after his parole ended last year. He has tried to use
China's nascent legal system and the international treaties it
signed to push for reform.
	   ``My husband is innocent and there's nothing he can be
criticized for,'' said his wife, He Xintong. ``They're going to
have to expend a lot of effort to make him a criminal.''

Paul Grayson to miss South Africa clash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS full team

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England stand-off Paul Grayson has failed to
recover from a knee injury and will miss Saturday's Test against
South Africa at Twickenham.
	   Grayson, who limped off during last weekend's 12-11 defeat to
Australia, will be replaced by Mike Catt.
	   But England coach Clive Woodward said Wednesday that Catt will
not assume Grayson's goal-kicking duties. Catt failed to convert
the only try against Australia, allowing the Wallabies to pull out
a late victory.
	   Instead, Matt Dawson will do the goal-kicking Saturday.
	   Nick Beal comes in at fullback for Matt Perry, who suffered a
concussion against the Wallabies and will be sidelined for three
weeks.
	   Woodward also brought in Dan Luger at the expense of out-of-form
Austin Healey.
	   Will Greenwood, like Grayson, has not recovered from a recent
groin injury and is out. That means Phil de Glanville will continue
in the center.
	   The Springboks will set a world record of 18 consecutive Test
victories if they beat England on Saturday. They would eclipse the
New Zealand All Blacks' 17-match winning streak between 1965 and
1969.
	   The England team:
	   Nick Beal (Northampton), Tony Underwood (Newcastle), Phil de
Glanville (Bath), Jeremy Guscott (Bath), Dan Luger (Harlequins),
Mike Catt (Bath), Matt Dawson (Northampton), Jason Leonard
(Harlequins), Richard Cockerill (Leicester), Darren Garforth
(Leicester), Martin Johnson (Leicester), Tim Rodber (Northampton),
Lawrence Dallaglio (Wasps, captain), Neil Black (Leicester),
Richard Hill (Saracens)
	   Replacements: David Rees (Manchester Sale), Alex King (Wasps),
Austin Healey (Leicester), Martin Corry (Leicester), Danny Grewcock
(Saracens), Graham Rowntree (Leicester), Phil Greening (Manchester
Sale).

EU Commission approves German coal-sector coal plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Commission gave the
go-ahead Wednesday to a German coal sector aid plan that included a
total of 9.4 billion German marks (dlrs 5.5 billion) in assistance
this year.
	   The German coal industry plan, covering the period 1998-2002,
aims to reduce the amount of state aid to the sector. It also
assumes that German coal production will fall to 37 million metric
tons at the end of the period from 47 million tons in 1997.
	   The framework approved by the Commission Wednesday is an update
of a plan originally approved in December 1994.
	   The Commission noted that its approval of the aid contained in
the new plan reflected the need to ``mitigating where possible the
social and regional consequences of the decline of the coal
industry in Germany.''

Two North Koreans defect to South Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two stowaways claiming to be defectors
from North Korea arrived in South Korea and surrendered to
authorities Wednesday, intelligence officials said.
	   The men, identifying themselves as Yoo Tae Joon, 30, and his
half-brother, Lee Keun Hyuk, 17, arrived in the southern port of
Pusan aboard a ship from a ``third country,'' the officials said.
	   South Korea generally uses the term ``third country'' to avoid
naming China, which is required by treaty with North Korea to
return defectors to their homeland.
	   Yoo, a coal storage worker, and Lee, a high-school student, fled
their homeland earlier this year and lived in hiding before
sneaking aboard a ship sailing to South Korea, officials said.
	   Other details were not immediately available.
	   About 200 North Koreans have defected to South Korea in the past
three years, including 64 so far this year. All complained about
severe food and fuel shortages in their country.
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. They fought the Korean War in 1950-53 and
have never signed a formal peace treaty.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Viacheslav Havlytsky still recalls the day
when his nuclear weapons unit relinquished its last bomb in
exchange for a promise of new housing.
	   It was 1993 when Ukraine agreed to turn over its former Soviet
nuclear arsenal, the world's third-largest, to Russia for
dismantling. The United States, eager to promote nuclear
disarmament, agreed to fund construction of about 2,000 apartments
for officers who would be left jobless as a result.
	   But Havlytsky, a retired lieutenant colonel who served at a
nuclear weapons base, believes the apartments have been
misappropriated by senior commanders for their own use.

Slovak government gains majority support in confidence vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The new Slovak government of Prime
Minister Mikulas Dzurinda won parliamentary endorsement Wednesday
for its program to pursue protection of minority and human rights
and integration into the European Union and NATO.
	   The confidence vote followed five days of discussions on the
government's program, which was supported by 88 of the 138 members
present at the session. The opposition, made up by the
nationalistic Slovak National Party and former Prime Minister
Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, criticized
the lack of specific figures and dates in the government's program.
	   The program of Dzurinda's cabinet, which came to power at the
end of October, set its priorities on guarding human and minority
rights as well as moving toward membership of the EU and NATO.
	   The program also calls for reducing unemployment from 14 percent
to 10 percent by 2002.
	   Dzurinda blamed Meciar for the critical state of the country.
	   The justice minister, Jan Carnogursky, was the only minister who
voted against the government's program. Carnogursky said the
program did not include specifics on position of schools managed by
churches, and the agreement between Slovakia and Vatican.

Police recovers Taliban posters from Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A group of Bangladeshi Muslim
hardliners that once fought the Russian army in Afghanistan as
religious mercenaries are trying to regroup and enroll members in
Bangladesh, police said Wednesday.
	   Hundreds of posters calling upon Muslims to join the ``Islami
Taliban Bangladesh'' were found pasted at public places in
Manikganj, 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the capital Dhaka on
Wednesday, a police spokesman said.
	   ``Militant Muslims unite'' and ``Collaborators of India leave
the country'' the slogans said. They were signed by ``Commander,
Bangladesh Andolan'' or Bangladesh movement.
	   Though India helped freedom fighters carve out Bangladesh _ then
known as East Pakistan _ some groups in Bangladesh now oppose what
they see as New Delhi's ``big-brother'' attitude toward Dhaka.
	   A district official at Manikganj said police are looking for
officials and supporters of Islami Taliban group, believed to be
composed of former mercenaries who fought the Russian Army in
Afghanistan in the 1980s.
	   Since their return, most of them joined religious schools and
institutions and mosques. Police said there could be a political
motive behind their attempts to regroup.

Russian parliament to discuss restoring statue of infamous police
</HEADLINE>
chief &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament agreed Wednesday to consider
resurrecting a statue of a dreaded Soviet secret police chief in
the center of Moscow.
	   The Communist-dominated State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, voted 246-50 to hold discussions of a resolution that
would ask the Moscow city government to return the statue of Felix
Dzerzhinsky to the spot it occupied for decades in front of the old
KGB headquarters.
	   The towering bronze statue of ``Iron Felix,'' head of the Cheka,
the first Soviet secret police, was a landmark during the Soviet
era. It was toppled by pro-democracy protesters in 1991 and has
since languished with other Soviet-era statues in a city park.
	   Nikolai Kharitonov, head of the pro-Communist Agrarian faction
in the Duma, has called for restoring the statue, saying it would
boost the confidence of ordinary Russians.
	   ``Even the Federal Security Service feels unprotected without
the monument to Dzerzhinsky, who symbolizes the struggle against
crime,'' Kharitonov said Wednesday, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   The Federal Security Service, known by the Russian acronym of
FSB, is the main successor to the KGB.
	   Kharitonov's proposal has been denounced by human rights
activists, who said Dzerzhinsky was a symbol of murderous
repression during the Soviet era. Dzerzhinsky headed the secret
police after the Bolshevik Revolution and oversaw the ruthless
crackdowns on political opponents.
	   Lubyanka Square, where the statue stood, is used by human rights
groups for vigils to honor the millions of victims of Soviet rule.

Judge orders halt to customs strike; protests continue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A judge Wednesday ordered an end to a
customs officers strike that has left gas stations dry and people
bundling up in unheated homes.
	   But strikers said it was up to their union leaders whether to go
back to work and warned the walkout could continue.
	   The government had appealed for a court order declaring the
strike illegal. All non-European Union shipments of fuel and other
goods have been stranded at ports and border crossings since
Monday, when the five-day strike began.
	   The customs workers are protesting plans to consolidate their
pension funds with other agencies.
	   The strike has severely cut the flow of gasoline and heating oil
into Greece. Many gas stations were tapped out and apartment
managers and homeowners turned off burners to try to conserve
heating fuel.
	   Temperatures dropped to about 6 degrees Celsius (43 F) in some
rural areas in northern Greece on Wednesday.
	   The strikes are part of growing labor union opposition to
government fiscal reforms aimed at qualifying Greece for the
European Union's single currency club by 2001.
	   Civil aviation workers held work stoppages Wednesday that
resulted in flight cancellations. Railway workers also began a
three-day work stoppage.
	   Greece is the only country of the 15-member EU that failed to
qualify for the first round of the single currency. Britain,
Denmark and Sweden opted out of joining.

Electricity deal provokes jokes and highly-charged dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALISON MUTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A dispute between Romania and its
neighbor Moldova is no laughing matter, even though the flap was
touched off by a comedy show.
	   Last week, the impoverished former Soviet Republic of Moldova
negotiated a favorable energy deal with slightly richer Romania.
Moldova declared an emergency after Ukraine recently cut energy
exports because the Moldavans had not paid their bills.
	   Officially, Romania and Moldova, where 65 percent of the
population is ethnically Romanian, are two brothers separated along
Romania's northeast border by the River Prut. The 1940 pact between
Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin awarded Moldova to the Soviet Union.
	   But relations are complicated, especially since Moldova declared
independence in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   In their hearts, Romanians consider Moldova an alienated
province, wrenched away by Stalin. But they also see their
neighbors as country bumpkins and treat them as figures of fun.
	   Romanians also consider Moldovans too ``Russified'' after a half
century of Russian domination.
	   So it was no surprise when Bucharest private television station
PRO-TV's irreverent nightly satire show ``Matter of the Day'' used
the energy deal for a little mirth, portraying the Moldovan deputy
Premier Valeriu Dolganiuc and his entourage in thick Russian-style
overcoats while Romanians were nattily attired in jackets and silk
ties.
	   Although their languages are virtually identical, the Moldovans
old-style accent was mocked. They made jokes such as: ``Alexander
Graham Bell invented the telephone and Porumb Bell (the Romanian
for pigeon) invented the mobile phone.''
	   The actor playing Romanian Premier Radu Vasile joked that
engineers from northern Romanian cities would hang extension leads
out of their windows and Moldovan brothers could swim over the Prut
and make a connection.
	   The Moldovans didn't see the humor.
	   ``We consider ourselves brothers; we are not cavemen,'' said
Dumitru Tara, head of the state news agency Moldpres by telephone.
``It was an official visit, he didn't come to beg; the electricity
will be paid for.''
	   Moldovan state television aired the offending program on the
nightly news, with the subliminal message what the Romanians
enjoyed best was mocking Moldovans.
	   Russian politicians irate that their Slavic brethren Ukraine and
Russia couldn't come up with the watts when they were needed got
political miles out of the show and pro-Romanian newspaper ``Flux''
griped ``the real authors of Romanian phobia are not in Chisinau
(the Moldovan capital) but in Bucharest under the roof of PRO-TV.''
	   The head of the television station apologized to Moldova's
deputy premier who told him it would be better for the actors in
the show to apologize to the Moldovan public.

Ukrainian agents apprehend gang suspected of smuggling stolen cars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Police and customs agents in Ukraine's
Crimean Peninsula apprehended a gang suspected of smuggling cars
stolen from the Baltic nation of Lithuania, officials said
Wednesday.
	   The group included a Russian accused of organizing the
operation, two Ukrainian residents who allegedly transported the
cars into Ukraine and two Lithuanian suspects, said Serhiy
Alekseev, spokesman for Crimea's customs department.
	   The suspects allegedly brought the vehicles into Ukraine as
tax-free, temporary imports and then sold them at low prices,
Alekseev told the Interfax news agency.
	   After discovering the group's existence during a check of
imported cars, police and customs agents seized as many as 25
vehicles. Ukraine's Security Service launched several criminal
cases and authorities plan to sell several of the cars that were
seized, Alekseev said.

Air France reports drop in profits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France reported a drop in net profit of
half-a-billion francs (dlrs 88 million) in the six months that
ended Sept. 30, mainly due to costs associated with a June pilots'
strike, the company said Wednesday.
	   Net profit fell to 1.3 billion francs (dlrs 230 million) from
1.8 billion francs (dlrs 319 million), the company said. Air France
estimated the cost of the strike at 1.3 billion francs (dlrs 230
million).
	   Air France hopes that a partial privatization that was delayed
because of the strike will be able to go ahead early next year.
	   ``With results at the end of September holding up well, despite
the impact of the June (labor) conflict ... Air France is in
marching order for its announced share placement,'' the company
said.
	   The French government had announced the 20 percent opening of
Air France's capital in early 1997.
	   Despite the strike, Air France said passenger-kilometers rose by
5.1 percent over the same period last year.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Sixty inmates of a drug
rehabilitation center have been confirmed to be carriers of HIV,
the virus that causes AIDS, a center official said Wednesday.
	   The center's deputy commandant Rohayu Ahmad said the infected
inmates, aged between 20 and 40 years old, were given treatment
with the help of the Health Ministry.
	   Rohayu said they were allowed to mix around with the other 300
detainees at the center but slept in a special block. The center is
located near Kota Bharu, about 474 kilometers (282 miles) north
east of Kuala Lumpur.
	   She said the center screened every inmate admitted there for the
HIV virus.
	   Rohayu said seriously ill inmates who require hospitalization
would be freed earlier than their scheduled release date.

Govt. offers tax break deal for Olympics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney Olympic organizers have
cautiously welcomed a federal government deal to help minimize the
effect of a planned goods and services tax (GST).
	   SOCOG president and Olympics Minister Michael Knight has warned
that a GST, planned for introduction in July, 2000, could create an
Australian dlrs 200 million (U.S. dlrs 126 million) blowout to the
Australian dlrs 2.6 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.64 billion) budget.
	   Prime Minister John Howard wrote to New South Wales premier Bob
Carr Wednesday offering to ``consider sympathetically a mechanism
to offset SOCOG's GST liability on Olympic tickets.''
	   Howard described this as ``a major concession by the
Commonwealth.'' He did not outline the details of the deal, but
previously his government has pushed SOCOG for the prime minister
of the day to open the games and free tickets for ministers.
	   SOCOG was seeking a full exemption from the GST because it
previously had an exemption to sales tax, which the GST will
replace in part.
	   Howard's letter also gave good news on SOCOG's broadcasting and
sponsorship deals which will be classified as exports and therefore
GST free.
	   The sale of tickets was SOCOG's biggest concern and it feared a
GST might apply because the seats were provided in Sept. 2000,
after the introduction of the new tax.
	   ``I appreciate this would place SOCOG in a difficult position
given the agreement it has with the International Olympic Committee
in relation to ticket prices,'' Howard said. SOCOG has budgeted to
receive a games record Australian dlrs 600 million (U.S. dlrs 372
million) from ticket sales.
	   Howard said the deal was conditional on a Memorandum of
Understanding between the government and SOCOG being settled soon,
preferably before Christmas.
	   The MOU deals with arrangements under which the Commonwealth
will provide SOCOG with Australian dlrs 32 million (U.S. dlrs 20
million) to assist staging the games, in areas like customs and
quarantine services.
	   Knight said he shared Howard's desire to have the deal sealed by
Christmas.
	   He said Howard's deal was ``not our preferred mechanism ... and
does not solve all our problems.'' ``But the measures go a long way
to meeting our needs,'' said Knight.
	   Knight said SOCOG was seeking advice from tax experts on the
full tax implications. Howard's government was returned in October
on a platform of the new 10 percent GST. It outlined its detailed
plans to parliament on Wednesday.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Security was tight in Istanbul on
Wednesday ahead of the politically charged Champions League match
between Juventus of Turin and Galatasaray.
	   Around 22,000 police officers were being deployed for the game
amid fears that angry Turkish fans might resort to violence against
the Italians. Military units were on standby.
	   Turks are outraged at Italy for refusing to extradite a Kurdish
rebel leader. Authorities also said they worried about a
provocation by the rebels aimed at staining Turkey's image.
	   Hundreds of police were on hand when the Italian team arrived at
the Istanbul airport Wednesday. A small group of airport employees
tossed flowers at the Juventus bus in greeting. But, as loyal
home-team fans, they also chanted ``Turkey, Turkey!''
	   The road from the airport to the team's hotel was closed to
traffic, but people standing along the route waved to the bus.
	   At the hotel where the players were resting until the 9:45 p.m.
(1945 GMT) match, security officials were monitoring cameras placed
at the entrances; police motorcades were on standby to escort the
team to the stadium.
	   At Ali Sami Yen stadium, security officials planned body
searches of all spectators for weapons or items like loose change
which could be hurled at the field. Authorities banned fireworks
and banners.
	   On Tuesday, police stopped a group of fans sneaking into the
stadium with a banner reading: ``Italy! Extradite that bloody
terrorist to Turkey,'' daily Milliyet reported. Another newspaper
said two helicopters would be nearby to evacuate the Italian team
in case of violence.
	   Ocalan leads a guerrilla force which has been fighting for
Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey for since 1984. The
conflict has killed about 37,000 people.
	   UEFA, European soccer's governing body, had postponed the match
by a week because of anti-Italian sentiment in Turkey.
	   Juventus went to Istanbul on the day of the game instead of the
day before as UEFA rules require, and the federation has said it
might take disciplinary action. The team returns home right after
the game.
	   Juventus, which has reached the European Champions Cup final
three straight times and won once, needed a victory against the
Turkish team to keep its qualifying chances alive.
	   Galatasaray has seven points in Group B, one behind Norway's
Rosenborg. Juventus has four, but both teams have played one fewer
game than the Norwegians.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A major fire broke out Wednesday morning
at the Coca-Cola bottling plant, and hours later firemen were still
struggling to contain the blaze.
	   According to the Interior Ministry, the fire broke at about 2
a.m. (midnight GMT) inside the warehouse, apparently due to
electrical problems.
	   Despite the efforts of fire brigades brought from four
neighbouring towns, the fire was still raging nearly 12 hours later
and threatened to destroy the dlrs 10 million facility.
	   No one was injured and workers outside the plant said the fire
had started after plastic boxes placed near a huge lamp melted and
then ignited the blaze.
	   The four-year-old plant is a joint venture between Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola and Italy's Gruppo Busi, which also operates bottling
plants in Italy.
	   The Albanian plant produces about 100 million bottles annually,
or about 33 bottles a year for every Albanian.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The Lebanese president on Wednesday named
the U.S.-educated economist Salim Hoss as the next prime minister,
who promised efforts to reduce the budget deficit and to end
Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon.
	   Hoss accepted the appointment, telling reporters after meeting
President Emile Lahoud: ``We are facing big challenges which we
should confront.''
	   Lahoud appointed Hoss after he secured a majority of
recommendations from the Parliament. Speaker Nabih Berri said
Wednesday that Hoss had the support of 95 of the 128 lawmakers in
the half-Christian, half-Muslim legislature.
	   This is the fifth premiership for Hoss. The Beirut legislator,
who turns 69 in December, survived a 1987 car bombing that killed a
bodyguard.
	   A graduate in business and economics from Indiana University at
Bloomington, Hoss will have his work cut out on the financial
front.
	   He will have to calm markets left jittery by Hariri's sudden
departure. The central bank has said it will intervene to support
the Lebanese pound, which has been stable in the past few days.
	   A harder task will be to cut the budget deficit, now estimated
to be running at 17 percent of the Gross Domestic Product _ the
value of all goods and services produced within the country.
	   Like almost all politicians in Lebanon, Hoss is an ally of
Syria, which maintains 30,000 troops in Lebanon and is the main
power-broker in the country.
	   Lebanon has refused offers to negotiate a separate peace with
Israel, saying the Israelis must also make peace with Syria. Israel
has occupied a zone in south Lebanon, amounting to 10 percent of
the country, since 1985 as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on
its northern territory.
	   Hoss first served as prime minister in 1976, in the early days
of the civil war, and after the assassination of Prime Minister
Rashid Karami in 1987. He was named to the post again in 1989 under
President Rene Mouawad and the following year under President Elias
Hrawi.
	   Hoss again became a contender for the post after the current
prime minister, Rafik Hariri, bowed out Monday in a power struggle
with Lahoud. Hariri has been serving in a caretaker capacity since
Lahoud's inauguration last week.
	   Hariri, a billionaire businessman, became prime minister in 1992
and launched the multibillion dollar program to rebuild Lebanon
from the devastation of its 1975-90 civil war. But his policy of
borrowing generously sank the country deep in debt and ordinary
Lebanese complained that the benefits of reconstruction had not
reached them.
	   When Lahoud sounded out legislators about re-appointing Hariri,
the prime minister received majority support, but not by the
overwhelming margin he had enjoyed in the past.
	   Hoss is a Sunni Muslim, like every prime minister under
Lebanon's power-sharing arrangement. The president is a Maronite
Catholic, and the speaker is a Shiite Muslim.
	   A soft-spoken, down-to-earth man, Hoss' style of government is
expected to be quite different from that of the flamboyant Hariri.
	   He is expected to have a good working relationship with Lahoud,
since both want to rid the administration of corruption. In his
previous terms as prime minister, Hoss has earned a reputation as
an honest politician.

Report: Intellectuals back Spielberg archive as Holocaust memorial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Intellectuals are backing the latest idea for
Germany's much-debated national Holocaust memorial, which entails
joining an existing exhibit of Third Reich terror with Steven
Spielberg's filmed interviews of Holocaust survivors.
	   The plan, pushed by Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen, is more
appropriate than proposals for building a giant memorial in the
heart of Berlin, historians and other leading intellectuals were
quoted as saying in the current issue of the weekly newspaper Die
Woche.
	   ``You don't have to be monumental to touch people's souls,''
said Gyoergy Konrad, president of Berlin's Academy of Art.
	   Spielberg already has offered to move his Shoah Visual History
Foundation to Berlin. The U.S. film director has suggested
``meditation rooms'' where visitors could watch interviews with
Holocaust survivors, according to a recent article in the news
magazine Stern. The foundation has compiled nearly 50,000
interviews.
	   Diepgen wants to combine Spielberg's archive with the Topography
of Terror, an exhibit of Third Reich documents and photographs
situated in the cellar of the former Gestapo and the SS
headquarters, where Nazis tortured political prisoners.
	   Critics of the large memorial plan have long argued that the
Topography of Terror is the most appropriate Holocaust memorial
Germany could have, largely because of its location at a site where
Nazis planned and executed their crimes.
	   ``Any memorial for the murdered Jews and other Nazi victims
should be closely linked to the Topography of Terror,'' historian
Heinrich August Winkler was quoted as saying. ``An active memorial
at a site of Nazi atrocities can preserve the memory of the crime
against humanity.''
	   Plans for a national Holocaust memorial have been a subject of
heated debate for nearly 10 years.
	   Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl supported proposals to build a
huge monument, about the size of two football fields, on a central
Berlin lot near the Brandenburg Gate. Leading intellectuals and
opposition politicians argued the monument would not be educational
enough, and that a single sculpture could not represent an atrocity
as sweeping as the Holocaust.
	   The new government, led by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, has
advocated scrapping the monument and instead preserving the remains
of the former Nazi concentration camps.
	   Parliament is to debate plans for the Holocaust Memorial early
next year. It was not immediately known if Schroeder's government
has responded to calls to combine Spielberg's archive with the
Topography of Terror.
	   Spielberg directed ``Schindler's List,'' the story of a
non-Jewish industrialist who saved thousands of Jews during World
War II. He was awarded one of Germany's highest state honors in
September.

Indonesian students demonstrate outside presidential palace

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 1,500 students slipped through
heavy security and converged outside the white-columned
presidential palace Wednesday in the boldest anti-government
protest since the military shot nine demonstrators to death last
month.
	   Waving flags and banners, they demanded former authoritarian
President Suharto be prosecuted for corruption and that a full
inquiry be held into the killing of their friends.
	   The standoff ended peacefully when a delegation of 18 student
leaders was escorted into the palace and met senior government
officials, including a top military adviser.
	   President B.J. Habibie refused to see them. Earlier he
criticized a rising tide of daily protests against him.
	   ``Indonesians have to implement reforms through constitutional
means because it is impossible to implement reforms on the
street,'' he said.
	   In another part of the capital, riot squads blocked about 500
other students from marching on the national Parliament.
	   Others demonstrated outside several government buildings as well
as near the home of Suharto, who resigned in May after deadly riots
and protests against his 32-year autocratic rule.
	   The rally at the palace appeared to take security forces by
surprise even though thousands of troops have been camped in an
adjacent park for weeks.
	   Students in a convoy of dozens of cars and 18 buses slipped into
the area via a side street and sat down in the road, only meters
from the palace's manicured lawns and ornamental fountain.
	   They chanted anti-military slogans as riot officers with sticks
and shields looked on.
	   Five small tanks wheeled into position in front of the Dutch
colonial mansion as squads of heavily armed presidential guards
assembled inside an ornate wrought iron fence.
	   Troop reinforcements were hurriedly trucked in as red-coated
ceremonial guards watched.
	   After about an hour of negotiations, the group of student
leaders was ushered into the palace and held talks with Habibie's
military secretary, two-star Vice Air Marshal Budi Santoso, and
presidential aide Erman Rajagujuk.
	   The students demanded that military chief Gen. Wiranto be held
accountable for the Nov. 13 deaths of the nine students.
	   They also called for an inquiry into the slaying of four other
students shot to death by police in a protest just days before
Suharto quit.
	   They said Suharto should be investigated for corruption and sent
to trial before a general election is held next June.
	   Erman later told reporters Habibie would make an announcement on
Suharto's case within the next few days.
	   ``Hang Suharto,'' shouted the protesters, who want the
77-year-old former army general to be charged with graft and human
rights abuses.
	   ``We will keep protesting until we have justice,'' said Yoke, a
demonstrator.
	   Earlier in the day, security forces blocked 300 students who
drove in buses toward Suharto's house, a frequent target of
protests. Some protesters roughed up a suspected plainclothes
policeman.
	   Habibie has ordered a new probe into the wealth of Suharto, his
onetime mentor. But a panel of investigators has yet to be formed,
and opponents question whether the process will be impartial.
	   An earlier investigation by the attorney general's office turned
up no evidence of wrongdoing, which student protesters labeled a
whitewash. Critics say Suharto's family built billion-dollar
business empires partly with state resources.
	   Also Wednesday, several hundred students demonstrated outside
the office of Attorney General Andi Mohamad Ghalib to press for a
trial of Suharto.
	   Another group gathered outside the office of the national
election council to demand that general elections, scheduled by
Habibie next year, be held on time.
	   Habibie has allowed new political parties to form and taken
other steps to dismantle Suharto's rigid political system, but
students say he is moving too slowly on democratic reforms.
	   Indonesia, which is suffering its worst economic crisis in
decades, has endured several outbreaks of religious violence
recently.
	   Muslim mobs burned and ransacked Christian churches in Jakarta
last month and Christian rioters in Kupang, a provincial capital,
targeted mosques this week.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
making it the world's most populous Islamic state.

German court upholds another sentence for neo-Nazi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ A court has ruled that a neo-Nazi in
jail for defamation of Jews should serve another three months for
asking a Holocaust survivor why the Nazis permitted him to live.
	   A district court in Karlsruhe on Tuesday rejected an appeal from
Guenter Deckert, 58, the former leader of the extreme-right
National Party of Germany but did not grant the eight-month term
state prosecutors had demanded.
	   Deckert received the additonal three months because he wrote to
a Jewish concentration camp survivor asking him out of ``historical
interest'' why Nazi leaders, ``who wanted to remove/destroy all
Jews ... permitted you to survive.''
	   In November, he was sentenced to four years and nine months for
defaming Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in
Germany, by calling him a ``Jewish Fuehrer.'' He also threatened to
kill a police officer sent to arrest him in 1995.

Russia receives praise, but no money, from IMF chief

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian leaders lobbied International Monetary
Fund chief Michel Camdessus on Wednesday, but he gave no sign
Wednesday that the fund was prepared to release the frozen loans
that Moscow so badly wants.
	   Camdessus met for a second day with Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and praised Russia's ``pragmatic'' course in dealing with
the country's economic crisis. But he said an IMF team would have
to return to Russia next month for further negotiations on the loan
installments.
	   ``We are hoping 1999 will be excellent for cooperation between
Russia and the IMF,'' Camdessus said.
	   The stakes are high: Russia owes billions of dollars to workers,
pensioners and foreign creditors and wants the IMF to provide new
installments on a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package. The loans were
negotiated this summer, but have been on hold since the latest
economic crisis hit in August.
	   The IMF has been demanding a realistic recovery plan from the
Russian government and has so far been unimpressed with Moscow's
efforts. Primakov sought to lower expectations even before talks
began Wednesday.
	   ``Don't measure the significance of Camdessus' visit by how much
money he brought,'' Primakov said. ``He has come with an attache
case containing documents, not cash. You shouldn't think that the
question of giving money to Russia will be solved now.''
	   The IMF froze the loan installments after Russia's government
devalued the ruble and defaulted on some debts in August. Moscow is
still seeking all, or at least part, of a dlrs 4.3 billion
installment that was originally planned for September.
	   Primakov's government has moved cautiously, refraining from any
radical measures and hoping that the IMF and other lenders will
offer help.
	   The government delayed a debate this week on next year's budget
as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet
expenses.
	   If the Russian government doesn't get foreign help soon, it's
expected to start printing money, which would drive up inflation
and further imperil Russia's fragile economy, Primakov and other
officials have warned.
	   An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's
revenue forecast for next year was overly optimistic. It also
disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes, offer
subsidies to ailing industries and increase state regulation of the
economy.
	   However, First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov insisted
that Russia will go its own way and assailed the IMF for what he
called its unfair assessment of the government's intentions.
	   ``They assess every step toward reason as a step toward
administrative controls over the economy,'' Maslyukov was quoted as
saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Russia has so far received only about dlrs 5 billion of the dlrs
22.6 billion bailout package, which also involves the World Bank
and the Japanese government.
	   Meanwhile, Central Bank chairman Viktor Geraschenko outlined the
country's economic woes in an address Wednesday to parliament's
upper house, the Federation Council.
	   Russia's economy has shrunk about 5 to 6 percent compared to a
year ago and inflation is up an estimated 70 percent compared to
last December, he said. The government will try to limit inflation
to 30 percent next year, he added.

Iraq appeals to France, Egypt on sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A leading newspaper appealed to France and
Egypt on Wednesday to back Iraq's efforts to get punishing U.N.
trade sanctions lifted.
	   Al-Thawra, which is published by President Saddam Hussein's
ruling Baath party, noted that both countries were critical of Iraq
during its recent standoff with the United Nations over weapons
inspections.
	   Iraq in August and October limited the work of U.N. inspectors,
who must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction before the sanctions can be lifted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil, ban air travel and bar most other financial
transactions.
	   Under threat of U.S. and British military action, Iraq agreed
Nov. 14 to resume cooperation with the inspectors.
	   It also has stepped up its efforts to get the U.N. Security
Council to conduct a promised ``comprehensive review'' of Iraqi
disarmament compliance that the Baghdad regime hopes will lead to
easing or lifting the sanctions.
	   In its editorial, Al-Thawra said that ``both Egypt and France
know the United States is trying to stop the comprehensive review
from taking place by pushing Richard Butler to create a new
crisis.''
	   It was a reference to efforts by Butler, the chief U.N.
inspector, to get documents on weaponry from Iraq. Iraqi officials
have so far refused to hand them over, saying they don't exist,
have been destroyed or are irrelevant.
	   ``What is not understood is that the two countries say that
Iraq's stands are not understood,'' the editorial continued. ``They
both know what Iraq has done with the disarmament issue, and they
both know that the United States wants to prolong sanctions on Iraq
for political reasons.''
	   It concluded: ``Is it to Egypt's _ or the Arab countries' _
advantage that Iraq be attacked or the sanctions be prolonged? Do
they (France and Egypt) think that Iraq will have to wear whatever
is sewn by the Americans at the Security Council?''
	   Meanwhile, Iraq's National Monitoring Directorate said that U.N.
teams carried out 18 inspections on Tuesday, the largest number
since they resumed work Nov. 18 after the last crisis.
	   It said that the sites visited included four colleges. It also
said that nuclear inspection teams took soil samples from six sites
in northern Baghdad, but did not identify them further.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the inspectors, would not
confirm or deny the figures.
	   ``We have many inspectors working, and we hope to finish the
scheduled inspections by mid-December,'' she said.
	   The Iraqi monitoring directorate _ which provides government
escorts for the U.N. teams _ also said that a U.N. biological
weapons inspection team, headed by David Kelly of Britain, arrived
Tuesday, along with a U.N. missile monitoring team.

Israeli, Palestinians clash near West Bank settlement

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details of attack on soldier, EDITS to
TRIM &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Dozens of Palestinians on Wednesday
ambushed an Israeli car, smashed its windshields with stones, then
pulled an Israeli soldier out of the vehicle and kicked and beat
him with stones and fists.
	   Attackers shouted ``Yahudi, Yahudi,'' Arabic for ``Jew, Jew.''
	   The soldier cowered by the car door, holding his hands up to
fend off blows as several Palestinians struck his head with rocks.
After about a minute of relentless attack, the soldier got up and
ran, bleeding from the head.
	   As he escaped, his assailants stole his M-16 assault rifle,
threw more stones at him, then doused the car with kerosene and set
it on fire.
	   Israeli police stationed at a joint position with Palestinian
counterparts fired pistols into the crowd while Israeli soldiers
opened up with a barrage of rubber-coated metal bullets and tear
gas. Eleven Palestinians were injured by rubber bullets.
	   The incident began when about 150 students from Bir Zeit
University staged a march in downtown Ramallah to protest against
Israel's refusal to release a large number of Palestinian prisoners
jailed for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The demonstrators, most of them followers of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction, then walked to the outskirts of
Ramallah, and began stoning Israeli cars at a traffic circle about
half a mile from the Jewish settlement of Beit El.
	   At one point, a white car with Israeli license plates
approached. The vehicle was driven by a man wearing a skullcap, and
a soldier was in the passenger seat.
	   To shouts of ``Yahudi, yahudi,'' about two dozen Palestinians
began pelting the car with stones and smashing its windows. The
driver stopped the car and ran away after a large rock struck him
in the face. The attackers then converged on the soldier, attacked
him and seized his M-16 assault rifle.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan,
held the Palestinian Authority responsible for the incident, saying
it had incited to violence over the prisoners' issue.
	   Bar-Illan also said the attack was ``a gross and dangerous''
violation of the Wye River land-for-security agreement negotiated
in October with the help of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   Hassan Asfour, a Palestinian peace negotiator, said he would not
comment on the attack until he had been properly briefed.
	   Earlier Wednesday, a 41-year-old Palestinian street cleaner,
Osama Musa Natche, was stabbed to death in a Jerusalem neighborhood
where both Arabs and Jews live. Police said they suspected the
attack was carried out by an Israeli extremist.
	   There are concerns that the escalating tension could result in a
new round of violence in advance of Clinton's planned trip to
Israel and the Palestinian lands in mid-December.
	   Netanyahu complained in a letter to Clinton this week that the
Palestinians have repeatedly violated the peace agreement. He asked
Clinton to use his influence to halt the violations.
	   Bar-Illan said the sending of the letter indicates that ``there
is a danger to the peace process if the violations continue.'' But
he said that, as of now, the Clinton visit was ``a go.''
	   In the letter, Bar-Illan said, Netanyahu objected to recent
statements, including one by Arafat, that a Palestinian state would
be declared on May 4, 1999.
	   The daily Maariv newspaper said Netanyahu asked Clinton to
publicly distance himself from Arafat's statements and persuade the
Palestinian leader to withdraw his remarks.
	   The Wye accord urges both Israel and the Palestinians to refrain
from unilateral steps that would prejudge the outcome of talks on a
permanent peace accord.
	   The Palestinians have also lodged a series of complaints about
Israeli violations. Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, said Wednesday
that Israel's plans to construct more than a dozen access roads for
Jewish settlements in the West Bank was not approved at the Wye
River summit.
	   Israel's Cabinet authorized the road projects to improve
security for Jewish communities that will become isolated as a
result of Israel's promised withdrawal from 13 percent of the West
Bank. Thousands of acres of Palestinian land are being expropriated
for the roads.
	   ``I want to make it very clear that there is no such agreement
because no rational Palestinian would agree to the confiscation of
land for roads,'' Abbas said on the Voice of Palestine radio.

Reputed Bosnian Croat crime boss sentenced for murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A reputed Bosnian Croat crime boss was
sentenced to eight years in prison for the 1996 murder of an
elderly women in the Bosnian city of Mostar, the newspaper Vecernji
List reported Wednesday.
	   Vinko Martinovic, who uses the alias Stela, was arrested during
a trip to Croatia in early 1997 after international peace keepers
in Bosnia accused him of operating a brutal crime ring out of
southwestern Bosnia.
	   The Zagreb court also sentenced Dragan Raspundic Guja to seven
years in prison for assisting Martinovic in the murder of Jasmina
Djukic in March of 1996 in Mostar.
	   The court concluded Martinovic and his colleague did not murder
the elderly Djukic for personal gain although he had been charged
with murdering the women in order to steal her apartment.
	   Under Croatian law, murder with no personal gain is not
considered premeditated and carries a maximum 20-year sentence.
	   The star witness, Martinovic's former bodyguard, first told
police that Martinovic and Guja killed the woman to sell her
apartment, according to investigators. Police said the bodyguard
told them Martinovic became rich by illegally acquiring apartments
in the Bosnian-Croat half of the city of Mostar.
	   In court, the bodyguard denied making the statements and other
witnesses refused to testify.
	   Martinovic's lawyers said they'll appeal the sentence.
	   Zagreb lawyers are also prosecuting Mladen Naletilic, alias
Tuta, who also was arrested in 1997, and accused of running the
crime ring.
	   Naletilic is charged with abduction, assault and battery,
inciting murder and aiding and abetting crime.

France's Groupe Danone to build yogurt plant in Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The French yogurt-maker Groupe Danone has begun
building a dlrs 100 million diary-products plant near Moscow, a
news report said Wednesday.
	   The plant near Chekhov, a town 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of
Moscow, will employ 650 people and produce 150,000 tons of yogurt
and other diary products each year after it is completed in 2000,
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Danone Industry, a subsidiary of the French food giant, plans to
invest dlrs 2 million in the project before the end of this year,
Interfax reported, citing the Chekhov region's top economic
official, Vladimir Galdin.
	   The plant is also expected to produce candy and mineral water,
and the number of employees may gradually rise to 1,300, Galdin
said.
	   Groupe Danone already has a yogurt plant in the central Russian
city of Togliatti and owns a 59 percent stake in Moscow's
baked-goods factory Bolshevik.

Ukrainian miners go on strike _ again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Hundreds of coal miners demonstrated
Wednesday near Ukraine's parliament building to demand more state
support for their ailing industry and the payment of back wages.
	   At least 22 mines across Ukraine, about 10 percent of the
country's total, also went on an indefinite strike, said Mykhailo
Volynets, chairman of the Independent Miners' Union.
	   The protest actions came as parliament, or Verkhovna Rada, began
debating the draft 1999 budget.
	   The miners want budget allocations for their industry to be
increased to ``the minimum required level'' of 5.5 billion hryvna
(dlrs 1.6 billion), Volynets told the independent UNIAN news
agency.
	   They also demanded the payment of wage arrears that have reached
at least 2.4 billion hryvna (dlrs 700 million), according to
government figures.
	   Wednesday's protest was the latest in a series of strikes.
Walkouts idled dozens of mines in Ukraine last spring and summer,
and miners held a ``warning strike'' last month.
	   Ukraine's coal industry long has been plagued by accidents,
inefficiency and a lack of reforms. The government has refrained
from closing many money-losing mines, but also lacks the cash to
keep subsidizing the operations.
	   More than 330 miners have died in mine accidents this year, many
blamed on a lack of funds to modernize equipment and improve safety
conditions. In the latest accident, a worker was crushed to death
by train wagons in the eastern Luhansk region.

Salim Hoss is designated as prime minister, gives his policies

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The prime minister-designate of Lebanon
promised to apply severe austerity measures shortly after he was
chosen to form a government Wednesday.
	   The government would pursue ``austerity in the extreme'' in the
1999 budget, Salim Hoss told reporters after his meeting with the
president.
	   The Cabinet that Hoss is to select will present a budget to the
Parliament in the coming weeks.
	   President Emile Lahoud issued a decree appointing Hoss after the
U.S.-educated economist received a majority of recommendations from
the Parliament. Speaker Nabih Berri said Wednesday that Hoss had
the support of 95 of the 128 lawmakers in the half-Christian,
half-Muslim legislature.
	   Hoss, a legislator from Beirut who turns 69 on Dec. 20, has held
the premiership on four previous occasions. He survived a 1987 car
bombing that killed a bodyguard in his motorcade.
	   ``We are facing big challenges which we should confront,'' Hoss
said.
	   He quickly tried to reassure the markets who have been jittery
since the current prime minister, Rafik Hariri, announced he was
bowing out of the race on Monday.
	   The national currency is ``in very solid state'' and measures
will be taken against speculators, he said.
	   The central bank has already pledged to intervene to support the
Lebanese pound.
	   He said his government would continue the postwar reconstruction
plan, work for the return of the hundreds of thousands of people
displaced by the 1975-90 civil war, and continue efforts to end
Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon.
	   Hariri, who is now serving in a caretaker capacity, became prime
minister in 1992 and launched the multibillion dollar program to
rebuild Lebanon from the devastation of the war. But his policy of
borrowing generously sank the country deep in debt and ordinary
Lebanese complained that the program's benefits had not reached
them.
	   When Lahoud sounded out legislators about re-appointing Hariri,
the prime minister received majority support, but not by the
overwhelming margin he had enjoyed in the past.
	   Hoss is a Sunni Muslim, like every prime minister under
Lebanon's power-sharing arrangement. The president is a Maronite
Catholic, and the speaker is a Shiite Muslim.
	   A soft-spoken, down-to-earth man, Hoss's style of government is
expected to be quite different from that of the flamboyant Hariri,
a billionaire businessman.
	   Hoss is expected to have a good working relationship with
Lahoud, whose goal of ridding the administration of corruption he
is known to share. In his previous terms as prime minister, Hoss
has earned a reputation as an honest politician.
	   A graduate in business and economics from Indiana University at
Bloomington, Hoss said Wednesday he favored cutting interest rates,
which are now running at 14 percent.
	   He has argued that such high rates have discouraged investment.
	   His government would ``set priorities in reconstruction and
development projects that do not exceed the financial capabilities
of the state,'' he said.
	   The government would honor contracts for projects ``although
some of these projects were executed without a plan,'' he said in
clear criticism of the previous administration.
	   Critics of the reconstruction program have charged that some
projects were unnecessary in view of the current state of national
finances.
	   Hoss's first economic challenge will come in drawing up the
budget for the 1999 fiscal year, which begins in January. The
budget deficit is running at a high 17 percent of the Gross
Domestic Product _ the value of all goods and services produced
within the country.
	   Like almost all politicians in Lebanon, Hoss is an ally of
Syria, which maintains some 30,000 troops in Lebanon and is the
main power-broker in the country.
	   He reaffirmed government support for the guerrillas fighting
Israel's occupation of a zone in southern Lebanon, amounting to 10
percent of the country. Israel has controlled the area since 1985
as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on its northern territory.
	   Hoss first served as prime minister in 1976, in the early days
of the civil war, and after the assassination of Prime Minister
Rashid Karami in 1987. He was named to the post again in 1989 under
President Rene Mouawad and the following year under President Elias
Hrawi.

Thai police retract suspicions that Pakistanis are terrorists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DON PATHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ On high alert for possible attacks at
the Asian Games, Thai police described four arrested Pakistanis as
possible terror suspects Wednesday, then withdrew the allegations
when suspected bomb-making equipment turned out to be nothing more
than old junk.
	   The four men, arrested Tuesday on the outskirts of Bangkok, are
not suspected of any criminal activity, although one of them will
be charged with overstaying his visa, a senior police officer said
late Wednesday.
	   ``These guys are not terrorists. They are too poor,'' said Col.
Songvudh Thawankitdamrong, commander of Prawes police station where
the men are being held.
	   Other senior police officers had earlier been cited in news
reports as saying the men were found with materials which could
have been used for making bombs.
	   Security awareness in the capital has been heightened with the
looming opening Sunday of the 13th Asian Games, a regional
Olympic-style event bringing together 6,000 athletes from 41
nations.
	   Nervousness was increased by a publicly unexplained security
exercise which closed the U.S. Embassy for a day late last month.
The United States linked the closure to recent terrorism warnings.
	   Col. Songvudh dismissed earlier press reports quoting other
officers as saying there were grounds to prosecute the four
Pakistanis on terror charges.
	   ``Our bomb experts, along three top generals from the Royal Thai
Police, were called in to question the suspects and examine the
confiscated materials,'' Songvudh said.
	   ``We concluded that there is no reason to believe that the
suspects were planning to carry out terrorist activities,''
Songvudh said. ``At the moment the four are still being questioned
to remove any possible doubt.''
	   He said fuses found in their possession were not the kind used
for carrying out military activities, and that a radio found in
their room was a simple walkie-talkie that can be easily obtained
anywhere.
	   According to a police, other materials confiscated from the men
included a home alarm, electronic disco lights, voltage converters,
a broken car radio and watch, a screwdriver and a left-handed red
boxing glove.
	   ``They rented a small guesthouse in Bangkok and one of them is
living with a Thai woman and washing dishes on Sukhumvit Road for
living,'' Songvudh said.
	   Thailand has deployed some 16,000 officers for security and
traffic control during the games and has threatened quick measures
against anyone trying to disrupt the competition.

Russia receives praise, but no money, from IMF chief

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian leaders lobbied International Monetary
Fund chief Michel Camdessus on Wednesday, but he gave no sign that
the fund was prepared to release the frozen loans that Moscow so
badly wants.
	   Camdessus met for a second day with Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and praised Russia's ``pragmatic'' course in dealing with
the country's economic crisis. But he said an IMF team would have
to return to Russia next month for further negotiations on the loan
installments.
	   ``We are hoping 1999 will be excellent for cooperation between
Russia and the IMF,'' Camdessus said.
	   The stakes are high: Russia owes billions of dollars to workers,
pensioners and foreign creditors and wants the IMF to provide new
installments on a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package, also including
loans from the World Bank and the Japanese government.
	   The IMF and other lenders have released only about dlrs 5
billion, putting the rest on hold after the latest economic crisis
hit in August. The fund has been demanding a realistic recovery
plan from the Russian government and has so far been unimpressed
with Moscow's efforts.
	   Primakov sought to lower expectations even before talks began
Wednesday.
	   ``Don't measure the significance of Camdessus' visit by how much
money he brought,'' Primakov said. ``He has come with an attache
case containing documents, not cash. You shouldn't think that the
question of giving money to Russia will be solved now.''
	   Speaking after the talks, the prime minister said that Russia
expected just advice, not money, from Camdessus.
	   ``We haven't considered specific credits, the size and timing of
their release,'' Primakov told reporters. ``It was important for us
that the fund chief come to Moscow and analyze and assess the
situation.''
	   Primakov's government has moved cautiously, refraining from any
radical measures and hoping that the IMF and other lenders will
offer help.
	   The government delayed a debate this week on next year's budget
as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet
expenses.
	   If the Russian government doesn't get foreign help soon, it's
expected to start printing money, which would drive up inflation
and further imperil Russia's fragile economy, Primakov and other
officials have warned.
	   An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's
revenue forecast for next year was overly optimistic. It also
disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes, offer
subsidies to ailing industries and increase state regulation of the
economy.
	   Primakov played down the differences, saying he and Camdessus
agreed that some state intervention in the economy may be positive,
provided it doesn't prevent the development of a free-market.
	   ``We will find a common approach, probably not immediately, but
we will,'' Primakov said.
	   Meanwhile, Central Bank chairman Viktor Geraschenko outlined the
country's economic woes in an address Wednesday to parliament's
upper house, the Federation Council.
	   Russia's economy has shrunk about 5 to 6 percent compared to a
year ago and inflation is up an estimated 70 percent compared to
last December, he said. The government will try to limit inflation
to 30 percent next year, he added.

	   KUPANG, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of Indonesian troops and
police Wednesday guarded a troubled provincial capital where
rioters burned and ransacked 15 mosques earlier this week.
	   While security was heavy, there were no reports of new unrest in
Christian-dominated Kupang, the latest site of religious violence
in the world's most populous Muslim nation.
	   The riots on Monday raised fears that attacks on places of
worship could escalate in Indonesia, which has already endured
sporadic outbreaks of unrest because of economic and political
turmoil.
	   In apparent retaliation, Muslim mobs on Tuesday smashed windows
of two houses where Christians worshipped in Banjarsari, 155 miles
(250 kilometers) southeast of Jakarta.
	   National police spokesman Brig. Gen. Togar Sianipar told
reporters in Jakarta that the situation in Kupang was calm.
	   He said 20 people were injured in the rioting, including two who
were wounded by plastic bullets. Eight men were arrested for
looting.
	   The violence in Kupang, the capital of East Nusa Tenggara
province, disrupted commerce as many traders shut their shops amid
fear of widespread looting.
	   Truckdrivers stayed away from the docks, leaving sacks of rice
unloaded in shipholds. The Christian-dominated city of 120,000
people lies 1,875 kilometers (1,172 miles) southeast of Jakarta in
a poor, arid region.
	   The Kompas daily newspaper said staple foods such as rice and
noodles were scarce and that shoppers in the marketplace could not
find fresh vegetables.
	   Frightened Muslims with sickles and swords guarded their homes
and mosques.
	   The attacks on Kupang's mosques were in retaliation for the
burning and ransacking of 22 churches by Muslim mobs in Jakarta on
Nov. 22, when 14 people were killed, some hacked to death.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
with the rest following Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or other faiths.
Some cities in the sprawling archipelago nation have Christian
majorities.
	   Togar said police had detained alleged instigators of Monday's
rioting, but did not say how many people were being questioned.
	   The military, its credibility sagging because of human rights
abuses, is overstretched as it tries to keep order across the
turbulent Southeast Asian nation.
	   Islamic leaders have urged their followers not to retaliate with
more violence.
	   Religious diversity based on a belief in God is enshrined in the
national philosophy, known as Pancasila, adopted when Indonesia
declared independence from Dutch colonial rule in 1945.
	   The upsurge in religious violence follows months of riots and
protests in many parts of Indonesia.

Ukrainian police confiscate illegal fireworks in Crimea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A police operation in Ukraine's Crimean
Peninsula to confiscate illegal fireworks used for New Year's
celebrations already has yielded 256 explosives, officials said
Wednesday.
	   Police uncovered 14 shops selling the illegal fireworks in
Crimea's capital Simferopol, and several were expected to be fined,
the police press service said.
	   During New Year's celebrations last year, 14 people were treated
in Simferopol for burns and other injuries caused by dangerous or
carelessly handled fireworks, according to police.

Repairs at Chernobyl nuclear reactor delayed over energy shortages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine is so short of energy that it could
not afford Tuesday to temporarily shut down the Chernobyl nuclear
power plant for repairs.
	   Earlier this month, Ukraine's Nuclear Regulation Administration
ordered the plant's only working reactor be temporarily stopped,
warning that some safety equipment was reaching the end of its
operational life and needed to be upgraded or replaced.
	   But a spokesman for the state nuclear energy company Energoatom
said Tuesday that the reactor will stay active until at least Dec.
15. By then, other nuclear reactors undergoing repairs are set to
be restarted.
	   Nuclear Regulation Administration chief Oleksander Smyshliaev
said his agency decided to grant Energoatom's request to prolong
the reactor's work, but stressed that it had to be stopped as soon
as possible.
	   Another Chernobyl reactor was destroyed in a 1986 explosion and
fire, the world's worst nuclear accident. Since then, there have
been frequent malfunctions at the one remaining reactor despite
lengthy repairs between July 1997 and May 1998.
	   The Energy Ministry has repeatedly protested the order to shut
down the reactor, saying it is needed until the spring to ensure
enough electricity for the winter months.
	   Energoatom warned Monday that the shutdown of the Chernobyl
reactor would force energy authorities to cut off entire regions of
the country.
	   Ukraine faces a huge energy deficit this winter because
conventional energy plants, which are owed more than $1 billion by
consumers, can't afford enough fuel to satisfy the demand for
electricity and heat.
	   Thousands of towns and villages in Ukraine already go without
electricity for several hours every day as temperatures throughout
much of the country have sunk below zero.
	   Western nations have long demanded the shutdown of the working
Chernobyl reactor amid growing worries over its safety.

Kremlin says Yeltsin improving, still in hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin is feeling better,
but still spending part of the day in a hospital bed as he
continues to be treated for pneumonia, officials said Tuesday.
	   A Kremlin spokesman said the president was doing limited
paperwork and there were no plans for any meetings or visitors. He
did not say how much longer Yeltsin would remain in the government
hospital, where he has been for 10 days.
	   Yeltsin's first deputy chief of staff Oleg Sysuyev said Tuesday
that the president is expected to return to work at the Kremlin
``in the nearest time.''
	   ``Doctors are having trouble keeping the president in the
hospital,'' Sysuyev said at a news conference.
	   The 67-year-old leader is known as a restless patient who
sometimes ignores the advice of his doctors.
	   Yeltsin ``is unhappy about being sick, he is not submitting to
his illness,'' Yakushkin said in an interview with the weekly
Sobesednik cited by the Interfax news agency.
	   This week, Yeltsin met with government leaders and spoke by
phone to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to discuss his upcoming
talks with International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus, who
arrived in Moscow later Tuesday.
	   Russian television on Monday showed brief footage of Yeltsin,
dressed in a white shirt and dark cardigan and looking pale,
listening intently to an aide and nodding periodically. Like most
footage of Yeltsin released in recent weeks, the tape didn't
contain any sound of the president speaking.
	   Yeltsin has remained out of public view throughout the latest
economic crisis that hit in mid-August, further eroding his sagging
public image.
	   ``It's known that the president now doesn't have sufficiently
high popularity, to put it mildly,'' Sysuyev said, according to the
Interfax news agency.

Russian prime minister lobbies IMF chief for more loans

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With a $22.6 billion loan package now on hold, the
head of the International Monetary Fund launched a new round of
talks Tuesday aimed at freeing up the money for the cash-starved
Russian economy.
	   But Michel Camdessus was not expected to announce any
breakthroughs. Russia's government has continued to postpone tough
financial decisions the IMF says it needs to see before it can lend
the rest of the funds.
	   Camdessus met Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Tuesday and is
scheduled to hold broader talks with government officials on
Wednesday.
	   ``I want to get better acquainted with the prime minister,''
Camdessus told reporters.
	   Russia, which owes mounting debts to workers, pensioners and
foreign creditors, is seeking further installments on the IMF-led
bailout package arranged during the summer.
	   The fund froze the loans when Russia devalued the ruble and
defaulted on some of its debts in August, succumbing to the
economic crisis that began in Asia.
	   Russia has so far received only about $5 billion of the package,
which also involves money from the World Bank and the Japanese
government.
	   The IMF has said Russia must lay out a realistic recovery plan
before it can have any more of the money.
	   An IMF mission left Moscow last week saying the government's
forecast for revenues next year was overly optimistic. It also
disapproved of the government's intention to cut taxes and
subsidize ailing industries.
	   If Russia doesn't receive foreign financial help soon, it may
have to start printing money to pay its debts _ a step sure to fuel
inflation and further imperil its wounded economy.
	   ``I hope that the IMF would be able to make a decision to
provide aid to Russia that would allow us to avoid
hyperinflation,'' Oleg Sysuyev, a top presidential aide, said at a
news conference Tuesday.
	   The government has delayed a debate on its budget for next year
while it struggles to find ways to raise enough money to meet its
expenses. The Cabinet again postponed the discussion this week.
	   Russian media have suggested that the government delayed action
on the budget because it is hoping first for a breakthrough on the
IMF loan. The latest draft budget assumes that Russia will receive
the IMF money.
	   Sysuyev, meanwhile, reiterated that President Boris Yeltsin, who
is in the hospital for pneumonia, will leave day-to-day management
of economic matters to Primakov.

Helicopter rescues TV crew trapped on Arctic island
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES last graf with crew leaving for Moscow. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While snow squalls whipped across the desolate
Arctic landscape, a Russian helicopter emerged from the dusky
winter light Tuesday and rescued a TV crew that had been stranded
on a remote island for weeks by bad weather.
	   The three-man crew _ a Russian, a Japanese and an Australian who
had been making a documentary on polar bears _ had three days' food
left when the helicopter airlifted them from Wrangel Island to the
port of Pevek, the Ministry of Emergency Situations said.
	   They had waited for weeks for the skies to clear up enough so
that a helicopter could land. The temperature on Wrangel Island has
been around minus 22 degrees, and the Arctic days never get
brighter than twilight.
	   ``We were filming polar bears and other animals,'' Nikita
Ovsyannikov told Russian television channel NTV. ``On Oct. 15, we
completed the work, and a flight was ordered to take us back.''
	   ``But this year the weather conditions were very unusual: heavy,
long cyclones, the weather was constantly bad, with powerful
blizzards. So the flight couldn't arrive,'' he said.
	   The three then holed up in a cabin on the island's northeast
coast, about 350 miles west of Alaska.
	   Japanese crew member Tatsuhiko Kobayashi developed complications
from a recent eye operation, but the others were in good health,
Russia's ORT television reported.
	   Weather in Russia's Arctic has been particularly severe this
year. A nuclear-powered ice-breaking ship was stranded for several
days last week, unable to cut a channel for a Finnish tanker that
carried badly needed fuel to residents of Russia's northeast
Chukotka peninsula, not far from Wrangel Island.
	   ``It wasn't easy to find pilots,'' said Dean Finlay of the
emergency company AEA International SOS. ``Also, there was only a
three-hour daytime window in the area, and just over two hours of
flight time, so they had to get the window just right.''
	   It took the crew about an hour to load the 880 pounds of
equipment and film aboard. Then they traveled back in the already
black Arctic night.
	   ``It was an anxious couple of hours,'' said John Hyde, a
television producer who helped coordinate the rescue.
	   There were conflicting reports on who organized the rescue.
Emergency Situations Ministry spokesman Viktor Beltsov said the
rescue was organized by his agency using an Mi-8 helicopter hired
from a private airline.
	   But AEA International SOS said it had organized the rescue,
according to Mark Crawford, the company's spokesman in Australia.
He said his company had been hired by the filmmakers' employer,
Natural History Pty. Ltd., in New Zealand.
	   ``They're in fair spirits,'' Crawford said of the crew.
``They're surviving, of course, but they were down to their last
three days of food.''
	   Kobayashi is an employee of NHK, the Japanese television
company. The Australian is cameraman John McGuiness. All three crew
members departed on a flight for Moscow on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus
has returned to a Russia that badly wants aid to pay off mounting
debts but has been unwilling to make the tough financial decisions
required to win IMF cash.
	   Camdessus is scheduled to hold meetings in Moscow today with
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other top Russian
officials. The IMF chief met with Primakov after his arrival
Tuesday night.
	   ``I want to get better acquainted with the prime minister,''
Camdessus told reporters. ``I presume we will be having interesting
conversations.''
	   The stakes are high: Russia owes billions of dollars to workers,
pensioners and foreign creditors and wants the IMF to release
further installments on a frozen $22.6 billion bailout loan.
	   But Camdessus' visit is unlikely to produce any breakthroughs
for this cash-starved country.
	   The IMF put the loan on hold after Russia's government,
succumbing to the economic crisis that began in Asia, devalued the
ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in August. The fund is
demanding that Russia come up with a realistic economic recovery
plan before it will free up the loan.
	   Russia, however, has been waiting for the IMF to make the first
move. The government delayed a debate this week on next year's
budget as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to
meet expenses.
	   While the Cabinet insisted the delay was not connected with
Camdessus' visit, Russian media have suggested the government put
off action on the budget because it hopes to receive an IMF cash
infusion first. The latest budget draft assumes Russia will receive
the IMF money.
	   ``Everyone understands that budget parameters remain vague, and
their clarification depends on Camdessus' visit,'' the business
daily Kommersant said Tuesday.
	   If the Russian government doesn't receive foreign help soon, it
will probably have to start printing money, which would drive up
inflation and further imperil Russia's fragile economy.
	   ``I hope that the IMF would be able to make a decision to
provide aid to Russia that would allow us to avoid
hyperinflation,'' Oleg Sysuyev, a top presidential aide, told a
news conference Tuesday.
	   An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's

disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes and offer
subsidies to ailing industries.
	   Russia has so far received only about $5 billion of the bailout
package, which also involves funds from the World Bank and the
Japanese government.
	   Sysuyev, meanwhile, reiterated that President Boris Yeltsin will
leave day-to-day management of economic matters to Primakov.
Yeltsin is in the hospital receiving treatment for pneumonia and
will not meet with Camdessus.

Ukrainian nuclear disarmament leaves army officers homeless
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Viacheslav Havlytsky still recalls the day
when his nuclear weapons unit relinquished its last bomb in
exchange for a promise of new housing.
	   It was 1993 when Ukraine agreed to turn over its former Soviet
nuclear arsenal, the world's third-largest, to Russia for
dismantling. The United States, eager to promote nuclear
disarmament, agreed to fund construction of about 2,000 apartments
for officers who would be left jobless as a result.
	   But Havlytsky, a retired lieutenant colonel who served at a
nuclear weapons base, says the apartments have been misappropriated
by senior commanders for their own use.
	   ``We were deceived in the rudest possible way,'' Havlytsky said.
``Now no one needs us.''
	   The officers were told to choose among several cities where
apartments were to be built _ a generous offer in a country with
thousands of homeless military retirees and career officers.
	   The schedule for construction and distribution of apartments,
conducted with financial assistance from the United States, was
finally approved by the Defense Ministry in 1996.
	   Under the plan, officers in Havlytsky's detachment, which ran a
secret base for storing nuclear warheads, were to receive 159
apartments, with 93 to be ready by the end of 1997.
	   ``All the high-ranking guests who visited our base, including
the president and the defense minister, reassured us that each of
us would have a place to live,'' said retired Maj. Oleksandr
Kuzmych, another officer from Object S, the nuclear base's code
name.
	   But only 21 officers received apartments last year, and none so
far this year.
	   Havlytsky produced a letter from the U.S. Embassy saying the
apartments had been built. A written inquiry about the homes' fate
sent by The Associated Press to the Defense Ministry went
unanswered for a month.
	   When the officers asked when they would get their new homes,
they were told their old unit had been transferred to another
command that was not eligible for the apartment program.
	   ``We were told we can no longer count on apartments distributed
under the agreement because our base is not part of the former
nuclear force,'' Kuzmych said in an interview.
	   That was a shock to the officers, many of them in their forties,
who saw their hopes of starting a new life abruptly vanish.
	   Entangled in military red tape, they wrote numerous letters to
the Defense Ministry, trying to prove they should still be eligible
for new homes as direct participants in Ukraine's nuclear
disarmament.
	   But the response they received from the 43rd Army in July
contained little in the way of promises: ``One thousand
seventy-nine officers in our army do not have apartments, so we do
not have a possibility to consider allocating apartments for your
unit in the near future,'' it said.
	   The ex-officers believe they are victims of the country's
rampant corruption and say the apartments apparently were
distributed to top officers who were not supposed to get them.
	   Today, they stay with their families at military homes near the
former nuclear base, surviving on $35 monthly pensions, of which
$29 is spent on apartment fees.
	   The officers have tried to return to army service, but their
expertise as nuclear professionals is no longer needed in
nuclear-free Ukraine.
	   Havlytsky recalls how in May 1996 his unit bid farewell to the
last nuclear warhead before dispatching it to Russia.
	   ``We wrote `feeding mother' on it as we really depended on these
weapons for our living,'' he said. ``Now we understand how
prophetic we were then.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of the International Monetary Fund met
today with top Russian officials who are still hoping to free up
loans that were frozen when Russia's latest economic crisis hit.
	   Michel Camdessus met with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, but
Camdessus wasn't expected to announce the release of the loans that
Moscow badly wants to pay off mounting debts.
	   Speaking to reporters this morning, Primakov sought to lower
expectations.
	   ``Don't measure the significance of Camdessus' visit by how much
money he brought,'' Primakov said. ``He has come with an attache
case containing documents, not cash.''
	   Primakov added that he was satisfied with his initial meeting
with Camdessus. ``We are exchanging opinions,'' he said. ``You
shouldn't think that the question of giving money to Russia will be
solved now.''
	   Russia owes billions of dollars to workers, pensioners and
foreign creditors and wants the IMF to provide a new installment on
a $22.6 billion bailout package that was negotiated in the summer,
shortly before the latest economic crisis hit.
	   But the IMF has been demanding a realistic recovery plan from
the Russian government and has so far been unimpressed with
Moscow's efforts.
	   The IMF put the loan installments on hold after Russia's
government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in
August. Primakov's government has moved cautiously, refraining from
any radical measures and hoping that the IMF and other lenders will
offer help.
	   The government delayed a debate this week on next year's budget
as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet
expenses.
	   While the Cabinet insisted the delay was not connected with
Camdessus' visit, Russian media have suggested the government put
off action on the budget because it is still holding out hope of
receiving IMF money. The latest budget draft assumes Russia will
receive the IMF loan.
	   If the Russian government doesn't receive foreign help soon, it
will be forced to start printing money, which would drive up
inflation and further imperil Russia's fragile economy, Primakov
and other officials have warned.
	   An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's
revenue forecast for next year was overly optimistic. It also
disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes, offer
subsidies to ailing industries and increase state regulation of the
economy.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov insisted today that
Russia will go its own way and assailed the IMF for what he called
its unfair assessment of the government's intentions.
	   ``They assess every step toward reason as a step toward
administrative controls over the economy,'' Maslyukov was quoted by
the Interfax news agency as saying.
	   He said that Russia's main goal now is ``to make the free-market
economy socially-oriented by means of state regulation.''
	   Russia has so far received only about $5 billion of the bailout
package, which also involves the World Bank and the Japanese
government.
	   Meanwhile, Central Bank chairman Viktor Geraschenko outlined the
country's economic woes in an address today to parliament's upper
house, the Federation Council.
	   Russia's economy has shrunk about 5 percent to 6 percent
compared to a year ago and inflation is up an estimated 70 percent
compared to last December, he said. The government will try to
limit inflation to 30 percent next year, he said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two people died of hypothermia overnight in Moscow
as temperatures dipped to minus 2, a news report said today.
	   Temperatures have been lower than normal in recent weeks, and 48
people have frozen to death on the streets of the Russian capital,
the Interfax news agency reported.

Deputy chief of Tajikistan's Central Bank kidnapped
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ The vice president of Tajikistan's
National Bank was kidnapped by several gunmen today in the capital
of this restive Central Asian nation.
	   Police said the assailants, wearing military fatigues, stopped
Navruz Valiyev's car, seized him and drove away. The motive for the
kidnapping was not immediately clear.
	   Valiyev recently ordered an increase in the minimum capital
requirements for the nation's commercial banks in a bid to protect
depositors' accounts. Several banks failed to meet the requirements
and were forced to halt operations.
	   Valiyev was also in charge of Tajikistan's talks with the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Tajikistan's economy is in shambles following a 5-year civil war
between the secular government, which is backed by Russia, and the
mostly Islamic opposition. A truce signed last year ended
large-scale hostilities, but there are still periodic clashes.

Ukrainian nuclear disarmament leaves army officers homeless
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 3rd graf pvs, `But Havlytsky...' to fix -- believes sted
says. Picks up 4th graf pvs, `We were...' &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Viacheslav Havlytsky still recalls the day
when his nuclear weapons unit relinquished its last bomb in
exchange for a promise of new housing.
	   It was 1993 when Ukraine agreed to turn over its former Soviet
nuclear arsenal, the world's third-largest, to Russia for
dismantling. The United States, eager to promote nuclear
disarmament, agreed to fund construction of about 2,000 apartments
for officers who would be left jobless as a result.
	   But Havlytsky, a retired lieutenant colonel who served at a
nuclear weapons base, believes the apartments have been
misappropriated by senior commanders for their own use.
	   ``We were deceived in the rudest possible way,'' Havlytsky said.
``Now no one needs us.''
	   The officers were told to choose among several cities where
apartments were to be built _ a generous offer in a country with
thousands of homeless military retirees and career officers.
	   The schedule for construction and distribution of apartments,
conducted with financial assistance from the United States, was
finally approved by the Defense Ministry in 1996.
	   Under the plan, officers in Havlytsky's detachment, which ran a
secret base for storing nuclear warheads, were to receive 159
apartments, with 93 to be ready by the end of 1997.
	   ``All the high-ranking guests who visited our base, including
the president and the defense minister, reassured us that each of
us would have a place to live,'' said retired Maj. Oleksandr
Kuzmych, another officer from Object S, the nuclear base's code
name.
	   But only 21 officers received apartments last year, and none so
far this year.
	   Havlytsky produced a letter from the U.S. Embassy saying the
apartments had been built. A written inquiry about the homes' fate
sent by The Associated Press to the Defense Ministry went
unanswered for a month.
	   When the officers asked when they would get their new homes,
they were told their old unit had been transferred to another
command that was not eligible for the apartment program.
	   ``We were told we can no longer count on apartments distributed
under the agreement because our base is not part of the former
nuclear force,'' Kuzmych said in an interview.
	   That was a shock to the officers, many of them in their forties,
who saw their hopes of starting a new life abruptly vanish.
	   Entangled in military red tape, they wrote numerous letters to
the Defense Ministry, trying to prove they should still be eligible
for new homes as direct participants in Ukraine's nuclear
disarmament.
	   But the response they received from the 43rd Army in July
contained little in the way of promises: ``One thousand
seventy-nine officers in our army do not have apartments, so we do
not have a possibility to consider allocating apartments for your
unit in the near future,'' it said.
	   The ex-officers believe they are victims of the country's
rampant corruption and say the apartments apparently were
distributed to top officers who were not supposed to get them.
	   Today, they stay with their families at military homes near the
former nuclear base, surviving on $35 monthly pensions, of which
$29 is spent on apartment fees.
	   The officers have tried to return to army service, but their
expertise as nuclear professionals is no longer needed in
nuclear-free Ukraine.
	   Havlytsky recalls how in May 1996 his unit bid farewell to the
last nuclear warhead before dispatching it to Russia.
	   ``We wrote `feeding mother' on it as we really depended on these
weapons for our living,'' he said. ``Now we understand how
prophetic we were then.''

Russian parliament calls for govt. officials to declare income
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's lawmakers and top government officials
will have to declare their income and assets each year under a bill
passed today by Russia's parliament.
	   The bill, designed to combat widespread corruption, won
unanimous approval in parliament's lower chamber, the State Duma.
To become law, it needs to be approved by parliament's upper
chamber and signed by President Boris Yeltsin.
	   The measure says all top officials must give details of their
income and assets, including information on personal debts, banking
transactions and stock ownership.
	   Yeltsin signed a similar order last year, and he and some other
senior government officials have made such declarations in the
past.
	   The new bill would broaden the practice, making it mandatory for
all Cabinet ministers and lawmakers as well as other officials.
	   Corruption has hampered Russia's free-market reforms and
contributed to the country's economic problems. A number of
officials have been accused or convicted of graft in recent years.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head of the International Monetary Fund met
today with top Russian officials who are still hoping to free up
loans that were frozen when Russia's latest economic crisis hit.
	   Michel Camdessus met with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, but
Camdessus wasn't expected to announce the release of the loans that
Moscow badly wants to pay off mounting debts.
	   Speaking to reporters this morning, Primakov sought to lower
expectations.
	   ``Don't measure the significance of Camdessus' visit by how much
money he brought,'' Primakov said. ``He has come with an attache
case containing documents, not cash.''
	   Primakov added that he was satisfied with his initial meeting
with Camdessus. ``We are exchanging opinions,'' he said. ``You
shouldn't think that the question of giving money to Russia will be
solved now.''
	   Russia owes billions of dollars to workers, pensioners and
foreign creditors and wants the IMF to provide a new installment on
a $22.6 billion bailout package that was negotiated in the summer,

Kremlin says Yeltsin may return to work Monday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin is expected to remain
hospitalized through the end of the week, but may return to the
Kremlin next Monday, a top aide said today.
	   The president, who is suffering from pneumonia, has been doing
limited paperwork and holding telephone conversations at the
government clinic where he's been recovering for the past 11 days.
	   Yeltsin was expected to hold a telephone conversation today with
French President Jacques Chirac. Later this week, the president
plans to meet Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the president's
deputy chief of staff, Yuri Yarov, was quoted as saying by the
Interfax news agency.
	   ``The president is making his schedule himself,'' said Yarov,
adding that the president could be back at work next Monday.
	   Another Yeltsin's aide, Oleg Sysuyev, said Tuesday that Yeltsin,
known as a restless patient, is urging doctors to discharge him as
soon as possible.
	   ``Doctors are having trouble keeping the president in the
hospital,'' Sysuyev said.
	   Yeltsin's repeated health problems have raised doubts about his
ability to lead Russia out of its worst economic crisis in the
post-Soviet era.
	   Last week, the Kremlin acknowledged for the first time that
Yeltsin suffered several heart attacks in 1996 before he underwent
bypass surgery. The Russian media had been reporting this for some
time.
	   Renat Akchurin, the surgeon who operated Yeltsin, said that the
current bout of pneumonia, the second in as many years, is
apparently due to the president's weakened immunity and his age,
not heart problems.
	   Akchurin, speaking in an interview with the weekly Argumenty i
Fakty, said he has not examined Yeltsin for eight months, but
believed that heart problems were unlikely.
	   The doctor urged Yeltsin to heed doctors' advice and warned
about possible complications.
	   ``Pneumonia sometimes brings even healthy people to a tragic
end,'' Akchurin said. ``For those with a record of heart illness,
it always has a quite serious character.''
	   Yeltsin has made only rare public appearances in recent months,
and was visiting the Kremlin only two or three days a week before
he fell ill. Primakov has taken over many day-to-day duties in
Yeltsin's absence.

Rover chairman resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The chairman of Rover Group announced his
resignation Wednesday, a week after the company and its unions
reached agreement on job cuts and other cost savings.
	   ``When I look around, I look to myself. I feel quite strongly
that somebody has to be prepared to stand up and be counted,''
Walter Hasselkus told a news conference. ``This was a very
difficult and painful process for me.''
	   Hasselkus was appointed chairman in 1996, two years after the
British automaker was acquired by Bayerische Motoren Werke AG. His
resignation is effective at the end of the year.
	   Werner Saemann, manager of the engines and chassis division of
BMW, will succeed Hasselukus, Rover announced.
	   Rover and its unions reached agreement last week on a plan to
trim 2,500 jobs from the current workforce of 39,000.
	   BMW expects to save 150 million pounds (dlrs 250 million) per
year due to the job cuts and the introduction of new working
practices, BMW chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder said. The agreement
has yet to be ratified by union members.

Remains foreign exchange reserves drop below dlrs 2 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Reman (AP) _ For the first time this year, Romania's
foreign exchange reserves at the National Bank dropped below dlrs 2
billion, an official said Wednesday.
	   Foreign exchange reserves at the National Bank of Romania are
estimated at dlrs 1.85 billion at the end of November, from dlrs
2.04 billion at the end of October, the bank's governor, Mugur
Isarescu, said during an economic conference.
	   The drop is the result of some external debts payments and
central bank interventions on the market to slow the depreciation
of the national currency, the leu, currency dealers said.
	   Last week, the central bank was seen intervening and selling
about dlrs 30 million to stop the fast fall of the leu.
	   The leu has depreciated in recent weeks on increasing dollar
demand from importers and banks buying dollars fearing a further
fall of the leu.
	   Isarescu declined to give a reason for the decline of the
reserves, but said that the foreign exchange reserve might be more
than dlrs 2 billion at the end of this year.
	   Economic analyst Ilie Serbanescu predicted that Romania would be
unable to pay its foreign debts of dlrs 2.2 billion next year due
to wrong government policy and slow reforms.
	   ``Its financial credibility on the international market will be
compromised significantly,'' Serbanescu said.
	   Isarescu predicted that the government's 45 percent annual
inflation target for 1998 will be reached and called ``feasible''
the 1999 target of 25 percent annual inflation.
	   But he warned that the figure is conditioned by swift market
reforms, including the closure of money-losing companies, control
of the budget deficit and keeping salaries in line with
productivity.
	   In recent weeks, thousands of protesters have taken to the
streets of Romania's cities to vent their anger at the government.
Workers accused the government of lacking a strategy to reduce
communist-era state ownership and claim that high taxes are causing
widespread poverty.

Russian jet ejection seats to be manufactured locally

	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) _ State and local officials said Tuesday
they look for the economic gain from a Russian ejection seat
maker's first American plant to continue beyond the startup date.
	   IBP Aerospace Group Inc. plans to open a facility in the
Prestige Park industrial complex in East Hartford next fall,
immediately generating about 200 full-time jobs. That number could
double by 2004, officials said during a news conference Tuesday.
	   IBP would join Hamilton Standard as a major aerospace contractor
with operations in East Hartford. ``We're just tickled pink about
it,'' East Hartford Mayor Timothy D. Larson said.
	   The state offered a $7 million aid package to the company, which
has manufactured 12,000 seats in Russia and the former Soviet Union
since 1965.
	   Arthur Diedrick, a development official in the administration of
Gov. John G. Rowland, said the company has promised to stay in East
Hartford for at least 10 years.
	   ``The partnership is really instrumental in where we're trying
to go in Connecticut,'' said James F. Abromaitis, commissioner of
the state Department of Economic and Community Development, which
offered a $1 million job training incentive.
	   All parts for the seats, considered the most technologically
advanced in the world, will be manufactured locally to Russian
standards, said Kenneth J. Szalai, the company's president and
chief executive officer. The former senior NASA official said the
company will use vendors and suppliers within a 50-mile radius of
the local plant.
	   IBP also has offices in McLean, Va.
	   Szalai said the local plant will benefit from the estimated $500
million spent on development of the product since the early 1960s.
	   Based on the Russian K-36 ejection seat, the American-built
seats will equip pilots weighing between 103 and 240 pounds, and
are designed to prevent injury upon ejection. The seats will be
used in a wide range of American fighter aircraft.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The NATO-led international
Stabilization Force in Bosnia detained indicted war criminal
General Radislav Krstic on Wednesday and will send him to the
International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands for
trial.
	   Details of the detention were not immediately available.

 &UR; Couples charged with counselling Russians to file phony refugee
claims &LR; 
	   TORONTO (CP) _ The RCMP shut down two immigration consulting
firms whose owners are accused of counselling hundreds of Russians
to make phony refugee claims.
	   Two couples were arrested in separate raids of Focus Universal
Canadian Consulting and Serge and Gail Paralegal Services on
Monday.
	   Mounties also seized official Israel and Russia stamps and seals
when they raided the former company.
	   RCMP said hundreds of Russian Jews were counselled to file false
refugee claims, given false promises of employment and some were
helped to enter Canada with false papers.
	   The claimants, saying they were persecuted in Russia for being
Jewish, would travel to Israel where they lived briefly before
heading to Canada as refugees.
	   ``There was some advertising overseas,'' said RCMP Sgt. Glenn
Hanna.
	   ``We're reviewing all their immigration files.''
	   Const. Howard Adams said both companies were catering to the
Russian community in the Toronto area.
	   Evgueni Kitaigorodski, 39, and his wife, Elena Kitaigorodskaia,
32, both refugee claimants, of Toronto, have been charged with
several immigration violations. They appeared for a bail hearing
Tuesday.
	   Sergie Slipachenko, 42, and his wife Galina Slipachenko, 39,
have been charged with several immigration offences. They were
released on bond and are to return to court Jan. 18. (Toronto

	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) _ State economic development officials see
a Russian aircraft ejection seat maker's first U.S. landing in East
Hartford as an example of the kind of major public-private
partnership the state wants to build.
	   IBP Aerospace Group Inc. announced Tuesday it would open a plant
in the Prestige Park industrial complex next fall.
	   Arthur Diedrick, a development official in the administration of
Gov. John G. Rowland, said the company has promised to stay in East
Hartford for at least 10 years.
	   The state offered a $7 million aid package to the company, which
has manufactured 12,000 seats in Russia and the former Soviet Union
since 1965.
	   The move will immediately generate about 200 full-time jobs, and
double that number by the year 2004, IBP officials said during a
news conference here Tuesday.
	   James F. Abromaitis, commissioner of the state Department of
Economic and Community Development, said IBP's move ``will work as
a catalyst'' and increase international exposure.
	   IBP would join Hamilton Standard as a major aerospace contractor
with operations in East Hartford.
	   ``This is a dynamite opportunity for the town and for the
state,'' said East Hartford Mayor Timothy D. Larson.
	   All parts for the seats, considered the most technologically
advanced in the world, will be manufactured locally to Russian
standards, said Kenneth J. Szalai, the company's president and
chief executive officer. The former senior NASA official said the
company will use vendors and suppliers within a 50-mile radius of
the local plant.
	   IBP also has offices in McLean, Va.
	   Szalai said the local plant will benefit from the estimated $500
million spent on development of the product since the early 1960s.
	   Based on the Russian K-36 ejection seat, the American-built
seats will equip pilots weighing between 103 and 240 pounds, and
are designed to prevent injury upon ejection. The seats will be
used in a wide range of American fighter aircraft.

Russia agrees to return art looted by Nazis

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Russia agreed to return to Holocaust victims
or their heirs art looted by the Nazis, but the French rejected a
plea to auction more than 2,000 works of art the government has
held since World War II.
	   A senior U.S. official called Russia's plan a ``breakthrough''
at an international conference to set informal standards for the
return of stolen assets.
	   But the French delegation rejected a plea Tuesday from a top
official of the Museum of Modern Art and the World Jewish Congress
to auction, for the benefit of Holocaust victims and their
families, more than 2,000 pieces of looted works the government has
held at museums since World War II.
	   ``It has been impossible to give back,'' Louis Amigues, a
leading member of the French delegation, said in an interview,
despite the publication of the list of looted art on the Internet
for the past year.
	   Amigues, like French President Jacques Chirac, said the
government would not consider auctioning the paintings and other
works to aid Holocaust victims. ``It is not the French way,'' he
explained. ``The French way is to try and find the owners or their
heirs. The art belongs to them and nobody else.''
	   The four-day conference, a mostly closed meeting that continues
today, involves 44 countries, the Vatican and more than a dozen
groups, including Jewish, art, history and insurance organizations.
	   On Tuesday, Moscow's representative, Valery Kulishov, surprised
the conference by pledging to try to identify and return ``victim
art'' looted from individuals and religious and community centers
by the Nazis and then taken as ``reparations'' by the Soviet
government for damage caused and lives lost at Germany's hands.
Russia said nothing about returning ``trophy art'' taken from
institutions.
	   Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, head of the U.S.
delegation that organized the conference, called the Russian
gesture ``a real breakthrough.'' He noted that Moscow also agreed
to a U.S.-proposed set of principles that would require return of
looted art, if possible, or restitution.
	   ``The political will exists now'' for returning the art,
Eizenstat declared at a news conference. He added that delegates
seemed to have ``a collective sense of urgency to participate.''
	   In Russia's case, time will be short for individuals to make
claims, according to a law passed by the Duma in April that gives
people 18 months to make a government-to-government request for
restitution, Eizenstat said. The Russians told delegates they are
willing to speed up their work and asked for help in setting up a
database to determine the history of plundered artworks, he said.
	   The Nazis looted an estimated 150,000 pieces of art from Western
Europe during the war and some 500,000 pieces from Eastern and
Central Europe, the delegates were told.
	   Ronald Lauder, chairman of the board of the Museum of Modern Art
and an official with the World Jewish Congress, estimated 110,000
pieces of art worth $10 billion to $30 billion are still
``missing'' and said virtually every large museum, institution and
private collection contains some. A review of 225 museum catalogs
over the summer by his group found 1,700 looted pieces of art, he
said.
	   Lauder called on governments and museums to return the art or
auction it to help Jewish groups and Holocaust survivors and their
families.
	   ``It is time for museums to set the same standard for ownership
that they expect of themselves for authenticity,'' he told
delegates. ``Is the art genuine? Is the art genuinely theirs?''
	   The U.S. Association of Art Museums formed a panel in June to
address the problem.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Security was tight in Istanbul on
Wednesday ahead of the politically charged Champions League match
between Juventus of Turin and Galatasaray.
	   Around 22,000 police officers were being deployed for the game
amid fears that angry Turkish fans might resort to violence against
the Italians. Military units were on standby.
	   Turks are outraged at Italy for refusing to extradite a Kurdish
rebel leader. Authorities also said they worried about a
provocation by the rebels aimed at staining Turkey's image.
	   Hundreds of police were on hand when the Italian team arrived at
the Istanbul airport Wednesday. A small group of airport employees
tossed flowers at the Juventus bus in greeting. But, as loyal
home-team fans, they also chanted ``Turkey, Turkey!''
	   The road from the airport to the team's hotel was closed to
traffic, but people standing along the route waved to the bus.
	   Turkey's leaders have been calling on Turks to be hospitable and
refrain from doing anything to mar the match.
	   Juventus official Romy Gai said security from the airport was
``just perfect,'' but added ``We will see at the match.''
	   ``We are here to play a game, only a game. We don't care about
other things,'' he said.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The prime minister-designate of Lebanon
promised to apply severe austerity measures shortly after he was
chosen to form a government Wednesday.
	   The government would pursue ``austerity in the extreme'' in the
1999 budget, Salim Hoss told reporters after his meeting with the
president.
	   The Cabinet that Hoss is to select will present a budget to the
Parliament in the coming weeks.
	   President Emile Lahoud issued a decree appointing Hoss after the
U.S.-educated economist received a majority of recommendations from
the Parliament. Speaker Nabih Berri said Wednesday that Hoss had
the support of 95 of the 128 lawmakers in the half-Christian,
half-Muslim legislature.
	   Hoss, a legislator from Beirut who turns 69 on Dec. 20, has held
the premiership on four previous occasions. He survived a 1987 car
bombing that killed a bodyguard in his motorcade.
	   ``We are facing big challenges which we should confront,'' Hoss
said.
	   He quickly tried to reassure the markets who have been jittery
since the current prime minister, Rafik Hariri, announced he was
bowing out of the race on Monday.
	   The national currency is ``in very solid state'' and measures
will be taken against speculators, he said.
	   The central bank has already pledged to intervene to support the
Lebanese pound.
	   He said his government would continue the postwar reconstruction
plan, work for the return of the hundreds of thousands of people
displaced by the 1975-90 civil war, and continue efforts to end
Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon.
	   Hariri, who is now serving in a caretaker capacity, became prime
minister in 1992 and launched the multibillion dollar program to
rebuild Lebanon from the devastation of the war. But his policy of
borrowing generously sank the country deep in debt and ordinary
Lebanese complained that the program's benefits had not reached
them.
	   When Lahoud sounded out legislators about re-appointing Hariri,
the prime minister received majority support, but not by the
overwhelming margin he had enjoyed in the past.
	   Hoss is a Sunni Muslim, like every prime minister under
Lebanon's power-sharing arrangement. The president is a Maronite
Catholic, and the speaker is a Shiite Muslim.
	   A soft-spoken, down-to-earth man, Hoss's style of government is
expected to be quite different from that of the flamboyant Hariri,
a billionaire businessman.
	   Hoss is expected to have a good working relationship with
Lahoud, whose goal of ridding the administration of corruption he
is known to share. In his previous terms as prime minister, Hoss
has earned a reputation as an honest politician.
	   The holder of an advanced degree in business and economics from
Indiana University at Bloomington, Hoss said Wednesday he favored
cutting interest rates, which are running at 14 percent.

New massacre in Algeria leaves 12 dead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Armed attackers slaughtered 12 villagers
during their sleep in a massacre early Wednesday in Algeria, an
official communique and hospital sources said.
	   Algerian security forces immediately launched a search for the
attackers in the Sidi Rached region about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
west of Algiers, where the massacre took place, an official
communique said.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the killings, which are
usually blamed on Islamic militants.
	   Hospital sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
villagers were killed while they were sleeping. Algerian radio
called the group a ``terrorist horde.''
	   No further details were available.
	   Violence in Algeria often comes in waves. The Muslim holy month
of Ramadan, which this year begins Dec. 20, tends to be an
especially dangerous time.
	   More than 75,000 people have died in an insurgency that erupted
when the government canceled January 1992 elections the Islamic
Salvation Front was expected to win.

Slovak government gains majority support in confidence vote
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Dzurinda quote &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The new Slovak government of Prime
Minister Mikulas Dzurinda won parliamentary endorsement Wednesday
for its program to pursue protection of minority and human rights
and integration into the European Union and NATO.
	   The confidence vote followed five days of discussions on the
government's program, which was supported by 88 of the 138 members
present at the session. The opposition, made up by the
nationalistic Slovak National Party and former Prime Minister
Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, criticized
the lack of specific figures and dates in the government's program.
	   The program of Dzurinda's cabinet, which came to power at the
end of October, set its priorities on guarding human and minority
rights as well as moving toward membership of the EU and NATO.
	   The program also calls for reducing unemployment from 14 percent
to 10 percent by 2002.
	   Dzurinda blamed Meciar for the critical state of the country.
	   ``The fact that the government of which I am head gained
confidence is good news for Slovakia and its citizens,'' Dzurinda
told reporters.
	   The justice minister, Jan Carnogursky, was the only minister who
voted against the government's program. Carnogursky said the
program did not include specifics on position of schools managed by
churches, and the agreement between Slovakia and Vatican.

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ At least 40 Rwandan soldiers captured in
the civil war in the Congo have been transferred to Harare,
Zimbabwe, in the hopes of exchanging them for Zimbabwean troops
captured by Rwandan-backed rebels, relief agency sources said
Wednesday.
	   However, Rwandan authorities have so far ruled out any prisoner
exchange, although they said they were in contact with Zimbabwean
authorities and are willing to facilitate visits to the captured
soldiers.
	   Rwanda and Zimbabwe are fighting on opposite sides of the
four-month uprising staged by rebels to oust Congolese President
Laurent Kabila.
	   Rwanda and Uganda are backing the rebels, a coalition of
disaffected soldiers and politicians who launched the rebellion
Aug. 2, accusing Kabila of corruption, nepotism and inciting ethnic
strife.
	   Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent soldiers to back
Kabila.
	   It isn't clear how many Rwandan soldiers Congolese authorities
are holding.
	   Last week Ugandan Foreign Minister Amama Mbabazi said Rwanda and
Uganda had captured 600 pro-Kabila fighters, including at least 16
Zimbabweans who fell into rebel hands in October when their plane
landed by mistake at an eastern airstrip under rebel control.
	   In northern Congo, the rebels say they are holding at least 200
Chadian prisoners, most of them in Kisangani.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross, which usually
registers prisoners of war and, when possible, facilitates the
exchange of messages between the prisoners and their families, said
since September it had recorded the names of 594 people, mainly
captured soldiers, in prisons in Kinshasa.
	   In a statement, the Red Cross also said it has started visiting
POWs held by the Congolese rebels in Goma, the eastern rebel
stronghold, but gave no figures.
	   The Red Cross said it had visited a total of 2,500 persons in
detention in Congo, including Tutsi civilians held on suspition of
aiding the rebels in the southern city of Lubumbashi.

Human rights groups fear government crackdown on funding
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BASSEM MROUE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian human rights activists said
Wednesday they feared that the arrest of one of their colleagues
was the start of a government crackdown to limit their funding _
and their work.
	   Police on Tuesday took Hafez Abu Saada, secretary-general of the
Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, into custody for 15 days on
grounds he accepted a donation from the British government without
Egyptian approval.
	   The donation became the subject of controversy after an Egyptian
weekly, Al-Osboa, alleged last month that the donation was
``payment'' to the EOHR for a report charging that Egyptian police
had arrested and tortured hundreds of Coptic Christians in a
criminal investigation in August.
	   Al-Osboa has close ties to the Interior Ministry, which is
responsible for internal security in Egypt.
	   ``This (arrest) has got nothing to do with the check, this has
nothing to do with the EOHR report,'' Gasser Abdel-Razek of the
Center for Human Rights Studies told a news conference. ``This is
about cover-up on torture and police brutality and human rights
violations.''
	   He added that ``this is an attack on the whole human rights
movement'' and called for support from international human rights
groups.
	   Abdel-Razek noted that his group has relied in part on foreign
funding since 1993. ``It is not illegal unless they (government
officials) want it to be illegal,'' he said.
	   The government to date has refused to register a single Egyptian
human rights group, putting them in the precarious position of
operating without the status of officially approved
non-governmental organizations.
	   The EOHR admits accepting a dlrs 25,703 donation in October from
the British Parliament's human rights committee.
	   But it denies the money influenced its report on police action
against the Copts in the Egyptian village of el-Kusheh.
	   On Tuesday, the EOHR's 15-member board voted to return the money
to Britain and to reject in future all foreign donations as a
demonstration of the group's neutrality.
	   At the news conference, Ayda Sayf al-Dawal of Al-Nadim Center
for Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence was asked if she thought
the government was trying to limit funding for non-governmental
organizations in advance of an anticipated, new rule on NGOs.
	   ``Yes, I think we definitely cannot interpret it except as the
introduction to this thing,'' she said.
	   Al-Dawal expressed surprise that Al-Osboa had suggested the EOHR
had committed the equivalent of treason for a foreign donation.
	   She noted that the paper's editor, Mustapha Bakri, was a member
of the EOHR's board of trustees ``for two rounds during which the
organization was receiving foreign funding.''
	   Abu Saada's wife, Nehal, said she believed her husband's arrest
was aimed at ``the organization he represents and against the whole
human rights movement in Egypt.''
	   She added: ``Foreign funding is not the problem. The problem for
the government is the activities that this funding is supporting.''
	   She said she has not yet been allowed to visit her husband.

Ukraine's Cabinet asks parliament to reconsider minimum wage hike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government asked parliament to
reconsider its decision raising the minimum wage, arguing that the
costly step would be destructive for the economy, a news report
said Wednesday.
	   A government statement urged the leftist-dominated parliament to
make a ``balanced and economically grounded decision'' providing
for a more gradual increase.
	   The hike approved last month ``does not take into account the
real budget spending possibilities and the financial conditions of
businesses'' and might lead to more wage arrears and cause
``extremely negative social and economic consequences,'' said the
appeal, cited by the independent UNIAN news agency.
	   The statement was read out in the legislature Wednesday.
	   Parliament voted Nov. 19 to raise the minimum wage from 55
hryvna (dlrs 16) a month to 148 hryvna (dlrs 43) a month. It also
set the official poverty level at 118.6 hryvna (dlrs 35) a month.
	   Nearly all Ukrainians earn more than the minimum wage, and the
average monthly salary was about 170 hryvna (dlrs 50) in the first
half of 1998. The minimum wage and poverty level figures, though,
are used to calculate various payments throughout the country.
	   The cash-strapped government has argued against the bill, citing
the extra spending involved. But the Verkhovna Rada, or parliament,
long has favored extra spending for social needs and dismissed the
Cabinet's objections.

<TEXT>
	   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) _ Over 250 million people face hunger and
poverty as a result of expanding deserts around the world,
according to U.N. figures presented to delegates at a conference on
desertification Wednesday.
	   Africa is one of the worst affected regions, with almost
three-quarters of its landmass severely or moderately affected by
drought triggered by changing climate patterns and harmful
agricultural practices, the U.N. report said.
	   For years, scientists have warned of the desertification of
arable lands on the edge of existing deserts, including Africa's
Sahara and China's Gobi. Deforestation, over-cultivation and
drought mean each year deserts expand and engulf once arable land.
	   The consequences in Africa have been devastating.
	   More than 200,000 people have died since the early 1970s as a
result of starvation brought on by drought, while about dlrs 9
billion in income has been lost to African economies, the U.N.
report said.

Lou Gehrig's patient connected from life support
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In what was described Wednesday as Israel's
first case of officially sanctioned euthanasia, a terminally ill
patient died after being disconnected from a life support machine.
	   Itai Arad, 49, a former fighter pilot, died Oct. 5 at
Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Yael
Bossem-Levy.
	   Arad suffered from Amniotic Lateral Sclerosis, a degenerative
muscle disease also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
	   The 49-year-old Arad had waged a lengthy legal battle to be
permitted to die without suffering. ALS attacks nerve cells in the
brain and spinal cord and eventually paralyzes victims.
	   In February 1996, Tel Aviv District Court Judge Moshe Talgam
ruled in a landmark decision that Arad had the right to choose the
time of his death.
	   At that time, Arad did not yet require life support, but was
unable to speak and answered his attorney's questions by nodding or
shaking his head.
	   In August, Arad asked medical staff at Meir Hospital in the town
of Kfar Saba to disconnect him from life support, but doctors at
Meir refused.
	   Arad's family then approached Dr. Avinoam Reches, a senior
neurologist at Hadassah Hospital, who agreed to disconnect Arad
from life support if the hospital's ethics committee agreed.
	   The committee asked the court to reaffirm its decision, the
Haaretz daily said. After the court did so on Oct. 1, Reches
injected Arad with large doses of painkillers on Oct. 4 and
disconnected him from life support.
	   Arad died a day later.
	   Reches said there could be no comparison between him and Dr.
Jack Kevorkian, a U.S. doctor who has assisted terminally ill
patients commit suicide and recently administered a lethal
injection to a patient suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease.
	   ``He (Kevorkian) kills indiscriminately ... He represents that
slippery slope that everybody is talking about,'' Reches told
Israel radio.
	   ``Itai ... died of his illness. I did not kill him. I
disconnected him from the instruments after I gave him medicine to
ensure that he would not suffer pain,'' Reches said.
	   Still, Haaretz on Wednesday described Arad's death as ``Israel's
first official euthanasia.''
	   Reches' act did not trigger widespread opposition.
	   One religious lawmaker, Yitzhak Cohen from the Shas Party, said
he feared the Arad case could pave the way for widespread
euthanasia. Cohen submitted a bill to parliament Wednesday that
would make it illegal to disconnect a patient from life support.
	   ``Even if a person is sick, even if he is dying, even if he is
crippled or mentally backward, nobody has the right to take his
life, neither by commission nor by omission,'' Cohen said. ``Once
you start it you never know where it will end.''

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The NATO-led international
Stabilization Force in Bosnia detained General Radislav Krstic on
Wednesday and will send him to the International War Crimes
Tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, where he is indicted for war
crimes.
	   Tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour was delighted at the
arrest, and called Krstic ``a very significant military leader.''
	   She added that she believed Krstic was still serving in the
Bosnian Serb Army.
	   His indictment is related to the 1995 massacre of Muslims
following the rebel Serb takeover of the Srebrenica U.N. safe haven
in eastern Bosnia in July, 1995.
	   ``Persons indicted for war crimes who are still at large should
realize they, too will be brought to justice,'' NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana said.
	   He is the ninth war crimes suspect to be arrested in the former
Yugoslavia by international forces.
	   Krstic was named on a sealed indictment, Arbour said. She did
not immediately disclose the exact nature of the charges against
him.
	   Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime
military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic both have been indicted for
genocide for allegedly masterminding the massacre at Serbrenica.
	   Neither Karadzic nor Mladic is in custody.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A car carrying a Norwegian television team
ran off the road and overturned on Wednesday, killing one of the
journalists and injuring the other, a Norwegian diplomat said.
	   Vavre De Saint-Clair, consul at the Norwegian Embassy in the
Jordanian capital Amman, said the driver, believed to be a
Jordanian, also was hurt in the crash.
	   The accident occurred 350 kilometers (210 miles) west of
Baghdad, according to Mohsin Tarfa, acting director of the Iraqi
Press Center in Baghdad.
	   The car was traveling to the Iraqi capital from Amman along a
route that is one of the few ways into the country because of U.N.
sanctions that ban air travel.
	   In Oslo, officials at Norway's TV2 said that two of its staffers
were involved in the accident. They said cameraman Knut Andre
Danielsen was killed and reporter Anders Saether was injured.
Saether was expected to be evacuated to Amman for treatment.
	   Danielsen, 33, was single and lived in Bergen, which is 500
kilometers (300 miles) west of Oslo. He had a degree as a TV
director and was an experience traveler, TV2 said.
	   The crew had planned to stay in Iraq for about four days to
produce a feature film.
	   Iraqi officials initially had said that three Norwegian
journalists were in the car.
	   Nearly all visitors to Iraq must take the 12-hour journey
through the desert from Amman to Baghdad.

Two-division championship expected to be approved
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The words ``revolutionary'' and ``radical'' aren't
normally associated with English cricket. Yet those are exactly the
terms being used to describe the sweeping changes in store for the
domestic game.
	   Cricket bosses are poised Thursday to approve the biggest
shakeup in the 109-year history of the English county championship.
	   The 18 clubs are expected to introduce a soccer-style
championship of two divisions, including a three-up and three-down
promotion and relegation system, starting in the year 2000.
	   Last year, the First-Class Forum voted 12-7 against a similar
two-division proposal. But newspaper polls of the teams show there
is wide support for the change this time.
	   Under the proposal, each division will have nine counties, with
three sides promoted and relegated each season. Following in the
footsteps of soccer, the two tiers are likely to be called the
Premier Division and First Division.
	   The top nine teams in next year's championship would form the
top flight division in 2000.
	   An alternative proposal, whereby 18 counties would be split into
six geographical areas of three counties each, appears to have
little backing.
	   The country structure has remained largely the same since 1980.
The only notable change since World War I was the addition of an
18th team, Durham, in 1992.
	   Australia's Sheffield Shield, which has only six teams, has
proved the benefit of having a small, more competitive club
structure.
	   The overhaul of the English county structure is intended to
raise the competitive level of the championship and improve the
English team's performances in international cricket.
	   The vote comes just three days after England's seven-wicket
defeat to Australia in the second Test of the Ashes series. The
result, which came after England was saved from defeat by a
thunderstorm in the first Test, offered further proof that England
is no longer a world power in the sport it invented and is falling
further behind the top nations.
	   ``County cricket's role is to produced the strongest possible
England team and a large part of me feels two divisions will do
that,'' said Kent's Matthew Fleming, chairman of the Cricketers'
Association and an England one-day player. ``It would create time
for training, recovery and preparation. Hopefully, the cricket will
be more competitive and prepare people better for the Test
cauldron.''
	   Former England captain and current Ashes tour manager Graham
Gooch also backed the idea.
	   ``I enjoyed my career in county cricket but we must raise the
standard because it has a direct effect on the standard of our
performances at Test level,'' he said.
	   Paul Sheldon, chief executive of Surrey, said the new structure
would provide a more competitive edge.
	   ``The championship is so poorly supported in terms of
attendances that it should not be a major considerations in terms
of finance for clubs in the lower league,'' he said. ``We have to
accept the reality that the championship is for breeding good
cricketers, not attracting spectators.''
	   Some smaller counties said they want financial and
constitutional safeguards. A television deal struck recently with
Channel 4 and BSkyB, worth 103 million pounds (dlrs 165 million)
over four years, should help appease their concerns.
	   ``The quality of cricket presently is one division is just not
competitive enough,'' said Jim Cumbes, chief executive of
Lancashire and a former fast bowler. ``There is a mood for change
and if you are going to be radical, there isn't much alternative.''

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Star striker Chen Yang scored a hat
trick Wednesday for China in a lackluster 4-1 victory over
Cambodia, securing his country a spot in the second soccer round
for the 13th Asian Games.
	   Underdog Turkmenistan also earned a second-round berth by
overcoming a 2-0 half-time deficit to defeat South Korea in a
nail-biting finish, with two goals coming in the final 10 minutes.
	   The United Arab Emirates and North Korea ended regulation play
and extra time at 3-3, settling their Group E match in the southern
city of Songkhla with a penalty shootout. The Emirates won, 7-4.
	   Playing at the National Stadium on a poor pitch with traces of
day-old repairs visible, host Thailand made a fiery debut against
Hong Kong, shutting out their opponents 5-0 after leading 3-0 at
the half.
	   Thailand's Kritsada Piandit scored the first goal barely a
minute into the match, followed by teammates Worawood Srimaka on a
penalty in the eighth minute and Kiatisuk Senamuang in the 22nd
minute.
	   Eight minutes into the second half, Tawan Sripan kicked in
Thailand's fourth goal, and Kiatisuk hit the target for the second
time at the 40th minute to make the final score 5-0.
	   The result takes Hong Kong out of competition, since they also
lost their Group F opener to Oman on Monday.
	   China fulfilled expectations of topping Group B in Surat Thani
with the victory over Cambodia, the 4-1 scoreline mirroring
Monday's rout of Lebanon. But though the Chinese dominated, they
failed to sparkle.
	   Chen scored early in the first half, heading in a long pass from
midfield. Peng Wang caught a pass on the right side about 10
minutes later and fired his second Asian Games goal.
	   Chen scored again on a near shot and headed in his third goal in
the 38th minute.
	   Cambodia partially salvaged its honor late in the second half
when Hok Sochetra beat the complacent Chinese defense and scored.
It was one of the only shots on goal that the Cambodians had.
	   Following Monday's victory over regional favorite Vietnam,
Turkmenistan staged its second upset in Group A in the central city
of Nakhon Sawan, eclipsing South Korea.
	   The South Koreans carved up the Turkmenistan defense in the
first half. Yong-Soo Choi gave his team _ which hoped to erase
memories of a dismal World Cup _ a commanding two-goal advantage
with an opening-minute goal and a shot that pin-balled off a
teammate into the net in the 44th minute.
	   Turkmenistan regrouped after the half. A long cross found the
head of Igor Kislov to put Turkmenistan on the scoreboard. Steady
pressure led to a dangerous foul and red card for South Korea's
Byoung-Keun Lee.
	   Muslim Agaev took advantage of the reduced South Korean side
with a slicing left-footed shot into the top far corner to
equalize. Kislov fired home the winner in the dying minutes.

Chief of Kosovo Albanian team syays Serbs blocking negotiations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Separatist guerrillas increasingly
agree with Kosovo politicians but Serb officials are stalling talks
on the status of the war-torn province, a top ethnic Albanian
negotiator said Wednesday.
	   The negotiator, Fehmi Agani, welcomed a statement by the Kosovo
Liberation Army that it could agree to something short of full,
immediate independence for Kosovo, which had been its goal.
	   Guerrilla spokesman Adem Demaci made the statement Monday in the
first clear indication the secessionist rebels would accept a
temporary status for Kosovo as a Yugoslav republic. Yugoslavia
consists of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro. Kosovo, with a
majority ethnic Albanian population, is a province of Serbia.
	   ``This is a serious approach to the problem,'' Agani told
reporters in Pristina, Kosovo's capital. ``It was easy to insist on
independence as a final goal but this prevented the process from
moving forward. A decisive time has come when we should present a
united stand.''
	   But Agani accused Serb negotiators of blocking talks on Kosovo's
status and inciting confrontations between the guerrillas and Serb
security forces.
	   Last month, Belgrade authorities rejected a U.S.-sponsored plan
for Kosovo as giving too much independence to the majority
Albanians. Serbian officials called the plan a ``step to full
secession.''
	   Serbia then issued its own plan which would give Kosovo some
autonomy but maintain firm Serb control.
	   Agani Wednesday called the Serbian draft proposal ``catastrophic
and destructive ... since it affirms Serbian rule over Kosovo.''
	   The government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic Tuesday
accused rebels of endangering the shaky peace and blasted
international efforts to include the guerrillas in the peace
process.
	   In a protest letter, the Yugoslav government also accused the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe of ``legalizing
the terrorists.''
	   Agani said the Yugoslav note to the OSCE was a sign of
``nervousness'' and called on the international community to exert
more pressure on Milosevic.
	   ``I don't believe the international community would allow its
peace efforts to fail easily,'' Agani said.
	   Since a U.S.-brokered, Oct. 12 agreement brought a halt to
full-scale fighting in Kosovo, international diplomatic efforts
have focused on finding a political solution for the separatist.
province.
	   Sporadic violence has continued since the agreement and
international officials are worried the fragile peace will collapse
in new fighting if a political settlement isn't reached soon.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and as many as 300,000 fled from
their homes during a nearly eight-month crackdown by Serb forces
against ethnic Albanian separatists.

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Former 5,000-meter world
record-holder David Moorcroft on Wednesday was named chief
executive of UK Athletics, the new governing body of track and
field in Britain.
	   Moorcroft has been been running the organization on an interim
basis following the financial collapse last year of the British
Athletics Federation.
	   Moorcroft's appointment was expected and one of the first acts
of former Olympic hurdles champion David Hemery, who was elected
last month as the new president.
	   One of Moorcroft's long-term challenges will be to lure the
World Championships to London in 2003, with a revamped Wembley
Stadium as the venue.
	   The IAAF, the governing body of world track and field, said last
month it was considering awarding the 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009
worlds at the same time. In no particular order, London, Paris,
Tokyo and Berlin are expected to be the sites.

EU suing France for excessive hunting seasons and failure to
</HEADLINE>
protect birds

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission decided
Wednesday to take France to the European Court for its failure to
comply to EU laws regarding the hunting and protection of wild
birds.
	   ``French legislation fails to guarantee complete protection of
wild bird species during their return to their breeding grounds and
during nesting and rearing,'' the Commission said in a statement
Wednesday, adding France was also not respecting other rules for
four wild bird species.
	   France's hunting seasons for wild birds are too long, according
to the Commission. They start too early, often up to 7 weeks before
young birds become independent of their parents, and they end too
late when migration has already started.
	   For four species of wild birds (three kinds of Gull and the
Cormorant), neither deliberate killing or capture nor destruction
or theft of nests and eggs are legally forbidden as required by EU
law.
	   The Commission warned France more than five months ago that
legal action would go ahead if France did not comply with EU
legislation, but France's answer ``does not reveal any move towards
compliance'' said the statement.

Police begin searching for bodies of family slain in 1989
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Police officers with high-tech equipment began
scanning a huge garbage dump outside the northern city of Parma on
Wednesday in search of the bodies of a family killed in 1989.
	   The eldest son, Ferdinando Carretta, surfaced recently, then
confessed to killing his mother, father and younger brother. His
confession put to rest one of Italy's longest-running
missing-persons mysteries.
	   Carretta, 36, said he shot his family in their apartment in
Parma, then buried the bodies on the banks of a river outside the
city.
	   The area is now a huge garbage dump, which complicates the
search, and police technicians were using instruments designed to
find buried organic material.
	   Police were also searching for the murder weapon; Carretta has
said he threw it in a canal.
	   The Carretta family was last seen on the night of Aug. 4, 1989,
getting ready to leave on vacation in their camper. The abandoned
camper was found months later, but there was no sign of the family.
	   Carretta turned up in London when police stopped him for a
routine traffic violation. Shortly afterward, he confessed
on-camera to an Italian TV program on missing persons and returned
voluntarily to Italy on Sunday, where he was arrested on charges of
triple homicide.
	   Police say Carretta has shown them the general area where he
buried the bodies.

 &UR; Hat trick for China's Chen; South Korea beaten; Emirates win
shootout

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Star striker Chen Yang scored a hat
trick Wednesday for China in a lackluster 4-1 victory over
Cambodia, securing his country a spot in the second soccer round
for the 13th Asian Games.
	   Underdog Turkmenistan also earned a second-round berth by
overcoming a 2-0 half-time deficit to defeat South Korea in a
nail-biting finish, with two goals coming in the final 10 minutes.
	   The United Arab Emirates and North Korea ended regulation play
and extra time at 3-3, settling their Group E match in the southern
city of Songkhla with a penalty shootout. The Emirates won, 7-4.
	   Playing at the National Stadium on a poor pitch with traces of
day-old repairs visible, host Thailand made a fiery debut against
Hong Kong, shutting out their opponents 5-0 after leading 3-0 at
the half.
	   Thailand's Kritsada Piandit scored the first goal barely a
minute into the match, followed by teammates Worawood Srimaka on a
penalty in the eighth minute and Kiatisuk Senamuang in the 22nd
minute.
	   Eight minutes into the second half, Tawan Sripan kicked in
Thailand's fourth goal, and Kiatisuk hit the target for the second
time at the 40th minute to make the final score 5-0.
	   The result takes Hong Kong out of competition, since they also
lost their Group F opener to Oman on Monday.
	   China fulfilled expectations of topping Group B in Surat Thani
with the victory over Cambodia, the 4-1 scoreline mirroring
Monday's rout of Lebanon. But though the Chinese dominated, they
failed to sparkle.
	   Chen scored early in the first half, heading in a long pass from
midfield. Peng Wang caught a pass on the right side about 10
minutes later and fired his second Asian Games goal.
	   Chen scored again on a near shot and headed in his third goal in
the 38th minute.
	   Cambodia partially salvaged its honor late in the second half
when Hok Sochetra beat the complacent Chinese defense and scored.
It was one of the only shots on goal that the Cambodians had.
	   Following Monday's victory over regional favorite Vietnam,
Turkmenistan staged its second upset in Group A in the central city
of Nakhon Sawan, eclipsing South Korea.
	   The South Koreans carved up the Turkmenistan defense in the
first half. Yong-Soo Choi gave his team _ which hoped to erase
memories of a dismal World Cup _ a commanding two-goal advantage
with an opening-minute goal and a shot that pin-balled off a
teammate into the net in the 44th minute.
	   Turkmenistan regrouped after the half. A long cross found the
head of Igor Kislov to put Turkmenistan on the scoreboard. Steady
pressure led to a dangerous foul and red card for South Korea's
Byoung-Keun Lee.
	   Muslim Agaev took advantage of the reduced South Korean side
with a slicing left-footed shot into the top far corner to
equalize. Kislov fired home the winner in the dying minutes.

Nuremberg coach Reimann quits, citing wife's health
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) _ Willi Reimann resigned Wednesday as
coach of the struggling Bundesliga club Nuremberg, saying he wanted
to devote more time to caring for his ill wife.
	   The resignation came as a surprise, although the coach had come
under fire since the club has gone six Bundesliga games without a
win.
	   ``My wife is seriously ill and she needs my care,'' Reimann
said.
	   Reimann, 48, was fired from Wolfsburg last season and took over
at Nuremberg shortly before the season. Nuremberg, with a long
Bundesliga tradition, gained promotion this season.
	   ``We have to accept his decision. It's especially tragic,
because his wife is ill,'' Nuremberg president Michael Roth said.
	   Assistant coach Thomas Brunner will take over as head coach for
the time being.

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Former 5,000-meter world
record-holder David Moorcroft on Wednesday was named chief
executive of UK Athletics, the new governing body of track and
field in Britain.
	   Moorcroft, 45, has been been running the organization on an
interim basis following the financial collapse last year of the
British Athletics Federation.
	   Moorcroft's appointment was expected and one of the first acts
of former Olympic hurdles champion David Hemery, who was elected
last month as the new president.
	   ``The last 15 months have seen great turbulence within the
sport, but in the course of our year-long consultation... we have
hopefully reached a point where we have solid foundations,''
Moorcroft said.
	   One of Moorcroft's long-term challenges will be to lure the
World Championships to London in 2003, with a revamped Wembley
Stadium as the venue.
	   The IAAF, the governing body of world track and field, said last
month it was considering awarding the 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009
worlds at the same time. In no particular order, London, Paris,
Tokyo and Berlin are expected to be the sites.

Israeli, Palestinians clash near West Bank settlement

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Dozens of Palestinians ambushed an
Israeli car on Wednesday, smashing its windshields with stones,
then pulling an Israeli soldier out of it and kicking and beating
him.
	   The attack prompted Israeli police to fire pistols into the
crowd while Israeli soldiers opened up with a barrage of
rubber-coated metal bullets and tear gas. Eleven Palestinians were
injured by rubber bullets.
	   And in Jerusalem, a 41-year-old Palestinian street cleaner was
stabbed to death Wednesday in a mixed Jerusalem neighborhood.
Police said they suspected the attack on Osama Musa Natche was
carried out by an Israeli extremist.
	   There are fears that the escalating tensions between Israelis
and Palestinians could result in a new round of violence before
U.S. President Bill Clinton's planned trip to Israel.
	   The clash in Ramallah began when 150 students from Bir Zeit
University marched in the West Bank city to protest Israel's
refusal to release a large number of Palestinian prisoners jailed
for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The demonstrators, most of them followers of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction, then walked to the outskirts of
Ramallah, and began stoning Israeli cars at a traffic circle near
the Jewish settlement of Beit El.
	   At one point, a white car with Israeli license plates
approached. The vehicle was driven by a man wearing a skullcap, and
a soldier was in the passenger seat.
	   To shouts of ``Yahudi! Yahudi!'' _ the Arabic word for Jew _
about two dozen Palestinians began pelting the car with stones and
smashing its windows. The driver stopped the car and ran away after
a large rock struck him in the face. The attackers then converged
on the soldier, attacked him and seized his M-16 assault rifle.
	   The soldier held his hands up to fend off blows as several
Palestinians struck his head with rocks. After a minute of
relentless attack, the soldier got up and ran, bleeding from the
head.
	   After he escaped, his assailants doused the car with kerosene
and set it on fire.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan,
held the Palestinian Authority responsible, saying it had incited
residents to violence over the prisoners' issue.
	   Bar-Illan also said the attack was ``a gross and dangerous''
violation of the Wye River land-for-security agreement negotiated
in October with the help of President Clinton.
	   Hassan Asfour, a Palestinian peace negotiator, would not comment
on the attack until he heard more about it.
	   Earlier this week, Netanyahu complained in a letter to Clinton
that the Palestinians have repeatedly violated the peace agreement.
He asked Clinton to use his influence to halt the violations.
	   Bar-Illan said the sending of the letter indicates ``there is a
danger to the peace process if the violations continue.'' But he
said that, as of now, the Clinton visit was still on.
	   In the letter, Bar-Illan said, Netanyahu objected to recent
statements, including one by Arafat, that a Palestinian state would
be declared on May 4, 1999.
	   The daily Maariv newspaper said Netanyahu asked Clinton to
publicly distance himself from Arafat's statements and persuade the
Palestinian leader to withdraw them.
	   The Wye accord urges both Israel and the Palestinians to refrain
from unilateral steps that would prejudge the outcome of talks on a
permanent peace accord.
	   The Palestinians have also lodged a series of complaints about
Israeli violations. Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, said Wednesday
that Israel's plans to construct more than a dozen access roads for
Jewish settlements in the West Bank was not approved at the Wye
River summit.
	   Israel's Cabinet authorized the road projects to improve
security for Jewish communities that will become isolated as a
result of Israel's promised withdrawal from 13 percent of the West
Bank. Thousands of acres (hectares) of Palestinian land are being
expropriated for the roads.
	   ``I want to make it very clear that there is no such agreement
because no rational Palestinian would agree to the confiscation of
land for roads,'' Abbas told the Voice of Palestine radio.

Parliament committee agrees to cut subsidies to racist parties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, details, ADDS byline
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A parliamentary committee unanimously
agreed Wednesday on a bill to cut subsidies to racist parties,
following weeks of haggling over public funding for the extreme
right Vlaams Blok party.
	   The Vlaams Blok and Dutch-speaking conservatives stayed away
from the vote in protest, allowing the bill to proceed without
opposition. The bill is expected to be passed by the full House of
Representatives on Dec. 10 and later by the Senate with the backing
of eight of the ten parties.
	   Under the proposal passed Wednesday, Belgium's highest
administrative court, the Council of State, would have authority to
judge if parties are racist. A party could appeal the decision.
	   The bill has become a hot issue with elections approaching next
June. Polls indicate the Vlaams Blok could further erode the
electoral base of the traditional parties.
	   The Vlaams Blok has made major advances in Dutch-speaking
regions, winning 12.2 percent of the Flemish vote in 1995 with an
anti-immigrant, Flemish nationalist program. The anti-racism move
originated among the French-speaking parties and also rose
linguistic tension in the legislature.
	   But many fear the drawn-out public battles over the issue, may
have given the Vlaams Blok more publicity that the party could have
paid for.
	   ``We have to prepare much better for things like this. We have
to make clear which way we want to go,'' said Louis Van Velthoven,
the parliamentary leader of the ruling Dutch-speaking Socialists.
	   The Christian Democrats of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene also
want to move on. ``Now we have to prove we also care about the real
issues facing the people,'' said the party's parliamentary leader
Paul Tant.
	   The Vlaams Blok said it would not get a fair hearing if the bill
is passed. The Dutch-speaking Conservatives objected on legal
grounds.
	   ``It's hysteria and that has always proved to be a bad
advisor,'' said Conservative leader Patrick Dewael. ``The parties
started their electoral campaign with this.''
	   Under Belgian law, political parties are restricted from seeking
private funding and instead receive cash handouts from the state
based on their election results.
	   This year, the Vlaams Blok receives 52 million francs (dlrs 1.53
million). In comparison, Prime Minister's Jean-Luc Dehaene's
Dutch-speaking Christian Democrat party is the top recipient with
108 million francs (dlrs 3.18 million).

Judge: Elephants were neglected in case that sparked international
</HEADLINE>
outcry &QL; 
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRITS, South Africa (AP) _ In a case that has sparked protests
overseas, a judge ruled Wednesday that 30 young elephants were
cruelly treated and awarded temporary custody to the National
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
	   ``This has become of public interest and is not private interest
anymore,'' Judge Herman Glas said in ruling in the case of the
elephants. They were snatched from their families from a game
reserve in Botswana and were destined to be sold to zoos in Europe
and to a safari park in China.
	   Glas said the animals had been neglected under their owner,
Riccardo Ghiazza, who runs African Game Services.
	   The NSPCA said the elephants had been abused by Ghiazza's
trainers, who hobbled them, deprived them of water and prodded them
so often it caused open sores.
	   ``I am persuaded that with more care (injuries) could have been
prevented,'' Glas said. ``These elephants have been neglected.''
	   In October, animal-rights activists dumped coal in front of the
South African Embassy in Washington to protest the treatment of the
animals. A protest was also held at the country's embassy in
London.
	   Britain's Spice Girls pop group and rocker Chrissie Hynde have
appealed to South African President Nelson Mandela to prevail on
his Botswana counterpart, Festus Mogae, to help the elephants
return to their families.
	   Final custody will be decided later. Crminal charges of cruelty
may yet be lodged against Ghiazza, whose lawyer had maintained that
the treatment of the elephants was valid under South African law.
	   ``It's not the aim to raise the animals to the level of human
rights,'' attorney Nic van der Walt had told the judge.

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ Qatar began its privatization program
Wednesday by offering for sale 45 percent of the shares of Qatar
Telecommunications Co..
	   Nationals of the six Arab states of the Gulf can buy a minimum
10,000 shares, at 60 riyals (dlrs 16.5) each, the Gulf Investment
Corps said in a statement.
	   The issue managers said investors could buy shares until Dec. 14
at banks in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and the
United Arab Emirates.
	   The Qatari government will retain 55 percent of Q-Tel's 100
million shares, the statement said.
	   Officials at Qatar's stock market said Q-Tel's shares would be
listed by February.
	   The Q-Tel sale is the first step in the government's
privatization scheme. Qatar's economy, like those of the other Gulf
states, has been badly hit by low oil prices.
	   ____
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ The government has decided to tighten its
budget for fiscal 1999-2000 by cutting expenditure on construction
and development by 50 million dinars (dlrs 133 million), local
English and Arabic-langauge newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   A total of 260 million dinars (dlrs 690 million) has been
earmarked for such projects, compared with some 310 million dinars
(dlrs 822 million) allocated during the 1997-1998 budget, the Gulf
Daily News and other newspapers said.
	   Bahrain's government works on a two-year budget.
	   Finance and National Economy Minister Ibrahim Abdul-Karim was
quoted as saying the new budget came at a ``very difficult time ...
due to the drop in oil prices in the international markets, which
has resulted in a drop in our oil revenue,''.
	   Bahrain, like the other Gulf states, receives most of its income
from oil.
	   The forecast expenditure for 1999-2000 was 1.45 billion dinars
(dlrs 3.8 billion), the finance minister said. He did not provide
the expected revenue and deficit.
	   The money allocated for construction and development will be
spent on electricity and water projects, road and sewerage
networks, the port and airport, bridges, schools and health
services, he said.
	   The minister said the government was going to squeeze capital
expenditure in order to provide a ``good quality of life'' for
Bahrainis in terms of free health, education and social services.
	   ____
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The Emirates pledged dlrs
50 million worth of aid to the Palestinians at the recent donors
conference in Washington, the official Emirates News Agency
reported Wednesday.
	   Foreign Minister Rashid Abdullah, who has just returned from the
conference, urged Arab countries to donate more money to the
Palestinians to help keep the peace process on track, the agency
reported.
	   ``The United States, and in particular President Bill Clinton,
are making big efforts in that regard. It is up to us as Arabs to
do the same to strengthen this process,'' Abdullah was quoted as
saying.
	   He said the Emirates had fulfilled the pledge it made of dlrs 25
million at the last donor conference five years ago.
	   During Monday's meeting at the U.S. State Department, 43 nations
pledged dlrs 3 billion to help alleviate Palestinian poverty and
develop their economy.
	   ____
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The first shipment of food under the
U.N.-approved oil-for-food program to pass through the Syrian port
of Tartous has arrived in Iraq, the Trade Ministry announced.
	   The announcement, carried late Tuesday by the official Iraqi
News Agency, said some 10,000 tons of food were transported by
Iraqi trucks from Syria.
	   ``More trucks will continue delivering goods to Iraq'' from
Syria, the agency quoted Mohammed Saber al-Mousawi of Iraq's Public
Land Transport Co. as saying.
	   A U.N. official told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the
shipment involved sugar and was the first delivery of a 25,000-ton
contract negotiated with France.
	   Tartous was approved last June as the fourth entry point for
food and medicine under the oil-for-food program. Other goods come
via Jordan, Turkey and the Iraqi port of Umm Kasr.
	   The program is an exception from U.N. trade sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. It allows Iraq to sell
limited quantities of oil to buy necessities for its 22 million
people.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Kuwait Cement Co. expects to double its
profits and make 5 million dinars (dlrs 16.55 million) this year,
the daily newspaper Al-Anba reported Wednesday.
	   The newspaper quoted the managing director of the company,
Rashed al-Rashed, as saying it has already posted some 4 million
dinars (dlrs 13.24 million) in operational profits in the first
three quarters of the year. Al-Rashed did not elaborate.
	   The company's general assembly has recently approved a 20
percent raise in capital to 39.05 million dinars (dlrs 129.30
million), the newspaper said. The funds will be used to partially
finance a new plant costing 142 million dinar (dlrs 470.19
million).
	   Kuwait Cement Co. is partly state-owned. It is listed on the
Kuwait Stock Exchange.
	   ____
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ EgyptAir has expanded its freight division
to be able to transport more than 100 tons of goods a day, its
chairman was quoted as saying Wednesday.
	   Mohammed Fahim Rayan also said that the company has increased
its fleet of passenger planes to 38. They fly to some 85 airports
abroad and 10 in Egypt.
	   The company plans to buy passenger aircraft, he told the
Egyptian Gazette.
	   It also plans to open new routes to Chicago, Montreal, Hong
Kong, Beijing, Warsaw and Prague, Rayan said.

Paul Grayson to miss South Africa clash, Springboks hope to have
</HEADLINE>
Dalton fit &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Recasts, ADDS South African team

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ James Dalton is hopeful of playing in an unchanged
South African team against England on Saturday as the Springboks
bid to make it a world record 18 wins in a row.
	   The experienced hooker limped out of the record-tying victory
over Ireland with a hamstring problem on Saturday, when South
Africa triumphed 27-13 to match New Zealand's total of 17 wins in a
row, set between 1965-69.
	   ``I will be guided by medical advice on James Dalton,'' said
Springboks coach Nick Mallett, whose team was last beaten in August
last year by New Zealand. ``At the moment, he looks like being fit,
but if he is not 100 percent then he won't play.
	   ''Keeping an unchanged team is one of the big reasons for our
success.''
	   England stand-off Paul Grayson has failed to recover from a knee
injury and will miss Saturday's match before 75,000 fans at
Twickenham.
	   Grayson, who limped off during last weekend's 12-11 defeat to
Australia, will be replaced by Mike Catt.
	   But England coach Clive Woodward said Wednesday that Catt will
not assume Grayson's goal-kicking duties. Catt failed to convert
the only try against Australia, allowing the Wallabies to pull out
a late victory.
	   Instead, Matt Dawson will do the goal-kicking Saturday.
	   Nick Beal comes in at fullback for Matt Perry, who suffered a
concussion against the Wallabies and will be sidelined for three
weeks.
	   Woodward also brought in Dan Luger at the expense of out-of-form
Austin Healey.
	   Will Greenwood, like Grayson, has not recovered from a recent
groin injury and is out. That means Phil de Glanville will continue
in the center.
	   Lineups:
	   South Africa _ Nick Beal (Northampton), Tony Underwood
(Newcastle), Phil de Glanville (Bath), Jeremy Guscott (Bath), Dan
Luger (Harlequins), Mike Catt (Bath), Matt Dawson (Northampton),
Jason Leonard (Harlequins), Richard Cockerill (Leicester), Darren
Garforth (Leicester), Martin Johnson (Leicester), Tim Rodber
(Northampton), Lawrence Dallaglio (Wasps, captain), Neil Black
(Leicester), Richard Hill (Saracens)
	   Replacements: David Rees (Manchester Sale), Alex King (Wasps),
Austin Healey (Leicester), Martin Corry (Leicester), Danny Grewcock
(Saracens), Graham Rowntree (Leicester), Phil Greening (Manchester
Sale).
	   South Africa _ Percy Montgomery; Stefan Terblanche, Andre
Snyman, Christian Stewart, Pieter Rossouw; Henry Honiball, Joost
van der Westhuizen; Adrian Garvey, James Dalton, Robbie Kempson,
Mark Andrews, Krynauw Otto, Gary Teichmann (captain), Bobby
Skinstad, Johan Erasmus.

Ukraine's parliament debates 1999 budget draft
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Wednesday began
debating the 1999 budget draft amid the government's warnings that
most of the fiscal targets set by lawmakers would be impossible to
meet.
	   The document, prepared by parliament's budget committee,
provided for a zero deficit and sharply raised the federal
government's projected revenues and expenditures to nearly 50
percent more than the Cabinet had proposed.
	   The revenues and expenditures were set at 35.1 billion hryvna
(dlrs 10.2 billion).
	   ``Ukraine can produce a financial sensation by approving a
deficit-free budget,'' parliament's budget committee chief Julia
Tymoshenko told lawmakers.
	   Deputies are to continue debating the 1999 budget Thursday, with
the vote on its first reading expected this week.
	   However, Cabinet officials already have objected to the proposed
document, an amended version of the budget draft the government had
submitted, and said its primary figures had to be revised.
	   ``The proposed revenues and expenditures are not realistic, and
we have doubts the economy would be able to live with (a budget
like this),'' Finance Minister Ihor Mitiukov said.
	   The government originally planned to raise 23.1 billion hryvna
(dlrs 6.74 billion) in budget revenues next year, allowing a
deficit of no more than 700 million hryvna (dlrs 204 million) or
0.6 percent of projected gross domestic product.
	   The figures were calculated to reflect the beleaguered state of
government finances.
	   Budget revenues in the first nine months of 1998 were just 50.8
percent of the annual target, while companies' tax debt skyrocketed
to 9.2 billion hryvna (dlrs 2.68 billion) as of Nov. 1, according
to Cabinet figures.
	   The government also forecast that the economy, which showed
signs of growth in the first half of 1998, would shrink again by
1.5 percent in 1998 largely because of the economic crisis in
neighboring Russia, Ukraine's main trade partner.
	   But lawmakers who had examined the Cabinet's draft for two weeks
before Wednesday's debate said the government overlooked many
opportunities for raising extra revenues.
	   Tymoshenko said extra money could be raised by taxing commercial
banks, raising rent for the land used for oil and gas extraction,
and pushing enterprises to repay loans received under government
guarantees.
	   She said revenues could also come from more unorthodox sources,
such as payment for using Ukraine's air space.
	   Tymoshenko said these and other suggestions the lawmakers came
up with would allow the government to pay off many of its debts,
including billions of dollars worth of overdue wages, pensions and
other social payments.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A NATO force on Wednesday arrested a
Bosnian Serb general indicted in the 1995 massacre of Muslims at
Srebrenica and prepared to send him for trial before an
international war crimes tribunal.
	   The NATO-led international Stabilization Force in Bosnia
arrested Gen. Radislav Krstic, who was indicted by the
International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
	   While the indictment was sealed, the Bosnian Serb general was
charged in the July 1995 massacre of Muslims after rebel Serbs took
over the U.N. safe haven of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia.
	   Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour called Krstic ``a very
significant military leader.''
	   She said she was delighted at the arrest of Krstic, who was
still believed to be serving in the Bosnian Serb Army.
	   He is the ninth war crimes suspect arrested in the former
Yugoslavia by international forces.
	   ``Persons indicted for war crimes who are still at large should
realize they, too will be brought to justice,'' said NATO
Secretary-General Javier.
	   Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime
military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic have been indicted for genocide
for allegedly masterminding the massacre at Serbrenica.
	   Neither is in custody.

UEFA suspends Parlour, Dixon after Champions League clash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Arsenal's Ray Parlour and Lee Dixon
have been suspended for at least one European match following
incidents during their club's defeat by Lens last week, UEFA said
Wednesday.
	   UEFA's control and disciplinary body also suspended Lens' Tony
Vairelles for one match for ``unsporting behavior.'' The French
champion's 1-0 win at Wembley put Arsenal out of the Champions
League.
	   Arsenal midfielder Parlour was sent off in the final minute for
striking out at Cyril Rool. He was followed a minute later by
Vairelles for a foul challenge on Dixon.
	   Dixon's suspension was imposed for ``an elbow-strike in the back
of an opponent,'' UEFA said.
	   Although Dixon was not booked by referee Anders Frisk, UEFA
ruled he started the trouble by elbowing Vairelles in the back.
	   Vairelles and Lens coach Daniel Leclercq accused Dixon of
feigning injury to get the French international striker sent off,
which came just seconds after Parlour was given his red card for
going after Rool.
	   The disciplinary body will take a final decision in January on
the length of the Arsenal players' suspensions.
	   Rool and Lens defender Eric Sikora each received one-match
suspensions after receiving the season's second booking.

Italy's Autogrill negotiating for restaurants in 13 French train

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The Italian highway and fast food company
Autogrill said Wednesday it is negotiating with the French national
railway system, SNCF, for the concessions to restaurants at 13
French train stations.
	   ``We are in talks with SNCF and hopefully they will be concluded
positively by year-end,'' said Paolo Prota Giurleo, the managing
director of Autogrill.
	   He Giurleo told a news conference that other bidders had dropped
out and ``now we are alone at the table with SNCF.''
	   The daily newspaper Milano Finanza said Wednesday that Autogrill
would pay around 97 billion lire (dlrs 59 million) for the
concessions.
	   SNCF, through Frantour, has the concessions for 13 restaurants
in French railway stations.

Russian prime minister lobbies IMF chief for more loans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with talks ending, no agreement
announced, more Primakov comment. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian leaders met today with the head of the
International Monetary Fund, who gave no sign he was prepared to
release the frozen loans the country so badly needs.
	   Michel Camdessus met for a second day with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov and praised Russia's ``pragmatic'' course in
dealing with the country's economic crisis. But he said an IMF team
would have to return to Russia next month for further negotiations
on the loan installments.
	   ``We are hoping 1999 will be excellent for cooperation between
Russia and the IMF,'' Camdessus said.
	   The stakes are high: Russia owes billions of dollars to workers,
pensioners and foreign creditors and wants the IMF to provide new
installments on a $22.6 billion bailout package. The loans were
negotiated this summer, but have been on hold since the latest
economic crisis hit in August.
	   The IMF has been demanding a realistic recovery plan from the
Russian government and has so far been unimpressed with Moscow's
efforts. Primakov sought to lower expectations even before today's
talks began.
	   ``Don't measure the significance of Camdessus' visit by how much
money he brought,'' Primakov said. ``He has come with an attache
case containing documents, not cash. You shouldn't think that the
question of giving money to Russia will be solved now.''
	   Speaking to reporters after the talks, the Russian prime
minister said Russia expected advice, not money, from Camdessus.
	   ``We haven't considered specific credits, the size and timing of
their release,'' Primakov said. ``It was important for us that the
fund chief come to Moscow and analyze and assess the situation.''
	   The IMF put the loan installments on hold after Russia's
government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in
August. Primakov's government has moved cautiously, refraining from
any radical measures and hoping the IMF and other lenders will
offer help.
	   The government delayed a debate this week on next year's budget
as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet
expenses.
	   While the Cabinet insisted the delay was not connected with
Camdessus' visit, Russian media have suggested the government put
off action on the budget because it still holds out hope for
receiving IMF money. The latest budget draft assumes Russia will
receive the IMF loan.
	   If the Russian government doesn't receive foreign help soon, it
will be forced to start printing money, which would drive up
inflation and further imperil Russia's fragile economy, Primakov
and other officials have warned.
	   An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's
revenue forecast for next year was overly optimistic. It also
disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes, offer
subsidies to ailing industries and increase state regulation of the
economy.
	   Primakov played down the differences today, saying he and
Camdessus agreed some state intervention in the economy may be
positive, provided it doesn't prevent the development of a
free-market.
	   ``We will find a common approach, probably not immediately, but
we will,'' Primakov said.
	   Russia has so far received only about $5 billion of the bailout
package, which also involves the World Bank and the Japanese
government.
	   Meanwhile, Central Bank chairman Viktor Geraschenko outlined the
country's economic woes in an address today to parliament's upper
house, the Federation Council.
	   Russia's economy has shrunk 5 percent to 6 percent compared to a
year ago and inflation is up an estimated 70 percent compared to
last December, he said. The government hopes to limit inflation to
30 percent next year, he said.

Vatican praises Cuba's declaration of Christmas holiday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Vatican voiced satisfaction Wednesday
that Cuba has decided to make Christmas a permanent holiday and
said the move will certainly be welcomed by the international
community.
	   The government granted a Christmas holiday last year as a
one-time favor to Pope John Paul II, who visited in January.
	   John Paul asked that it be a regular holiday on the Cuban
calendar, but until now the government balked at declaring the
measure permanent.
	   The Communist Party made the recommendation Tuesday that ``from
this year on'' Dec. 25 should be a holiday in Cuba, formally
re-establishing a custom abolished in 1969. The proposal is sure to
be adopted by the Communist country's government.
	   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the announcement
was received ``with satisfaction'' and that the move ``responds to
a precise desire of the pope and the Cuban church and I believe
will not go unobserved by the international community.''

Indian elections spark political disarray
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DONNA BRYSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ With foes and allies of India's
governing Hindu nationalist party seizing on its weakness following
an election setback, the country seemed headed for another period
of political disarray.
	   Local newspapers reported Wednesday that several key bills,
including those bearing on economic policy, may not be introduced
in this legislative session because the Bharatiya Janata Party-led
government fears it no longer has the support to make them law.
	   ``The BJP seems to have forgotten that it was given a mandate to
govern,'' said an editorial Wednesday in The Times of India, a
leading English-language daily.
	   The government appeared indecisive at best on Tuesday, when
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Madan Lal Khurana told reporters
that long-awaited legislation to open India's insurance industry to
foreign investment was unlikely to see a parliamentary vote this
year.
	   After Finance Minister Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha
contradicted him in comments before an international economic
forum, Khurana called a news conference to say the insurance bill
remained a priority.
	   That day of conflicting signals followed an opening day of
parliament during which little business was conducted as opposition
parties shouted that the BJP government should step down after
major losses in three state elections last week.
	   The parliament session so far has been ``an utter waste of
money,'' said Veena Nayyar of the independent Women's Political
Watch. ``It shows lack of concern for the issues that concern the
people. ... It's just business as usual.''
	   Although the state elections had no direct effect on the federal
government, the BJP's losses were seen as evidence of voter
discontent with the BJP's eight months of federal rule, which have
been marked by rising consumer prices and uncertainty in foreign
relations sparked by tit-for-tat nuclear weapons tests by India and
rival Pakistan.
	   The BJP has also been criticized for diverting its energies to
ideological issues, such as demanding that public schools offer
spiritual education.
	   In national elections in March, voters were believed to have
been drawn to BJP promises it would build a stable and effective
government after years of political uncertainty under coalition
governments accused of spending more time fighting among themselves
than making policy.
	   The BJP won the most votes in March elections, but not enough to
govern without partners _ 18 of them. The current coalition is
proving as fractious as previous groupings, worrying business
leaders.
	   Experts gathered in New Delhi this week for an economic summit
organized by the World Economic Forum wondered if India wasn't
backsliding to the early 1990s, when it was just beginning reforms
meant to clear away red tape, welcoming foreign entrepreneurs and
helping homegrown business prosper.
	   India's economic growth faltered to 5 percent in the fiscal year
1997-98, the lowest rate in the last five years.

South Korea's Samsung may give up car business in swap deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Samsung Group, South Korea's largest
conglomerate, has neared agreement on swapping its car
manufacturing company for a subsidiary owned by another major
industrial group, a senior presidential aide said Wednesday.
	   Kang Bong-kyun, chief economic aide to President Kim Dae-jung,
said the deal would cap months of government efforts to persuade
South Korea's bloated, debt-ridden conglomerates to swap or merge
some of their overlapping subsidiaries.
	   Kang refused to divulge details on the talks. But local news
media, quoting unidentified government officials, reported Samsung
would hand over Samsung Motors Co. to the Daewoo group, which would
in return give up its Daewoo Electronics Co. unit to Samsung.
	   ``There has been progress made in the talks, and Samsung is
moving towards giving up its car business,'' Kang said.
	   Officials at Daewoo and Samsung refused to comment on Kang's
remarks.
	   President Kim has insisted the country must complete a broad
restructuring of its industrial conglomerates by the end of the
year to restore international investors' confidence in the South
Korean economy.
	   He has even threatened to withhold loans from state-controlled
banks to force the groups streamline their operations. A typical
South Korean conglomerate has 40 to 50 cross-funded subsidiaries.
	   The International Monetary Fund demanded a reorganization of the
conglomerates when it granted South Korea a record dlrs 58 billion
bailout last December.
	   Mostly family-run enterprises known as ``chaebol,'' South
Korea's conglomerates have been accused of overexpanding and
overdiversifying during the country's boom years, sowing the seeds
for its current financial crisis.
	   At least eight of them collapsed under heavy debt loads last
year, saddling banks with billions of dollars in bad loans.
	   Kim plans to meet with heads of the country's leading industrial
groups next week, and the government expects the conglomerates to
present their restructuring plans by then, Kang said.
	   In a separate shakeup deal, Hyundai and LG were discussing
details of merging their computer chip-making subsidiaries _
Hyundai Electronics and LG Semicon. Combined, Hyundai and LG supply
18 percent of the world's computer memory chips.
	   The nation's top five conglomerates _ Samsung, Hyundai, Daewoo,
LG and SK _ also have been discussing mergers in their aerospace,
train manufacturing, power plant and oil refinery subsidiaries.
	   Despite fears of a production glut, Samsung entered the car
business four years ago by striking a technological tie-up with
Japan's Nissan Motors Co. Its first passenger cars rolled off the
assembly lines in February.
	   But doubts about the viability of the car venture have spread as
Samsung's cash cow subsidiary, Samsung Electronics Co., has
suffered from a slump in global semiconductor prices.
	   As a result, Samsung Motors depends heavily on loans, and its
debts were estimated at dlrs 1.9 billion last year, or three times
its equity value.
	   The swap would leave South Korea with two major car makers _
Daewoo Motors and Hyundai Motors. Earlier this year, Hyundai took
over Kia Motors Corp., which collapsed last July and helped trigger
South Korea's economic crisis.
	   With sales of dlrs 2.7 billion last year, Daewoo Electronics is
South Korea's No. 2 home appliance maker after Samsung Electronics.
	   It runs 28 assembly plants in England, Poland, France, Mexico
and other countries. Its debt totaled dlrs 2.3 billion last year,
or four times its equity value.
	   The deal would leave South Korea with two major home appliance
makers: Samsung and LG, formerly known as Gold Star. Their cheap TV
sets, micro ovens and refrigerators flood the lower end of the
world's home appliance market.

German President goes to Scotland; newspapers turn on finance
</HEADLINE>
minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ German President Roman Herzog laid a
wreath Wednesday at the Scottish National War Memorial, underlining
close ties between former enemies.
	   But British tabloid newspapers blazoned anti-German headlines
because of a dispute over pressure by Germany's new finance
minister, Oskar Lafontaine, to harmonize taxes across the European
Union.
	   Herzog, accompanied by Prince Charles on the second day of a
state visit, laid the wreath at the memorial at Edinburgh Castle,
signed the visitors book and looked at the panoramic view of the
Scottish capital from the castle battlements.
	   In St. Giles Cathedral, the prince and president heard a
performance of the Windbach Boys Choir from Germany, and toured the
new National Museum of Scotland _ arriving in a limousine with the
German flag flying.
	   In contrast, newspapers turned on Lafontaine, accusing him of
authoritarian behavior by urging at an EU meeting in Brussels on
Monday that no member state should be able to veto tax
harmonization.
	   British tax rates are generally lower than those in the rest of
the EU, and the issue of harmonization is potentially Britain's
most serious dispute with its European partners since Prime
Minister Tony Blair's 19-month-old government came to power.
	   The Mirror announced: ``Achtung Oskar! We like Europe, we think
we will like the euro, we're even growing to like the Germans ...
but your big mouth is getting very, very irritating.''
	   ``Listen very carefully, Herr Lafontaine...,'' warned the mass
circulation Sun on Page One. ``That's the last straw. This time you
have gone too far.''
	   The Guardian, a liberal, pro-European daily, carried the
headline: ``Europe: the showdown,'' and the pro-Conservative Daily
Telegraph said the Germans set an ``ambush'' for Britain.
	   Germany and France are pressing for tax harmonization because a
single currency, the euro, will be adopted in January by 11 of the
15 EU countries. Britain says it will decide early next century on
whether to join the euro.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A NATO force on Wednesday arrested a
Bosnian Serb general indicted in the 1995 massacre of Muslims at
Srebrenica and prepared to send him for trial before an
international war crimes tribunal.
	   The NATO-led international Stabilization Force in Bosnia
arrested Gen. Radislav Krstic, who was indicted by the
International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.
	   While the indictment was sealed, the Bosnian Serb general was
charged in the July 1995 massacre of Muslims after rebel Serbs took
over the U.N. safe haven of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia.
	   Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour called Krstic ``a very
significant military leader.''
	   She said she was delighted at the arrest of Krstic, who was
still believed to be serving in the Bosnian Serb Army.
	   He is the ninth war crimes suspect arrested in the former
Yugoslavia by international forces.
	   ``Persons indicted for war crimes who are still at large should
realize they, too will be brought to justice,'' said NATO
Secretary-General Javier.
	   Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime
military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic have been indicted for genocide
for allegedly masterminding the massacre at Srebrenica.
	   Neither is in custody.

Duma seeks medical report on Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with parliament demanding official report
on Yeltsin's health, trims previous. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin's foes in the Russian parliament
demanded to unveil his medical records and study them as a possible
reason for his ouster, while the president remained in a hospital
with pneumonia on Wednesday.
	   Though non-binding, the move has increased the pressure on the
president, whose frequent illnesses have eroded his authority and
raised concern about his ability to serve through the end of his
term in mid-2000, and to lead his country out of its worst economic
crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The Communist-initiated statement, which was passed by the
parliament's lower house, the State Duma, by a 247-33 vote, urges
the presidential doctors to submit a report on Yeltsin's health
within 10 days.
	   ``The absence of trustworthy information on the president's
health has spurred abundant rumors, allegations and even guesswork
diagnosis, such as Parkinson or Alzheimer's disease,'' it said.
``That stirs the public and causes doubts about the president's
ability to exercise his duties.''
	   The Duma also decided to prepare an appeal to the Constitutional
Court, asking it to explain the meaning of a legal provision about
terminating the president's powers due to ``lasting inability to
exercise his duties.'' The constitutional provision doesn't spell
out who must determine that and how.
	   Alexander Kotenkov, Yeltsin's envoy to the Duma, quickly
dismissed the statement as having no legal meaning, since Russian
law gives the lower house no power to make an inquest into the
president's health.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff Yuri Yarov said
Wednesday that the president will remain in the hospital through
the end of the week, but may return to the Kremlin next Monday.
	   Yeltsin has been handling limited paperwork and holding
telephone conversations at the government clinic where he's been
recovering for 11 days.
	   Yeltsin was expected to hold a telephone conversation on
Wednesday with French President Jacques Chirac. Later this week,
the president plans to meet Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Yarov
was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Another Yeltsin aide, Oleg Sysuyev, said Tuesday that Yeltsin,
known as a restless patient, is urging doctors to discharge him as
soon as possible.
	   Last week, the Kremlin acknowledged for the first time that
Yeltsin suffered several heart attacks in 1996 before he underwent
bypass surgery. The Russian media had been reporting this for some
time.
	   Renat Akchurin, the surgeon who operated on Yeltsin, said the
current bout of pneumonia, the second in as many years, is
apparently due to the president's weakened immunity and his age,
not heart problems.
	   Akchurin, speaking in an interview with the weekly Argumenty i
Fakty, said he has not examined Yeltsin for eight months, but
believed that heart problems were unlikely.
	   The doctor urged Yeltsin to heed doctors' advice and warned
about possible complications.
	   ``Pneumonia sometimes brings even healthy people to a tragic
end,'' Akchurin said. ``For those with a record of heart illness,
it always has a quite serious character.''
	   Yeltsin has made only rare public appearances in recent months,
and was visiting the Kremlin only two or three days a week before
he fell ill. Primakov has taken over many day-to-day duties in
Yeltsin's absence.

German captain admits he could be benched
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German soccer captain Oliver Bierhoff,
who is going through a scoring slump, says he should be benched if
he continues to struggle.
	   ``If things continue not to work for me, my position in the
national team will have to be questioned,'' Bierhoff told the
mass-circulation newspaper Bild on Wednesday.
	   ``Not even the captain should have a starting-place guarantee,''
Bierhoff said.
	   Bierhoff, who scored the ``golden goal'' that gave Germany the
1996 European Championship, has been a pale shadow of himself since
being named German captain after the World Cup, scoring only one
goal in five games, four of them against modest opposition.
	   The 30-year-old striker also has been struggling in his new
Italian club AC Milan.
	   Last year's Serie A scoring king with 27 goals, Bierhoff has
notched seven goals in 12 games this season for Milan, and none in
the last seven games.
	   He opened the season with five goals in four games.
	   ``I was hoping that things would continue that way,'' Bierhoff
said. ``Unfortunately, it wasn't so.''
	   ``I always knew it would be a complicated year. A new team, with
a new coach and a new game plan, it can't work perfectly from the
start,'' Bierhoff said.
	   New Milan coach Alberto Zaccheroni coached Bierhoff in his
successful years in Udinese.
	   ``I don't want to blame anyone for the crisis and I am looking
for my own faults,'' Bierhoff said. ``Of course, I am not calm in
these for me hard times. But I have to show character and react
with goals.''
	   ``Physically I feel fit. I am just trying to think about
scoring, about living up to the expectations of the fans,'' he
said.
	   ``But I don't expect to be the top scorer again this season, I
am too far behind,'' Bierhoff said. ``But at some point, I want to
return to the top.''

Trautmann won't resign after Jospin rejects media overhaul plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Culture Minister Catherine Trautmann said Wednesday
she wouldn't resign following Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's
rejection of a sweeping bill to overhaul French television and
radio.
	   It was the latest setback for Jospin, whose government met
stubborn opposition to its recent proposal to give legal status to
homosexual and other unmarried couples.
	   For Trautmann, it was seen as a major slap on the wrist.
	   Jospin sent her back to the drawing board to rework the proposal
designed to bolster the flagging state-run television and radio.
	   Trautmann, the former mayor of Strasbourg and once a darling of
Jospin's Socialist government, said she wouldn't resign just
because there was opposition to the bill.
	   Critics said the bill which, in its present form, reduces the
amount of advertising allowed on the state-run networks and radio
stations, benefits the private sector.
	   The bill was scheduled to be presented Tuesday before the
National Assembly, but was postponed to a later date.

Israeli, Palestinians clash near West Bank settlement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS top to RAISE context, ADDS statement by protest
organizer &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Two dozen Palestinians on Wednesday
ambushed an Israeli car, smashed its windshields with stones, then
pulled an Israeli soldier out of the vehicle and kicked and beat
him with stones and fists.
	   Attackers shouted ``Yahudi, Yahudi,'' Arabic for ``Jew, Jew.''
	   The soldier cowered by the car door, holding his hands up to
fend off blows as several Palestinians struck his head with rocks.
After about a minute of relentless attack, the soldier got up and
ran, bleeding from the head.
	   As he escaped, his assailants stole his M-16 assault rifle,
threw more stones at him, then doused the car with kerosene and set
it on fire.
	   Earlier Wednesday, a 41-year-old Palestinian street cleaner,
Osama Musa Natche, was stabbed to death in what police believe was
an attack by an Israeli extremist blamed for six other stabbings.
	   The renewed violence came just 10 days before U.S. President
Bill Clinton was to arrive in Israel and the Palestinian areas to
usher in the next stage of the Wye River land-for-security
agreement he helped negotiate in October.
	   There has also been renewed acrimony between Israeli and
Palestinian leaders, with both sides accusing each other of
violating the accord. However, an Israeli official said that as of
now, the Clinton visit was still on.
	   The stone-throwing attack began when about 150 students from Bir
Zeit University were bused to downtown Ramallah for a protest
against Israel's refusal to release a large number of Palestinian
prisoners jailed for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The march was organized by various political factions at the
university, including Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah
faction and the Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   The demonstrators, most of them Fatah followers, then walked to
the outskirts of Ramallah, and began stoning Israeli cars at a
traffic circle about half a mile from the Jewish settlement of Beit
El.
	   At one point, a white car with Israeli license plates
approached. The vehicle was driven by a man wearing a skullcap, and
a soldier was in the passenger seat.
	   To shouts of ``Yahudi, yahudi,'' about two dozen Palestinians
began pelting the car with stones and smashing its windows. The
driver stopped the car and ran away after a large rock struck him
in the face. The attackers then converged on the soldier, attacked
him and seized his M-16 assault rifle.
	   A student organizer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the attack on the car had not been planned. He said student leaders
would try to find those who had seized the soldier's weapon and
turn them over to Palestinian police.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan,
held the Palestinian Authority responsible for the incident, saying
it had incited to violence over the prisoners' issue.
	   Bar-Illan also said the attack was ``a gross and dangerous''
violation of the Wye River agreement.
	   Also Wednesday, Bar-Illan confirmed that Netanyahu complained in
a letter to Clinton that the Palestinians have repeatedly violated
the peace agreement. He asked Clinton to use his influence to halt
the violations.
	   Bar-Illan said the sending of the letter indicates that ``there
is a danger to the peace process if the violations continue.''
	   In the letter, Bar-Illan said, Netanyahu objected to recent
statements, including one by Arafat, that a Palestinian state would
be declared on May 4, 1999.
	   The daily Maariv newspaper said Netanyahu asked Clinton to
publicly distance himself from Arafat's statements and persuade the
Palestinian leader to withdraw his remarks.
	   The Wye accord urges both Israel and the Palestinians to refrain
from unilateral steps that would prejudge the outcome of talks on a
permanent peace accord.
	   The Palestinians have also lodged a series of complaints about
Israeli violations. Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, said Wednesday
that Israel's plans to construct more than a dozen access roads for
Jewish settlements in the West Bank was not approved at the Wye
River summit.
	   Israel's Cabinet authorized the road projects to improve
security for Jewish communities that will become isolated as a
result of Israel's promised withdrawal from 13 percent of the West
Bank. Thousands of acres of Palestinian land are being expropriated
for the roads.
	   ``I want to make it very clear that there is no such agreement
because no rational Palestinian would agree to the confiscation of
land for roads,'' Abbas said on the Voice of Palestine radio.

South Africa's first free, private station in hot water
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's first free,
private television station on Wednesday faced having its plug
pulled after only two months of broadcasts.
	   The Independent Broadcasting Authority took the first step
Tuesday toward shutting down the new channel, e.tv, over its
failure to meet a deadline to begin broadcasting news, according to
The Star, a Johannesburg newspaper.
	   The e.tv channel, a joint venture of black-run consortiums and
Time-Warner Inc., was supposed to have begun broadcasting news on
Monday but did not.
	   Instead, what has transpired at the Cape Town-based station
appears more akin to a soap opera.
	   On Tuesday, acting news and current affairs director Rapitse
Monthsho was suspended by the station. A letter signed by Jonathan
Proctor, head of Midi TV which runs e.tv, accused Monthso of
racism, abusiveness, leaking information to the press and poor
performance, The Star reported.
	   Monthsho would not comment, saying he was meeting his laywers
later. E.tv spokesman San Reddy confimed Monthsho was suspended but
would not say if it was permanent.
	   Last month, the Independent Broadcasting Authority found seven
violations of e.tv's broadcast license during the channel's first
week of operation, from Oct. 1-7.
	   Among the violations:
	   - No shows in Zulu, Xhosa, SeSotho and SeTswana, four of the
country's 11 official languages and the main African tongues in
South Africa. The license requirement called for one hour a week.
	   - Children's programming was lacking. Instead of 3 hours, 37
minutes per week it only broadcast 30 minutes.
	   - 240 minutes of information programming instead of 285.
	   - Too many ads per hour, sometimes exceeding the 4 minute, 11
second maximum by 3 1-2 minutes.
	   Allowed to broadcast for only six hours a day in its start-up
phase, e.tv's lineup includes reruns from the Warner TV library,
Magic Johnson's talk show ``The Magic Hour,'' cop-and-lawyer shows
like ``Silk Stalkings'' and ``A Wing and a Prayer,'' and locally
produced shows about sports, current events and popular culture.

Russian prime minister lobbies IMF chief for more loans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with talks ending, no agreement
announced, more Primakov comment. Also moving on general news
wires. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian leaders met today with the head of the
International Monetary Fund, who gave no sign he was prepared to
release the frozen loans the country so badly needs.
	   Michel Camdessus met for a second day with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov and praised Russia's ``pragmatic'' course in
dealing with the country's economic crisis. But he said an IMF team
would have to return to Russia next month for further negotiations
on the loan installments.
	   ``We are hoping 1999 will be excellent for cooperation between
Russia and the IMF,'' Camdessus said.
	   The stakes are high: Russia owes billions of dollars to workers,
pensioners and foreign creditors and wants the IMF to provide new
installments on a $22.6 billion bailout package. The loans were
negotiated this summer, but have been on hold since the latest
economic crisis hit in August.
	   The IMF has been demanding a realistic recovery plan from the
Russian government and has so far been unimpressed with Moscow's
efforts. Primakov sought to lower expectations even before today's
talks began.
	   ``Don't measure the significance of Camdessus' visit by how much
money he brought,'' Primakov said. ``He has come with an attache
case containing documents, not cash. You shouldn't think that the
question of giving money to Russia will be solved now.''
	   Speaking to reporters after the talks, the Russian prime
minister said Russia expected advice, not money, from Camdessus.
	   ``We haven't considered specific credits, the size and timing of
their release,'' Primakov said. ``It was important for us that the
fund chief come to Moscow and analyze and assess the situation.''
	   The IMF put the loan installments on hold after Russia's
government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in
August. Primakov's government has moved cautiously, refraining from
any radical measures and hoping the IMF and other lenders will
offer help.
	   The government delayed a debate this week on next year's budget
as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet
expenses.
	   While the Cabinet insisted the delay was not connected with
Camdessus' visit, Russian media have suggested the government put
off action on the budget because it still holds out hope for
receiving IMF money. The latest budget draft assumes Russia will
receive the IMF loan.
	   If the Russian government doesn't receive foreign help soon, it
will be forced to start printing money, which would drive up
inflation and further imperil Russia's fragile economy, Primakov
and other officials have warned.
	   An IMF mission left town last week saying the government's
revenue forecast for next year was overly optimistic. It also
disapproved of the government's intention to lower taxes, offer
subsidies to ailing industries and increase state regulation of the
economy.
	   Primakov played down the differences today, saying he and
Camdessus agreed some state intervention in the economy may be
positive, provided it doesn't prevent the development of a
free-market.
	   ``We will find a common approach, probably not immediately, but
we will,'' Primakov said.
	   Russia has so far received only about $5 billion of the bailout
package, which also involves the World Bank and the Japanese
government.
	   Meanwhile, Central Bank chairman Viktor Geraschenko outlined the
country's economic woes in an address today to parliament's upper
house, the Federation Council.
	   Russia's economy has shrunk 5 percent to 6 percent compared to a
year ago and inflation is up an estimated 70 percent compared to
last December, he said. The government hopes to limit inflation to
30 percent next year, he said.

UEFA suspends Parlour, Dixon after Champions League clash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Arsenal's Ray Parlour and Lee Dixon
have been suspended for at least one European match following
incidents during their club's defeat by Lens last week, UEFA said
Wednesday.
	   UEFA's control and disciplinary body also suspended Lens' Tony
Vairelles for one match for ``unsporting behavior.'' The French
champion's 1-0 victory at Wembley eliminated Arsenal from
contention for the Champions League quaterfinals.
	   Arsenal midfielder Parlour was sent off in the final minute for
striking Cyril Rool. He was followed a minute later by Vairelles
for a foul on Dixon.
	   Dixon's suspension was imposed for ``an elbow-strike in the back
of an opponent,'' UEFA said.
	   Although Dixon was not carded by referee Anders Frisk, UEFA
ruled he initiated the incident by elbowing Vairelles in the back.
	   Vairelles and Lens coach Daniel Leclercq accused Dixon of
feigning injury to get the French international striker sent off,
which came just seconds after Parlour was given his red card for
going after Rool.
	   The disciplinary body will take a final decision in January on
the length of the Arsenal players' suspensions.
	   Rool and Lens defender Eric Sikora each received one-match
suspensions after receiving the season's second yellow card.

French police detain 20 people in immigration crackdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French police arrested 20 people suspected of
involvement in illegal immigration from Sri Lanka in pre-dawn raids
Wednesday in Paris and the suburbs, police said.
	   At least 6 of the 20 people arrested were without valid
residency permits to allow them to legally live in France.
	   The arrests were made on a warrant aimed at breaking up a ring
suspected of smuggling Sri Lankan citizens into France, police
said.
	   French police believe two networks were at work, one bringing
Sri Lankans through Russia, Germany and then to France and the
other bringing them to France via Austria and Italy.
	   For the past two years, several dozen illegal immigrants have
managed to arrive in France from Sri Lanka, paying up to 50,000
francs (dlrs 8,865) for the journey, police said.
	   For 10,000 francs (dlrs 1769) extra, the immigrants would be
smuggled into Britain.
	   Several of the leaders of the ring were detained in Wednesday's
raids.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has granted more residency permits
to illegal immigrants than the previous conservative government. It
has legalized the status of some 76,000 illegal immigrants but has
rejected residency requested by more than 64,000 others.

Parliamentarians recommend policies to ease world hunger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Lawmakers from nearly 80 countries on Wednesday
urged governments to fight hunger by investing in agriculture and
easing the burden of debt on poor countries.
	   The recommendations were issued at the end of a three-day
conference on how to achieve the goals of the 1996 United Nations
World Food Summit.
	   The main goal is to cut in half the number of malnourished
people in the world by the year 2015.
	   ``I think that the target is not only desirable, but
achievable,'' said Antonio Martino of the Inter-Parliamentary
Union, which organized the conference.
	   According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, the
number of undernourished people in the developing world began
rising in 1992 after years of decline. FAO said in its latest
report that more than 800 million people worldwide are
undernourished.
	   Food production has grown, but access to food hasn't, Martino
said, urging countries to remove import barriers.
	   The report also recommends that richer countries consider
forgiving the debts of poorer ones to ease the ``heavy financial
burden which is crushing the most disadvantaged people in so many
parts of the world.''
	   The report urges governments to provide incentives to increase
farm productivity and to help poor farmers with financial aid to
buy fertilizers, machinery and other equipment.
	   The lawmakers attending the conference will pass the
recommendations on to their governments.

Russian parliament calls for restoring statue of infamous police

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with parliament approving resolution calling for the
monument's restoration. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian parliament's lower house called Wednesday
for resurrecting a statue of a dreaded Soviet secret police chief
in the center of Moscow.
	   The Communist-dominated State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, voted 237-69 to give tentative approval to the
resolution asking the Moscow city government to return the statue
of Felix Dzerzhinsky to the spot it occupied for decades in front
of the old KGB headquarters.
	   The statue should be restored as a ``symbol of fight against
crime in Russia,'' the Duma said in the resolution, adding that it
would edit the document and give it final approval later.
	   Even once finalized, the declaration would carry no legal
meaning.
	   The towering bronze statue of ``Iron Felix,'' head of the Cheka,
the first Soviet secret police, was a landmark during the Soviet
era. It was toppled by pro-democracy protesters in 1991 and has
since languished with other Soviet-era statues in a city park.
	   Nikolai Kharitonov, head of the pro-Communist Agrarian faction
in the Duma, called for restoring the statue, saying it would boost
the confidence of ordinary Russians.
	   ``Even the Federal Security Service feels unprotected without
the monument to Dzerzhinsky, who symbolizes the struggle against
crime,'' Kharitonov said Wednesday.
	   The Federal Security Service, known by the Russian acronym of
FSB, occupies the former KGB headquarters as its main successor.
	   The proposal to restore the statue has been denounced by human
rights activists, who said Dzerzhinsky was a symbol of murderous
repression during the Soviet era. Dzerzhinsky headed the secret
police after the Bolshevik Revolution and oversaw the ruthless
crackdowns on political opponents.
	   Lubyanka Square, where the statue stood, is used by human rights
groups for vigils to honor the millions of victims of Soviet rule.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ NATO forces on Wednesday arrested
a Bosnian Serb General charged by the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
with genocide, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and crimes
against humanity.
	   Gen. Radislav Krstic was arrested in a section of northern
Bosnia controlled by U.S. troops serving in NATO's Stabilization
Force, better known as SFOR.
	   SFOR spokeswoman Maj. Sheena Thomson said that Krstic was
arrested without incident at noon and would be sent to The Hague.
	   Tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour of Canada was delighted
at the arrest, calling Krstic ``a very significant military
leader.'' The tribunal had indicted him in October.
	   Arbour said Krstic's secret indictment covered offenses
allegedly committed following the rebel Serb takeover of the U.N.
safe haven of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia in July 1995, where
thousands of Muslims were massacred.
	   In a statement, Arbour said the arrest was ``very significant
for the continuing work of the tribunal.''
	   ``I'm very pleased that one of ... the executors of genocide,
the destruction of the entire population of a wider region of
Bosnia made it to The Hague,'' Amor Masovic, the head of the
Bosnian Muslim commission for missing people who has dealt the most
with mass graves and Srebrenica, told The Associated Press.
	   ``I expect his arrest to unveil important facts related to the
missing of more then 8,000 people from Srebrenica,'' Masovic added.
	   Krstic is the commander of the 5th Corps of the Bosnian Serb
Army. He is believed to be a close associate of former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief Gen. Ratko
Mladic, the tribunal's top two indicted suspects.
	   Both Karadzic and Mladic have been indicted for genocide for
allegedly masterminding the massacre of Muslims at Srebrenica, but
neither is in custody.
	   ``Persons indicted for war crimes who are still at large should
realize they, too, will be brought to justice,'' NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana said.
	   Krstic is the ninth war crimes suspect to be arrested in the
former Yugoslavia by international forces. He was named head of the
Drina Corps of the Bosnian Serb Army in 1995, after the fall of
Srebrenica.
	   The last reported sighting of Krstic was at a joint Yugoslav
National Army-Bosnian Serb military exercise in Manjaca, near Banja
Luka, in October. SFOR banned his 5th Corps from taking part in the
exercise, but let him monitor.

Spanish leader blasted plan to freeze EU spending

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Spanish Prime Minister Jose-Maria Aznar
on Wednesday condemned attempts by other European Union nations to
freeze EU spending ahead of a planned expansion of the Union into
eastern Europe.
	   ``There are a number of proposals ... which are completely
unacceptable,'' Aznar told a news conference during a visit to EU
headquarters.
	   His comments underscore the continuing rift over spending among
EU leaders as they prepare for a year-end European summit next week
in Vienna, Austria.
	   Spain, backed by other less prosperous EU members Portugal,
Greece and Ireland, want budget increases to ensure they don't
loose out as up to 12 even poorer nations prepare enter the Union
over the coming decade.
	   But the EU's wealthier members are seeking to stabilize spending
up to 2006 around current levels of 85 billion European currency
units (dlrs 100 billion) a year. Austria, which currently holds the
EU's rotating presidency has drafted proposals for a freeze.
	   Aznar said he refused to consider the Austrian plan, calling it
``regressive'' and harmful to European unity.
	   EU leaders have set themselves a deadline of April 1999 to reach
agreement on the budget overhaul to enable the expansion into
Eastern Europe to go ahead as planned.
	   Aznar was supported by European Commission President Jacques
Santer who stood by plans drawn up by the EU's executive body to
link spending to economic growth in EU nations. The Commission
estimates that would add 20 billion ecu (dlrs 23.6 billion) to the
Union's budget by 2006.
	   The budget is funded by sales taxes and membership dues from 15
member nations. They can be asked to pay up to 1.27 percent of
their annual gross national product, but contributions are usually
lower.
	   Most of the money is spent on subsidy programs for EU farmers
and development aid to the Union's poorer regions.
	   Further complicating reform negotiations are demands by Germany,
the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden for a reduction in their
contributions, and France's fears that cutting agricultural
subsidies will inflame its powerful farm lobby.

Greek telecommunications managing director ends stormy tenure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The managing director of Greece's state
telecommunications giant stepped down Wednesday following a stormy
tenure in which he stressed upgrading technology and scaling down
expansion plans.
	   The government accepted the resignation of George Chryssolouris,
who left for undisclosed ``personal reasons,'' according to a
statement from the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization, or
OTE.
	   Chryssolouris' hard-charging style opened up conflicts in top
management. Quarrels over OTE's direction reportedly contributed to
Dimitris Papoulias' decision to resign as chairman earlier this
year.
	   After taking the post in January, Chryssolouris swiftly focused
the company's priorities on modernization of its telecommunication
network. The level of digital service rose from 45 percent in
January to about 67 percent now.
	   Chryssolouris, a U.S.-trained engineer, also canceled plans for
risky investments in markets such as Jordan and concentrated on
deals closer to home. Last month, OTE won a tender to buy a 35
percent stake in Romania's telecommunications operator, Romtelecom.
	   After the announcement, OTE moved quickly to appoint a new
managing director: George Simeonidis, a senior executive at
Inmarsat, a London-based group specializing in satellite
communications. Simeonidis has also previously served on the OTE
board.
	   Management bickering had taken its toll OTE shares and rumors of
Chryssolouris' departure pushed shares up 3.3 percent on the Athens
exchange. Last month, OTE became the first Greek company listed on
the New York Stock Exchange.
	   About 35 percent of OTE is now privately held.

Israeli, Palestinians clash near West Bank settlement

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Two dozen Palestinians on Wednesday
ambushed an Israeli car, smashed its windshields with stones, then
pulled an Israeli soldier out of the vehicle and kicked and beat
him with stones.
	   Attackers shouted ``Yahudi, Yahudi,'' Arabic for ``Jew, Jew.''
	   The soldier cowered by the car door, holding his hands up to
fend off blows as several Palestinians struck his head with rocks.
After about a minute of relentless attack, the soldier got up and
ran, bleeding from the head.
	   As he escaped, his assailants stole his M-16 assault rifle,
threw more stones at him, then doused the car with kerosene and set
it on fire.
	   Earlier Wednesday, a 41-year-old Palestinian street cleaner,
Osama Musa Natche, was stabbed to death in what police believe was
an attack by an Israeli extremist blamed for six other stabbings.
	   The renewed violence came just 10 days before U.S. President
Bill Clinton was to arrive in Israel and the Palestinian areas to
usher in the next stage of the Wye River land-for-security
agreement he helped negotiate in October.
	   There has also been renewed acrimony between Israeli and
Palestinian leaders, with both sides accusing each other of
violating the accord. However, an Israeli official said that as of
now, the Clinton visit was still on.
	   The stone-throwing attack began when about 150 students from Bir
Zeit University were bused to downtown Ramallah to protest Israel's
refusal to release a large number of Palestinians jailed for
anti-Israeli activities.
	   The march was organized by various political factions at the
university, including Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah
faction and that of the Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   The demonstrators, most of them Fatah followers, then walked to
the outskirts of Ramallah, and began stoning Israeli cars at a
traffic circle about half a mile (a kilometer) from the Jewish
settlement of Beit El.
	   At one point, a white car with Israeli license plates
approached. The vehicle was driven by a man wearing a skullcap, and
a soldier was in the passenger seat.
	   To shouts of ``Yahudi, yahudi,'' about two dozen Palestinians
began pelting the car with stones and smashing its windows. The
driver stopped the car and ran away after a large rock struck him
in the face. The attackers then converged on the soldier, attacked
him and seized his M-16 assault rifle.
	   A student organizer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the attack on the car had not been planned. He said student leaders
would try to find those who had seized the soldier's weapon and
turn them over to Palestinian police.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan,
held the Palestinian Authority responsible for the incident, saying
it had incited to violence over the prisoners' issue.
	   Bar-Illan also said the attack was ``a gross and dangerous''
violation of the Wye River agreement.
	   Also Wednesday, Bar-Illan confirmed that Netanyahu complained to
Clinton that the Palestinians have repeatedly violated the peace
agreement. In a letter, he asked Clinton to use his influence to
halt the violations.
	   Bar-Illan said the letter indicates ``there is a danger to the
peace process if the violations continue.''
	   In the letter, Bar-Illan said, Netanyahu objected to recent
statements by Arafat and others that a Palestinian state would be
declared on May 4, 1999.
	   The daily Maariv newspaper said Netanyahu asked Clinton to
publicly distance himself from Arafat's statements and to persuade
the Palestinian leader to withdraw his remarks.
	   The Wye accord urges both Israel and the Palestinians to refrain
from unilateral steps that prejudge the outcome of talks on a
permanent peace accord.
	   The Palestinians have also lodged complaints about Israeli
violations. Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, said Wednesday that
Israel's plans to construct more than a dozen access roads for
Jewish settlements in the West Bank was not approved at the Wye
River summit.
	   Israel's Cabinet authorized the road projects to improve
security for Jewish communities that will become isolated as a
result of Israel's promised withdrawal from 13 percent of the West
Bank. Thousands of acres (hectares) of Palestinian land are being
expropriated for the roads.
	   ``I want to make it very clear that there is no such agreement
because no rational Palestinian would agree to the confiscation of
land for roads,'' Abbas said on the Voice of Palestine radio.

Blair heading for Belfast again as `breakthrough' speculation
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony
Blair was heading back to Belfast on Wednesday and Northern
Ireland's rival politicians said they expected a break soon in the
months-long of the peace process.
	   British officials in the province said they expected Blair to
arrive about 6 p.m. (1800 GMT).
	   Catholic politician Seamus Mallon, the would-be deputy leader of
Northern Ireland's still-unformed coalition government, said he
also expected Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern in Belfast by
Thursday.
	   Blair and Ahern helped broker April's accord among the
province's British Protestant and Irish Catholic politicians on how
they should govern in coalition. The prime ministers' subsequent
visits to Belfast have led to progress in enactment of the
complicated agreement.
	   Local politicians have failed to form the multi-party
administration _ the Executive _ envisioned in the accord.
	   Mallon and Protestant leader David Trimble were appointed in
July to oversee the Executive. But Trimble has argued that the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein party cannot participate until the Irish
Republican Army starts to disarm, something the outlawed group
refuses to do.
	   Trimble's Ulster Unionist Party and Mallon's Social Democratic
and Labor Party haven't agreed on how many posts the Executive
should have in addition to the leaders.
	   Trimble wants six more: two for his own party, two for Mallon's,
and one each for Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists, the
hard-line Protestant party led by the Rev. Ian Paisley.
	   Mallon agrees with Sinn Fein that the Executive should have at
least 10 posts, of which Sinn Fein would have two.
	   The other basic point of disagreement is the scope of
cooperation the new Northern Ireland government should pursue with
Ahern's government in the Irish Republic.
	   Trimble and Mallon agree that the Executive should form
committees with the Irish government as envisioned in the
agreement, but can't agree on how many and on what subjects.
	   The agreement specified a minimum of six committees should be
formed, and Protestants largely want these to be in
noncontroversial areas, such as tourism and animal health. The
Catholic side is pushing for more, including one to promote
economic development across the island.
	   Mallon said he expected ``a resolution'' to the deadlock over
cross-border committees by Friday, when the eight party leaders who
accepted April's agreement are to fly to Washington to receive a
joint reward for their accomplishment.
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams also said he expected agreement on
the issue, but added that cross-border structures ``will not be a
great breakthrough,'' since Trimble would still insist upon IRA
disarmament

Heavy rains soak course at Sun City
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUN CITY, South Africa (AP) _ ``Where is the sun in Sun City?''
	   That's what Tiger Woods wanted to know Wednesday as torrential
rain soaked the Gary Player Country Club course, where 12 of the
world's best golfers meet this week in the Million Dollar
Challenge.
	   More than 70 millimeters (2.8 inches) of rain between Tuesday
night and Wednesday afternoon caused cancellation of the pro-am,
idling the 12-member field including Woods, David Duval, Ernie Els,
defending champion Nick Price, Mark O'Meara, Lee Westwood and Tom
Watson.
	   Others in the field _ considered the strongest since the
tournament started in 1981 _ are Justin Leonard, Jim Furyk,
Bernhard Langer, Colin Montgomerie and Jesper Parnevik.
	   With more rain forecast, tournament chairman Tobin Prior said if
Thursday's opening round had to be canceled, two rounds would be
played Friday.
	   ``We want a single round finish'' Sunday, he said.
	   The tournament, which has total prize money of dlrs 2.57
million, is by invitation only. All travel and expenses for the
players are paid. The winner gets dlrs 1 million and the last-place
finisher takes home dlrs 100,000.
	   The tournament in this Vegas of Africa, a hotel-entertainment
complex that was a gambling refuge under apartheid, will serve as a
tune-up for the Americans playing in next week's Presidents Cup in
Australia.
	   It will also give emerging European star Westwood of England a
chance to cap a stellar season. He has 10 wins in the past 12
months, including his two previous tournaments, in Japan.
	   Westwood decided to play here instead of defending his title at
the Australian Open, angering the Aussie organizers.
	   For Woods, whose first appearance on an African course has
excited South Africa's black majority population, the tournament
comes at the end of a modest year by his standards.
	   After winning four times in 1997, including at the Masters,
Woods has won only once on the U.S. PGA tour this year. He is still
No. 1 in the world rankings.
	   The heavy rain could help Woods against local favorite Els and
defending champ Price of Zimbabwe. The rains are accelerating
growth in the rough, and the lawnmowers are idled. That favors long
and straight drivers like Woods.
	   ``This is a big advantage for me, being able to fly over
trouble,'' Woods said Wednesday.
	   Price, who has won the event four times and been runner-up three
times, called the par-72, 7,597-yard (6,947-meter) layout a ``long,
tough course.''
	   ``Even if it's only a limited field event, you'll have to play
great golf to win here,'' he said.
	   Woods practiced early Tuesday, and was mobbed by youngsters, who
see him as a hero for black South Africans.
	   `It was really neat,'' Woods said. ``They came in droves. It's
very special.''
	   On Monday, Woods met privately with President Nelson Mandela. He
called the experience ``unbelievable,'' and said Mandela had been
following his career.

NATO detains Bosnian war crimes suspect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO-led peacekeepers today arrested a
Bosnian Serb general charged in the 1995 massacre of Muslims in
Bosnia and will send him to stand trial before an international war
crimes tribunal.
	   Gen. Radislav Krstic is the ninth war crimes suspect to be
arrested in the former Yugoslavia by international forces. He is
charged in a sealed indictment with the massacre of Muslims
following the Serb takeover of a U.N. safe haven at Srebrenica in
eastern Bosnia in July 1995.
	   The International War Crimes Tribunal's chief prosecutor, Louise
Arbour, called Krstic ``a very significant military leader'' and
said she was delighted with the arrest. She said she believed
Krstic was still serving in the Bosnian Serb Army.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana warned that other war
crimes suspects ``who are still at large should realize they, too
will be brought to justice.''
	   Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime
military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic both have been indicted for
genocide for allegedly masterminding the massacre at Srebrenica.
	   Neither Karadzic nor Mladic is in custody.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Shortly after he was chosen Wednesday to
form a new government, Lebanon's future prime minister promised
austerity measures to cut public spending and boost the ailing
currency.
	   Salim Hoss, a U.S.-educated economist who has been premier four
times before, promised to pursue ``austerity in the extreme'' in
the 1999 budget. Hoss, a Beirut legislator, survived a 1987 car
bombing that killed a bodyguard in his motorcade.
	   President Emile Lahoud appointed Hoss on Wednesday, after he
received the support of 95 of 128 lawmakers in the half-Christian,
half-Muslim legislature.
	   ``We are facing big challenges which we should confront,'' said
Hoss, who turns 69 this month.
	   He quickly tried to reassure markets jittery since the current
prime minister, Rafik Hariri, bowed out Monday.
	   The central bank has already pledged to intervene to support the
Lebanese pound.
	   The national currency is ``in very solid state'' and measures
will be taken against speculators, he said.
	   Hoss's first economic challenge is to draw up next year's
budget. The deficit is running at a high 17 percent of the Gross
Domestic Product _ the value of all goods and services produced
within the country.
	   The Cabinet that Hoss is to select will present a budget to the
Parliament in the coming weeks.
	   Hoss said his government would continue the postwar
reconstruction plan, work to bring back hundreds of thousands of
people displaced by the 1975-90 civil war, and continue efforts to
end Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon.
	   Like almost all politicians in Lebanon, Hoss is an ally of
Syria, which maintains 30,000 troops in Lebanon and is the main
power-broker in the country.
	   He reaffirmed support for guerrillas fighting Israel's
occupation of a zone in southern Lebanon. Israel has controlled the
area since 1985 as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on its
northern territory.
	   Hoss first served as prime minister in 1976, in the early days
of the civil war, and after the assassination of Prime Minister
Rashid Karami in 1987. He was named to the post again in 1989 under
President Rene Mouawad and the following year under President Elias
Hrawi.
	   Hoss is a Sunni Muslim, like every prime minister under
Lebanon's power-sharing arrangement. The president is a Maronite
Catholic, and the speaker is a Shiite Muslim.
	   Hoss is expected to have a good working relationship with
Lahoud, who shares his goal of ridding the administration of
corruption. In his previous terms as prime minister, Hoss earned a
reputation as an honest politician.
	   The holder of an advanced degree in business and economics from
Indiana University at Bloomington, Hoss said Wednesday he favored
cutting interest rates, now at 14 percent.
	   He has argued that such high rates have discouraged investment.
	   His government would ``set priorities in reconstruction and
development projects that do not exceed the financial capabilities
of the state,'' he said.
	   A soft-spoken, down-to-earth man, Hoss's style of government is
expected to be quite different from that of the flamboyant Hariri,
a billionaire businessman.
	   Hariri, who is now serving in a caretaker capacity, became prime
minister in 1992 and launched the multibillion dollar program to
rebuild Lebanon. His heavy borrowing sank the country in debt and
many Lebanese complained that the program's benefits had not
reached them.
	   Most legislators supported Hariri's reappointment, but his
margin of support had shrunk.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish President Suleyman Demirel met
with Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit on Wednesday, stoking speculation
that he'd ask the center-left leader to form a new government.
	   Ecevit is said to have the support of Turkey's all-powerful
military and most analysts say he is the most viable replacement
for Mesut Yilmaz, who was ousted in a no-confidence vote last week
over a mafia scandal.
	   Daily Milliyet said Demirel was likely to announce his choice
before leaving Thursday for a two-day trip to Romania.
	   But the presidential office gave no indication that the
president was ready to designate a premier.

Activists stop screening of movie on lesbians in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Dozens of right-wing activists stormed two
Indian theaters on Wednesday, prompting a movie distributor to
suspend the showing of an internationally acclaimed film about a
lesbian relationship.
	   The Bombay protesters claim the movie ``Fire,'' the first film
from India to focus on lesbianism, distorts their culture. At least
100 activists with the right-wing Shiv Sena Party surrounded the
theater managers and demanded the movie not be shown.
	   The movie's distributor, Shringar Films, suspended showing of
the movie in Bombay, citing concern for audience safety. Shiv Sena
activists have used violence to get their way on other issues.
	   ``We will wait and watch. Ultimately, audience safety is more
important,'' said Balkrishna Shroff, an owner of Shringar Films.
	   ``Fire'' has been packing theaters in the three weeks it has
been running in Bombay. Angry ticket-holders lined up for a refund.
	   ``Why can't those who cannot stomach sensitive subjects not come
for the films instead of stopping us from seeing good cinema,''
said Naina Fernandes, a college student.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ With space station construction
about to start, NASA is considering a trip back to Mir to salvage
science equipment that could be used on the new outpost.
	   U.S. and Russian space officials said Tuesday that the
discussions for a possible shuttle flight to the aging Mir next
year are ``very tentative.''
	   ``We're still discussing what hardware might be recoverable or
what might make sense vs. the cost of the shuttle,'' said Frank
Culbertson, deputy program manager for the international space
station. ``It's just a matter of assessing what the risks, costs
and benefits are.''
	   Culbertson said it would take six months or so to plan such a
mission, making it late spring or early summer before a shuttle
could fly to the Russian station. A shuttle flight typically costs
about $500 million.
	   The Russians requested a 10th shuttle ferry flight because of a
lack of funding. They launched the first part of the international
space station on Nov. 20; the power and propulsion tug was built in
Russia but financed by the United States.
	   Space shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to blast off Thursday with
an American-made chamber that the six-person crew will connect to
the Russian tug. Unacceptable weather is forecast, though, for the
3:57 a.m. launch.
	   The third compartment, a Russian control module, is stalled
until next summer because of the country's financial crisis.
Astronauts and cosmonauts cannot move in until it's in place.
	   Valery Ryumin, a Russian station official who flew to Mir in
June on what was considered to be the last shuttle visit, said
money is a problem and more is needed.
	   ``We have to admit that we don't have a surplus of the science
equipment,'' he said.
	   Unable to afford two space stations, the Russian Space Agency
has targeted next summer for Mir's demise, though some in the
country would like to keep the nearly 13-year-old station up much
longer. Discussions are under way with an unnamed company, in fact,
to provide an alternative source of funding. Russian officials
would not elaborate Tuesday on the possible deals.
	   ``When it is time to get rid of a pair of old shoes, you never
do that before you buy a new pair of shoes _ especially in the
wintertime,'' Ryumin said. ``So why get rid of an old space station
when we don't have a new one?''

Fire breaks out at Coca-Cola bottling plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A major fire broke out Wednesday morning
at a Coca-Cola bottling plant, and hours later firemen were still
struggling to contain the blaze.
	   According to the Interior Ministry, the fire inside a warehouse
apparently was related to electrical problems. Workers said it
started when plastic boxes placed near a huge lamp melted and then
ignited.
	   Despite the efforts of firefighters brought from four
neighboring towns, the fire was still raging nearly 12 hours after
it started and was threatening to destroy the $10 million plant.
	   No one was injured.
	   The four-year-old plant is a joint venture between Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola and Italy's Gruppo Busi, which also operates bottling
plants in Italy.
	   The Albanian plant produces about 100 million bottles annually,
or about 33 bottles a year for every Albanian.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ U.S. oil company Esso, a subsidiary of
Exxon Corp., has discovered a new oilfield in deep water about 360
kilometers (223 miles) northwest of Luanda, a news report said
Wednesday.
	   The oilfield has an estimated production capacity of 4,400
barrels per day, according to a company statement in Luanda cited
by the Portuguese news agency LUSA.
	   The oilfield, named Dikanza, is the fourth to be discovered by
the joint venture between Esso and Angolan state oil company
Sonangol in an area called
	   Bloc 15. The previous three discoveries can produce 16,000,
10,000 and 6,500 barrels per day.
	   Other companies active in Bloc 15 are British Petroleum, Italy's
Agip and
	   Norway's Norske Staps Oljeselskap.
	   Angola is sub-Saharan Africa's second-largest oil producer after
Nigeria with a production of about 700,000 barrels per day.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Botswana President Festus Mogae
on Wednesday denied the Congo war was causing division within the
14-nation Southern African Development Community.
	   However Mogae acknowledged the SADC was being distracted from
its goal of economic development.
	   ``For the time being, SADC is less focused than it normally is,
but this is a short-term phenomenon. I'm sure it will recover its
focus before long,'' he told delegates attending the International
Herald Tribune's Southern Africa Trade and Investment Summit in
Cape Town.
	   Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola _ all SADC members _ have sent
troops to fight alongside Congo President Laurent Kabila's forces
against rebels fighting to unseat him. Some other SADC members,
notably South Africa, have sought a peaceful solution to the war.
	   Uganda and Rwanda are supporting the rebels.
	   Mogae, whose country also belongs to the SADC, said the war was
``an expensive exercise'' but added that the region could
ill-afford the instability which would result if the Congo
government was overthrown every year. Kabila came to power in 1997
after leading a rebellion that overthrew Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   Namibian Prime Minister Hage Geingob said that eventually, the
African continent would have to ``come together as a whole'' and
work together for economic development.
	   European Union commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro, also
attending the conference, said the EU was very positive about
southern Africa's prospects. He expressed hope a trade deal between
South Africa and the EU could still be struck before year-end.
	   --
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ A group that claimed responsibility
for a bomb blast that killed a security guard and damaged the
deputy prime minister's office has warned that more attacks will
follow.
	   The Black Tigers, in a fax to The Times of Swaziland newspaper,
threatened to launch a reign of ``fear and terror'' unless the 1973
royal decree banning political parties was reviewed.
	   The newspaper printed the faxed message across the front page on
Wednesday, the South African Press Association reported. The
missive threatened cabinet ministers.
	   The government has declined to comment on the threats except to
say that police investigations into recent bombings were still
continuing.
	   Meanwhile, moves are under way to call an emergency meeting of
Swaziland's parliament aimed at introducing tough anti-terrorism
laws, SAPA reported.
	   On Nov. 20, an explosion tore out a section of a two-story
building housing government offices, including the deputy prime
minister's, on one of the capital's busiest streets.
	   In October, an explosion damaged a bridge and injured one
person, two hours after King Mswati III crossed the span
	   Swaziland, a kingdom of 1 million people, is sandwiched between
South Africa and Mozambique.

unfinished building of Russia's Supreme Court on Wednesday, and
people working in the main courthouse next door were evacuated,
news reports said.
	   No casualties were reported. It was unclear whether anyone was

	   The cause of the fire, in central Moscow, was also unclear.
	   More than 10 fire trucks and a firefighting helicopter were sent
to the scene, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   At least 15 floors of the building were ablaze, including
scaffolding, timber and building materials, Interfax and the
ITAR-Tass news agency said. Gusts of wind were carrying burning
fragments of plastic into nearby streets.

Supposed portrait of Rembrandt now deemed a copy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A painting that has hung for years
in this city's top museum, billed as a self-portrait by Dutch
master Rembrandt, was declared a mere copy Wednesday.
	   ``It's no longer a Rembrandt, but it is still a major piece. The
painting is still very precious,'' said Carola Visser of the
prestigious Mauritshuis museum.
	   Experts have previously questioned the authenticity of the oil
titled ``Self-portrait with Gorget'' in the Dutch museum because
there is a near-identical version in the Germanic National Museum
in Nuremburg, Germany.
	   With an extensive Rembrandt exhibition scheduled for next year,
Mauritshuis curators thought it was time to end the speculation
once for all, and launched an investigation.
	   Thanks to infrared technology and X-rays, researchers have
discovered outlines of the portrait beneath the Mauritshuis
painting. Since Rembrandt never made outlines, experts agreed it
was likely a copy _ possibly by one of the master's pupils _ and
that the painting in the German museum is genuine.
	   Experts believe the copy was created in the 17th century just
like the original, and that the mystery artist was someone close to
Rembrandt, most likely one of his students, Visser said.
	   It is widely known that many paintings attributed to Rembrandt
may not be his, since teachers, students and other imitators worked
in a virtually identical style and used the same materials.
	   The 37-by-28-centimeter (15-by-11-inch) painting shows the curly
haired Rembrandt as a young man, gazing intently with his right
cheek illuminated by soft light.
	   The version in the Nuremburg museum was signed by Rembrandt; the
Mauritshuis copy was left unsigned.
	   Rembrandt van Rijn was born in 1606 in the university city of
Leiden, 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Amsterdam. He was a
popular painter and etcher in his lifetime, but died a pauper in
1669 and was buried in an unmarked grave in Amsterdam.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Security was tight in Istanbul on
Wednesday ahead of the politically charged Champions League match
between Juventus of Turin and Galatasaray.
	   Around 22,000 police officers were being deployed for the game
amid fears that angry Turkish fans might resort to violence against
the Italians. Military units were on standby.
	   Turks are outraged at Italy for refusing to extradite a Kurdish
rebel leader. Authorities also said they worried about a
provocation by the rebels aimed at staining Turkey's image.
	   Hundreds of police were on hand when the Italian team arrived at
the Istanbul airport Wednesday. A small group of airport employees
tossed flowers at the Juventus bus in greeting. But, as loyal
home-team fans, they also chanted ``Turkey, Turkey!''
	   The road from the airport to the team's hotel was closed to
traffic, but people standing along the route waved to the bus.
	   Turkey's leaders have been calling on Turks to be hospitable and
refrain from doing anything to mar the match.
	   In a show of top-level support, Italy's ministers of foreign
trade and of sports went to Istanbul for the game.

Iraq appeals to France, Egypt on sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A leading Iraqi newspaper appealed to
France and Egypt on Wednesday to back Baghdad's efforts to get
punishing U.N. trade sanctions lifted.
	   Al-Thawra, which is published by President Saddam Hussein's
ruling Baath party, noted that both countries were critical of Iraq
during its recent standoff with the United Nations over weapons
inspections.
	   In August and again in October, Iraq limited the work of U.N.
inspectors, who must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before the sanctions can be lifted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, an
invasion that triggered the Gulf War, limit the sale of oil, ban
air travel and bar most other financial transactions.
	   Under threat of U.S. and British military action, Iraq agreed to
resume cooperation on Nov. 14.
	   It has also stepped up efforts to get the U.N. Security Council
to conduct a promised ``comprehensive review'' of Iraqi disarmament
compliance that the Baghdad regime hopes will lead to easing or
lifting of the sanctions.
	   ``Both Egypt and France know the United States is trying to stop
the comprehensive review from taking place by pushing Richard
Butler to create a new crisis,'' Al-Thawra said. ``They both know
that the United States wants to prolong sanctions on Iraq for
political reasons.''
	   Butler, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, has been trying to get
documents on weaponry from Iraq. Iraqi officials have so far
refused to hand them over, saying they don't exist, have been
destroyed or are irrelevant.
	   ``Is it to Egypt's _ or the Arab countries' _ advantage that
Iraq be attacked or the sanctions be prolonged? Do (France and
Egypt) think that Iraq will have to wear whatever is sewn by the
Americans at the Security Council?''
	   Meanwhile, Iraq's National Monitoring Directorate said that U.N.
teams carried out 18 inspections on Tuesday, the largest number
since they resumed work Nov. 18 after the last crisis.
	   It said that the sites visited included four colleges. Nuclear
inspection teams also took soil samples from six sites in northern
Baghdad, the directorate said, without identifying the sites.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the inspectors, would not
confirm or deny the figures.
	   ``We have many inspectors working, and we hope to finish the
scheduled inspections by mid-December,'' she said.
	   The directorate, which provides government escorts for the U.N.
teams, Iraq also reported that a U.N. biological weapons inspection
team and a U.N. missile monitoring team arrived Tuesday.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Two dozen Palestinians on Wednesday
ambushed an Israeli car, smashed its windshields with stones, then
pulled an Israeli soldier out of the vehicle and kicked and beat
him with stones and fists.
	   Attackers shouted ``Yahudi, Yahudi,'' Arabic for ``Jew, Jew.''
	   The soldier cowered by the car door, holding his hands up to
fend off blows as several Palestinians struck his head with rocks.
After about a minute of relentless attack, the soldier got up and
ran, bleeding from the head.
	   As he escaped, his assailants stole his M-16 assault rifle,
threw more stones at him, then doused the car with kerosene and set
it on fire.
	   Earlier Wednesday, a 41-year-old Palestinian street cleaner,
Osama Musa Natche, was stabbed to death in what police believe was
an attack by an Israeli extremist.
	   Hundreds joined Natche's funeral procession along Salah Eddin
Street, the main thoroughfare of traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
Dozens of marchers broke away and hurled stones at Israeli riot
police who fired rubber bullets.
	   In a side street, Palestinians stoned an Israeli motorist,
pulled him out of the car and then set the vehicle on fire, said
Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby.
	   The renewed violence came just 10 days before U.S. President
Bill Clinton was to arrive in Israel and the Palestinian areas to
usher in the next stage of the Wye River land-for-security
agreement he helped negotiate in October.
	   There has also been fresh acrimony between Israeli and
Palestinian leaders, with both sides accusing each other of
violating the accord. However, an Israeli official said that as of
now, the Clinton visit was still on.
	   The stone-throwing attack in the West Bank began when about 150
students from Bir Zeit University were bused to downtown Ramallah
for a protest against Israel's refusal to release a large number of
Palestinian prisoners jailed for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The march was organized by various political factions at the
university, including Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah
faction and the Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   The demonstrators, most of them Fatah followers, then walked to
the outskirts of Ramallah, and began stoning Israeli cars at a
traffic circle about half a mile from the Jewish settlement of Beit
El.
	   At one point, a white car with Israeli license plates
approached. The vehicle was driven by a man wearing a skullcap, and
a soldier was in the passenger seat.
	   To shouts of ``Yahudi, yahudi,'' about two dozen Palestinians
began pelting the car with stones and smashing its windows. The
driver stopped the car and ran away after a large rock struck him
in the face. The attackers then converged on the soldier and
attacked him.
	   Israeli troops fired live ammunition and a barrage of
rubber-coated metal bullets and tear gas. Eleven Palestinians were
lightly injured by rubber bullets.
	   A student organizer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the attack on the car had not been planned. He said student leaders
would try to find those who had seized the soldier's weapon and
turn them over to Palestinian police.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan,
held the Palestinian Authority responsible for the incident, saying
it had incited to violence over the prisoners' issue.
	   Bar-Illan also said the attack was ``a gross and dangerous''
violation of the Wye River agreement.
	   Only a day earlier, the speaker of the Palestinian legislative
council, Ahmed Qureia, had told protesters seeking the release of
Palestinian prisoners that ``the leadership that threw stones is
prepared once again to throw stones in order to free the people and
to free the land.''
	   Also Wednesday, Bar-Illan confirmed that Netanyahu complained in
a letter to Clinton that the Palestinians have repeatedly violated
the peace agreement. He asked Clinton to use his influence to halt
the violations.
	   Bar-Illan said the sending of the letter indicates that ``there
is a danger to the peace process if the violations continue.''
	   In the letter, Bar-Illan said, Netanyahu objected to recent
statements, including one by Arafat, that a Palestinian state would
be declared on May 4, 1999.
	   The Wye accord urges both Israel and the Palestinians to refrain
from unilateral steps that would prejudge the outcome of talks on a
permanent peace accord.
	   Asked about Netanyahu's complaints, Arafat said: ``He used to
(always) says something like that.''

Duma urges alliance of ex-Soviet states to oust Berezovsky
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Communist-dominated Russian parliament's lower
house on Wednesday called on an alliance of former Soviet republics
to oust controversial business tycoon Boris Berezovsky as its
secretary.
	   Berezovsky, whose vast business interests range from oil to cars
to media holdings, also has close Kremlin connections and serves as
the executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States,
a loose grouping of 12 ex-Soviet republics.
	   Berezovsky recently called for a ban on the Communist Party for
its failure to quickly condemn a Communist lawmaker for his
anti-Semitic remarks.
	   In response, Communists and their hard-line allies in the State
Duma voted 226-1 Wednesday for a statement denouncing Berezovsky's
demand as ``inciting anti-Communist hysteria and infringing on
human rights.''
	   It also asked the leaders of the CIS member states to dismiss
Berezovsky as the Commonwealth secretary.
	   The CIS leaders are unlikely to heed the Communists' call.

Fire breaks out at Russia's Supreme Court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A fire swept through at least 15 floors of an
unfinished building of Russia's Supreme Court today, forcing
workers to evacuate the main courthouse next door, news reports
said.
	   No casualties were reported. It was unclear whether anyone was
in the central Moscow building when it caught fire.
	   The cause of the fire was also not known.
	   More than 10 fire trucks and a firefighting helicopter were sent
to the scene, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   At least 15 floors of the building were ablaze, including
scaffolding, timber and building materials, Interfax and the
ITAR-Tass news agency said. Gusts of wind were carrying burning
fragments of plastic into nearby streets.

Finance minister says Poland stronger against external problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz said
Wednesday that Poland's economy was better equipped than a year ago
to cope with global problems such as the Asian and Russian economic
crises.
	   At a news conference assessing economic performance in the past
year, Balcerowicz said the Solidarity-led governing alliance would
continue reforms promoting fiscal discipline and restructuring
ailing sectors such as mining and transportation.
	   ``We have prevented growing signs of crisis in our economy, and
strengthened our credibility among other emerging markets,'' said
Balcerowicz, leader of the liberal Freedom Union that is
Solidarity's junior partner in the alliance.
	   He noted the Polish economy was still prone to shocks from
global economic instability, but he called it ``less sensitive''
than last year.
	   Polish share prices fell and the zloty currency weakened in
August when the Russian economic crisis emerged. But the Polish
economy generally remained solid, showing the former Soviet
satellite had successfully shifted most of its economic focus from
the former Soviet bloc to Western Europe.
	   Balcerowicz, who introduced so-called ``shock therapy'' measures
promoting market-led reforms after communist rule ended in 1989,
said the main goal of the Solidarity-led government now would be to
promote economic growth so Poland could catch up to European Union
countries.
	   Poland hopes to join the EU in 2002.

Wolfsburg beats third-division team to reach semifinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Two goals by Polish striker Andrzej
Juskowiak and one by American midfielder Claudio Reyna gave
Wolfsburg a 3-1 victory Wednesday over third-division Siegen and a
place in the semifinals of the German Cup.
	   Wolfsburg, one of the hottest Bundesliga teams at the moment,
reached the semifinals for the second time since 1995.
	   Juskowiak brought his season goal total to 13 by scoring in the
sixth and 45th minute. Reyna, who has been struggling to preserve
his place in the starting lineup, added the third in the 63rd.
	   Wolfsburg is now undefeated in 11 consecutive games.
	   Lithuanian midfielder Roman Cirba scored in the 22nd for Siegen,
which had eliminated one first-division and two second-division
teams from the competition.
	   On Tuesday, Bundesliga leader and cup holder Bayern Munich
crushed slumping VfB Stuttgart 3-0 in the subfreezing Olympic
stadium on goals by Carsten Jancker, Mario Basler and Alexander
Zickler.
	   The defeat could hasten the end of coach Winfried Schaefer's
reign in Stuttgart, which is now without a win in six games, with
four defeats
	   German media reports say Stuttgart players are rebelling against
the unpopular coach, who is also detested by fans.
	   Schaefer denied knowledge of a reported poll by Stuttgart
players, who allegedly voted 25-0 against the coach.
	   But Schaefer dropped Bulgarian star midfielder Krasimir Balakov
from the rosters, while starting striker Fredi Bobic only came on
in the second half-time against Bayern.
	   Schaefer said Bobic was in poor form, but the on-and-off
international immediately assailed the coach.
	   ``You can do this with an 18-year-old, but not with Fredi
Bobic,'' Bobic said.
	   ``That's exactly the problem of Stuttgart,'' Schaefer countered.
``He should have said that he deserved to be benched because he
hasn't performed well.''
	   ``The players blab into microphones instead of checking their
performances on the field,'' Schaefer said.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Archbishop Jozef Glemp, the primate of the
Roman Catholic church in Poland, was released Wednesday from a
hospital outside Warsaw where he underwent a heart procedure
Monday.
	   Glemp, who will be 69 on Dec. 18, had coronary angioplasty to
clear a clogged artery in his heart.

EU worried about millennium bug preparations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission Wednesday
released proposals to answer ``serious concerns'' about national
preparations for tackling computer glitches caused by the new
millennium.
	   The European Union executive body said its 15 member nations had
made ``substantial progress'' this year helping business and the
public prepare for the problem. But it added the lack of assurances
that ``matters have been investigated, rectified and tested raises
serious concerns.''
	   The Commission said concern was greatest in the local
administration, energy and transport sectors. It plans to set up a
working group to coordinate national plans to ensure the smooth
running of cross-border transport, energy, finance and
telecommunication networks.
	   The so-called millennium bug could cause computers that are set
to read only the last two digits of the year to malfunction when
the calendar changes to 2000.

Myanmar refugees flee camps as Bangladesh resumes repatriation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh (AP) _ More than 500 Muslim refugees
from Myanmar have fled their camps, fearing repatriation to their
homeland that Bangladesh resumed last week, officials said
Wednesday.
	   The refugees have been missing from their camps in southern
Bangladesh for the last one week and repatriation officials fear
they may have either mingled with the local people or were hiding
in nearby forests.
	   Police are searching the area's forests and mountains for the
men, who were from two refugee camps near the frontier town of
Teknaf, 185 miles (320 kilometers) south of Dhaka, Bangladesh
capital.
	   Also on Wednesday, 25 refugees were sent home, raising the
number of repatriated people to 71 in past one week, Bangladesh
officials said. The repatriation was supervised by the U.N. refugee
officials.
	   Eight years ago, 250,000 Muslims fled to Bangladesh from
Myanmar's western province of Arakan, accusing their predominantly
Buddhist military of rape, murder and forced unpaid labor.
Bangladesh is an Islamic nation.
	   Their repatriation began in 1992 after the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees promised to monitor their safety in
Myanmar.
	   Since then more than 229,000 refugees have been sent home in a
slow repatriation that had to be suspended on several occasions as
many refugees refused to return home fearing persecution.
	   Those missing were among the 21,000 refugees that Bangladesh
wants to send home. The latest round of repatriation began after 16
months of suspension.

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ At least 5,000 opposition activists
Wednesday sat in a soccer field to protest onion prices, which have
almost doubled in recent weeks.
	   The eight-hour protest was led by the country's main opposition
leader Khaleda Zia, who warned that the high onion prices could
topple Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government.
	   In neighboring India, skyrocketing prices of onions _ sixfold in
recent months _ was blamed for the rout of the Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party in three crucial state legislature elections
last week.
	   In Bangladesh, onions were selling at 50 takas (dlr 1) a kilo
(50 cents a pound), up by nearly 100 percent. The government eased
import tariff on onions.
	   ``The Indians have shown us how rising onion price can bring a
government down,'' opposition leader Zia told a cheering crowd of
her Bangladesh Nationalist Party in capital Dhaka.
	   Mrs. Zia accused the government of incompetence for the rising
prices of onion, an essential ingredient in Bangladesh cuisine.

Latvian accused in arms drop case suffers heart attack in court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ A Latvian who is among those accused in a
case of dropping arms and ammunition on to Indian territory
collapsed in court during the trial Wednesday and was hospitalized
with a heart attack, officials said.
	   Doctors said Joe Antimenko would continue to be under medical
observation for some time before they can release him, police and
court officials said.
	   Antimenko, who is in his late 40s, is among the five other
Latvian crew members who are facing trial since the 1995
sensational dropping of rocket launchers, anti-tank missiles and
assault rifles in a northern state in December 1995.
	   A British pilot was held along with the Latvians on charge of
aiding an attack on India, a charge they deny.
	   Among those accused is British arms dealer Peter Bleach, who
says he kept police informed and believed he was helping British
intelligence set up a sting. They can be sentenced to death or
given life imprisonment if found guilty.
	   The trial has already dragged on for nearly three years.
	   Indian investigators say the arms were for an anti-Communist
cult in the state of West Bengal, of which Calcutta is the capital.
Other reports have said that the cult, known as Ananda Marg, may
have been a conduit to rebels in neighboring Myanmar, formerly
Burma. The Ananda Marg has denied the allegations.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Deutsche Bank will buy Credit Lyonnais
Belgium for about 1 billion marks (dlrs 590 million), continuing
its European expansion after recent ventures in the United States
and Japan, the bank announced Wednesday.
	   The planned purchase of the Belgian bank, a subsidiary of
France-based Credit Lyonnais SA, came just days after Deutsche Bank
announced its 17 billion mark (dlrs 10 billion) takeover of Bankers
Trust Corp. Last month it announced an asset-management joint
venture with Japan's Nippon Life Insurance Co.
	   ``Nevertheless, the foundations for all our activities are in
Europe,'' Carl von Boehm-Bezing, a member of Deutsche Bank's
management board said at a press conference in Brussels.
	   With the imminent launch of the European common currency _ or
euro _ on Jan. 1, Deutsche Bank more than ever considers Europe its
home market, von Boehm-Bezing said. He noted the Belgian deal
followed major acquisitions in Italy and Spain in recent years.
	   He also made clear that Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank will not
be making a bid for Credit Lyonnais, the French bank that is being
privatized next year.
	   ``We had a clear-cut answer from France that Deutsche Bank was
not invited to the party,'' Von Boehm-Bezing said.
	   Deutsche Bank said it expects the Belgium deal to close in the
first quarter of 1999. Credit Lyonnais Belgium will be renamed
Deutsche Bank. While Deutsche Bank plans to fully integrate its
Belgian activities with those of Credit Lyonnais Belgium, although
it plans to retain the Belgian bank's management.
	   The Credit Lyonnais deal shows that Deutsche Bank ``does still
have the resources to expand in Europe'' despite buying Bankers
Trust, said Volker von Kruechten, analyst at BHF Bank in Frankfurt.
	   The Bankers Trust deal, announced Monday, means Deutsche Bank
will become the world's largest financial institution. With assets
of more than dlrs 800 billion, the combined bank would surpass UBS
AG of Switzerland, currently the No. 1 bank, and the recently
formed Citigroup Inc.
	   The purchase will be the largest takeover of a U.S. financial
institution by a foreign bank.

EU suing France for excessive hunting seasons and failure to
</HEADLINE>
protect birds

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission decided
Wednesday to take France to the European Court for its failure to
comply to EU laws regarding the hunting and protection of wild
birds.
	   ``French legislation fails to guarantee complete protection of
wild bird species during their return to their breeding grounds and
during nesting and rearing,'' the Commission said in a statement
Wednesday, adding France was also not respecting other rules for
four wild bird species.
	   France's hunting seasons for wild birds are too long, according
to the Commission. They start too early, often up to 7 weeks before
young birds become independent of their parents, and they end too
late when migration has already started.
	   For four species of wild birds (three kinds of Gull and the
Cormorant), neither deliberate killing or capture nor destruction
or theft of nests and eggs are legally forbidden as required by EU
law.
	   The Commission warned France more than five months ago that
legal action would go ahead if France did not comply with EU
legislation, but France's answer ``does not reveal any move towards
compliance'' said the statement.

Tight security at match amid Turkey-Italy dispute over rebel leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Security was tight in Istanbul on
Wednesday for a politically charged soccer match between top teams
from Italy and Turkey.
	   Turkey and Italy are locked in a bitter dispute over the fate of
Abdullah Ocalan, a Kurdish rebel leader arrested in Rome who has
asked for political asylum, and there were fears the political
tensions might spill onto the soccer field.
	   Around 22,000 police officers were deployed for the Champions
League match between Juventus of Turin and Galatasaray of Istanbul,
and military units were on standby.
	   Hundreds of police were on hand when Juventus arrived at the
Istanbul airport Wednesday. A small group of airport employees
tossed flowers at the team bus in greeting. But, as loyal home-team
fans, they also chanted ``Turkey, Turkey!''
	   The road from the airport to the team's hotel was closed to
traffic, but people standing along the route waved to the bus.
	   Turkey's leaders have been calling on Turks to be hospitable and
refrain from doing anything to mar the match.
	   In a show of top-level support, Italy's ministers of foreign
trade and of sports went to Istanbul for the game.
	   ``We are here to play a game, only a game,'' said Juventus
official Romy Gai. ``We don't care about other things,'' he said.
	   At the hotel where the players rested until the 9:45 p.m. (1945
GMT) match, security officials were monitoring cameras placed at
the entrances; police motorcades ready to escort the team to the
stadium.
	   At Ali Sami Yen stadium, security officials planned body
searches of all spectators for weapons or items like loose change
which could be hurled at the field. Authorities banned fireworks
and banners.
	   On Tuesday, police stopped a group of fans sneaking into the
stadium with a banner reading: ``Italy! Extradite that bloody
terrorist to Turkey,'' daily Milliyet reported. Another newspaper
said two helicopters would be nearby to evacuate the Italian team
in case of violence.
	   Ocalan leads a guerrilla force which has been fighting for
Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey for since 1984. The
conflict has killed about 37,000 people.
	   UEFA, European soccer's governing body, had postponed the match
by a week because of anti-Italian sentiment in Turkey.
	   Concerned about security, Juventus went to Istanbul on the day
of the game instead of the day before as UEFA rules require, and
the federation has said it might take disciplinary action. The team
returns home right after the game.

Teachers strike in Siberia, hospital workers in Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Teachers in several Siberian towns went on strike
Wednesday, protesting the government's failure to pay them.
Hospital workers in Russia's Far East went on a hunger strike, also
demanding back pay.
	   In Siberia, 6,000 teachers went on strike in the Irkutsk region,
shutting down 123 schools, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. In one
town, Ulkan, the teachers began a hunger strike, according to
teachers' union spokesman Yuri Bekshtanovsky.
	   In the Far East, more than 40 hospital workers in the town of
Elban joined a hunger strike called the day before by emergency
medical workers in the nearby city of Amursk. Workers at the Elban
hospital said they hadn't been paid for six months, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Teachers in eight schools in the surrounding Khabarovsk region
went on strike Tuesday and teachers in other schools called a
``pre-strike alert,'' threatening to walk off their jobs if they
aren't paid, the news agency said.
	   Such strikes are common in Russia, where many workers go unpaid
for months at a time. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has promised
to begin repaying wages of all public sector workers next year.

Six people burn to death in truck crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Six men burned to death Wednesday when two
trucks collided and caught fire in southern Egypt, police said.
	   Police said a truck carrying wood smashed into a pickup loaded
with vegetables going in the opposite direction near Minya, 190
kilometers (120 miles) south of Cairo.
	   The crash set off a raging blaze after the pickup's gas tank
burst into flames and ignited the wood in the other vehicle, said
police officials, speaking under customary rules of anonymity.
	   The driver and three passengers in the pickup were trapped and
burned to death. The driver of the other truck and his assistant
suffered serious burns and later died in a hospital.
	   The accident occurred at about 7 a.m. (0500gmt) on the main
highway linking southern Egypt to Cairo. Police said they were
investigating the cause.

NATO detains Bosnian Serb general charged with genocide
</HEADLINE>

parliament's president. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ NATO forces on Wednesday arrested
the most senior Bosnian Serb military figure yet to be seized for
U.N. trial on genocide and war crimes charges.
	   Gen. Radislav Krstic was arrested in a section of northern
Bosnia controlled by U.S. troops serving in NATO's Stabilization
Force, better known as SFOR. The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal has
accused him of genocide, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions
and crimes against humanity.
	   SFOR spokeswoman Maj. Sheena Thomson said Krstic was arrested
without incident at noon and would be sent to The Hague for trial
on charge stemming from the wartime massacre of Muslims.
	   Tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour of Canada was delighted
at the arrest, calling Krstic ``a very significant military
leader.'' The tribunal had indicted him in October.
	   Arbour said Krstic's secret indictment covered offenses
allegedly committed following the rebel Serb takeover of the U.N.
safe haven of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia in July 1995, where
thousands of Muslims were massacred.
	   He is indicted for genocide, complicity to commit genocide,
extermination, murder, and persecution for his alleged personal
involvement in the atrocities and his command of troops carrying
out the massacres, the tribunal announced.
	   In a statement, Arbour said the arrest was ``very significant
for the continuing work of the tribunal.''
	   ``I'm very pleased that one of ... the executors of genocide,
the destruction of the entire population of a wider region of
Bosnia made it to The Hague,'' Amor Masovic, the head of the
Bosnian Muslim commission for missing people who has dealt the most
with mass graves and Srebrenica, told The Associated Press.
	   ``I expect his arrest to unveil important facts related to the
missing of more then 8,000 people from Srebrenica,'' Masovic said.
	   But Petar Djokic, president of the Bosnian Serb parliament, said
Krstic's arrest on a secret indictment ``brings uncertainty to
people, a feeling that every citizen of Republika Srpska can be
regarded as a potential war criminal in the eyes of the tribunal,
and that SFOR is authorized to arrest anybody, anytime, anywhere.''
	   Republika Srpska is the Serb entity within Bosnia. Serbs account
for the vast majority of suspects publicly indicted by the U.N.
court.
	   Krstic was the commander of the 5th Corps of the Bosnian Serb
Army. He is believed to be a close associate of former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief Gen. Ratko
Mladic, the tribunal's top two indicted suspects.
	   Both Karadzic and Mladic have been indicted for genocide for
allegedly masterminding the massacre of Muslims at Srebrenica.
Neither is in custody.
	   ``Persons indicted for war crimes who are still at large should
realize they, too, will be brought to justice,'' NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana said Wednesday after the arrest.
	   Krstic is the ninth war crimes suspect to be arrested in the
former Yugoslavia by international forces. He was named head of the
Drina Corps of the Bosnian Serb Army in 1995 after the fall of
Srebrenica.
	   The last reported sighting of Krstic was at a joint military
exercise of the Yugoslav National Army and the Bosnian Serb
military in Manjaca, near Banja Luka, in October. SFOR banned his
5th Corps from taking part in the exercise, but let him monitor it.

Duma seeks medical report on Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recasts top two grafs. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin's foes in the Russian parliament
demanded Wednesday that his medical records be released so they
could be studied as a possible reason for his ouster. The president
remained in a hospital with pneumonia.
	   Though non-binding, the move has increased pressure on the
president. His frequent illnesses have eroded his authority and
raised concern about his ability to finish his term, which ends in
mid-2000, and to lead Russia out of its worst economic crisis since
the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The Communist-initiated statement, which was passed by the
parliament's lower house, the State Duma, by a 247-33 vote, urges
the presidential doctors to submit a report on Yeltsin's health
within 10 days.
	   ``The absence of trustworthy information on the president's
health has spurred abundant rumors, allegations and even guesswork
diagnosis, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease,'' it said.
``That stirs the public and causes doubts about the president's
ability to exercise his duties.''
	   The Duma also decided to prepare an appeal to the Constitutional
Court, asking it to explain the meaning of a legal provision about
terminating the president's powers due to ``lasting inability to
exercise his duties.'' The constitutional provision doesn't spell
out who must determine that and how.
	   Alexander Kotenkov, Yeltsin's envoy to the Duma, quickly
dismissed the statement as having no legal meaning, since Russian
law gives the lower house no power to make an inquest into the
president's health.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff Yuri Yarov said
Wednesday that the president will remain in the hospital through
the end of the week, but may return to the Kremlin next Monday.
	   Yeltsin has been handling limited paperwork and holding
telephone conversations at the government clinic where he's been
recovering for 11 days.
	   Yeltsin was expected to hold a telephone conversation on
Wednesday with French President Jacques Chirac. Later this week,
the president plans to meet Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Yarov
was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Another Yeltsin aide, Oleg Sysuyev, said Tuesday that Yeltsin,
known as a restless patient, is urging doctors to discharge him as
soon as possible.
	   Last week, the Kremlin acknowledged for the first time that
Yeltsin suffered several heart attacks in 1996 before he underwent
bypass surgery. The Russian media had been reporting this for some
time.
	   Renat Akchurin, the surgeon who operated on Yeltsin, said the
current bout of pneumonia, the second in as many years, is
apparently due to the president's weakened immunity and his age,
not heart problems.
	   Akchurin, speaking in an interview with the weekly Argumenty i
Fakty, said he has not examined Yeltsin for eight months, but
believed that heart problems were unlikely.
	   The doctor urged Yeltsin to heed doctors' advice.
	   ``Pneumonia sometimes brings even healthy people to a tragic
end,'' Akchurin said. ``For those with a record of heart illness,
it always has a quite serious character.''
	   Yeltsin has made only rare public appearances in recent months,
and was visiting the Kremlin only two or three days a week before
he fell ill. Primakov has taken over many day-to-day duties in
Yeltsin's absence.

Schalke libero out for the season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) _ Schalke, the 1997 UEFA Cup winner
which has slid into the relegation zone of the Bundesliga after a
string of poor results, received another setback Wednesday with the
news that libero Olaf Thon is probably out for the season.
	   The 32-year-old Schalke captain, who retired from the German
national team after the World Cup, needs surgery for an Achilles'
tendon injury.
	   ``If he doesn't have surgery, he wouldn't be able to continue
his career,'' Schalke coach Huub Stevens said.
	   Thon's surgery added to Schalke's injury misery and club
officials said they would start looking for replacement players on
the transfer market.
	   With three wins in 15 games, Schalke has sank to 16th in the
18-team Bundesliga.

Man shot in latest incident of Macau violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A man believed to be involved in Macau's
gambling industry was seriously injured in a drive-by shooting late
Wednesday, apparently the latest in a string of slayings linked to
casino payoffs in the Portuguese enclave, Hong Kong media reports
said.
	   The unidentified man, sitting in his parked car near a
firehouse, was shot three times in his stomach, arm and foot by two
assailants who drove by on motorcycles, government-owned Radio Hong
Kong said.
	   The victim, believed to be in his 20s, was hospitalized in
serious condition, Asia Television said. No other details were
available.
	   Macau, a popular gambling and tourist spot at the tip of south
China, has been hit recently with gangland-style shootings, arson
and other attacks that have killed six people this year, including
three government officials.
	   Police have blamed the violence on Chinese gangs, called triads,
who are fighting over payoffs from casinos whose profits have been
shrinking because of Asia's economic downturn.
	   The violence prompted China to announce last month that it will
send an elite detachment of soldiers to try to halt the violence
after Macau reverts to Chinese rule next year.
	   Beijing said the troops will protect social order and maintain
economic development in the territory, 40 miles (64 kilometers)
west of Hong Kong.

Indy-car racing, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
	   The date for the U.S. Grand Prix, the first in a multi-year
agreement, will be announced in the future, IMS president Tony
George said.
	   It will be the first Formula One race in the United States since
Ayrton Senna won at Phoenix in 1991.
	   ``This is a project that we have pursued since 1991, and is now
about to become a reality,'' George said in a prepared release.
	   Indianapolis used to be used for only one event a year, the
Indianapolis 500 at the end of May. But in 1994, the speedway added
the Brickyard 400, which has become one of the five big events in
American stock car racing.
	   This year, the International Race of Champions stock car race
also made Indianapolis part of its series.
	   ``Our vision as a company is international leadership in
motorsport entertainment, and the U.S. Grand Prix underscores the
reality of that vision,'' George said.
	   The addition of a road course to the 4-kilometer (2 1-2-mile)
oval will be the first major reconfiguration since it was built in
1909.
	   The U.S. Grand Prix will be run on a permament, 4.07-kilometer
(2.53-mile) circuit to be built within the speedway, much to the
approval of Bernie Ecclestone, Formula One's chief executive.
	   ``I know the Speedway will look after us and see that we have a
home for Formula One for years to come,'' Ecclestone said.
	   The Formula One race will start on the main straightaway and
drivers will then negotiate a 13-turn course. The course will wind
through the north infield, south on the current Hulman Boulevard,
turn east just north of the Hall of Fame Museum and exit back onto
the Speedway's oval near Turn Two.
	   The cars will then run clockwise on the oval, which is the
reverse of the direction used for the Indianapolis 500 and
Brickyard 400.
	   Kevin Forbes, who designed the course, said the infield holes of
the Brickyard Crossing golf course won't be affected.
	   The Speedway announced that work on the mult-million dollar
project for the race already has begun with the removal of items in
the rooms outside the existing Tower Terrace grandstand, which will
be torn down starting in December. Thirty-six Formula One garages
topped by 12 suites will replace them.
	   Officials also announced that a new 400-seat press building will
be constructed.
	   The Indianapolis 500 was considered an official Formula One
event from 1950 to 1960 despite the fact that very few of the
Formula One regulars competed in the event.
	   Not withstanding the Indianapolis 500, a U.S. Grand Prix race
was a regular fixture on the Formula One circuit from 1959 until
1991, with some years including two events and in 1982 three. But
declining attendance and interest failed to attract an organizer
after 1991.

Stranded film crew: six weeks of boredom, despair and dish

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After six weeks cooped up in a dark, arctic cabin,
a three-member documentary film crew returned to civilization
Wednesday little the worse for wear but happy for a change of
scenery.
	   ``I'm happy that we're not buried in that hut under the snow,''
Japanese producer Tatsuhiko Kabayashi told reporters after he and
his international crew arrived at a Moscow airport.
	   The three had gone to Wrangel Island, off Russia's far northeast
coast, to film polar bears in September, and had intended to leave
Oct. 15. But early, severe winter weather had stranded them until
their helicopter rescue Tuesday.
	   At that point, they were down to their last five days' food
rations, temperatures were down to minus 30 C (minus 22 F) and the
long arctic night was beginning to take its toll.
	   ``It was practically complete darkness and snowstorms, and we
had nothing to do but stay in our hut,'' Kabayashi said. ``So we
sat in the darkness, because we had to save fuel. ... We were
sitting there listening to the sound of the snowstorms outside. It
drove me to despair.''
	   The other members of the crew were considerably more upbeat
about the experience, which was cushioned by a generator, satellite
telephone and e-mail. Still, they acknowledged that it got a bit
boring.
	   ``For my part, the experience has been one involving a lot of
patience and a lot of waiting, but not one of great hardship,''
said cameraman Rory McGuinness of New Zealand. ``If not for the
fact that we were stuck, I think it would have been a very positive
experience.''
	   A Russian crew member, naturalist Nikita Ovsyanikov, stressed
that the group was never in any danger. Had their food run out, he
said, villagers 125 kilometers (80 miles) away would have
undertaken an arduous journey by snow tractor to rescue them.
	   That became moot on Tuesday, when the weather finally cleared
enough for an emergency helicopter to get to the crew's hut, on
Wrangel's Cape Blossom.
	   McGuinness acknowledged that the stranded trio got on each
other's nerves. He described their hut as the size of a
``smallish'' Moscow apartment, which is about as small as human
habitat gets.
	   ``There were conflicts over things like who was going to do the
dishes tonight. ... I think that, given that we were three men
stuck in a hut for six weeks, we did OK,'' he said.
	   Kobayashi, who works for Japan's NHK television, was bothered by
complications from eye surgery that had taken place before the
trip. He showed no ill effects at the airport news conference
Wednesday.
	   He said the crew's work earlier in the fall had gone well. Among
the scenes they captured was a mother polar bear giving birth, and
later romping with her offspring.
	   McGuinness said some of the best scenes came after they got
stuck. But it was a mixed blessing: He ran out of film in
mid-November. After that, he said, ``I was left to simply enjoy the
experience. That was great.''
	   McGuinness bristled a bit at suggestions that the crew had shown
irresponsibility by not getting out sooner, or that they had
planned their trip poorly.
	   ``The fact that we stayed there six weeks longer than we planned
was an indication of fairly good contingency planning in the food
department,'' he said.

Rwandan soldiers captured in Congo transferred to Zimbabwe

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ At least 40 Rwandans captured in the
Congolese war were transferred to Zimbabwe in the hope of
exchanging them for Zimbabweans held by Rwandan-backed rebels, aid
workers said Wednesday.
	   Rwandan authorities, however, have so far ruled out a prisoner
exchange, although they said they were in contact with Zimbabwean
authorities and were willing to facilitate visits with the
captives.
	   Zimbabwe is fighting Rwandan- and Ugandan-backed rebels in an
uprising launched four months ago to oust Congolese President
Laurent Kabila.
	   The rebels, a coalition of disaffected soldiers and politicians,
accuse Kabila of corruption, nepotism and inciting ethnic strife.
	   Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent soldiers to back
Kabila.
	   It wasn't clear how many Rwandan soldiers Congolese authorities
were holding, the aid workers said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Last week, Ugandan Foreign Minister Amama Mbabazi said Rwanda
and Uganda had captured 600 pro-Kabila fighters, including at least
16 Zimbabweans taken by rebels in October when their plane
mistakenly landed at an eastern airstrip under rebel control.
	   In northern Congo, rebels say they are holding at least 200
Chadian prisoners, most of them in Kisangani.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross, which registers
prisoners of war and helps them exchange messages with their
families, said since September it had recorded the names of 594
people, mainly captured Congolese rebels and Rwandan soldiers, in
prisons in Kinshasa.
	   The Red Cross also said in a statement it has started to visit
POWs held by the Congolese rebels in Goma, the eastern rebel
stronghold, but gave no figures.
	   The Red Cross said it has visited 2,500 people detained in
Congo, including Tutsi civilians held on suspicion of aiding rebels
in the southern city of Lubumbashi.

Netanyahu and ministers visit south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS. Leads throughout with Cabinet visit to northern
border, Netanyahu comments, report of U.S. message to Syria, ADDS
Byline &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With public calls for a troop withdrawal
intensifying, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and members of his
Cabinet toured Israeli-occupied south Lebanon Wednesday, where
seven soldiers have been killed over the past two weeks.
	   The tour was part of Cabinet discussions on reassessing Israel's
15-year military presence in the area but the government was not
expected to make any immediate policy changes and Netanyahu said he
would not bend to public pressure.
	   Israel is at war with Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas in
south Lebanon, which claimed responsibility for the deaths of the
seven soldiers last month and 16 others killed there this year.
Israel patrols a self-styled security zone there to prevent
cross-border attacks by Hezbollah on Israeli communities.
	   ``We are here to defend the children and the villages and the
citizens in northern Israel and that is the major goal. If we can
find a way to defend northern Israel without (the army) being here,
we'll take them out,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   Netanyahu has said he would withdraw troops if Lebanon would
guarantee the safety of their shared border. Both Lebanon and
Syria, the main power-broker there, want Israel to unilaterally
withdraw from foreign soil and have refused to give such
guarantees.
	   Israel believes Syria is allowing the conflict there to escalate
in order to force Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights as
well, a strategic plateau Israel captured from Syria in the 1967
Mideast war.
	   After two weeks of intense fighting between Israeli troops and
Hezbollah, the United States, fearing further violence, sent a
warning to Syria that Israel may attack Syrian troops also
stationed in Lebanon if the flow of weapons to Hezbollah in the
south is not plugged up, the Yediot Aharonot newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   U.S. intelligence has confirmed that Iranian-purchased weapons
for Hezbollah pass unheeded through Damascus airport and reach the
guerrilla group by land routes to south Lebanon.
	   ``We will not be able to prevent Israel from acting against
Syrian targets if the situation in south Lebanon continues to
deteriorate,'' read the U.S. message to Syria, according to the
mass-circulation daily.
	   Israel's Ambassador to the U.S., Zalman Shoval, reportedly told
Netanyahu this week that the United States informed Damascus it
would be a ``mistake'' for them to think that an intensification of
the conflict in Lebanon would pressure Israel to renew peace talks
with Syria.
	   Larry Schwartz, the spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Israel,
would not comment on the report but said the State Department has
sent messages to Israel, Syria and Lebanon urging them to act with
restraint.
	   In all, 23 Israeli soldiers have died in the security zone this
year, widening public debate over how to end years of occupation in
Lebanon. Some argue that a unilateral withdrawal is the only way
out, while others say without guarantees, Israeli civilians living
in the north would be vulnerable to attack.
	   Meanwhile, three Lebanese civilians are on trial in an Israeli
military court accused of passing intelligence information and
explosive charges to Hezbollah.
	   The trial is being held behind closed doors, but the court
released the names of two of the accused, Bulos Abu-Zeid, an
officer in the Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army and Ibrahim
Abu-Zeid. The third defendant was not named.
	   The military prosecutor submitted confessions signed by the
accused, but they said these were not given voluntarily, and the
court is currently considering whether the confessions are
acceptable.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Two dozen Palestinians ambushed an
Israeli car Wednesday, smashed its windshields with stones, then
pulled an Israeli soldier out of the vehicle and kicked and beat
him with stones.
	   Attackers shouted ``Yahudi, Yahudi,'' Arabic for ``Jew, Jew.''
	   The soldier cowered by the car door, holding his hands up to
fend off blows as several Palestinians struck his head with rocks.
After about a minute of relentless attack, the soldier got up and
ran, bleeding from the head.
	   As he escaped, his assailants stole his M-16 assault rifle,
threw more stones at him, then doused the car with kerosene and set
it on fire.
	   Earlier Wednesday, a 41-year-old Palestinian street cleaner,
Osama Musa Natche, was stabbed to death in what police believe was
an attack by an Israeli extremist.
	   Hundreds joined Natche's funeral procession along Salah Eddin
Street, the main thoroughfare of traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
Dozens of marchers broke away and hurled stones at Israeli riot
police who fired rubber bullets.
	   In a side street, Palestinians stoned an Israeli motorist,
pulled him out of the car and then set the vehicle on fire, said
Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby.
	   The renewed violence came just 10 days before U.S. President
Bill Clinton was to arrive in Israel and the Palestinian areas to
usher in the next stage of the Wye River land-for-security
agreement he helped negotiate in October.
	   There has also been fresh acrimony between Israeli and
Palestinian leaders, with both sides accusing each other of
violating the accord. However, an Israeli official said that as of
now, the Clinton visit was still on.
	   The stone-throwing attack in the West Bank began when about 150
students from Bir Zeit University were bused to downtown Ramallah
to protest Israel's refusal to release a large number of
Palestinians jailed for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The march was organized by university groups allied with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction and the Islamic
militant group Hamas.
	   The demonstrators, most of them Fatah followers, then walked to
the outskirts of Ramallah, and began stoning Israeli cars at a
traffic circle about half a mile (a kilometer) from the Jewish
settlement of Beit El.
	   At one point, a white car with Israeli license plates
approached. The vehicle was driven by a man wearing a skullcap, and
a soldier was in the passenger seat.
	   To shouts of ``Yahudi, Yahudi,'' two dozen Palestinians began
pelting the car with stones and smashing its windows. The driver
stopped the car and ran away after a large rock struck him in the
face. The attackers then converged on the soldier and attacked him.
	   Israeli troops fired live ammunition and a barrage of
rubber-coated metal bullets and tear gas. Eleven Palestinians were
lightly injured by rubber bullets.
	   A student organizer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the car attack had not been planned. He said student leaders would
try to find those who had seized the soldier's weapon and turn them
over to Palestinian police.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan,
held the Palestinian Authority responsible for the incident, saying
it had incited to violence over the prisoners' issue.
	   Bar-Illan also said the attack was ``a gross and dangerous''
violation of the Wye River agreement.
	   A day earlier, the speaker of the Palestinian legislative
council, Ahmed Qureia, told protesters seeking the release of
Palestinian prisoners that ``the leadership that threw stones is
prepared once again to throw stones in order to free the people and
to free the land.''
	   Also Wednesday, Bar-Illan confirmed that Netanyahu complained to
Clinton that the Palestinians have repeatedly violated the peace
agreement. In a letter, he asked Clinton to use his influence to
halt the violations.
	   Bar-Illan said the letter indicates ``there is a danger to the
peace process if the violations continue.''
	   In the letter, Bar-Illan said, Netanyahu objected to recent
statements by Arafat and others that a Palestinian state would be
declared on May 4, 1999.
	   The Wye accord urges both Israel and the Palestinians to refrain
from unilateral steps that prejudge the outcome of talks on a
permanent peace accord.

Judge orders halt to customs strike; protests continue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with customs unions threatening to continue strike,
nationwide strike called for Dec. 15 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A judge Wednesday ordered an end to a
customs officers strike that has left gas stations dry and people
bundling up in unheated homes.
	   But strikers said it was up to their union leaders whether to go
back to work and warned the walkout could continue.
	   Unionists threatened to ignore the court order by changing their
demands. As the court found the specific strike demands illegal, it
would have to issue a new order if they are changed.
	   A decision by union leaders could come late Wednesday.
	   The government had appealed for a court order declaring the
strike illegal. All non-European Union shipments of fuel and other
goods have been stranded at ports and border crossings since
Monday, when the five-day strike began.
	   The customs workers are protesting plans to consolidate their
pension funds with other agencies.
	   The strike has severely cut the flow of gasoline and heating oil
into Greece. Many gas stations were tapped out and apartment
managers and homeowners turned off burners to try to conserve
heating fuel.
	   Temperatures dropped to about 6 degrees Celsius (43 F) in some
rural areas in northern Greece on Wednesday.
	   Civil aviation workers held work stoppages Wednesday that
resulted in flight cancellations. Railway workers also began a
three-day work stoppage.
	   The strikes are just a few of the work stoppages currently in
Greece. Bus drivers, tax officials, doctors at state-run hospitals
and teachers had walkouts planned this week. Labor groups also have
announced a 24-hour strike for Dec. 15.
	   The strikes are part of growing labor union opposition to
government fiscal reforms aimed at qualifying Greece for the
European Union's single currency club by 2001.
	   Greece is the only country of the 15-member EU that failed to
qualify for the first round of the single currency. Britain,
Denmark and Sweden opted out of joining.

At least 60 dead in fighting over jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ At least 60 people have been killed
and another 150 injured following three weeks of sporadic fighting
set off by a dispute over jobs with a Swedish relief agency in
southwestern Somalia.
	   Representatives of two sub-clans in and around the town of Sakow
that are competing for jobs with Swedish Church Relief said in
Mogadishu Wednesday that fighting had intensified and both sides
were bringing in vehicles mounted with machine guns.
	   Sakow is 380 kilometers (240 miles) southwest of Mogadishu.
	   Since Somalia descended into civil war and famine after the
ouster of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991, armed militia based
on clans or sub-clans have carved out territories in which they
feel entitled to all the available jobs and relief supplies.
	   Aid agencies unfamiliar with clan turf wars or trying to bridge
the gap are often caught in the middle.
	   The current dispute pits the Moallimweyne and Geladleh sub-clans
against each other.
	   Sheikh Qasim Ibrahim Nur, a spokesman for the Rahanwein clan of
which Geladleh is a sub-clan, warned that the conflict could spread
as other sub-clans come to the Geladlehs' support.
	   VHF radion reports from Sakow say thousands of residents have
fled the town as the fighting spreads.
	   Radio reports Wednesday said 15 people were killed in battles
Tuesday when Moallimweyne militiamen attacked Geladleh fighters
north of Sakow on the road to Bardera.

Justice Minister outraged by magistrate's anti-Semitic statement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou said
Wednesday she was outraged by an anti-Semitic statement penned by
one of the nation's leading magistrates.
	   A French court announced Tuesday it would open an investigation
into Alain Terrail, honorary president of France's magistrates'
union, for using anti-Semitic language in an attack against Alain
Levy, deputy prosecutor in Toulon.
	   Levy, who is Jewish, is currently under investigation for having
violated France's confidentiality law by leaking information about
a school cafeteria scandal in Toulon, a southern French city
controlled by the extreme-right National Front.
	   In an article published in the magistrates' union bulletin,
Terrail attacked Levy, modifying a well-known French proverb to
say: ``Levy has gone so often to the ovens, that he ends up getting
burned.''
	   Guigou said she was scandalized by the statement, which is
widely regarded as a reference to the crematoria in which the
bodies of Jews killed in Nazi gas chambers during World War II were
burned.
	   In France, it is against the law to make anti-Semitic remarks.
	   Terrail said the statement - a truncated version of the original
French saying - was an oversight, and that he did not proofread the
article before it went to press.
	   The magistrates' union, some of whose members are widely
regarded as being sympathetic to the extreme right, said the affair
spelled out their ``death certificate.''
	   Union president Georges Fenech said the ``mistake was so
serious,'' the union would meet next week to decide what action it
would take.
	   Terrail is the founder and honorary president of the union, and
is currently a magistrate in France's highest appeals court.

<TEXT>
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Faced with loss of control of
Parliament and claims of nepotism, corruption and a threat to kill
a political opponent, Prime Minister Keith Mitchell effectively
dismissed Grenada's legislature on Tuesday.
	   He did not set a date for new elections. But his announcement on
national television means people in the former British Caribbean
colony must go to the polls within 90 days.
	   Mitchell's announcement came two days after Foreign and Legal
Affairs Minister Raphael Fletcher resigned, charging that
government contracts at inflated prices were improperly being given
to friends and supporters of the government.
	   Mitchell has accused Fletcher of being backed by Libya in a
sinister plot to bring down the government and have himself elected
prime minister.
	   In addition, Fletcher is now under police guard following a
radio report that the government had ordered him killed.
	   Both men have denied all the allegations.
	   Neverthelesss, the suggestion of a Libyan connection has raised
fears that the United States, which has declared Libya a terrorist
state, might block aid to Grenada through international agencies
like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
	   In 1983, the United States invaded Grenada in the chaos
surrounding a failed Marxist revolution, saying the island was in
danger of becoming a satellite of Cuba.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ NATO forces on Wednesday arrested
a Bosnian Serb general charged with genocide and crimes against
humanity in the 1995 massacre of Muslims fleeing Srebrenica.
	   Gen. Radislav Krstic was arrested in a part of northern Bosnia
controlled by U.S. troops serving in NATO's Stabilization Force,
better known as SFOR.
	   SFOR spokeswoman Maj. Sheena Thomson said that Krstic was
arrested Wednesday without incident and would be sent for trial to
the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal at The Hague.
	   Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour called Krstic ``a very
significant military leader.'' The Canadian expressed delight at
the arrest of Krstic, who was indicted in October.
	   Arbour said Krstic was indicted in offenses allegedly committed
after rebel Serbs took over the U.N. safe haven of Srebrenica in
eastern Bosnia in July 1995. Thousands of Muslims were massacred.
	   Amor Masovic, the head of a Bosnian Muslim commission unearthing
mass graves containing victims of the 3 1/2-year war, said he
expected the case to yield important facts related 8,000 people
still missing from Srebrenica.
	   ``I'm very pleased that one of ... the executors of genocide,
the destruction of the entire population of a wider region of
Bosnia made it to The Hague,'' he said.
	   Krstic is the commander of the 5th Corps of the Bosnian Serb
Army. He is believed to be a close associate of former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief Gen. Ratko
Mladic.
	   Both Karadzic and Mladic have been indicted for genocide for
allegedly masterminding the Srebrenica massacre, but neither is in
custody.
	   ``Persons indicted for war crimes who are still at large should
realize they, too, will be brought to justice,'' said NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana.
	   Krstic is the ninth war crimes suspect to be arrested in the
former Yugoslavia by international forces. He was named head of the
Drina Corps of the Bosnian Serb Army in 1995, after the fall of
Srebrenica.

Basketball body FIBA agrees to free player movement worldwide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Club basketball is entering a new era of
freedom of movement.
	   Under an agreement announced Wednesday by world governing body
FIBA, basketball players will be free to join any club team in the
world without restriction.
	   FIBA, which has previously restricted European club teams to two
non-European players, has agreed in principle to the free movement
of players worldwide.
	   ``What it means is a team like Real Madrid could field 10
Americans if they wanted,'' FIBA spokesman Florian Wanninger said.
``It puts us in line with the NBA, which has no limit of any kind
on foreign players.''
	   Seventeen of FIBA's 20-member central board voted in favor of
the change, which could be in force next season. Details are
expected to be ironed out at a FIBA meeting in May in Barcelona,
Spain.
	   The proposed change is an extension of the so-called Bosman
ruling in soccer, issued three years ago by the European Union's
highest court. That decision prohibited soccer clubs in the 15
European Union countries from setting limits on players from other
EU countries.
	   FIBA has also proposed the change to end the practice of non-EU
players seeking EU passports in order to be counted as a national
player instead of a foreigner.
	   The increasing practice has set off disputes between national
basketball federations.
	   At this year's World Championship in Athens, 6-11 (2.12 meter)
Dragan Tarlac _ a Yugoslav with a Greek passport who plays with
Greek club Olympiakos _ declined to play for Yugoslavia's national
team for fear of a legal battle.
	   ``In a world of globalization and liberalization, free movement
is the logical consequence,'' Wanninger said.

EU calls for fines against Luxembourg for labor law discrimination
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission asked the
European Court of Justice Wednesday to fine Luxembourg for
reserving public sector jobs for its own nationals.
	   The European Union executive body proposed fines of 14,000
European currency units (dlrs 16,000) every day until Luxembourg
complies with a 1996 judgment from the EU high court which said the
Grand Duchy infringed EU laws on the free movement of labor.
	   According to the Court ruling, most public jobs in the 15 EU
nations should be open to all European Union citizens.
	   Luxembourg has claimed in its defense that the changes required
involve major reforms of its constitution and legal system. The
Commission pointed out the EU rules on public service employment
were adopted more than 10 years ago allowing plenty of time for to
introduce the chances.

news reports said.
	   No casualties were reported, and the blaze was extinguished
Wednesday evening, the Interfax news agency reported. It was
unclear whether anyone was in the building when it caught fire.
	   The cause of the fire, in central Moscow, was also unclear.
	   More than 10 fire trucks and a firefighting helicopter were sent
to the scene, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   At least 15 floors of the building were ablaze, including
scaffolding, timber and building materials, Interfax and the
ITAR-Tass news agency said. Gusts of wind carried burning fragments
of plastic into nearby streets.

U.N.'s Robinson says Ireland shaping models for human rights
</HEADLINE>
commissions &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Northern Ireland &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Both parts of Ireland are
leading the way in shaping human rights standards for Europe and
the world, the United Nations' human rights commissioner said
Wednesday.
	   Mary Robinson, who was president of the Irish Republic before
she took up the U.N. post in September 1997, visited Belfast as the
British government launched its recruitment drive for a Northern
Ireland human rights commission.
	   She said it had been ``very heart-warming'' to watch the
development of April's peace agreement between the British and
Irish governments and eight Northern Irish parties, which included
plans for human rights commissions in both the British-ruled north
and independent Irish Republic.
	   ``The island of Ireland will have the first two fully recognized
national human rights commissions in Western Europe,'' she said.
``And there are other governments in Western Europe looking closely
at establishing national human rights commissions.''
	   Paul Murphy, Britain's No. 2 minister in Northern Ireland, said
the 10-member commission should be advising the British government
by February 1999. It is also to advise the newly devolved Northern
Ireland government.
	   ``We are looking for people who are sensitive to the different
perspectives in Northern Ireland on human rights matters,'' he
said.
	   April's agreement specified that the Northern Ireland commission
should draft a Bill of Rights for citizens, ensuring equality of
treatment between the province's British Protestant majority and
Irish Catholic minority.
	   The Irish Republic's commission would be expected to monitor
state support for traditionally disadvantaged groups, such as
women, the disabled, nomadic gypsies and a growing illegal
immigrant population.
	   In keeping with the agreement's goal of promoting cooperation
between both parts of Ireland, the two human rights committees are
expected to meet periodically and promote joint initiatives.

Formula One to return to United States in 2000 at Indianapolis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS more comment from George. &QL; 
 &UR; By HANK LOWENKRON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Formula One will return to the United States
in 2000 for the first time in nine years _ and to the home of
Indy-car racing, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
	   The date for the U.S. Grand Prix, the first in a multi-year
agreement, will be announced in the future, IMS president Tony
George said.
	   It will be the first Formula One race in the United States since
Ayrton Senna won at Phoenix in 1991.
	   ``This is a project that we have pursued since 1991, and is now
about to become a reality,'' George said in a prepared release.
	   Indianapolis used to be used for only one event a year, the
Indianapolis 500 at the end of May. But in 1994, the speedway added
the Brickyard 400, which has become one of the five big events in
American stock car racing.
	   This year, the International Race of Champions stock car race
also made Indianapolis part of its series.
	   ``The U.S. Grand Prix will join the Indianapolis 500 and the
Brickyard 400 at the world's most famous speedway, underscoring the
words that are chiseled in stone over the entrance of this
building, the racing capital of the world,'' George said in a news
conference at the Hall of Fame Museum in the speedway infield.
	   The event will be the first F-1 race in the United States since
1991.
	   ``Formula One represents the most technologically advanced road
racing series in the world, and it's the best known racing outside
the United States,'' George said.
	   ``We plan to assist Formula One in re-establishing the grand
prix in the United States.''
	   The addition of a road course to the 4-kilometer (2 1-2-mile)
oval will be the first major reconfiguration since it was built in
1909.
	   The U.S. Grand Prix will be run on a permament, 4.07-kilometer
(2.53-mile) circuit to be built within the speedway, much to the
approval of Bernie Ecclestone, Formula One's chief executive.
	   ``I know the Speedway will look after us and see that we have a
home for Formula One for years to come,'' Ecclestone said.
	   The Formula One race will start on the main straightaway and
drivers will then negotiate a 13-turn course. The course will wind
through the north infield, south on the current Hulman Boulevard,
turn east just north of the Hall of Fame Museum and exit back onto
the Speedway's oval near Turn Two.
	   The cars will then run clockwise on the oval, which is the
reverse of the direction used for the Indianapolis 500.
	   ``There's a lot that remains to be done to have our facility
ready for the new millennium, and this is going to be a very
important event for us,'' George said.
	   ``There's a lot that remains to be done to have our facility
ready for the new millennium, and this is going to be a very
important event for us,'' George said.
	   ``It's going to really establish the face of the Indianapolis
Motor Speedway heading into the new millennium,'' he said.
	   Kevin Forbes, who designed the course, said the infield holes of
the Brickyard Crossing golf course won't be affected.
	   The Speedway announced that work on the mult-million dollar
project for the race already has begun with the removal of items in
the rooms outside the existing Tower Terrace grandstand, which will
be torn down starting in December. Thirty-six Formula One garages
topped by 12 suites will replace them.
	   Officials also announced that a new 400-seat press building will
be constructed.
	   The Indianapolis 500 was considered an official Formula One
event from 1950 to 1960 despite the fact that very few of the
Formula One regulars competed in the event.
	   Notwithstanding the Indianapolis 500, a U.S. Grand Prix race was
a regular fixture on the Formula One circuit from 1959 to 1991,
with some years including two events and in 1982 three. But
declining attendance and interest failed to attract an organizer
after 1991.
	   The agreement calls for a major financial commitment by George,
including about dlrs 10 million to host the race and another dlrs
15 million for track improvements.
	   Indianapolis wasn't the only city that considered luring the
series. Other cities believed to have made bids were San Francisco,
Las Vegas and Atlanta.
	   The only Formula One race in North America now is the Canadian
Grand Prix held in Montreal in June. Ecclestone wanted to run a
race in the United States closer to the Canadian Grand Prix at
Montreal in early June so the series would have to make only one
trip to North America.

	   If successful, Ecevit's government would be Turkey's fifth since
1995.
	   ``I will do my best to form a government that will win a
confidence vote as soon as possible,'' Ecevit told reporters after
a 45-minute meeting with Demirel.
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz' government collapsed on Nov. 25 in
a no-confidence vote in Parliament. Opposition parties accused
Yilmaz of entertaining ties with mobsters and rigging the sale of a
state bank.
	   Yilmaz, a center-right leader, is expected to back an Ecevit-led
government, but there are doubts whether Turkey's other main
center-right leader, former premier Tansu Ciller, will do the same.
	   A three-party coalition would have a large majority in
parliament.
	   Ecevit would be the glue between Yilmaz and Mrs. Ciller, whose
longtime rivalry led to a government collapse in 1996.
	   ``This will be a strong, determined government that will have
the support of Parliament,'' Ecevit said.
	   Three times prime minister since 1974, the staunchly secular
leftist is said to have the support of the all-powerful military.
	   Ecevit said he would begin negotiations with party leaders on
Friday.
	   By tradition, the president designates the leader of the largest
party in Parliament. But the largest party, the pro-Islamic Virtue
Party, is opposed by the military, which pressured Turkey's first
Islamic-led government out of office last year.
	   Ecevit, 73, is best remembered for ordering the 1974 invasion of
Cyprus by Turkish troops in the wake of a short-lived coup by
supporters of union with Greece.

	   When upstart Italy faces defending champion Sweden starting

be no one from among the top 30 in the ATP world rankings playing
singles at the final.
	   That could change if Sweden's Thomas Johansson, rated 17th, is
called on after originally being ruled out with a nagging right
knee injury. He has practiced in Milan this week.
	   Otherwise, No. 31 Magnus Gustafsson is the highlight.
	   Italy, meanwhile, is led by Andrea Gaudenzi, who is 44th, three
spots ahead of teammate Davide Sanguinetti _ who did make a splash
at Wimbledon this summer, advancing to the quarterfinals.
	   ``We might not be phenomenal, but we haven't done too badly so
far,'' the excitable Gaudenzi said. ``Hey, we did reach the Davis
Cup final.''
	   Thanks, in large part, to Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi. That
duo opted out of the U.S. team for the semifinal against Italy,
which humbled a third-string American unit 4-1 to reach its first
Davis Cup final since 1980.
	   After Thursday's draw, play starts Friday with two singles
matches, followed by the doubles Saturday, and the two reverse
singles matches Sunday.
	   Gaudenzi could be the key.
	   Bothered by a shoulder injury, the former junior No. 1 has not
played an official match since the September semifinal, but will be
counted on to play two singles matches plus team with Diego Nargiso
in the doubles.
	   Sweden will go with Gustaffson and either Johansson or Magnus
Norman in the singles, while Jonas Bjorkman and Nicklas Kulti are
the likely doubles pairing.
	   Sweden has a much richer tennis history _ running from Bjorn
Borg to Mats Wilander to Stefan Edberg _ and six Davis Cup
trophies, including two of the last three.
	   Italy, by contrast, won its lone title in 1976, and has lost in
five other finals.
	   But as host, Italy was able to select the surface, rarely used
indoor clay, and its fans can be counted on to transform a cozy
arena into a soccer stadium, replete with raucous chanting.
	   The Italian Tennis Federation essentially auctioned off the
event to the highest bidding city, and then got into a flap with
the players over prize money.
	   Gaudenzi led the protest, saying it was ``ridiculous'' to expect
the players to accept 200 million lire (dlrs 120,000) in the event
of victory.
	   ``There was no dialogue, they did not discuss it with us,'' he
said, referring to the federation. ``There are plenty of countries'
teams that have been given more than us _ France, Germany, England.
But who got to the final?''

EU's Santer calls for independent fraud unit in wake of scandals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Commission President Jacques
Santer proposed plans for a separate independent fraud unit
Wednesday in an attempt to counter fraud allegations against the
EU's executive office.
	   ``It is healthy to have a clear separation between the
controllers and the controlled,'' Santer said, following
accusations the in-house fraud unit UCLAF did not function
properly.
	   Santer proposed creating a new Fraud Investigation Office to
complement and reinforce UCLAF.
	   Several fraud scandals this year have dented the integrity of
the Commission, which handles an annual budget of some 85 billion
European currency units (dlrs 100 billion).
	   ``The creation of such an office is in line with the
Commission's commitment to protect the European taxpayers' money,''
a Commission statement said.
	   EU officials had investigated the disappearance of some 500,000
ecus (dlrs 550,000) from Commission's humanitarian aid coffers and
one ECHO official has been suspended.
	   The missing funds were part of four aid contracts earmarked for
ex-Yugoslavia and Rwanda in 1993-1994, totaling 2.4 million ecus
(dlrs 2.6 million).
	   EU Research Commissioner Edith Cresson has filed suit in a
French court case against the Liberation newspaper for defamation
after the Paris daily alleged the former French prime minister was
involved in irregularities in awarding a commission contract.
	   Santer said the Commission had dealt with 49 cases of fraud and
``other forms of reprehensible behavior,'' and 8 officials have
been removed from their post.

Russian parliament votes to restore statue of infamous police
</HEADLINE>
chief &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian parliament's lower house overwhelmingly
voted in favor Wednesday of resurrecting a statue of a dreaded
Soviet secret police chief in the center of Moscow.
	   The Communist-dominated State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, voted 237-69 to give preliminary approval to the
resolution asking the Moscow city government to return the statue
of Felix Dzerzhinsky to the spot it occupied for decades in front
of the old KGB headquarters.
	   The statue should be restored as a ``symbol of fight against
crime in Russia,'' the Duma said in the resolution, which still
requires final approval at a later date.
	   Once finalized, however, the declaration would carry no legal
meaning.
	   The towering bronze statue of ``Iron Felix,'' head of the Cheka,
the first Soviet secret police, was a landmark during the Soviet
era. It was toppled by pro-democracy protesters in 1991 and has
since languished with other Soviet-era statues in a city park.
	   Nikolai Kharitonov, head of the pro-Communist Agrarian faction
in the Duma, called for restoring the statue.
	   ``Even the Federal Security Service feels unprotected without
the monument to Dzerzhinsky, who symbolizes the struggle against
crime,'' Kharitonov said Wednesday.
	   The Federal Security Service, known by the Russian acronym of
FSB, occupies the former KGB headquarters as its main successor.
	   The proposal to restore the statue has been denounced by human
rights activists, who said Dzerzhinsky was a symbol of murderous
repression during the Soviet era. Dzerzhinsky headed the secret
police after the Bolshevik Revolution and oversaw the ruthless
crackdowns on political opponents.

Israeli company to pay damages for violating Prozac patent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV (AP) _ Israel's largest pharmaceutical company said
Wednesday it was ordered by a court judge to pay millions of
dollars to U.S. drug manufacturer Eli Lilly and Co. for violating
the company's 20-year patent on the anti-depressant Prozac.
	   The Tel Aviv District Court determined in its ruling that Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries was testing a generic version of Prozac
prior to the expiration of Lilly's patent, said Teva spokeswoman
Ayala Miller.
	   Miller said Teva would likely appeal the ruling.
	   Lilly received a patent to sell Prozac in Israel in 1975, but
research and testing was not completed until 1990. Thus the company
was able to sell the drug in Israel only five years before Teva
jumped in to begin selling immediately after the patent expired.
	   Lilly successfully argued that Teva had developed and tested the
drug during the patent period instead of waiting until the 1995
expiration before they began.
	   Judge Esther Kovo ordered Teva to turn over its financial
records in order for the court to determine how much the company
should pay in damages. The amount is expected to exceed several
million dollars.
	   Teva is a public corporation which is traded in Israel and the
United States and is the fourth largest industrial firm in Israel.
Company sales for 1997 totaled dlrs 1.1 billion, up 17 percent from
the previous year. Teva produces 24 of the top 50 generic drugs in
the United States.

DaimlerChrysler to debut a new sports car at Detroit Motor Show
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ DaimlerChrysler will preview a new
sports car at the Detroit Auto Shows with design features
reminiscent of the legendary 1954 Mercedes 300 SL, the newsmagazine
Stern reported Wednesday.
	   The distinguishing feature of the 500-horsepower auto will be
the doors that open upward _ and the price: dlrs 1 million.
	   Sterns said DaimlerChrysler has not yet decided on the motor,
vacillating between a 12-cylinder bi-turbo, 5.2 liter engine, a
7-liter enhanced version of an old 12-cylinder, or a 5-liter V8
compressor.
	   The project got new momentum after Mika Hakkinen won the Formula
1 driving for the McLaren-Mercedes team on Nov. 1. The new car's
body incorporates McLaren technology, Stern said.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ NATO-led peacekeeping forces today
arrested a Bosnian Serb general charged by the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal with genocide and crimes against humanity in a 1995
massacre of Muslims in Bosnia.
	   Gen. Radislav Krstic was arrested in a section of northern
Bosnia controlled by U.S. troops serving in NATO's Stabilization
Force, better known as SFOR. Krstic is the ninth war crimes suspect
to be arrested in the former Yugoslavia by international forces.
	   Krstic was arrested without incident and would be sent later
today to the tribunal based in The Hague, said SFOR spokeswoman
Maj. Sheena Thomson. No date was set for his arraignment.
	   The International War Crimes Tribunal's chief prosecutor, Louise
Arbour, called Krstic ``a very significant military leader'' and
said she was delighted with the arrest. The tribunal indicted him
in October.
	   Arbour said Krstic's secret indictment covered offenses
allegedly committed during and after the Serb takeover of the U.N.
safe haven of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia in July 1995, where
thousands of Muslims were massacred.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana warned that other war
crimes suspects ``who are still at large should realize they, too,
will be brought to justice.''
	   Amor Masovic, the head of a Bosnian Muslim commission that has
dealt extensively with Srebrenica told The Associated Press he
expected the arrest to uncover important facts related to the
disappearance of more 8,000 people from the town.
	   ``I'm very pleased that one of ... the executors of genocide,
the destruction of the entire population of a wider region of
Bosnia made it to The Hague,'' Masovic said.
	   Krstic is believed to be a close associate of former Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief Gen.
Ratko Mladic, the tribunal's top two indicted suspects. Both have
been indicted for genocide for allegedly masterminding the
Srebrenica massacre, but neither is in custody.

Duma seeks medical report on Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads with 12 grafs to UPDATE with parliament demanding
medical report on Yeltsin's health. Pickup 10th pvs, ``Akchurin,
speaking...'' &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin's foes in parliament today urged the
Russian leader's doctors to release a report on his health for
possible use in removing him from power.
	   Though non-binding, the move increased pressure on Yeltsin, who
remained hospitalized today with pneumonia. The president's
frequent illnesses have eroded his authority and raised concerns
about his ability to serve out his term, which ends in mid-2000,
and to lead his country out of its worst economic crisis since the
1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The Communist-initiated statement, passed by parliament's lower
house, the State Duma, by a 247-33 vote, calls on Yeltsin's doctors
to submit a report on the Russian leader's health within 10 days.
	   ``The absence of trustworthy information on the president's
health has spurred abundant rumors, allegations and even guesswork
diagnosis, such as Parkinson or Alzheimer's disease,'' the
statement said. ``That stirs the public and causes doubts about the
president's ability to exercise his duties.''
	   Alexander Kotenkov, Yeltsin's envoy to the Duma, quickly
dismissed the move, saying it has no legal meaning because Russian
law gives the lower house no power to make an inquest into the
president's health.
	   The Duma also voted to ask the Constitutional Court for an
explanation of a legal provision that permits the termination of a
president's powers due to ``lasting inability to exercise his
duties.'' The constitutional provision doesn't spell out who must
determine that, or how.
	   Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff Yuri Yarov said today the
Russian leader would remain hospitalized through the end of the
week, but may return to the Kremlin on Monday.
	   Yeltsin has been handling limited paperwork and holding
telephone conversations at the government clinic where he has been
recovering for 11 days.
	   Yeltsin was expected to hold a telephone conversation today with
French President Jacques Chirac. Later this week, he plans to meet
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Yarov was quoted as saying by the
Interfax news agency.
	   Another Yeltsin aide, Oleg Sysuyev, said Tuesday that Yeltsin,
known as a restless patient, has been urging doctors to discharge
him as soon as possible.
	   Last week, the Kremlin acknowledged for the first time that
Yeltsin suffered several heart attacks in 1996 before he underwent
bypass surgery. The Russian media have been reporting this for some
time.
	   Renat Akchurin, the surgeon who operated on Yeltsin, said the
current bout of pneumonia, the second in as many years, is
apparently due to the president's weakened immunity and his age,
not heart problems.
	   Akchurin, speaking in an interview with the weekly Argumenty i
Fakty, said he has not examined Yeltsin for eight months, but
believed that heart problems were unlikely.
	   The doctor urged Yeltsin to heed doctors' advice and warned
about possible complications.
	   ``Pneumonia sometimes brings even healthy people to a tragic
end,'' Akchurin said. ``For those with a record of heart illness,
it always has a quite serious character.''
	   Yeltsin has made only rare public appearances in recent months,
and was visiting the Kremlin only two or three days a week before
he fell ill. Primakov has taken over many day-to-day duties in
Yeltsin's absence.

Chief of Kosovo Albanian team says Serbs blocking negotiations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Separatist guerrillas and ethnic
Albanian politicians are nearing agreement on the future of Kosovo,
but Serb officials are stalling talks, a top ethnic Albanian
negotiator said Wednesday.
	   ``It was easy to insist on independence as a final goal, but
this prevented the process from moving forward,'' negotiator Fehmi
Agani said. ``A decisive time has come when we should present a
united stand.''
	   Agani was welcoming the Kosovo Liberation Army statement that it
could agree to something short of full, immediate independence for
Kosovo. It was the first clear indication that separatists would
accept temporary status for Kosovo as a Yugoslav republic.
	   At the same time, Agani accused Serb negotiators of blocking
talks on Kosovo's status and inciting confrontations between the
guerrillas and Serb security forces.
	   Yugoslavia consists of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro.
Kosovo, with a majority ethnic Albanian population, is a province
of Serbia.
	   Since a U.S.-brokered Oct. 12 agreement brought a halt to
full-scale fighting in Kosovo, international diplomatic efforts
have focused on finding a political solution. The West generally
does not favor independence for Kosovo because border changes in
the Balkans often lead to further bloodshed.
	   However, sporadic violence has continued and international
officials are worried that the fragile peace will collapse in new
fighting if a political settlement isn't reached soon.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and as many as 300,000
forced from their homes since a Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian
separatists began in February.
	   Last month, Belgrade authorities rejected a U.S.-sponsored plan
for Kosovo as giving too much independence to the ethnic Albanians.
Serbian officials called it a ``step to full secession.''
	   Serbia countered with its own plan to give Kosovo some autonomy
but maintain firm control.
	   The Serbian proposal is ``catastrophic and destructive ... since
it affirms Serbian rule over Kosovo,'' Agani said Wednesday.

Mother delves into underworld to probe daughter's death
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ For Eleni Fotiadou, the official
explanation was not enough.
	   To probe deeper into the death of her 20-year-old daughter, the
technician at a cellular biology lab shed her white coat for the
miniskirts and high heels of a prostitute. The alter ego was part
of her six-month search through the gritty back streets of this
northern Greek port.
	   Finally, a prosecutor joined her in challenging the coroner's
report that Paraskevi Fotiadou died of a heroin overdose. Eight
people are under indictment on charges of gang rape and murder,
authorities confirmed Wednesday.
	   ``I started dressing like a prostitute and junkie and going to
places where I could get information ... I was sure that my child
was killed,'' Ms. Fotiadou, 44, told a news conference.
	   Her daughter, a marketing student, was sitting on a park bench
with her sister in June. She said she was going to get a drink and
never returned.
	   The young woman was found two days later _ a used syringe at her
side _ in a derelict building located in one of Salonica's
blue-collar districts more than five kilometers (three miles) away.
	   ``We were called to the mortuary to identify the body and we
took it home. Although the man at the mortuary told us not to look
at the body because the days had past, we did. The body was full of
wounds,'' Ms. Fotiadou said.
	   Ms. Fotiadou's refused to accept the explanation that her
daughter was just another statistic in the dozens of deaths among
the junkies in Salonica, a Balkan crossroads with a teeming
underclass fed by prostitution rings and drug smugglers from across
Eastern Europe.
	   ``My child's body was full of bruises, bumps and scrapes ... her
jewelry was gone while her personal effects contained things that
were not hers. Her clothes were torn off, which shows that violence
had been perpetrated,'' she added.
	   Ms. Fotiadou also said the search was launched out of
frustration.
	   ``I went to the police to ask for their help, but they were
completely indifferent,'' she claimed.
	   In August, she made up her mind to take matters into her own
hands. After work, she would come home and make the transformation.
She would rumple her shoulder-length hair. Some days she would wear
attention-grabbing clothing: short skirts and tight tops. Other
times, she would don the tattered clothes of someone down on their
luck.
	   With the help of a private detective, she began trolling areas
known to be hangouts frequented by junkies and prostitutes. Ms.
Fotiadou said she wore a wire while the detective videotaped from a
distance.
	   She was gradually accepted as one of the crowd.
	   ``What goes on there, the mind of a normal person cannot
comprehend. That's where I started. I found out that because they
need their fix, they push some of their women into prostitution, so
I went there. The scene there is indescribable,'' she recounted.
	   Ms. Fotiadou claims that gossip, rumors and tips eventually led
her to eight men and women she alleges were responsible for her
daughter's death.
	   She claims her daughter was accosted, drugged and taken to the
home of one of the suspects. There, she was gang raped and killed,
her body later dumped in an empty building, Ms. Fotiadou alleges.
	   ``We have cassettes where the hookers describe the method of
murder, they name the people who murdered the girl,'' said
Fotiadou's lawyer Nikos Dialinas.
	   All the evidence was turned over to prosecutor Petros
Raptopoulos, who last week charged the eight with murder, robbery
and gang rape. But the suspects have not yet been captured.

U.N. calls for international cooperation on genetics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHRYN MASTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NOORDWIJK, Netherlands (AP) _ A universal code of ethics for
cloning and genetic engineering is essential to preserve humanity
and prevent discrimination, U.N. officials warned Wednesday.
	   Representatives from the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization opened a three-day conference here aimed
at forging international cooperation to deal with recent
breakthroughs in genetics research.
	   Representatives from the 186 member states will debate the use _
and possible misuse _ of the rapid scientific advances in genetic
knowledge and application.
	   ``This is of crucial importance in the face of a possible threat
to individuals' access to employment, or health and life insurance
or education on the basis of their genetic make-up,'' said Federico
Mayor, the director-general of UNESCO.
	   Last year, the group unanimously passed a declaration of the
human rights of genomes, saying that genetic makeup is the heritage
of humanity and should not be used to discriminate among people.
	   The declaration came after fears of human cloning surfaced when
a sheep was successfully cloned in Scotland. Lie many of its member
nations, UNESCO has spoken out against the possibility of human
cloning, saying it is contrary to the individual dignity of
humanity.
	   ``It is no exaggeration to say the future of mankind is at
stake,'' Dutch Health Minister Els Borst told participants. ``A
great call will be made on mutural solidarity and assistance.''
	   ``We are coming to the point where everything seems possible. We
can study more and more, but is there a limit, and where should it
be set?'' she said.
	   ``What guarantee is there to avoid giving the individual the
feeling that he is simply a subject on the table of scientific
research _ or, to put it another way, a toy in the hands of
scientific research?''
	   Dutch Queen Beatrix officially opened this year's conference,
which coincides with the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Participants of the conference in the Dutch seaside resort of
Noordwijk were addressing the topics of bioethics and women's
rights, preventative medicine and the use of genetic engineering in
industry.
	   Embryology, the health and status of women, reproductive choices
and the genetic engineering of crops will be debated by
representatives from such diverse countries as China, Pakistan,
Israel, the Netherlands, Chile and Italy.
	   UNESCO strives to include all nations in scientific
advancements, Mayor said. While scientific discoveries are often
patented by private companies and used for profit, new ways must be
found to ``dare to share'' the scientific benefits for all people,
he said.
	   ``We have reached the point where we have to chose,'' Mayor
said. ``Either scientific knowledge becomes a commodity and will no
longer be shared by all, or it remains part of our universal
intellectual heritage for the benefit of all humanity.''

Center-left leader Ecevit asked to form Turkey's new government

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ President Suleyman Demirel on Wednesday
asked Bulent Ecevit, a veteran center-left leader, to form a new
government.
	   Ecevit, three times premier since 1974, announced he will that
he will try to stitch together a pro-secular coalition with the two
main center-right parties. But it was unclear if one of those
potential partners, former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, would go
along.
	   Ecevit, 73, is considered to have the backing of Turkey's
pro-secular military, often an important factor in government
longevity in Turkey. He is best remembered for ordering the 1974
invasion of Cyprus by Turkish troops in the wake of a short-lived
coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Mesut Yilmaz' government collapsed on Nov. 25 when the prime
minister lost a no-confidence vote in Parliament. Opposition
parties had accused Yilmaz of entertaining ties with mobsters and
rigging the sale of a state bank.
	   By tradition, the president designates the leader of the largest
party in Parliament. But the largest party, the pro-Islamic Virtue
Party, is opposed by the military, which pressured Turkey's first
Islamic-led government out of office last year.
	   If successful, Ecevit's government would be Turkey's fifth since
1995 and would face a short lifespan -- parliamentary elections are
scheduled for April 18.
	   ``I will do my best to form a government that will win a
confidence vote as soon as possible,'' Ecevit told reporters after
a 45-minute meeting with Demirel.
	   Despite the looming elections, Ecevit said his government would
be ``not only an interim government, it is one that will tackle
internal and external problems.''
	   Turkey is currently fighting an uphill diplomatic battle with
Italy for the extradition of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan,
detained in Rome on Nov. 12.
	   Yilmaz, Ciller's main rival for leadership of the center-right,
is expected to back an Ecevit-led government.
	   Ecevit would be the glue between Yilmaz and Mrs. Ciller, whose
longtime rivalry led to a government collapse in 1996.
	   Another scenario put forward by analysts is a minority
government with one of the two rival parties in power and the other
center-right group lending outside support in Parliament.
	   ``This will be a strong, determined government that will have
the support of Parliament,'' Ecevit contended.
	   Ecevit said he would begin negotiations with party leaders on
Friday, after consulting with his own party members.

Supposed portrait of Rembrandt now deemed a copy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A painting long billed as a
self-portrait by Rembrandt was declared a mere copy on Wednesday.
	   ``It's no longer a Rembrandt, but it is still a major piece,''
said Carola Visser of the prestigious Mauritshuis museum, where
``Self-portrait with Gorget'' has hung for years.
	   Although the oil painting was labeled a Rembrandt, its
authenticity has long been in doubt because it is nearly identical
to one in the Germanic National Museum in Nuremburg, Germany.
	   With an extensive Rembrandt exhibition scheduled for next year,
curators of the Dutch museum thought it was time to end the
speculation.
	   Using infrared technology and X-rays, researchers discovered
outlines of the portrait beneath the Mauritshuis painting. Since
Rembrandt never made outlines, experts agreed that it was probably
a copy and that the painting in the German museum is genuine.
	   Experts believe the copy was created in the 17th century just
like the original, and that the artist was someone close to
Rembrandt, most likely one of his students, Visser said.
	   It is widely known that many paintings attributed to Dutch
master may not be his, since his pupils and other artists imitated
his style and used the same materials.
	   The 37-by-28-centimeter (15-by-11-inch) painting shows the curly
haired Rembrandt as a young man, gazing intently with his right
cheek illuminated by soft light.
	   The version in the Nuremburg museum was signed by Rembrandt; the
Mauritshuis copy was left unsigned.

EU's Santer calls for independent fraud unit in wake of scandals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Commission President Jacques
Santer proposed plans for a separate independent fraud unit
Wednesday in an attempt to counter fraud allegations against the
EU's executive office.
	   ``It is healthy to have a clear separation between the
controllers and the controlled,'' Santer said, following
accusations the in-house fraud unit UCLAF did not function
properly.
	   Santer proposed creating a new Fraud Investigation Office to
complement and reinforce UCLAF.
	   Several fraud scandals this year have dented the integrity of
the Commission, which handles an annual budget of some 85 billion
European currency units (dlrs 100 billion).
	   ``The creation of such an office is in line with the
Commission's commitment to protect the European taxpayers' money,''
a Commission statement said.
	   EU officials had investigated the disappearance of some 500,000
ecus (dlrs 550,000) from Commission's humanitarian aid coffers and
one ECHO official has been suspended.
	   The missing funds were part of four aid contracts earmarked for
ex-Yugoslavia and Rwanda in 1993-1994, totaling 2.4 million ecus
(dlrs 2.6 million).
	   EU Research Commissioner Edith Cresson has filed suit in a
French court case against the Liberation newspaper for defamation
after the Paris daily alleged the former French prime minister was
involved in irregularities in awarding a commission contract.
	   Santer said the Commission had dealt with 49 cases of fraud and
``other forms of reprehensible behavior,'' and eight officials have
been removed from their post.

Chilean minister cautiously optimistic on getting Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
released &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza
returned from quick visits to London and Madrid on Wednesday with
cautious optimism on the outcome of efforts to secure the release
of Gen. Augusto Pinochet
	   But, Insulza said, his efforts are being undermined by the
continued polarization at home in the face of the arrest in London
of the 83-year-old former dictator and the prospect of his
extradition to Spain to face trial on genocide and terrorism
charges.
	   ``It is very difficult to make these efforts abroad when the
messages coming from Chile are so contradictory,'' Insulza said at
a news conference upon his return.
	   Still, he said, he returned ``with a cautiously positive view of
the efforts we have made and the ones we still have to make.''
	   ``It is very important that Chileans understand that the problem
is the lack of agreement among them,'' he added.
	   While the government and the right-wing insist that Pinochet
should be released and that foreign courts have no business dealing
with events occurred in Chile, leftists openly support the arrest
and trial in Spain.
	   Pinochet is under police custody in London awaiting a decision
no later than Dec. 12 by Home Secretary Jack Straw on whether he
will be extradited to Spain or allowed to come home.
	   Insulza criticized three congressmen of his own Socialist Party
wrote Straw that releasing Pinochet would ensure his impunity,
because no conditions exist in Chile to bring him to trial.
	   The minister insisted that Pinochet can indeed be tried here.

South African High Court OK's Mandela lawyers appeal of rugby
</HEADLINE>
decision &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's highest court
ruled Wednesday it will hear an appeal by President Nelson Mandela
on a lower-court decision that quashed his probe of racism and
mismanagement in rugby.
	   In a country emerging from decades of white rule, the case
resonates with racial issues. Blacks hated rugby _ loved by the
Afrikaner descendants of Dutch settlers _ as a symbol of the white
minority. Mandela tried to use rugby to unify the nation by
cheering on the national Springboks team to their World Cup victory
in 1995.
	   But racial divisions emerged again after Mandela appointed a
commission to investigate the South African Rugby Football Union,
the sport's ruling body.
	   SARFU went to court to block the probe and even hauled Mandela
into the witness stand. In April, a judge on the High Court in
Pretoria, the capital, ruled Mandela had acted unconstitutionally
in appointing the commission.
	   High Court Judge William de Villiers, appointed to the bench
under the apartheid regime, even rebuked Mandela for alleged
insolence during his testimony.
	   The Constitutional Court voted unanimously to hear the appeal,
filed by lawyers for Mandela, Sports Minister Steve Tshwete and
Director-General of Sport Mthobi Tyamzashe.
	   The court set aside five days, beginning on March 23, 1999, for
the case.

Germans promises tough stand on EU budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany will seek tough budget reforms in
the European Union during its six-month presidency of the trade
bloc starting Jan. 1, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said
Wednesday.
	   His comments drew battle lines, including with Germany's key
partner France, over difficult efforts to streamline the EU to
allow it to welcome the first nations from the former Soviet bloc
after 2000.
	   A priority will be to cut Germany's share of the dlrs 100
billion EU budget, Fischer said in reply to lawmakers' questions.
Germany is the largest contributor, paying for about a third of EU
spending.
	   ``We want a success, but not at any price anymore,'' Fischer
said.
	   He also repeated that Germany wants a budget freeze and cuts in
farm subsidies, which eat up about half the EU budget. France
worries that its powerful farm lobby will revolt against subsidy
cuts.
	   Schroeder has set an ambitious March deadline for resolving
squabbles among EU nations over plans to overhaul the budget for
2000-2006 to enable the bloc to finance the entry of new members.
	   Another focus of the EU presidency will be joint efforts to put
Europeans back to work, Fischer said.
	   ``It will be a chance to push employment and social policies for
Europe,'' government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said.
	   German and French leaders called Tuesday for a European pact for
jobs. But Fischer seemed to tone down expectations, saying that
main goal was better coordination of national programs to fight
unemployment.
	   Joblessness in the 11 countries launching Europe's single
currency, the euro, is a stubborn 10.9 percent.
	   With the euro making its debut Jan. 1, Germany's finance
minister is stepping his campaign for a common EU tax policy to
complement the common money.
	   Oskar Lafontaine is proposing that the EU drop the right of
individual EU governments to veto common tax measures, German media
reported Wednesday.
	   The idea seems aimed against Britain, which says a single
currency doesn't necessarily require unified taxes in Europe.

Nice pulls out of deal with Roma
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ The president of Nice soccer club has
decided not to sell the second division team to Italian soccer
giant AS Roma, the French sports daily L'Equipe reported Wednesday.
	   ``The club is no longer for sale. We have already lost enough
precious time to waste even more,'' Nice president Milan Mandaric
was quoted by the newspaper as saying.
	   After talks with Roma officials, Mandaric, an American
businessman, decided that a sale to Roma would not be in the club's
interest.
	   Mandaric told the paper that the club has attracted a new
investor.
	   On Tuesday, Roma officials had said that a takeover was
imminent.
	   The move was intended to encourage youth development at Nice and
give second string Roma players experience in the French league.

Norwegian journalist killed in road accident in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Saether returned to Amman; details of accident,
quotes; body of Danielsen brought to Baghdad in grafs 5-7 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A car carrying a Norwegian television team
ran off the road and overturned on Wednesday, killing one of the
journalists and injuring the other, a Norwegian diplomat said.
	   In Oslo, officials at Norway's TV2 said that two of its staffers
were involved in the accident on the desert road near the
Iraq-Jordan border. They said cameraman Knut Andre Danielsen was
killed and reporter Anders Saether was injured.
	   The driver, a Jordanian, also was hurt in the crash.
	   The accident occurred 350 kilometers (210 miles) west of
Baghdad, according to Mohsin Tarfa, acting director of the Iraqi
Press Center in Baghdad.
	   The car was traveling to Baghdad from the Jordanian capital of
Amman along a route that is one of the few ways into the country
because of U.N. sanctions that ban air travel. Nearly all visitors
to Iraq must take the 12-hour journey from Amman to Baghdad.
	   Saether, the injured reporter, arrived at an Amman hotel in a
four-wheel drive taxi that picked him from the accident site
shortly after the 6.30 a.m. (0430 gmt) crash.
	   He was taken in a wheelchair into the hotel, clad in a dark gray
sweater and navy blue trousers covered in tried blood and torn near
the knees and thighs. He shoe-less feet were scratched and coated
with dry blood.
	   Saether, who refused to speak to reporters, looked tired but
appeared in physical control.
	   Hashem Sublaban, the Jordanian taxi driver who evacuated
Saether, said he was driving a BBC crew from Amman to Baghdad when
he saw the wreckage. Saether lying on the side of the highway, he
said.
	   Nicholas Springate, a London-based senior foreign producer for
the BBC who returned to Amman with Saether, said he suffered from a
severe whiplash and head injuries. ``He is in pain, but not in a
serious condition,'' he said.
	   The speeding car overturned five times on the highway, Sublaban
said quoting Saether. He said Saether was in the front seat while
Danielsen was sleeping in the back seat when the car crashed.
	   Danielsen, 33, was single and lived in Bergen, which is 500
kilometers (300 miles) west of Oslo. He had a degree as a TV
director and was an experience traveler, TV2 said.
	   His body was brought to Baghdad, said Aram Semerjian, the
Norwegian consul-general. It will then be driven to Amman for a
flight to Oslo, he said.
	   The two journalists had planned to stay in Iraq for about four
days to produce a feature film.
	   Iraqi officials initially had said that three Norwegian
journalists were in the car.

Belarusian government forces cancellation of protest

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ A massive action planned for Wednesday to
protest severe food shortages and poverty was canceled under
pressure from Belarus' authoritarian government.
	   More than 30,000 workers in the capital, Minsk, were expected to
take part in a march and rally Wednesday, according to both union
and government estimates.
	   Belarus' official trade unions announced Wednesday they would
not take part in the protest. The decision followed three-hour
closed-door consultations with President Alexander Lukashenko's
chief of staff Mikhail Myasnikov on Tuesday.
	   Lukashenko has kept tight controls over the economy and prices,
saying he was trying to ensure Soviet-style ``stability'' for the
people.
	   But the policy has resulted in severe shortages of most basic
foods and ration cards in many regions of this impoverished former
Soviet republic.
	   In the latest example, many factories and other businesses
agencies are giving employees cards that can be redeemed for ten
eggs once a month at a company store.
	   The protesters are demanding that the government raise wages,
lower taxes and support domestic producers.
	   Union leader Gennady Fedynich insisted Wednesday that the
decision to put off the rally was not the result of government
pressure, saying it had merely been postponed until Jan. 27.
	   The government suggested they try to settle their demands at a
negotiating table instead of taking to the streets, Fedynich told
reporters. ``It was a tactical move, we were not scared away by
anyone.''
	   Belarus' official unions are largely holdovers from the Soviet
system of state-supported unions, and enjoy better relations with
the government than the independent unions _ who denounced the
postponement of Wednesday's rally.
	   ``This is a betrayal, first of all of their members,'' said
Maria Aliyeva, who heads Belarus' independent Free Trade Union.
``It is obvious that the decision to cancel the action was made
under pressure by authorities.''
	   ``The fact that the president and the prime minister rushed to
factories several days before the scheduled (protest) action means
that the authorities are afraid of workers,'' she added.
	   Lukashenko has been visiting factories and other state-run
businesses in the past few days, promising to raise wages, keep
prices down, and fill store shelves with food from unspecified
``internal reserves.''
	   The deputy prime minister in charge of agriculture, Alexander
Popkov, has promised that retail prices on food will not go up,
even if food has to be sold below cost. He didn't say how the
government would be able to afford that.
	   Harsher forms of pressure were also applied to stop workers from
taking part in the protest, the official and independent unions
said.
	   ``The pressure went up to the point of people being dismissed
from their jobs,'' Fedynich said.
	   The official unions also accused the state-run media of waging a
campaign to discredit and intimidate the labor movement.
	   Belarusian television has been running lengthy reports
criticizing the protest plans in every newscast for the past
several days.
	   Lukashenko, who is openly nostalgic for the Soviet Union, has
harshly suppressed political dissent, but so far has tolerated
trade unions _ apparently because their demands are not purely
political, and because unions were widespread in Soviet times.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The head of the Roman Catholic church in
Poland, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, was released Wednesday from a
hospital outside Warsaw where he underwent a heart procedure
Monday.
	   Glemp, who will be 69 on Dec. 18, had coronary angioplasty to
clear a clogged artery in his heart.
	   Dr. Witold Ruzylo of the Cardiology Institute in Anin, near
Warsaw, called the 40-minute procedure a success and said Glemp
could resume working.
	   Glemp, who became the Polish church prelate in 1981 and was made
a cardinal by Polish-born Pope John Paul II in 1983, is known for
his conservative views.
	   He battled with the former communist leadership in 1980s over
the role of the church in Poland and later criticized the leftist
post-communist government elected in 1993 for pushing what Glemp
called atheistic views.
	   Glemp also was accused of anti-Semitism in 1990 for criticizing
Jewish protests against a Carmelite nunnery next door to Auschwitz,
the former Nazi death camp in southern Poland. The nunnery was
eventually moved.

Germany railway works to improve image after deadly spring crash
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Facing calls for his resignation,
German railway chief Johannes Ludewig unveiled an ambitious program
Wednesday for better service in hopes of improving Deutsche Bahn's
image _ as well as his own.
	   Dubbing his program ``Fitness 99,'' Ludewig vowed to better
motivate employees, to improve railway information and to keep
trains on time _ a direct appeal to the German love of punctuality.
	   Still, his promises may do little to fend off his critics
angered by his handling of the June crash of a high-speed train in
Eschede, postwar Germany's worst rail disaster, in which 101 people
died and 87 were injured.
	   Railway union leaders say his management style has hurt employee
morale. Deutsche Bahn board members blame him for a massive drop in
railway income this year, and some have threatened to quit unless
Ludewig resigns.
	   Part of the problem is that Ludewig, appointed by the previous
government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, is facing heat from freshly
elected lawmakers and a new union chief.
	   The union says morale is low among the railway's 30,000 train
drivers, who are clocking up record overtime and can't keep to
timetables. It blames Ludewig for creating expectations among
travelers that trains would resume normal schedules faster than was
possible following the Eschede crash.
	   Union members also fault Ludewig for allowing the crash to taint
the railway's image of providing swift but safe travel. They say he
failed to make clear to the public that the apparent cause of the
crash was the failure of a wheel produced by private company _ not
the railway itself.
	   But after meeting the railway chief, Germany's new
transportation minister, Franz Muentefering, urged the critics to
hold their fire. He said Ludewig would keep his job but that he was
ordered to come up with plans for improving railway performance.
	   Ludewig's 10-point plan includes:
	   _Improving information services for travelers aboard trains and
in railway stations.
	   _Employ 150 new workers to help improve punctuality through
better response to schedule glitches. Reduce delays caused by
maintenance work.
	   _Taking a cue from airlines and offering travel vouchers to
delayed passengers.
	   _Increase publicity for extra trains running during peak times;
such trains often run empty because passengers are not aware of
them.
	   _Raise morale by offering bonuses for good job performance.

Ukrainian miners go on strike _ again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Fixes number of striking mines, ADDS number of workers in 2nd

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Hundreds of coal miners demonstrated
Wednesday near Ukraine's parliament building to demand more state
support for their ailing industry and the payment of back wages.
	   Some 20 mines across Ukraine, about 10 percent of the country's
total, also went on an indefinite strike that involved 40,000
workers, said Mykhailo Volynets, chairman of the Independent
Miners' Union.
	   The protest actions came as the parliament, or Verkhovna Rada,
began debating the draft 1999 budget.
	   The miners want budget allocations for their industry to be
increased to ``the minimum required level'' of 5.5 billion hryvna
(dlrs 1.6 billion), Volynets told the independent UNIAN news
agency.
	   Parliament's budget draft only provides for 3.1 billion hryvna
(dlrs 904 million) in spending on the coal industry.
	   The miners also demanded the payment of wage arrears that have
reached at least 2.4 billion hryvna (dlrs 700 million), according
to government figures.
	   Wednesday's protest was the latest in a series of strikes.
Walkouts idled dozens of mines in Ukraine last spring and summer,
and miners held a ``warning strike'' last month.
	   Ukraine's coal industry long has been plagued by accidents,
inefficiency and a lack of reforms. The government has refrained
from closing many money-losing mines, but also lacks the cash to
keep subsidizing the operations.
	   More than 330 miners have died in mine accidents this year, many
blamed on a lack of funds to modernize equipment and improve safety
conditions. In the latest accident, a worker was crushed to death
by train wagons in the eastern Luhansk region.

South African High Court OK's Mandela appeal of rugby decision
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Also moved on news wires &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's highest court
ruled Wednesday it will hear an appeal by President Nelson Mandela
on a lower-court decision that quashed his probe of racism and
mismanagement in rugby.
	   In a country emerging from decades of white rule, the case
resonates with racial issues. Blacks hated rugby _ loved by the
Afrikaner descendants of Dutch settlers _ as a symbol of the white
minority. Mandela tried to use rugby to unify the nation by
cheering on the national Springboks team to their World Cup victory
in 1995.
	   But racial divisions emerged again after Mandela appointed a
commission to investigate the South African Rugby Football Union,
the sport's ruling body.
	   SARFU went to court to block the probe and even hauled Mandela
into the witness stand. In April, a judge on the High Court in
Pretoria, the capital, ruled Mandela had acted unconstitutionally
in appointing the commission.
	   High Court Judge William de Villiers, appointed to the bench
under the apartheid regime, even rebuked Mandela for alleged
insolence during his testimony.
	   The Constitutional Court voted unanimously to hear the appeal,
filed by lawyers for Mandela, Sports Minister Steve Tshwete and
Director-General of Sport Mthobi Tyamzashe.
	   The court set aside five days, beginning on March 23, 1999, for
the case.

Government warns hunters in Trinidad about yellow fever
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ The Trinidadian government and
sportsmen's associations are warning hunters in Trinidad's dense
northern rain forest to beware of mosquitoes carrying deadly yellow
fever.
	   The disease, legendary for its devastating attacks on the
builders of the Panama Canal, has been reported on the rise in
Venezuela, just seven miles from Trinidad.
	   The virus can cause high fever, jaundice and death. It is spread
by the forest-dwelling hemagoggus mosquito. Howler monkeys that
live in the forest are immune to the virus and are carriers of the
disease.
	   ``The forests are full of howlers and really full of mosquitoes
right now, so we are warning everyone of the dangers,'' said Mohan
Bholasingh, president of Trinidad's Southeastern Hunters
Association. ``The Ministry of Health is on an active drive to get
all hunters inoculated.''
	   Vaccinations are free in Trinidad and are good for about 10
years. Most children in Trinidad are vaccinated after their first
birthday.
	   The Trinidad &AMP; Tobago hunting season runs from October 1 through
the end of February.

 &UR; Turkey's Cyprus hero returns to power &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By SUZAN FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associcated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Bulent Ecevit, who was asked to form a new
government Wednesday, is a former prime minister best remembered
for ordering an invasion of Cyprus in 1974 that made him an
overnight hero at home.
	   The invasion, after a short-lived coup by supporters of union
with Greece, has led to the division of the island. Throughout the
years, Ecevit, 73, has remained a strong defender of the cause of
the Turkish Cypriots
	   ``As long as Turkey lives, we won't allow the oppression and
subordination of Turkish Cypriots at the hands of Greek Cypriots,''
he said in July 1997 during the 23rd anniversary celebrations of
the invasion.
	   Ecevit, who was prime minister three times since 1974, has over
the years shed some of the socialist idealism he was known for in
the 70s.
	   During his tenure as deputy prime minister in a 17-month
government that was toppled last week over a corruption scandal, he
gave his backing to the liberal policies of the center-right-led
coalition.
	   He often said he was carrying out a duty to bring a stable
government and spare Turkey from crisis - a reference to tensions
between a previous Islamic-led government and the secular military.
	   Though never a Marxist, Ecevit was in his early years viewed
with suspicion by big business for espousing socialism based on
heavy government social benefits and a strong role for the state
sector in the economy.
	   Recently, however, he has helped the government keep on good
terms with the IMF, which ordered a strict curb on public spending,
and approved a number of state sell-offs.
	   Under his leadership in the 70's, ties with the United States
were tense. He has also expressed concern over a U.S.-led
multinational force based in Turkey that monitors a no-fly zone
over Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. He argues it it is helping
create a Kurdish state.
	   His frequent visits to Iraq to meet with President Saddam
Hussein have in turn raised suspicion in Washington.
	   Despite a short alliance with an Islamic party in 1974, he is a
staunch defender of Turkey's secular traditions and pushed for a
crackdown on Islamic radicalism.
	   Ecevit was born in Istanbul in 1925, to an intellectual family
and studied literature at a prestigious American-run high school.
He has taken some courses at Harvard University.
	   A former journalist, he entered politics in 1957, rising to the
leadership of the Republican People's Party in 1972, becoming prime
minister in 1974, briefly in 1977 and again in 1978-79. He was
barred from politics in the years that followed a 1980 military
coup.
	   He was imprisoned three times for carrying on with political
activities despite the ban, mainly through his wife of 51 years,
Rahsan, who formed the Democratic Left Party in 1985 and led it
until a democratic reform in 1987 allowed Ecevit back into
politics.
	   In corruption-tainted Turkish politics, he remains known as the
leader with the cleanest slate. Not even his alliance with Yilmaz
who was ousted for alleged ties to the mob and rigging the
privatization of a bank, tarnished his image.

South African High Court OK's Mandela appeal of rugby decision
</HEADLINE>

style on RugbyU in slug. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's highest court
ruled Wednesday it will hear an appeal by President Nelson Mandela
on a lower-court decision that quashed his probe of racism and
mismanagement in the South African Rugby Football Union.
	   In a country emerging from decades of white rule, the case
resonates with racial issues. Blacks hated rugby _ loved by the
Afrikaner descendants of Dutch settlers _ as a symbol of the white
minority. Mandela tried to use rugby to unify the nation by
cheering on the national Springboks team to their World Cup victory
in 1995.
	   But racial divisions emerged again after Mandela appointed a
commission to investigate SARFU.
	   SARFU went to court to block the probe and even hauled Mandela
into the witness stand. In April, a judge on the High Court in
Pretoria, the capital, ruled Mandela had acted unconstitutionally
in appointing the commission.
	   High Court Judge William de Villiers, appointed to the bench
under apartheid rule, even rebuked Mandela for insolence during his
testimony.
	   The Constitutional Court voted unanimously to hear the appeal,
filed by lawyers for Mandela, Sports Minister Steve Tshwete and
Director-General of Sport Mthobi Tyamzashe.
	   The court set aside five days, beginning on March 23, 1999, for
the case.

Iraq uses U.S war veteran to blame Gulf War for illnesses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos BAG 101-104 &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Wednesday presented a former
American soldier suffering from war-related illnesses to push its
claim that U.S. forces used artillery containing a radioactive
substance during the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Her voice wavering and hands shaking, former Sgt. 1st Class
Carol Picou urged some 600 Iraqi scientists and doctors at a
medical conference to help explain what she said were unexplained
ailments.
	   ``I have numerous illnesses, brain damage, neurological
disorders. I have no muscle (control) left in my rectum,'' said Ms.
Picou, 42, who served as a nurse and truck driver in the U.S. Army.
	   A native of Toccoa, Georgia, she said she sometimes finds
herself uttering words that aren't what she had intended to say.
	   Besides Ms. Picou, Iraq also sponsored the visit of two former
British soldiers to attend the two-day conference. They stood in a
row with five Iraqi officers. All claim they suffer from similar
neurological illnesses. They, however, looked in good physical
shape.
	   Ms. Picou and the Britons, Raymond Bristow and Colin
Dursell-Lee, said they defied their government's orders to attend
the conference.
	   The meeting will discuss what Iraq claims is the high incidence
of cancer among Iraqi civilians in southern Iraq exposed to
depleted uranium from artillery shells fired by U.S. forces during
the 1991 Gulf War to evict Iraq from Kuwait.
	   But there have been no independent studies to confirm that
claim. And a Western scientist attending the conference said it is
premature to blame depleted uranium for the illnesses.
	   ``Right now we have no idea whether it is depleted uranium or
oil fires. It will take a long time to know, and not in my
lifetime,'' Dr. Hari Sharma, a radio-chemical specialist at
Waterloo University in Canada, said.
	   An umbrella of U.S. veterans group claimed in March that at
least 400,000 service men and women had contact with depleted
uranium during the Gulf War.
	   But Bernard Rostker, Pentagon's adviser on Gulf War illnesses,
has called the report exaggerated. He said too few Americans were
on the battlefield during the war and shortly afterward for so many
to have been exposed.
	   Depleted uranium is a metal residue left when natural uranium is
refined. It is used in artillery shells and bombs designed to
penetrate the armor of tanks. On impact, the shells create an
airborne dust, which if inhaled or ingested, can be poisonous.
	   Most of the U.S. troops who came into direct contact with the
substance were in vehicles hit by fellow Americans in mistaken
attacks the Army calls ``friendly fire.''
	   Sami Raoof, who heads a newly-formed Iraqi office on the Gulf
War impact, said Iraqi scientists found an increase in radiation
levels at sites where depleted uranium shells were used.
	   He said cancer cases in southern Iraq have increased by almost
200 percent compared to before the war.
	   Shawqi Marqus of the Health Ministry said Iraq has conclusive
evidence that Ms. Picou and the two Britons are suffering from
exposure to depleted uranium. He did not elaborate.
	   Raymond Bristow, one of the Britons at the conference, said he
can only walk with the aid of a cane. A former army technician, he
said he was told by Canadian doctors who tested his blood that he
had been exposed to 100 times more than the average radiation
level.

Bomb levels electricity tower, blacks out southern Albania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A bomb blew up a high-voltage electricity
tower, blacking out several towns in southern Albania, the power
company said Wednesday.
	   Government officials called bombing a ``clear terrorist act''
aimed at destabilizing the country. Police are investigating but
have no suspects yet.
	   The incident occured late Tuesday, near the Western port of
Durres, 35 kilometers (20 miles) west of Tirana, when the explosion
toppled one of two towers in the region that supply power to
hundreds of thousands of people, local media reported.
	   Local police found four unexploded bombs, containing TNT, at the
site of the explosion near Durres, said Artan Bizhga, a spokesman
for Albania's Interior Ministry which oversees public security.
	   Officials at Albania's Electropower Corporation estimated the
damage at around dlrs 25,000. While officials repair the downed
tower, several southern Albanian towns will have no electricity
while power shortages will affect Tirana and Durres.
	   Bombings and random acts of violence are common in Albania,
where police have little or no control over many rural regions.

Germans promises tough stand on EU budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS that Britain not joining euro zone. &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany will seek tough budget reforms in
the European Union during its six-month presidency of the trade
bloc starting Jan. 1, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said
Wednesday.
	   His comments drew battle lines, including with Germany's key
partner France, over difficult efforts to streamline the EU to
allow it to welcome the first nations from the former Soviet bloc
after 2000.
	   A priority will be to cut Germany's share of the dlrs 100
billion EU budget, Fischer said in reply to lawmakers' questions.
Germany is the largest contributor, paying for about a third of EU
spending.
	   ``We want a success, but not at any price anymore,'' Fischer
said.
	   He also repeated that Germany wants a budget freeze and cuts in
farm subsidies, which eat up about half the EU budget. France
worries that its powerful farm lobby will revolt against subsidy
cuts.
	   Schroeder has set an ambitious March deadline for resolving
squabbles among EU nations over plans to overhaul the budget for
2000-2006 to enable the bloc to finance the entry of new members.
	   Another focus of the EU presidency will be joint efforts to put
Europeans back to work, Fischer said.
	   ``It will be a chance to push employment and social policies for
Europe,'' government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said.
	   German and French leaders called Tuesday for a European pact for
jobs. But Fischer seemed to tone down expectations, saying that
main goal was better coordination of national programs to fight
unemployment.
	   Joblessness in the 11 countries launching Europe's single
currency, the euro, is a stubborn 10.9 percent.
	   With the euro making its debut Jan. 1, Germany's finance
minister is stepping his campaign for a common EU tax policy to
complement the common money.
	   Oskar Lafontaine is proposing that the EU drop the right of
individual EU governments to veto common tax measures, German media
reported Wednesday.
	   The idea seems aimed against Britain, which says a single
currency doesn't necessarily require unified taxes in Europe.
Britain is not introducing the euro.

Russia offers aid to hurricane victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's cash-starved government is offering
financial aid to Central American countries devastated by Hurricane
Mitch, a news report said Wednesday.
	   Russia's Finance Ministry will send aid for the affected
countries to a special United Nations bank account in Geneva,
Vasily Gromov, director of the Foreign Ministry's Latin America
department, told the Interfax news agency.
	   The report did not say how much money Russia would offer. The
country is mired in its worst economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet
collapse and owes billions of dollars to workers, pensioners and
foreign creditors. Russian leaders are lobbying for more aid
themselves from international lenders.
	   More than 9,000 people were killed in the hurricane last month,
most in Honduras. Thousands more were missing and more than a
million people were left homeless.

Chilean minister cautiously optimistic on Pinochet release
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Chile's foreign minister on Wednesday
returned from European visits cautiously optimistic about efforts
to persuade Britain to release former dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, who is wanted for trial in Spain.
	   But, Jose Miguel Insulza said Chileans' polarization about the
83-year-old former dictator was undermining his diplomatic efforts.
	   ``It is very difficult to make these efforts abroad when the
messages coming from Chile are so contradictory,'' Insulza said
upon his return from Madrid and London.
	   Still, Insulza said he returned ``with a cautiously positive
view of the efforts we have made and the ones we still have to
make.''
	   Pinochet is under police custody in London awaiting a decision
by Home Secretary Jack Straw on whether he will be extradited to
Spain to face charges of genocide and torture. Straw has until Dec.
12 to make a decision.
	   The government and the right-wing insist Pinochet should be
released, saying foreign courts have no business dealing with
events in Chile. Leftists and human rights advocates support the
arrest and eventual trial in Spain of Pinochet.
	   A Chilean government report concluded that 3,197 people _
including Spaniards and other foreigners _ were killed or
disappeared during Pinochet's rule from 1973-1990. The
democratically elected president, Salvador Allende, died in a 1973
coup Pinochet helped lead.
	   Based on a Spanish warrant, Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in a
central London hospital where he had undergone back surgery.
	   Insulza says Pinochet can indeed be tried in Chile, where he
enjoys diplomatic immunity as senator for life.
	   Insulza criticized three congressmen of his own Socialist Party
who sent a letter to Straw saying Pinochet's release would ensure
his impunity.
	   ``It is very important that Chileans understand that the problem
is the lack of agreement among them,'' Insulza said.

Netanyahu and ministers visit south Lebanon

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Under increasing public pressure to withdraw
troops from southern Lebanon, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
members of his Cabinet on Wednesday toured an Israeli-occupied zone
where seven soldiers have been killed over the last two weeks.
	   The tour was part of Cabinet discussions to reassess Israel's
15-year military presence in the area, but Netanyahu has said he
would not bend to public pressure and no immediate policy change
was expected.
	   Israel is at war in southern Lebanon with Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrillas, who claimed responsibility for killing the
seven soldiers last month and 16 others this year. Israel and its
allied South Lebanese Army militia patrol a self-styled security
zone there to prevent cross-border attacks by Hezbollah on Israeli
communities.
	   ``We are here to defend the children and the villages and the
citizens in northern Israel and that is the major goal,'' Netanyahu
said. ``If we can find a way to defend northern Israel without (the
army) being here, we'll take them out.''
	   Netanyahu has said he would withdraw troops if Lebanon would
guarantee the safety of their border. Both Lebanon and Syria, the
main power-broker there, want Israel to unilaterally withdraw from
foreign soil and have refused such guarantees.
	   Israel believes Syria is allowing the conflict there to escalate
to force Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights as well, a
strategic plateau Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast
war.
	   Fearing further violence, the United States warned Syria that
Israel could attack Syrian troops in Lebanon if the flow of weapons
to Hezbollah was not halted, the Yediot Aharonot newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   U.S. intelligence has confirmed that Iranian-purchased weapons
for Hezbollah pass through the airport in the Syrian capital,
Damascus, and reach the guerrillas by land.
	   ``We will not be able to prevent Israel from acting against
Syrian targets if the situation in south Lebanon continues to
deteriorate,'' read the U.S. message to Syria, according to the
mass-circulation daily.
	   The United States informed Damascus it would be a ``mistake''
for them to think that intensifying the conflict in Lebanon would
pressure Israel to renew peace talks with Syria, Israel's U.S.
Ambassador, Zalman Shoval, reportedly told Netanyahu this week.
	   Larry Schwartz, the spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Israel,
would not comment on the report but said the U.S. State Department
has sent messages to Israel, Syria and Lebanon urging them to act
with restraint.
	   The deaths of 23 Israeli soldiers in the security zone this year
has widened public debate on how to end years of occupation in
Lebanon. Some argue that a unilateral withdrawal is the only way
out, while others say withdrawal without security guarantees would
leave civilians in northern Israel open to attack.
	   Meanwhile, three Lebanese civilians are on trial in an Israeli
military court accused of passing intelligence information and
explosive charges to Hezbollah.
	   The trial is being held behind closed doors, but the court
released the names of two of the accused, Bulos Abu-Zeid, an
officer in the Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army and Ibrahim
Abu-Zeid. The third defendant was not named.
	   The military prosecutor submitted confessions signed by the
accused, but they said these were not given voluntarily.

 &UR; Nice pulls out of deal with Roma Eds: Clarifies quote from Mandaric

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ The president of Nice soccer club has
decided not to sell the second division team to Italian soccer
giant AS Roma, the French sports daily L'Equipe reported Wednesday.
	   ``The club is no longer for sale. We have already lost precious
time and do not want to waste more,'' Nice president Milan Mandaric
was quoted by the newspaper as saying.
	   After talks with Roma officials, Mandaric, an American
businessman, decided that a sale to Roma would not be in the club's
interest.
	   Mandaric told the paper that the club has attracted a new
investor.
	   On Tuesday, Roma officials had said that a takeover was
imminent.
	   The move was intended to encourage youth development at Nice and
give second string Roma players experience in the French league.

Judge: Elephants were neglected in case that sparked international

upholding his earlier ruling; ADDS reax &QL; 
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRITS, South Africa (AP) _ In a case that sparked protests
overseas, a judge made a final ruling Wednesday that 30 young
elephants were cruelly treated and awarded temporary custody to the
National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
	   ``This has become of public interest and is not private interest
anymore,'' Judge Herman Glas said in upholding his earlier ruling,
made in October.
	   In an unusual move, the elephants' owner, animal exporter
Riccardo Ghiazza, had asked the judge to reconsider his earlier
decision. Ghiazza was allowed to keep the elephants in the interim.
	   The NSPCA hopes to transport the animals to three game reserves
in South Africa on Friday or Saturday, said NSPCA executive
director Marcelle French.
	   The elephants were snatched from their families from a game
reserve in neighboring Botswana. Ghiazza had planned to sell them
to zoos in Europe and to a safari park in China.
	   The judge cited particular concern about seven baby elephants
who had abscesses on their heads from being prodded by sharp
instruments as part of training to prepare them for captivity.
	   The trainers hobbled them and deprived them of water, NSPCA
officials testified during the hearings.
	   Glas pointed out that international elephant experts testified
that such training was outmoded and dangerous.
	   ``I am persuaded that with more care (injuries) could have been
prevented,'' Glas said. ``These elephants have been neglected.''
	   The international animal rights organization, People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals, had threatened to organize a tourist
boycott if Ghiazza was allowed to keep the elephants.
	   ``I feel the baby elephants will never feel the comfort and love
of their mothers again, but at least they have the chance to live
their lives without bull hooks, chains and beatings,'' said Jane
Garrison of PETA, who monitored the case.
	   In a statement from PETA's headquarters in Norfolk, Va., PETA
Vice President Mary Beth Sweetland said: ``This must be the
beginning of the end of the African elephant slave trade.''
	   In October, animal-rights activists dumped coal in front of the
South African Embassy in Washington to protest the elephants'
treatment. A protest was also held at the country's embassy in
London.
	   Britain's Spice Girls pop group and rocker Chrissie Hynde have
appealed to South African President Nelson Mandela to prevail on
his Botswana counterpart, Festus Mogae, to help the elephants
return to their families.
	   Final custody will be decided later, pending criminal charges of
cruelty being considered by the attorney general against Ghiazza.
	   Ghiazza's lawyer had maintained that the treatment of the
elephants was valid under South African law.
	   ``It's not the aim to raise the animals to the level of human
rights,'' attorney Nic van der Walt told the judge last month.

France's Groupe Danone to build yogurt plant in Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new 3rd graf with German, Dutch companies also
building yogurt plants. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The French yogurt-maker Groupe Danone has begun
building a dlrs 100 million dairy plant near Moscow, a news report
said Wednesday.
	   The plant near Chekhov, a town 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of
Moscow, will employ 650 people and produce 150,000 tons of yogurt
and other diary products each year after it is completed in 2000,
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Danone is not the only yogurt-maker braving Russia's treacherous
economy to build a dairy plant. Germany's Ehremann began building
one in September, and the Netherlands' Campina is also planning
one, the Moscow Times newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Danone Industry, a subsidiary of the French food giant, plans to
invest dlrs 2 million in its project before the end of this year,
Interfax reported, citing the Chekhov region's top economic
official, Vladimir Galdin.
	   The plant is also expected to produce candy and mineral water,
and the number of employees may gradually rise to 1,300, Galdin
said.
	   Groupe Danone already has a yogurt plant in the central Russian
city of Togliatti and owns a 59 percent stake in Moscow's
baked-goods factory Bolshevik.

 &UR; Lebanon's premier-designate, veteran politician known for honesty
 &UR; By HUSSEIN DAKROUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Salim Hoss, the American-educated
economist appointed prime minister on Wednesday, is a veteran of
Lebanon's turbulent politics.
	   His 22-year political career _ including four terms as prime
minister _ has given the Sunni Muslim leader one main asset:
Muslims and Christians alike respect him as an honest public
servant in a political establishment often seen as corrupt.
	   The legislator from Beirut served as prime minister in the most
difficult times _ during the 1975-90 civil war when the government
had little authority. He once took over leadership after his
predecessor was assassinated and later was himself the target of
would-be assassins.
	   Hoss was designated by President Emile Lahoud on Wednesday to
form a new Cabinet. Hoss is less flamboyant than his predecessor,
Rafik Hariri, but he is known to share Lahoud's goal of ridding the
public service of corruption.
	   ``God willing, we hope to form a government that will be up to
the level of challenges, a government that fulfills the people's
hopes and meets their needs,'' Hoss said in his trademark soft
voice after accepting the task.
	   Hoss, who turns 69 on Dec. 20, is a firm backer of democracy, a
free-wheeling economy and Christian-Muslim coexistence in Lebanon.
	   In the civil war that killed 150,000 people, he refused to align
himself with any of the rival militias, leading even opponents to
once call him ``a voice of sanity in a tortured land.''
	   His religious tolerance was put into practice when in 1957 he
married a Christian, Leila Pharaon, although such a mixed marriage
was rare at the time. His wife has since died. The couple had one
daughter.
	   While in government, the tall, balding and bespectacled Hoss
lived modestly in a Beirut apartment, where he still resides.
	   Outside the government, he was offered detailed, point-by-point
criticism of government policy in parliamentary debate _ while
other opposition legislators heaped personal attacks on Hariri.
	   Born on Dec. 20, 1929, Hoss is the youngest of five children of
a lower middle class Sunni family from Beirut. His father, a
pharmacist, died when he was young.
	   Despite financial strains, he studied business at the
prestigious American University of Beirut, where he later taught.
	   In 1961, he obtained an advanced degree in economics and
business administration from Indiana University at Bloomington.
	   He became an accountant and later worked as a financial adviser
in Kuwait. In 1967, he headed the Banking Control Commission at
Lebanon's Central Bank.
	   His switch from banking to politics came in 1976 when President
Elias Sarkis, a former Central Bank governor, named him to form the
Cabinet. In Lebanon's then-swift changing governments, he was prime
minister again in 1987 and twice in 1989.
	   Hoss is a vegetarian who does not smoke or drink. He has a
passion for Arabic literature and Western classical music.

Watchdog says tabloid right to pay for Woodward story
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Press Complaints Commission ruled Wednesday
that a British newspaper was justified in buying a story from the
family of Louise Woodward, the au pair convicted in Massachusetts
of killing the baby in her care.
	   The sum of money paid by the Daily Mail for an interview with
Ms. Woodward's parents was not revealed.
	   But the industry's self-regulatory body rejected complaints
about it, saying the article published last year was in the public
interest. Payment had been necessary to get the interview and did
not provide a profit for the Woodwards, the commission said.
	   Ms. Woodward, convicted of killing 8-month-old Matthew Eappen,
was originally found guilty of second-degree murder in 1997. The
verdict was reduced to manslaughter by the trial judge, who then
set her free.
	   The Daily Mail paid for an interview with her parents between
the first and second verdicts in the case _ before the conviction
was reduced from murder to manslaughter.
	   The voluntary press code says payments can be made to criminals
or their associates if there is a public interest defense and if it
is necessary to secure publication.
	   ``Payment was necessary because of the obvious financial plight
of the Woodwards,'' the commission said.
	   The article was in the public interest, it ruled, because the
interviews released new information to the public and formed ``an
integral part of the newspaper's campaign on a matter of
significant public controversy.''
	   ``On each of the central tests applied by the commission... the
newspaper's justification under the code could not be faulted,''
the announcement said.
	   The commission said the money was used by Ms. Woodward's mother,
Sue, to help her daughter's legal fight, and there was nothing left
over.
	   ``We are pleased that after two exhaustive meetings, the PCC has
concluded that the Mail's interview with Louise Woodward's parents
was in the public interest,'' a statement from the newspaper said.
	   The commission is an independent body that rules on complaints
against the media by the public or competing publications. Such
rulings do not carry financial penalties for the offenders.
	   The Guild of Editors welcomed its adjudication in the Woodward
case as a ``common sense'' decision showing ``self-regulation of
the press working at its best.''
	   ``As a general rule criminals and their families should not
benefit from their actions,'' the guild said. ``In this case they
did not. ... Newspapers have long been the guardians of individuals
and campaigners for justice.''
	   A U.S. federal judge ruled on Nov. 19 that Louise Woodward is
liable for punitive damages and set a January trial date to decide
the amount she must pay.
	   Frederic Ellis, lawyer for Matthew's parents, said the couple
sued because they do not want Ms. Woodward to become rich because
she killed their child. She is now under court order to inform the
U.S. district judges if she enters into a contract to be paid for
her story.

Salim Hoss, prime minister-designate, to carry on reconstruction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS to raise continuation of reconstruction
 &UR; With Lebanon-Hoss Profile &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Salim Hoss, a U.S. educated economist,
was designated prime minister of Lebanon on Wednesday, and promptly
pledged to continue his predecessor's reconstruction program, but
with a dollop of austerity.
	   Former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was the architect of a
multibillion dollar drive to rebuild the country from the
devastation of the 1975-90 civil war, and Hoss sought to clam fears
that Hariri's departure would undermine the program or devalue the
currency.
	   The new government would pursue ``austerity in the extreme'' in
the 1999 budget, which has to be presented in the coming weeks,
Hoss told reporters after President Emile Lahoud invited him to
form a government.
	   ``We will also be austere in ways of implementing projects,''
Hoss said, referring to Hariri's plans.
	   The government would ``set priorities in reconstruction and
development projects that do not exceed the financial capabilities
of the state,'' he said.
	   But it would honor contracts for reconstruction ``although some
of these projects were executed without a plan,'' Hoss said.
	   The national currency is ``in very solid state'' and measures
will be taken against speculators, he said.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Lahoud issued a decree appointing Hoss after
he received the constitutionally required recommendations from a
majority of Parliament members. Speaker Nabih Berri said Hoss had
the support of 95 of the 128 lawmakers in the half-Christian,
half-Muslim legislature.
	   Hoss, a legislator from Beirut who turns 69 on Dec. 20, has held
the premiership on four previous occasions. He survived a 1987 car
bombing that killed a bodyguard in his motorcade.
	   The president had initially been inclined to re-appoint Hariri,
the billionaire businessman who had been prime minister since 1992.
Hariri even had the majority support of legislators but not the
overwhelming margin he had enjoyed in the past.
	   A chagrined Hariri bowed out of the race on Monday, but will
continue in a caretaker capacity until the Parliament approves the
new Cabinet.
	   Hoss is a Sunni Muslim, like every prime minister under
Lebanon's power-sharing arrangement. The president has to be a
Maronite Catholic, and the speaker is a Shiite Muslim.
	   A soft-spoken, down-to-earth man, Hoss's style of government is
expected to be quite different from that of the flamboyant Hariri.
	   His economic policies are expected to be different as well.
	   The holder of an advanced degree in business and economics from
Indiana University at Bloomington, Hoss said Wednesday he favored
cutting interest rates, which are running at 14 percent.
	   He has argued that such high rates have discouraged investment.
	   Hoss's first economic challenge will be in drawing up the budget
for the 1999 fiscal year, which begins in January. The budget
deficit is running at a high 17 percent of the Gross Domestic
Product _ the value of all goods and services produced within the
country.
	   In his previous terms as prime minister, Hoss has earned a
reputation as an honest politician. He is known to share Lahoud's
goal of ridding the administration of corruption.
	   Like almost all politicians in Lebanon, Hoss is an ally of
Syria, which maintains some 30,000 troops in Lebanon and is the
main power-broker in the country.
	   He reaffirmed government support for the guerrillas fighting
Israel's occupation of a zone in southern Lebanon, amounting to 10
percent of the country. Israel has controlled the area since 1985
as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on its northern territory.
	   Hoss first served as prime minister in 1976, in the early days
of the civil war, and after the assassination of Prime Minister
Rashid Karami in 1987. He was named to the post again in 1989 under
President Rene Mouawad and the following year under President Elias
Hrawi.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Slogans denouncing a Kurdish guerrilla
group mixed with upbeat soccer chants at Ali Sami Yen Stadium
Wednesday as spectators awaited the start of the politically
charged Champions League match between Galatasaray and Juventus of
Turin.
	   Around 22,000 police officers were deployed for the game amid
fears that angry Turkish fans might resort to violence against the
Italians. Military troops in camouflage outfits stood guard around
the stadium.
	   Turkey and Italy are locked in a bitter dispute over the fate of
Abdullah Ocalan, a Kurdish rebel leader arrested in Rome who has
asked for political asylum, and there were fears the political
tensions might spill onto the soccer field.
	   Authorities also said they worried about a provocation by the
rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, aimed at staining
Turkey's image.
	   ``Down with the PKK,'' chanted thousands of Turkish spectators
who filed into the stadium four hours before kickoff.
	   Others yelled more traditional soccer cheers in support of
Galatasaray, while a scoreboard flashed a cartoon Galatasaray
player handing flowers to a Juventus counterpart.
	   But there was bitterness in the air.
	   No Italian fans attended the match because of security concerns.
	   Hundreds of police were on hand when the Italian team arrived at
the Istanbul airport Wednesday. A small group of airport employees
tossed flowers at the Juventus bus in greeting. But, as loyal
home-team fans, they also chanted ``Turkey, Turkey!''
	   The road from the airport to the team's hotel was closed to
traffic, but people standing along the route waved to the bus.
	   Turkey's leaders have been calling on Turks to be hospitable and
refrain from doing anything to mar the match.
	   Sports ministers of both Turkey and Italy are scheduled to
attend the game.
	   ``Sports is an international language. Tonight we will watch a
very nice competition,'' said Italian Sports and Culture Minister
Giovanna Melandri.
	   Her Turkish counterpart Yucel Seckiner said, ``Let's all
together applaud the team that wins.''
	   Juventus official Romy Gai agreed. ``We are here to play a game,
only a game. We don't care about other things,'' he said.
	   At the stadium entrance, police searched spectators for weapons
or items like loose change that could be hurled onto the field.
Even umbrellas and mobile phones were not allowed.

Reports: Bonn team wants to sign entire Cuban national team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A German club intends to give a
completely new meaning to open-door policies in international
soccer _ by signing the entire Cuban national team.
	   Fourth-division Bonner SC, based in the soon-to-be abandoned
German government seat of Bonn, thinks the plan will help it gain
promotion.
	   A club delegation will travel to Cuba on Sunday for talks with
Cuban soccer federation officials, German newspapers reported
Wednesday. They hope to sign a cooperation deal next Wednesday.
	   In return for allowing the entire team to practice and play in
Germany, the Cubans would receive balls, soccer boots, uniforms and
other equipment.
	   The Bonn club could release any players on loan, but the
transfer rights would remain with the Cuban federation.
	   The Cubans would come with their coach William Bennett and would
also play exhibition games against smaller European soccer nations.
Also under the plan, the Cubans would be available for all World
Cup qualifying games.
	   ``The Cubans want to develop their team and let it learn tactics
in Europe,'' Bonner SC chairman Hans Viol told the Bonn newspaper
General-Anzeiger.
	   Bonner SC coach Rainer Thomas said he would retain the core of
his current roster.
	   The Cubans would practice separately. Thomas said ``maybe three,
maybe eight'' could make the starting lineup.
	   ``That's the only way we can gain promotion,'' Viol said. But it
was unlikely to come before next season, he said.
	   Bonner SC officials came to the idea after watching the video
tape of Cuba playing Brazil.
	   If the German soccer federation approves the deal, the Cubans
could start playing in February.
	   The Bonn club is looking for sponsors to pay for the Cubans'
lodging, food and medical insurance.
	   The General-Anzeiger newspaper dismissed the plan as too
``adventurous.''
	   ``What if they start asking for political asylum?'' it asked.
	   Many lower-division German clubs have signed a multitude of
foreign players. But once they reach the second division, they face
a problem: the league allows only three foreigners outside the
European Union to play in a game.

French Jews support gov't refusal to sell looted art
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Jews strongly support the government's
refusal to sell off some 2,000 pieces of Nazi-looted art to
compensate Holocaust victims worldwide, preferring to keep the
works in France, a Jewish leader said Wednesday.
	   Henri Hajdenberg, President of the Representative Council of
French Jewish Institutions, said that if the owners aren't traced
within 10 years, the government should estimate the value, then put
that sum towards building a new Holocaust center in France.
	   ``It's an internal French affair,'' Hajdenberg said. ``It's only
right that the situation be handled by France and French Jews.''
	   ``There is a moral responsibility to create a lasting memory,''
he said in a telephone interview.
	   His remarks came after France rejected a plea Tuesday in
Washington from the World Jewish Congress and the Museum of Modern
Art to auction the works for the benefit of Holocaust victims or
their families across the globe.
	   He added that the French National Museum Authority is actively
tracing ownership of the 2,000 works, and said it should be allowed
another five to 10 years to complete the investigation.
	   Once completed, the state could buy back the works, which would
remain part of the French national heritage.
	   The money, Hajdenberg said, should go into a foundation to
finance a new Holocaust memorial. He suggested building an
extension to the Memorial to the Unknown Jewish Martyr in central
Paris.
	   Hajdenberg rejected the suggestion that the works be put in a
special museum.
	   ``There's no homogeneity, no theme and the artists aren't
Jewish,'' he said. ``The only thing they have in common is that
they once belonged to Jews and were confiscated during the war.''

Germany upholds call for NATO to drop first strike threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany on Wednesday stuck with its call
for NATO to drop a doctrine allowing it to use nuclear weapons
before first being targeted, but pledged to abide by any alliance
decision to uphold the policy.
	   The United States has been irritated by the German proposal,
made as part of a NATO debate on overhauling its doctrine after the
end of the Cold War.
	   Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer raised the point with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on his first visit to
Washington after Germany's new left-leaning government took office
in October.
	   Fischer and Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping, who tried to play
down his colleague's comments during a visit to Washington last
week, went before parliamentary committees Wednesday to clarify
their position, stating that Germany will go along with whatever
NATO decides at its April meeting.
	   They insisted that NATO's strategy debate must be open to all
ideas, but that there will be ``no separate German way'' from its
allies, according to a Foreign Ministry official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Fischer, who led the anti-nuclear demonstrations in the 1980s
when the United States based nuclear warheads in Germany, said the
security situation in Europe has changed significantly since the
first-strike option was adopted.
	   However, the position has been criticized abroad and by
opponents at home who say nuclear weapons are still needed as
deterrents to chemical and biological weapons, which NATO does not
have.

NATO detains Bosnian Serb general charged with genocide

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ NATO forces on Wednesday arrested
the most senior Bosnian Serb military figure yet to be seized for
U.N. trial on genocide and war crimes charges.
	   Gen. Radislav Krstic was arrested in a section of northern
Bosnia controlled by U.S. troops serving in NATO's Stabilization
Force, better known as SFOR. The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal has
charged him in the 1995 massacre of Muslim civilians fleeing
Srebrenica.
	   Krstic was ``a very significant military leader,'' said Louise
Arbour, chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal.
Arbour said she was delighted at the arrest of Krstic, who was
indicted in October on charges of genocide, grave breaches of the
Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity.
	   SFOR spokeswoman Maj. Sheena Thomson said Krstic was arrested
without incident and would be sent to The Hague tribunal for trial
on charges stemming from the wartime massacre of thousands of
Muslims who fled the U.N. safe haven of Srebrenica after it was
taken over by Serb rebels.
	   He was indicted for genocide, complicity to commit genocide,
extermination, murder, and persecution for his alleged personal
involvement in the atrocities and his command of troops carrying
out the massacres, the tribunal announced.
	   In a statement, Arbour, of Canada, said the arrest was ``very
significant for the continuing work of the tribunal.''
	   Amor Masovic, the head of a Bosnian Muslim commission unearthing
mass graves containing victims of the 3 1/2-year war, said he
expected the case to yield important facts related 8,000 people
still missing from Srebrenica.
	   ``I'm very pleased that one of ... the executors of genocide,
the destruction of the entire population of a wider region of
Bosnia made it to The Hague,'' he said.
	   But Petar Djokic, president of the Bosnian Serb parliament, said
Krstic's arrest on a secret indictment ``brings uncertainty to
people, a feeling that every citizen of Republika Srpska can be
regarded as a potential war criminal in the eyes of the tribunal,
and that SFOR is authorized to arrest anybody, anytime, anywhere.''
	   Republika Srpska is the Serb entity within Bosnia. Serbs account
for the vast majority of suspects publicly indicted by the U.N.
court.
	   Krstic was the commander of the 5th Corps of the Bosnian Serb
Army. He is believed to be a close associate of former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief Gen. Ratko
Mladic, the tribunal's top two indicted suspects.
	   Both Karadzic and Mladic have been indicted for genocide for
allegedly masterminding the massacre of Muslims at Srebrenica.
Neither is in custody.
	   ``Persons indicted for war crimes who are still at large should
realize they, too, will be brought to justice,'' NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said Wednesday after the arrest.
	   Krstic is the ninth war crimes suspect to be arrested in the
former Yugoslavia by international forces. He was named head of the
Drina Corps of the Bosnian Serb Army in 1995 after the fall of
Srebrenica.

Russia receives praise, but no money, from IMF chief

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The visiting International Monetary Fund chief
praised Russia's ``pragmatic'' course in dealing with its economic
meltdown on Wednesday, but made no promises to release frozen loans
that Moscow badly wants.
	   Still, after weeks of IMF criticism of Russian government's
plans, Michel Camdessus' cautiously positive evaluation was a good
sign for Moscow.
	   Camdessus said a fund team would return to Russia next month for
further negotiations on the loan.
	   ``We are hoping 1999 will be excellent for cooperation between
Russia and the IMF,'' Camdessus told reporters.
	   Russia owes billions of dollars to workers, pensioners and
foreign creditors and wants the IMF to provide new installments on
a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package, which also includes loans from
the World Bank and the Japanese government.
	   The lenders have released only about dlrs 5 billion, putting the
rest on hold after the latest economic crisis hit in August, when
Russia devalued the ruble and defaulted on domestic debt. The IMF
has been demanding a realistic recovery plan from the Russian
government and has so far been unimpressed with Moscow's efforts.
	   During a second day of talks with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov on Wednesday, Camdessus praised Moscow's ``pragmatic''
course and its commitment to a budget that does not overstretch the
government's abilities.
	   Primakov ``wants a budget which tells the truth, is sincere and
doesn't promise what it can't fulfill,'' Camdessus said. ``I was
impressed by this insistence on sincerity.''
	   The statement was a break from the conclusion by an IMF team
that left town last week saying the government's revenue forecast
for next year was overly optimistic.
	   But Camdessus refused to elaborate or say indicate whether he
had reviewed the 1999 budget draft in detail.
	   The Russians were even more enthusiastic.
	   ``It was important for us that the fund chief come to Moscow and
analyze and assess the situation,'' Primakov told reporters after
the talks.
	   ``Don't measure the significance of Camdessus' visit by how much
money he brought. He has come with an attache case containing
documents, not cash. You shouldn't think that the question of
giving money to Russia will be solved now,'' Primakov said.
	   Primakov's government has moved cautiously in tackling Russia's
worst economic crisis since the Soviet collapse, refraining from
any radical measures and hoping that the IMF and other lenders will
offer help.
	   The last IMF mission also disapproved of the government's plans
to lower taxes, offer subsidies to ailing industries and increase
state regulation of the economy.
	   Camdessus' evaluation appeared more favorable. He said Russia
must make choices about what taxes it wants to reduce, and that the
Communist-dominated parliament must give the tax service ``the
means to do its job properly.''
	   Primakov also said Camdessus agreed that some state intervention
in the economy may be positive, provided it doesn't prevent the
development of a free-market.

United Nations urges international cooperation on genetics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHRYN MASTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NOORDWIJK, Netherlands (AP) _ A universal code of ethics for
cloning and genetic engineering is essential to preserve humanity
and prevent discrimination, U.N. officials warned Wednesday.
	   Representatives from the U.N. Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization opened a three-day conference here aimed at
forging international cooperation to deal with recent breakthroughs
in genetics research.
	   Representatives from the 186 member states will debate the use _
and possible misuse _ of the rapid scientific advances in genetic
knowledge and application.
	   ``This is of crucial importance in the face of a possible threat
to individuals' access to employment, or health and life insurance
or education on the basis of their genetic make-up,'' said Federico
Mayor, director-general of UNESCO.
	   Last year, the group unanimously passed a declaration of the
human rights of genomes, saying that genetic makeup is the heritage
of humanity and should not be used to discriminate among people.
	   The declaration came after fears of human cloning surfaced when
a sheep was successfully cloned in Scotland. Lie many of its member
nations, UNESCO has spoken out against the possibility of human
cloning, saying it is contrary to the individual dignity of
humanity.
	   ``It is no exaggeration to say the future of mankind is at
stake,'' Dutch Health Minister Els Borst told participants. ``A
great call will be made on mutual solidarity and assistance.''
	   ``We are coming to the point where everything seems possible. We
can study more and more, but is there a limit, and where should it
be set?'' she said.
	   ``What guarantee is there to avoid giving the individual the
feeling that he is simply a subject on the table of scientific
research _ or, to put it another way, a toy in the hands of
scientific research?''
	   Dutch Queen Beatrix officially opened this year's conference,
which coincides with the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Participants of the conference in the Dutch seaside resort of
Noordwijk were addressing the topics of bioethics and women's
rights, preventative medicine and the use of genetic engineering in
industry.
	   Embryology, the health and status of women, reproductive choices
and the genetic engineering of crops will be debated by
representatives from such diverse countries as China, Pakistan,
Israel, the Netherlands, Chile and Italy.
	   UNESCO strives to include all nations in scientific
advancements, Mayor said. While scientific discoveries are often
patented by private companies and used for profit, new ways must be
found to ``dare to share'' the scientific benefits for all people,
he said.
	   ``We have reached the point where we have to chose,'' Mayor
said. ``Either scientific knowledge becomes a commodity and will no
longer be shared by all, or it remains part of our universal
intellectual heritage for the benefit of all humanity.''

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's Muslim leaders
cheered the arrest Wednesday of a Bosnian Serb general wanted for
war crimes_ with hopes the action sets a new trend.
	   NATO troops in northern Bosnia arrested Gen. Radislav Krstic,
charged with genocide and crimes against humanity in the 1995
massacre of Muslims fleeing Srebrenica.
	   Krstic is the most senior person wanted by the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal to be arrested so far. He is also the first one
related to the 1995 massacre at Srebrenica, in which some 8,000
people went missing.
	   ``We welcome this arrest _ particularly the fact that they have
started arresting generals,'' said Mirza Hajric, the adviser to
Bosnian Muslim member of the joint presidency, Alija Izetbegovic.
``We hope they will soon switch over to commanders.''
	   Krstic was arrested in the northern part of Bosnia, controlled
by U.S. troops. Most of the nine actions against alleged war
criminals by international forces have taken place in either in the
British or U.S. sectors.
	   French troops, stationed in the eastern part of Bosnia, however,
have yet to arrest any of the indicted war criminals presumed to be
in their region _ including the most wanted duo of the alleged
civil and military commanders, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.
	   ``This could serve as a good example for the French troops who
have not yet arrested anybody,'' Hajric said.
	   The Bosnian Muslim leadership considers France an obstacle to
arresting Bosnian Serb war-crimes suspects, after the French
government refused to let its officers testify in the tribunal in
The Hague, Netherlands, a source close to the Muslim leadership
said.
	   Many Muslim sources say the French sector is known as ``haven
for war-criminals.''
	   In the past three years, three high ranking French officers have
been caught secretly cooperating with the Serbs behind the back of
the United Nations and NATO.
	   To strengthen the current political atmosphere in Bosnia, it
would be important for the masterminds of crime to be arrested,
Hajric said.
	   ``It would be a message to hundreds of thousands of refugees
that they can prepare themselves to go home,'' he said.
	   As long as war-criminals remain at large, no minority returns
are expected to occur in the areas they move around.
	   In last September's nationwide elections, the Bosnian Serbs
elected Nikola Poplasen, a Bosnian Serb ultranationalist who
cooperated with Karadzic and Mladic during the 1992-95 war, as
president of their half of Bosnia.
	   The move frustrated international agencies charged with the
implementing the peace agreed upon in the 1995 Dayton accord.
	   ``This would also be an important message to Nikola Poplasen
that would made him understand that his policy has come to an
end,'' Hajric stressed.

Asian couple found strangled in Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The bodies of a young man and a woman of
Asian origin who had apparently been strangled were discovered
Wednesday in the mountains of central Cyprus, police said.
	   It appeared that the couple were killed in the last few days and
the bodies taken to the remote spot near a monastery and dumped
down a cliff in the central Troodos mountains, a police statement
said.
	   The area is 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of the port of
Limassol.
	   There was no identification on the bodies, which were fully
clothed.
	   No other details were available.
	   This ``is a most unusual crime for Cyprus,'' district police
chief Miltiades Neocleous told The Associated Press. ``We are
trying to establish their identities but for the moment we don't
have a clue,'' he said.
	   Violent crime is rare in Cyprus, which records less than 10
murders a year.

Lebanon's premier-designate a veteran politician known for honesty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Lebanon-Government &QL; 
 &UR; By HUSSEIN DAKROUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Salim Hoss, the economist appointed prime
minister on Wednesday, is a veteran of Lebanon's turbulent
politics.
	   His 22-year career in politics _ including four prior terms as
prime minister _ has given the Sunni Muslim leader a large asset:
Muslims and Christians alike respect him as an honest public
servant in an often corrupt establishment.
	   The Beirut legislator served as prime minister in the most
difficult times _ during the 1975-90 civil war when the government
had little authority. He once took over leadership after his
predecessor was assassinated and later was himself the target of
would-be assassins.
	   President Emile Lahoud asked Hoss on Wednesday to form a new
Cabinet. Hoss is less flamboyant than his predecessor, Rafik
Hariri, but he is known to share Lahoud's goal of ridding the
public service of corruption.
	   ``God willing, we hope to form a government that will be up to
the level of challenges, a government that fulfills the people's
hopes and meets their needs,'' Hoss said in his trademark soft
voice.
	   Hoss, who turns 69 on Dec. 20, is a firm backer of democracy, a
market economy and Christian-Muslim coexistence in Lebanon.
	   In the civil war that killed 150,000 people, he refused to align
himself with any of the rival militias, leading even opponents to
once call him ``a voice of sanity in a tortured land.''
	   His religious tolerance was put into practice when in 1957 he
married a Christian, Leila Pharaon, although such a mixed marriage
was rare at the time. His wife has since died. The couple had one
daughter.
	   While in government, the tall, balding and bespectacled Hoss
lived modestly in a Beirut apartment, where he still resides.
	   Born on Dec. 20, 1929, Hoss is the youngest of five children of
a lower middle class Sunni family from Beirut. His father, a
pharmacist, died when he was young.
	   Despite financial strains, he studied business at the
prestigious American University of Beirut, where he later taught.
	   In 1961, he obtained an advanced degree in economics and
business administration from Indiana University at Bloomington.
	   He became an accountant and later worked as a financial adviser
in Kuwait. In 1967, he headed the Banking Control Commission at
Lebanon's Central Bank.
	   His switch from banking to politics came in 1976 when President
Elias Sarkis, a former Central Bank governor, named him to form the
Cabinet. In Lebanon's then-swift changing governments, he was prime
minister again in 1987 and twice in 1989.
	   Hoss is a vegetarian who does not smoke or drink. He has a
passion for Arabic literature and Western classical music.

Blair offers two-stage end to hereditary members in House of Lords
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair has offered to phase out
hereditary members of the House of Lords in two stages, but the
leader of the opposition rejected the compromise Wednesday.
	   The offer _ not previously disclosed by the government _
apparently was intended to avoid a prolonged and bitter fight
between the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the unelected
upper chamber which has limited power to revise and delay
legislation.
	   Blair's Labor Party manifesto for the 1997 election included a
pledge to abolish hereditary members.
	   Conservative Party leader William Hague said in the House of
Commons that he could not support ``major constitutional change
that is based on no comprehensive plan or principle.'' He
complained that the government has not spelled out how members of
the House of Lords would be chosen.
	   Blair, however, said the Conservative leader in the Lords, Lord
Cranborne, had agreed to his offer to keep a hundred hereditary
peers in the chamber as an intermediate step. There are now 759
hereditary nobles who are entitled to vote in the House of Lords.
	   Blair has promised to appoint a commission to decide how members
will be chosen.
	   ``While we believe that your agreement to retain hereditary
peers after stage one is a huge climbdown on the part of the
government, let me make it clear that we believe it is wrong to
embark on fundamental change to the Parliament of this country
without any idea of where it is leading to,'' Hague said during
prime minister's questions in the House of Commons.
	   Blair replied that it was ``common sense ...to get this thing
done with as little fuss and as easily as possible, which we can
now do.''

Duma seeks medical report on Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS. UPDATES with Yeltsin talking with Chirac,

 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Communist-dominated parliament on
Wednesday demanded the release of Boris Yeltsin's medical records
so they could be used as a possible reason for his ouster.
	   Yeltsin remained in the hospital for the 11th straight day
Wednesday with what aides described as pneumonia. It follows many
previous ailments, which have diminished the president's authority
and raised doubts about his ability to stay in office through the
end of his term in 2000.
	   The parliament's demand for his medical records is non-binding,
but it increases pressure on the president.
	   ``The absence of trustworthy information on the president's
health has spurred abundant rumors, allegations and even guesswork
diagnosis, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease,'' it said.
``That stirs the public and causes doubts about the president's
ability to exercise his duties.''
	   The document, which urges the presidential doctors to submit a
report on Yeltsin's health within 10 days, was passed by the
parliament's lower house, the State Duma, by a 247-33 vote.
	   But Russian law gives the Duma no power to make an inquest into
the president's health, and the resolution didn't say what would
happen if the 10-day ultimatum is not met.
	   Alexander Kotenkov, Yeltsin's envoy to the Duma, quickly
dismissed the statement as having no legal meaning.
	   The Russian Constitution says that president may be dismissed
from office due to ``lasting inability to exercise his duties.''
But it doesn't spell out who must determine that or how.
	   The Duma decided to ask the Constitutional Court for a
clarification.
	   Yeltsin was to remain in the hospital through the end of the
week, but may return to the Kremlin next Monday, his deputy chief
of staff Yuri Yarov said Wednesday.
	   Yeltsin was handling limited paperwork and held telephone
conversations with French President Jacques Chirac and Russia's
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Wednesday, presidential press
service said.
	   Another Yeltsin aide, Oleg Sysuyev, said Tuesday that Yeltsin,
known as a restless patient, is urging doctors to discharge him as
soon as possible.
	   Renat Akchurin, the surgeon who did Yeltsin's heart bypass
operation in 1996, said the current bout of pneumonia, the second
in as many years, is apparently due to the president's weakened
immunity and his age, not heart problems.
	   Akchurin, speaking in an interview with the weekly Argumenty i
Fakty, said he has not examined Yeltsin for eight months, but
believed that heart problems were unlikely.
	   Still, that didn't mean the illness could be taken lightly.
	   ``Pneumonia sometimes brings even healthy people to a tragic
end,'' Akchurin said. ``For those with a record of heart illness,
it always has a quite serious character.''
	   Yeltsin has made only rare public appearances in recent months,
and was visiting the Kremlin only two or three days a week before
he fell ill. Primakov has taken over many day-to-day duties in
Yeltsin's absence.

Administration considering various arms-reduction options

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Clinton may outline new ideas for
reducing and safeguarding nuclear arsenals here and in Russia in
next month's State of the Union address, administration and
congressional officials say.
	   But the officials stress that much depends on whether Russia's
parliament moves first to ratify a long-delayed major disarmament
agreement.
	   The Communist-dominated Duma, the lower house, is expected to
begin debating the 6-year-old START II measure as early as Friday.
The pact, ratified in 1996 by the U.S. Senate, would cut the two
nations' arsenals by roughly half, to 3,000 to 3,500 warheads each.
	   Ratification would remove a major obstacle to the Pentagon's
desire to consolidate its nuclear inventory _ current
Republican-written restrictions that require that at least 6,000
nuclear warheads be maintained and that dictate the mix of
missiles, submarines and bombers.
	   Administration and congressional officials stress Clinton has
yet to decide on specifics.
	   But the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
proposals under review range from asking Congress to ease the
barriers to go-it-alone reductions in nuclear weapons to more cash
to help Moscow to dismantle its old, rusting Soviet missiles and to
retrain its weapons scientists.
	   P.J. Crowley, a White House spokesman for the National Security
Council, suggested Wednesday it is premature to discuss specific
proposals, although it was ``safe to say that arms control'' is
among the subjects Clinton is likely to cover in the late-January
address.
	   ``We are certainly hopeful the Duma will ratify Start II,''
Crowley said. ``This would be a welcome step.''
	   If Russia does ratify the agreement, the administration is ready
to begin negotiations on ever deeper cuts under a START III
agreement, Crowley said.
	   Troubled by a lack of cash to maintain its present weapons,
Russian lawmakers are looking more favorably upon the treaty,
signed in 1993 by Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The
Russian leader's uncertain health is fueling new concerns about the
future and security of the nation's aging nuclear arsenal.
	   ``For the moment, Prime Minister (Yevgeny) Primakov has majority
support in the Russian Duma for prompt ratification'' of START II,
said Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., who recently returned from a nine-day
visit to Russia and Ukraine.
	   Under a program originated by Lugar and former Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., in 1991, the United States has spent more than $400 million
annually to help Russia dismantle its old Soviet weapons. Champions
of the program say more money is needed. That is one issue under
consideration by Clinton as he prepares his fiscal 2000 budget and
his State of the Union address, officials said.
	   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, says the United States shouldn't wait for the
Duma but should move to reduce its own arsenal unilaterally.
	   He suggested that if Republicans agree to ease the ban on
unilateral cuts, more Democrats might support GOP demands for a
national shield against incoming ballistic missiles.
	   ``The threat is no longer an authorized launch of nuclear
missiles, the threat is now an unauthorized launch,'' Kerrey said
in an interview, suggesting a launch by a rogue nation or terrorist
regime.
	   But few in either party publicly embraced Kerrey's views.
	   U.S. optimism over Russian ratification of START II was
tempered, given that Russia's parliament has promised to debate
START II in the past and always delayed it. In addition, some
Russian officials are trying to link ratification with obtaining
more money from the International Monetary Fund, a linkage the
Clinton administration discourages. And some Russian lawmakers are
insisting on conditions that might require the U.S. Senate to
review it again.
	   Would the administration ask Congress for unilateral reductions
if Russia continues to stall?
	   It wouldn't be the preferred course, suggested Crowley.
	   ``We prefer to work through treaties,'' said the White House
spokesman. ``They provide legally binding, verification
mechanisms.''

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs, UPDATES with Palestinian comment &QL; 
 &UR; By EYAL WARSHAVSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Dozens of Palestinian university
students waited at a traffic circle Wednesday, holding rocks and
concrete slabs. They screened cars. ``Wait, it's an Arab,'' one
said of the driver in an approaching car. ``A Jew,'' another said.
Seconds later, a hail of stones hit the vehicle.
	   In the ambush, a young Israeli soldier was dragged out of the
car and, as he cowered on the pavement and raised his hands
defensively, was struck repeatedly on the head with rocks.
	   Captured by cameras, the attack was shown over and over on
Israeli television, making some Israelis wonder whether the
Palestinian Authority was trying to control violence as it pledged
in the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace agreement.
	   The ambush overshadowed the stabbing death earlier Wednesday of
an Arab street cleaner in Jerusalem, apparently by an Israeli
extremist. During the funeral procession for Osama Natche, a
41-year-old father of six, mourners torched an Israeli car and
stoned Israeli police who fired rubber bullets.
	   Israel and the Palestinian Authority blamed each other for the
violence which came just 10 days before U.S. President Bill Clinton
was to arrive in Israel and the Palestinian areas to usher in the
second stage of the Wye River land-for-security agreement.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said the Palestinian Authority has incited against
Israel in the dispute over the release of Palestinian prisoners.
	   On Tuesday, the Palestinian parliament speaker, Ahmed Qureia,
told protesters demanding that Israel release prisoners that they
had the backing of the Palestinian leadership which ``is prepared
once again to throw stones in order to free the people.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Israel was to blame
for the violence, saying Netanyahu raised tensions by not releasing
prisoners and continuing to expand Jewish settlements.
	   In the Wye agreement, Israel promised to release 750 Palestinian
prisoners by January. In a first stage last month, it freed 250
prisoners, but most were criminals, not those held for anti-Israeli
activities as the Palestinian Authority had expected.
	   Arafat raised the issue earlier this week with Clinton in
meetings with Washington. ``He (Clinton) promised us to make every
effort to solve this issue,'' said Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat upon his return from Washington.
	   About half of the 2,500 Palestinians held by Israel are members
of Arafat's Fatah faction and there has been growing anger in Fatah
ranks over the Palestinian Authority's failure to get detainees
released.
	   Most of those involved in Wednesday's attack on the soldier on
the outskirts of the West Bank town of Ramallah where Fatah
activists. Fatah may have been trying to embarrass Arafat with the
ambush in order to step up pressure on him to deal with the issue
of the prisoners.
	   The incident began when about 150 students from nearby Bir Zeit
University were bused to the center of Ramallah for a protest
organized by various political factions, including Fatah and the
Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   They staged a march seeking the release of prisoners, then
walked to a traffic circle at the outskirts of town and began
stoning Israeli cars.
	   At one point, a white car with Israeli license plates
approached. The vehicle was driven by a man wearing a skullcap, and
a soldier was in the passenger seat.
	   To shouts of ``Yahudi, yahudi,'' Arabic for Jew, about two dozen
Palestinians began pelting the car with stones and smashing its
windows. The driver fled from the moving car after a large rock
broke the side window and just missed his head.
	   The car came to a halt when it hit a wall. Some attackers jumped
on the hood. Others, rocks in hand, reached inside the car,
striking the soldier. One Palestinian pulled the soldier out and
delivered more blows as the Israeli cowered on the pavement.
Another seized the soldier's M-16 assault rifle.
	   The soldier eventually got up and ran to safety. As he escaped,
the attackers threw more stones at him, then doused the car with
kerosene and set it on fire.
	   Israeli troops fired live ammunition and a barrage of
rubber-coated metal bullets and tear gas to disperse the
Palestinians. Eleven Palestinians were injured by rubber bullets.
	   The soldier, Assaf Miara, was hospitalized for head injuries.
From his hospital bed, Miara, his head bandaged, watched the
incident on video and quietly cursed at one time.
	   Israel TV said Palestinian police later recovered the M-16 and
handed it over to the Israeli army. Troops sealed off Ramallah,
barring Palestinians from entering or leaving the city, TV said.

U.N. Secretary-General will go to Libya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with final news conference, announcement he will
travel to Libya &QL; 
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said
Wednesday he will travel to Libya after completing his North
African tour this week.
	   Speaking at a news conference after a two-day visit to the
Algerian capital, Annan said he would go to Libya after his trip to
Tunis -- the last stop on his North African tour aimed at
unblocking plans for a U.N. referendum on the disputed Western
Sahara.
	   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Annan would travel to Tripoli on Saturday to meet with authorities
there on the 1988 Pan Am bombing that has led to U.N. sanctions
against Libya.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions in 1992, including a
flight ban, to try to force Libya to hand over two suspects in the
bombing that killed 270 people.
	   The sanctions ban flights to and from the country. Neighboring
Tunisia provides a land route for those traveling to Libya from the
region.
	   During his Algerian stay, Annan has worked to revive plans for a
U.N.-sponsored referendum on the fate of the disputed Western
Sahara territory.
	   Morocco has laid claim to the territory since Spain abandoned it
in 1975. Polisario Front rebels, based in southern Algeria, are
seeking the Western Sahara's independence.
	   The referendum had been set for Dec. 7 but Annan has suggested
it be moved to December 1999. Disputes about who is eligible to
cast a ballot have been behind the delays. Morocco insists some
65,000 people from three tribes should be on the list that now
carries some 90,000 names.
	   Annan visited Morocco and the Western Sahara in early November
but returned to U.N. headquarters in New York because of the Iraqi
crisis.
	   Annan told reporters he had ``complete support'' from Algerian
authorities for the U.N. plan. The U.N. chief met with President
Liamine Zeroual and other officials for talks he later said were
``very useful and very deep.''
	   Annan also discussed plans for the Organization of African Unity
summit to be held in Algiers in June 1999.

Macedonia will host NATO force for Kosovo, premier says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ The Macedonian government confirmed
Wednesday it will allow a NATO force to be stationed in its
territory to serve as a back-up for international peace officials
in neighboring Kosovo.
	   Macedonian Premier Ljubco Georgievski said the government made
the ``difficult decision'' after much deliberation, taking into
consideration that Macedonia aspires to fully join NATO and because
it ``supports peaceful initiatives for solving the Kosovo
conflict.''
	   Macedonia borders Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic, whose
Kosovo province erupted in war this year, with local ethnic
Albanians fighting government forces to win independence.
	   Under U.S.-led initiative, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
agreed to pull out some of the government forces from Kosovo.
Milosevic also agreed to allow trained officials from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to verify
compliance on the ground.
	   The verifiers are currently being dispatched to Kosovo, but
there are concerns for their physical safety in the volatile
region. NATO planes are to verify compliance from the air, and keep
an eye on the ground mission.
	   The NATO-led ``extraction force'' to be stationed in Macedonia,
is intended to evacuate the verifiers should they run into trouble.
	   Macedonia, which has its own sizable ethnic Albanian community,
was reluctant to agree to hosting the force, for fear of upsetting
its relations with neighboring Yugoslavia.
	   Georgievski said his newly elected center-right government
decided in favor of hosting the troops after NATO leaders offered
the small Balkan nation ``special privileges'' in exchange _
including assurances the move would bring Macedonia closer to the
desired full membership in the Alliance.
	   NATO officials also assured Macedonia the troops would be ``part
of a peace operation, not a rapid reaction force.''
	   Wednesday's statement was Georgievski's first, after taking the
job Monday, following the very first meeting of his new cabinet.

Mother delves into underworld to probe daughter's death

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ For Eleni Fotiadou, the official
explanation was not enough.
	   To probe deeper into the death of her 20-year-old daughter, the
technician at a cellular biology lab shed her white coat for the
miniskirts and high heels of a prostitute. The alter ego was part
of her six-month search through the gritty back streets of this
northern Greek port.
	   Finally, a prosecutor joined her in challenging the coroner's
report that Paraskevi Fotiadou died of a heroin overdose. Eight
people are under indictment on charges of gang rape and murder,
authorities confirmed Wednesday.
	   In her guise as a prostitute, Fotiadou even allegedly slept with
the man she believes to have killed her daughter.
	   Detective Stratos Bakirtzis, who helped her on the case, said it
was the only way to infiltrate the group which has been placed
under indictment.
	   ``I started dressing like a prostitute and junkie and going to
places where I could get information ... I was sure that my child
was killed,'' Ms. Fotiadou, 44, told a news conference.
	   Her daughter, a marketing student, was sitting on a park bench
with her sister in June. She said she was going to get a drink and
never returned.
	   The young woman was found two days later _ a used syringe at her
side _ in a derelict building located in one of Salonica's
blue-collar districts more than five kilometers (three miles) away.
	   ``We were called to the mortuary to identify the body and we
took it home. Although the man at the mortuary told us not to look
at the body because the days had past, we did. The body was full of
wounds,'' Ms. Fotiadou said.
	   Ms. Fotiadou's refused to accept the explanation that her
daughter was just another statistic in the dozens of deaths among
the junkies in Salonica, a Balkan crossroads with a teeming
underclass fed by prostitution rings and drug smugglers from across
Eastern Europe.
	   ``My child's body was full of bruises, bumps and scrapes ... her
jewelry was gone while her personal effects contained things that
were not hers. Her clothes were torn off, which shows that violence
had been perpetrated,'' she added.
	   Ms. Fotiadou also said the search was launched out of
frustration.
	   ``I went to the police to ask for their help, but they were
completely indifferent,'' she claimed.
	   In August, she made up her mind to take matters into her own
hands. After work, she would come home and make the transformation.
She would rumple her shoulder-length hair. Some days she would wear
attention-grabbing clothing: short skirts and tight tops. Other
times, she would don the tattered clothes of someone down on their
luck.
	   With the help of Bakirtzis, she began trolling areas known to be
hangouts frequented by junkies and prostitutes. Ms. Fotiadou said
she wore a wire while Bakirtzis detective videotaped from a
distance.
	   She was gradually accepted as one of the crowd.
	   ``What goes on there, the mind of a normal person cannot
comprehend. That's where I started. I found out that because they
need their fix, they push some of their women into prostitution, so
I went there. The scene there is indescribable,'' she recounted.
	   Ms. Fotiadou claims that gossip, rumors and tips eventually led
her to eight men and women she alleges were responsible for her
daughter's death.
	   She claims her daughter was accosted, drugged and taken to the
home of one of the suspects. There, she was gang raped and killed,
her body later dumped in an empty building, Ms. Fotiadou alleges.
	   ``We have cassettes where the hookers describe the method of
murder, they name the people who murdered the girl,'' said
Fotiadou's lawyer Nikos Dialinas.
	   All the evidence was turned over to prosecutor Petros
Raptopoulos, who last week charged the eight with murder, robbery
and gang rape. But the suspects have not yet been captured.

At least 60 dead in fighting over jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Fighting between two Somali clans
competing for jobs with a Swedish relief agency has left at least
60 people dead and 150 others injured over the past three weeks.
	   Representatives of the two clans battling over work with Swedish
Church Relief said Wednesday that fighting had intensified and both
sides were bringing in vehicles mounted with machine guns.
	   Thousands of residents have fled the town of Sakow, 240 miles
(390 kilometers) southwest of the capital, Mogadishu, local radio
reported.
	   Since Somalia descended into civil war and famine after the
ouster of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991, armed militia have
carved out territories in which they feel entitled to all the
available jobs and relief supplies.
	   Aid agencies unfamiliar with clan turf wars or trying to bridge
the gap are often caught in the middle.
	   The Swedish Church Relief could not be reached for comment.
	   The current dispute pits the Moallimweyne and Geladleh subclans
against each other.
	   Sheikh Qasim Ibrahim Nur, a spokesman for the Rahanwein clan of
which Geladleh is a subclan, warned that the conflict could spread
as other subclans come to the Geladlehs' support.
	   Radio reports Wednesday said 15 people were killed in battles
the day before when Moallimweyne militiamen attacked Geladleh
fighters north of Sakow.

Ireland announces big tax cuts due to `Celtic tiger' economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Enjoying the fruits of Europe's
fastest-growing economy, Ireland's finance minister announced big
tax cuts Wednesday in his 1999 budget.
	   But Charlie McGreevy warned the Dail, Ireland's key lower house
of Parliament, that ``economic booms don't last forever,'' so he
would observe a 4 percent increase in government spending in hopes
of keeping the country's ``Celtic tiger'' economy under control.
	   He cut the rate of tax Ireland charges to businesses by 4
percentage points to 28 percent, one of the lowest in Europe, in
what was McGreevy's final budget before Ireland joins 10 other
countries Jan. 1 in forming a single currency run by the Central
European Bank in Frankfurt.
	   The cuts in corporation tax are expected to cost the government
200 million pounds (dlrs 300 million) in annual revenue.
	   Ireland has set a goal of levying just 12.5 percent on all
Irish-based firms by 2003, when Dublin's International Financial
Services Center loses its status as a special zone of 10 percent
corporation tax.
	   McGreevy also removed 80,000 low-income wage-earners from the
need to pay any income tax at all at Ireland's base 26 percent
rate. And he raised the cutoff point when larger earners start
paying the higher 46 percent rate. Together the moves were expected
to reduce government revenues by 300 million pounds (dlrs 450
million) annually.
	   Despite the cuts, McGreevy forecast that the government would
collect 2.3 billion pounds (dlrs 3.4 billion) more than it intends
to spend in 1999, and that the country's domestic product would
grow by 6.7 percent, defying recessionary trends overshadowing the
world economy.
	   He projected that unemployment would fall to 6.8 percent from
the current 7.8 percent, which is already a 14-year low.
	   Ireland's economy has been booming since 1994 on a wave of U.S.
high-tech investment, European Union funding, property development
and unprecedented domestic confidence. It has grown by 35 percent
in the past four years without fueling inflation, which has
remained constant around 2 percent annually.
	   And Ireland is now defying its history of emigration, with tens
of thousands of exiles and foreigners arriving in the past two
years.
	   McGreevy didn't change the rates of tax on alcohol and motor
fuels, but added 5 pence (7.5 cents) to each pack of cigarettes.

Kosovo conflict tops agenda for OSCE ministers in Oslo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with day's meeting. &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ As an OSCE foreign ministers' meeting
focused Wednesday on the organization's risky task of maintaining
peace in Kosovo, Yugoslavia said it should have been included.
	   The 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, or OSCE, is sending 2,000 unarmed observers to the Kosovo
province of Yugsolavia in hopes to stopping attacks on mainly
ethnic Albanian civilians.
	   The monitors' mission, one of the riskiest and biggest
undertakings by the OSCE, was a key topic during opening day of a
two-day foreign ministers meeting in the Norwegian capital. The
group fears that failure could lead to violence spreading in the
Balkans.
	   ``The OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission is undoubtedly the
greatest challenge the OSCE has ever faced,'' said Austrian Foreign
Minister Wolfgang Schussel, speaking on behalf of the European
Union. ``The operation is not without risk, and we highly value the
importance the mission attaches to the security of its members.''
Austria is the current EU chairman.
	   In Kosovo, hundreds have been killed and up to 300,000 mainly
ethnic Albanians have been displaced since Serbia launched a
crackdown on separatists in February. Kosovo is a province of
Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslavia was suspended from the OSCE in 1992 for allegedly
fomenting ethnic conflict in the former Yugoslav republics of
Croatia and Bosnia. It was not officially represented in Oslo, and
the Belgrade government Wednesday wrote to the OSCE to complain.
	   ``I have seen at letter in which they say they would very much
like to be here. And I don't see that as a protest,'' said
Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek, who takes over the
OSCE's rotating membership in January. ``They say that since we
were discussing the question of Kosovo, they should be present at
this discussion.''
	   At a briefing after the first day of closed meetings, Vollebaek
said Yugoslavia and the government of President Slobodan Milosevic
still have to meet tough requirements before they will be allowed
to rejoin the OSCE.
	   ``We haven't discussed this here today,'' said Vollebaek. ``But
I think I think it is important that we see it as a clear aim.''
	   Facing threats of a NATO airstrike, Milosevic agreed to a
U.S.-brokered truce that is shaky and troubled by sporadic
violence. The deal included allowing 2,000 members of the Kosovo
Verification Mission into the province under NATO protection.
	   Vollebaek said 499 were in place as of Wednesday, and would
continue arriving at the rate of 250 a week until the total of
2,000 is reached by mid-January.
	   Although the Seventh Ministerial Meeting of the OSCE drew
foreign ministers from about 45 countries, some key countries _
including the United States and Britain _ sent lower ranking
delegations.
	   At the end of the meeting, the ministers hope to adopt a series
of resolutions on a broad range of topics.

Norway reduces haddock quota
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway and the EU agreed Tuesday that the
total haddock quota in the North Sea will be reduced from 115,000
tons in 1998 to 88,550 tons in 1999.
	   The total cod quota in the North Sea will be 132,400 tons, 7,600
tons less than 1998, while the mackerel quota should be on the same
level as 1998. Norway's quota of the mackerel will be 151,750 tons
of a total 484,615 tons.
	   Norway and the EU also agreed that they will manage the North
Sea herring stock according to the principles of the herring
agreement of 1998. For 1999, the total herring quota in the North
Sea will be 265,000, whereas Norway's quota is 29 percent or 76,850
tons.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's Muslim leaders
cheered the arrest Wednesday of a Bosnian Serb general wanted for
war crimes_ with hopes the detention is start of a trend.
	   NATO troops in northern Bosnia arrested Gen. Radislav Krstic,
charged with genocide and crimes against humanity in the 1995
massacre of Muslims fleeing Srebrenica.
	   Krstic is the most senior person wanted by the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal to be arrested so far. He is also the first one
related to the 1995 massacre at Srebrenica, in which some 8,000
people went missing after the U.N. safe haven was overtaken by
Bosnian Serb rebels.
	   ``We welcome this arrest _ particularly the fact that they have
started arresting generals,'' said Mirza Hajric, adviser to Bosnian
Muslim member of the joint presidency, Alija Izetbegovic. ``We hope
they will soon switch over to commanders.''
	   Krstic is believed to be a close associate of former Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief Gen.
Ratko Mladic. The two, who have not been detained, have been
indicted for genocide for allegedly masterminding the Srebrenica
massacre.
	   To strengthen the current political atmosphere in Bosnia, it
would be important for the masterminds of crime to be arrested,
Hajric said.
	   ``It would be a message to hundreds of thousands of refugees
that they can prepare themselves to go home,'' he said.
	   No minority returns are expected in areas where war-criminals
remain at large.

Chief of Kosovo Albanian team says Serbs blocking negotiations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with three dead in downtown Pristina shootout in final
graf.
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Separatist guerrillas increasingly
agree with Kosovo politicians but Serb officials are stalling talks
on the status of the war-torn province, a top ethnic Albanian
negotiator said Wednesday.
	   The negotiator, Fehmi Agani, welcomed a statement by the Kosovo
Liberation Army that it could agree to something short of full,
immediate independence for Kosovo, which had been its goal.
	   Guerrilla spokesman Adem Demaci made the statement Monday in the
first clear indication the secessionist rebels would accept a
temporary status for Kosovo as a Yugoslav republic. Yugoslavia
consists of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro. Kosovo, with a
majority ethnic Albanian population, is a province of Serbia.
	   ``This is a serious approach to the problem,'' Agani told
reporters in Pristina, Kosovo's capital. ``It was easy to insist on
independence as a final goal but this prevented the process from
moving forward. A decisive time has come when we should present a
united stand.''
	   But Agani accused Serb negotiators of blocking talks on Kosovo's
status and inciting confrontations between the guerrillas and Serb
security forces.
	   Last month, Belgrade authorities rejected a U.S.-sponsored plan
for Kosovo as giving too much independence to the majority
Albanians. Serbian officials called the plan a ``step to full
secession.''
	   Serbia then issued its own plan which would give Kosovo some
autonomy but maintain firm Serb control.
	   Agani Wednesday called the Serbian draft proposal ``catastrophic
and destructive ... since it affirms Serbian rule over Kosovo.''
	   The government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic Tuesday
accused rebels of endangering the shaky peace and blasted
international efforts to include the guerrillas in the peace
process.
	   In a protest letter, the Yugoslav government also accused the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe of ``legalizing
the terrorists.''
	   Agani said the Yugoslav note to the OSCE was a sign of
``nervousness'' and called on the international community to exert
more pressure on Milosevic.
	   ``I don't believe the international community would allow its
peace efforts to fail easily,'' Agani said.
	   Since a U.S.-brokered, Oct. 12 agreement brought a halt to
full-scale fighting in Kosovo, international diplomatic efforts
have focused on finding a political solution for the separatist.
province.
	   Sporadic violence has continued since the agreement and
international officials are worried the fragile peace will collapse
in new fighting if a political settlement isn't reached soon.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and as many as 300,000 fled from
their homes during a nearly eight-month crackdown by Serb forces
against ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   Late Wednesday, three ethnic Albanians were killed by unknown
assailants in downtown Pristina, when their car was riddled with
bullets, police said. It was unclear if the killings were related
to the ethnic tensions in the province and no further information
was immediately available.

Kidnapped policemen freed in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Four policemen kidnapped last month on the border
of breakaway Chechnya were released in a massive police operation
Wednesday and six of their captors were arrested, a news report
said.
	   About 200 officers with Chechnya's anti-kidnapping department
and presidential guard led the operation near Chechnya's border
with the volatile Russian region of Ingushetia, Mairbek Vachagayev,
spokesman for Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov, told the Interfax
news agency.
	   The four Ingush police officers were kidnapped Nov. 14 while
guarding a checkpoint along the Chechen-Ingush border in southern
Russia's Caucasus Mountains.
	   One more officer was also seized but he managed to escape and
tell authorities where the others were being held.
	   Six of their captors were arrested in Wednesday's operation,
Interfax said. It did not say whether others escaped.
	   Maskhadov expressed his condolences over the abduction.
	   Ingushetia, a region torn by violence resulting from ethnic
strife with nearby North Ossetia, has also been hit by spillover
violence and kidnappings from Chechnya, where rebels fought a
1994-96 independence war with Russia.
	   Russian officials say hundreds of people kidnapped in and around
Chechnya, including Russians and several foreigners, remain in
captivity.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Two dozen Palestinians ambushed an
Israeli car Wednesday, smashed its windshields with stones, then
pulled an Israeli soldier out of the vehicle and kicked and beat
him with stones.
	   Attackers shouted ``Yahudi, Yahudi,'' Arabic for ``Jew, Jew.''
	   The soldier cowered by the car door, holding his hands up to
fend off blows as several Palestinians struck his head with rocks.
After about a minute of relentless attack, the soldier got up and
ran, bleeding from the head.
	   As he escaped, his assailants stole his M-16 assault rifle,
threw more stones at him, then doused the car with kerosene and set
it on fire.
	   Earlier Wednesday, a 41-year-old Palestinian street cleaner,
Osama Musa Natche, was stabbed to death in what police believe was
an attack by an Israeli extremist.
	   Hundreds joined Natche's funeral procession along Salah Eddin
Street, the main thoroughfare of traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
Dozens of marchers broke away and hurled stones at Israeli riot
police who fired rubber bullets.
	   In a side street, Palestinians stoned an Israeli motorist,
pulled him out of the car and then set the vehicle on fire, said
Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby.
	   The renewed violence came just 10 days before U.S. President
Bill Clinton was to arrive in Israel and the Palestinian areas to
usher in the next stage of the Wye River land-for-security
agreement he helped negotiate in October.
	   There has also been fresh acrimony between Israeli and
Palestinian leaders, with both sides accusing each other of
violating the accord. However, an Israeli official said that as of
now, the Clinton visit was still on.
	   The stone-throwing attack in the West Bank began when about 150
students from Bir Zeit University were bused to downtown Ramallah
to protest Israel's refusal to release a large number of
Palestinians jailed for anti-Israeli activities.
	   The march was organized by university groups allied with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction and the Islamic
militant group Hamas.
	   The demonstrators, most of them Fatah followers, then walked to
the outskirts of Ramallah, and began stoning Israeli cars at a
traffic circle about half a mile (a kilometer) from the Jewish
settlement of Beit El.
	   At one point, a white car with Israeli license plates
approached. The vehicle was driven by a man wearing a skullcap, and
a soldier was in the passenger seat.
	   To shouts of ``Yahudi, Yahudi,'' two dozen Palestinians began
pelting the car with stones and smashing its windows. The driver
stopped the car and ran away after a large rock struck him in the
face. The attackers then converged on the soldier and attacked him.
	   Israeli troops fired live ammunition and a barrage of
rubber-coated metal bullets and tear gas. Eleven Palestinians were
lightly injured by rubber bullets.
	   A student organizer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the car attack had not been planned. He said student leaders would
try to find those who had seized the soldier's weapon and turn them
over to Palestinian police.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan,
held the Palestinian Authority responsible for the incident, saying
it had incited to violence over the prisoners' issue.
	   Bar-Illan also said the attack was ``a gross and dangerous''
violation of the Wye River agreement.
	   A day earlier, the speaker of the Palestinian legislative
council, Ahmed Qureia, told protesters seeking the release of
Palestinian prisoners that ``the leadership that threw stones is
prepared once again to throw stones in order to free the people and
to free the land.''
	   Also Wednesday, Bar-Illan confirmed that Netanyahu complained to
Clinton that the Palestinians have repeatedly violated the peace
agreement. In a letter, he asked Clinton to use his influence to
halt the violations.
	   Bar-Illan said the letter indicates ``there is a danger to the
peace process if the violations continue.''
	   In the letter, Bar-Illan said, Netanyahu objected to recent
statements by Arafat and others that a Palestinian state would be
declared on May 4, 1999.
	   The Wye accord urges both Israel and the Palestinians to refrain
from unilateral steps that prejudge the outcome of talks on a
permanent peace accord.

Opposition rejects dialogue with President Tudjman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A coalition of the country's strongest
opposition parties rejected Wednesday a rare outstretched hand for
dialogue offered by President Franjo Tudjman.
	   According to Vlado Gotovac, a spokesman, for the united
opposition, the group felt it would be unfair to meet Tudjman as
the country's leader, instead of as a party leader, because it
would create an inflexible, counterproductive atmosphere. He did
not elaborate.
	   ``We demanded to meet with Tudjman as a party chief and not as
the president of the country,'' said Gotovac.
	   The group of six parties has long been trying to meet with
Tudjman, in hopes of drawing his attention to the lack of
inter-party tolerance or cooperation, as well as increasing
instances of corruption within the upper echelons of power.
	   Last month, the opposition gave up their positions in
parliamentary bodies in a sign of protest until parliament, which
is overwhelmingly dominated by Tudjman's Croatian Democratic Union,
agrees to address certain cases of corruption involving top
government officials.
	   Tudjman, a 76-year-old ruler who controls all walks of Croatian
life, has flatly rejected any compromise with opposition parties
since he rose to power in 1990.
	   Faced with sagging support in the last few months and pressure
from abroad, the authoritarian leader agreed last week to sit with
the opposition leaders.
	   Elections are scheduled for late 1999 but may be called as early
March.

Airbus confirms plans to raise output despite Boeing woes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Undaunted by news of falling profitability and job
cuts at U.S. rival Boeing, Europe's Airbus Industrie said Wednesday
that it has a long backlog of orders and plans to increase output
by 30 percent next year.
	   Cautious expansion of its output in the past three years is the
reason behind the backlog, the company said, adding that the
European consortium has been little affected by the Asian financial
crisis.
	   Airbus has ``a backlog of 1,300 firm orders,'' said spokeswoman
Barbara Kracht.
	   Airbus said it plans to increase output to 290 aircraft in 1999,
30 percent higher than the likely total production of 230 aircraft
this year, Ms. Kracht said.
	   The Airbus work force is currently ``stable ... at 30,000 to
33,000,'' she added. The figures represent an approximation because
they represent employees of Airbus' four partners rather than staff
employed by Airbus itself.
	   ``The Asian crisis has had much less of an effect on us,'' she
said. ``There have been no cancellations of wide-bodied aircraft
such as the A330 and A340 ... (while) an order for a dozen
single-aisle aircraft was canceled but easily placed elsewhere,''
Kracht added.
	   Boeing said Tuesday that Asia's economic woes have wreaked havoc
with its long-term business plans, prompting across-the-board
production cuts and the elimination of as many as 20,000 additional
jobs through 2000.
	   Boeing also indicated that it now expects the full brunt of the
region's woes over the next two years will depress total revenue by
more than 10 percent, down to dlrs 50 billion from the roughly dlrs
56 billion expected this year.
	   Airbus, meanwhile, has seen its share of the market for
100-seater-plus jetliners rise sharply in the past three years,
with firm orders climbing to 503 by November this year, up 9.3
percent from the 460 orders in 1997, Kracht said.
	   The Airbus consortium is made up of Aerospatiale of France,
Spain's Construccoines Aeronauticas, DaimlerChrysler Aerospace of
Germany, and British Aerospace.

Suspended runner assails German track federation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Three-time Boston Marathon winner Uta Pippig, who
faces a two-year doping ban, assailed Wednesday the German
Athletics Federation for refusing to give her another drug test.
	   ``By refusing another test, they took away my chance to defend
me,'' Pippig told the Sender Freies Berlin, a Berlin radio station.
	   ``I have nothing to hide,'' she said. ``If you are seeking more
controls, then you are not doping.''
	   Angered by the way she has been treated by the German
federation, Pippig said she would refuse to run for Germany at the
2000 Olympics in Sydney.
	   Pippig, 33, was suspended in October. She tested positive for
abnormally high levels of testosterone, a male sex hormone used by
athletes to enhance performance illegally.
	   The runner was tested in April in Boulder, Colorado, where she
lives most of the year. Two samples were taken at the time and both
were positive, but Pippig later asked for more tests.
	   Pippig denied the doping charges and insisted the testosterone
abnormalities were caused by a medicine taken to battle a viral
infection.
	   German doping experts have ruled out such a connection.
	   A hearing by the German Athletics Federation (DLV) has been
postponed until January so that Pippig can undergo more medical
tests in the United States.
	   If the DLV finds her guilty of doping, Pippig will be banned for
two years.
	   Pippig won the Boston Marathon three years in a row, between
1994 and 1996, and the New York Marathon in 1993. She has also won
the Berlin Marathon three times.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ After a record sales year, Ferrari expects to see
lower profits over the next two years, the sportscar maker's
president said Wednesday.
	   The company has set highs of 470 Ferrari sales in Britain and
650 in Germany this year and expects to post about a 100 percent
revenue increase, Luca di Montezemolo said.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Dozens of Palestinian university
students waited at a traffic circle Wednesday, holding rocks and
concrete slabs. They screened cars. ``Wait, it's an Arab,'' one
said of the driver in an approaching car. ``A Jew,'' another said.
Seconds later, a hail of stones hit the vehicle.
	   In the ambush, a young Israeli soldier was dragged out of the
car and, as he cowered on the pavement and raised his hands
defensively, was struck repeatedly on the head with rocks.
	   Captured by cameras, the attack was shown over and over on
Israeli television, making some Israelis wonder whether the
Palestinian Authority was trying to control violence as it pledged
in the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace agreement.
	   The ambush overshadowed the stabbing death earlier Wednesday of
an Arab street cleaner in Jerusalem, apparently by an Israeli
extremist. During the funeral procession for Osama Natche, a
41-year-old father of six, mourners torched an Israeli car and
stoned Israeli police who fired rubber bullets.
	   Israel and the Palestinian Authority blamed each other for the
violence, which came just 10 days before U.S. President Bill
Clinton was to arrive in Israel and the Palestinian areas to usher
in the second stage of the Wye River land-for-security agreement.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said the Palestinian Authority has incited against
Israel in the dispute over the release of Palestinian prisoners.
	   On Tuesday, the Palestinian parliament speaker, Ahmed Qureia,
said the Palestinian leadership supported protesters demanding
Israel release prisoners. He told protesters that the leadership
``is prepared once again to throw stones in order to free the
people.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Israel was to blame
for the violence, saying Netanyahu raised tensions by not releasing
prisoners and by continuing to expand Jewish settlements.
	   In the Wye agreement, Israel promised to release 750 Palestinian
prisoners by January. In a first stage last month, it freed 250
prisoners, but most were criminals, not those held for anti-Israeli
activities as the Palestinian Authority had expected.
	   Arafat raised the issue earlier this week with Clinton in
meetings with Washington. ``He (Clinton) promised us to make every
effort to solve this issue,'' said Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat upon his return from Washington.
	   About half of the 2,500 Palestinians held by Israel are members
of Arafat's Fatah faction and there has been growing anger in Fatah
ranks over the Palestinian Authority's failure to get detainees
released.
	   Most of those involved in Wednesday's attack on the soldier on
the outskirts of the West Bank town of Ramallah were Fatah
activists. Fatah may have been trying to embarrass Arafat with the
ambush in order to step up pressure on him to deal with the issue
of the prisoners.
	   The incident began when about 150 students from nearby Bir Zeit
University were bused to the center of Ramallah for a protest
organized by various political factions, including Fatah and the
Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   They staged a march seeking the release of prisoners, then
walked to a traffic circle at the outskirts of town and began
stoning Israeli cars.
	   At one point, a white car with Israeli license plates
approached. The vehicle was driven by a man wearing a skullcap, and
a soldier was in the passenger seat.
	   To shouts of ``Yahudi, Yahudi,'' Arabic for Jew, about two dozen
Palestinians began pelting the car with stones and smashing its
windows. The driver fled from the moving car after a large rock
broke the side window and just missed his head.
	   The car came to a halt when it hit a wall. Some attackers jumped
on the hood. Others, rocks in hand, reached inside the car,
striking the soldier. One Palestinian pulled the soldier out and
delivered more blows as the Israeli cowered on the pavement.
Another seized the soldier's M-16 assault rifle.
	   The soldier eventually got up and ran to safety. As he escaped,
the attackers threw more stones at him, then doused the car with
kerosene and set it on fire.
	   Israeli troops fired live ammunition and a barrage of
rubber-coated metal bullets and tear gas to disperse the
Palestinians. Eleven Palestinians were lightly injured by rubber
bullets.
	   The soldier, Assaf Miara, was hospitalized for head injuries.
From his hospital bed, Miara, his head bandaged, watched the
incident on video and quietly cursed.
	   Israel TV said Palestinian police later recovered the M-16 and
handed it over to the Israeli army. Troops sealed off Ramallah,
barring Palestinians from entering or leaving the city, TV said.

Tribesmen blow up U.S.-owned oil pipeline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMAD AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemeni tribesmen protesting the lack of
development in their region on Wednesday blew up a pipeline of a
U.S. oil company, officials and tribal sources said.
	   The American Hunt Oil Co.'s pipeline, which carries oil out of
the Safer oil field in Marib province, was blown up at dawn and
caught fire, said company officials. There were no reports of
casualties.
	   It will take two days to repair the damage, said the officials,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   It is the second attack against Hunt in two weeks by members of
Jahm tribe in Marib province, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast
of San`a.
	   Members of the tribe confirmed the latest attack and said they
want to force the government to build power plants and water
distribution system in their region.
	   Late last month, members of Jahm tribe halted the company's
drilling operations in al-Raja oil field in Marib.
	   The company officials said Wednesday the drilling operations
resumed a few days ago after authorities negotiated peace with the
tribal chiefs. No details of the settlement were available.
	   Hunt gives dlrs 200,000 annually to the government to develop
the region and tribal leaders complain that they are yet to see the
benefits of the donation.
	   The government says it builds schools and roads and other
projects according to the needs of a district.
	   A human rights groups in Marib said last week that troops sent
to the region arrested 35 Jahm tribesmen in connection with the
first pipeline blast.
	   Large parts of Yemen are lawless, inhabited by tribes who do not
hesitate to use firearms to settle scores with rivals or to express
discontent with the government.
	   Hunt Oil Company's oil field concession in Marib produces
165,000 barrels per day. The company hires 1,300 Yemeni staff in
addition to 30 foreign workers.

Bishop to be tried for speaking in favor of pre-marital sex
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: one name cq for metropolitan and archbishop.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ He claimed to have expressed what he
thinks most of his flock believes: that pre-marital sex is not bad
if it leads to a successful marriage.
	   But Metropolitan Chrisostomos of Zakinthos did add one caveat,
that people ``shouldn't change partners like they change their
shirts.''
	   On Wednesday, Greece's conservative Orthodox Church struck back.
A 12-member clerical court decided to remand the Metropolitan, or
Bishop, to trial for heresy.
	   To make matters worse for the popular Chrisostomos, whose name
means golden mouth in Greek, the court also decided to charge him
with insulting the church by having his views published in
Penthouse magazine, a medium ``unacceptable to the clerics of the
Orthodox Church.''
	   His Jan. 20 trial comes at a time when Archbishop Christodoulos,
the leader of the Orthodox Church, has been trying to attract young
people. With church attendance sliding in recent years,
Christodoulos recently told young men it was all right with him if
they wore earrings to services.
	   An announcement issued by the Holy Synod, the church's ruling
council, said Chrisostomos broke the laws of the Gospel and canonic
justice of the church by ``publicly expressing views in favor of
bodily relations as supposed prerequisites for a successful
marriage.''
	   Chrisostomos said after the decision that ``I am not a heretic''
and added he would win the trial. If he does not, Chrisostomos
could be defrocked.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin's foes in parliament today urged the
Russian leader's doctors to release a report on his health for
possible use in removing him from power.
	   Though non-binding, the move increased pressure on Yeltsin, who
remained hospitalized today with pneumonia. The president's
frequent illnesses have eroded his authority and raised concerns
about his ability to serve out his term, which ends in mid-2000,
and to lead his country out of its worst economic crisis since the
1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The Communist-initiated statement, passed by parliament's lower
house, the State Duma, by a 247-33 vote, calls on Yeltsin's doctors
to submit a report on the Russian leader's health within 10 days.
	   ``The absence of trustworthy information on the president's
health has spurred abundant rumors, allegations and even guesswork
diagnosis, such as Parkinson or Alzheimer's disease,'' the
statement said. ``That stirs the public and causes doubts about the
president's ability to exercise his duties.''
	   Alexander Kotenkov, Yeltsin's envoy to the Duma, quickly
dismissed the move, saying it has no legal meaning because Russian
law gives the lower house no power to make an inquest into the
president's health.
	   The Duma also voted to ask the Constitutional Court for an
explanation of a legal provision that permits the termination of a
president's powers due to ``lasting inability to exercise his
duties.'' The constitutional provision doesn't spell out who must
determine that, or how.
	   Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff Yuri Yarov said today the
Russian leader would remain hospitalized through the end of the
week, but may return to the Kremlin on Monday.
	   Yeltsin was handling limited paperwork and held telephone
conversations today with French President Jacques Chirac and
Russia's Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, presidential press
service said.
	   Another Yeltsin aide, Oleg Sysuyev, said Tuesday that Yeltsin,
known as a restless patient, has been urging doctors to discharge
him as soon as possible.
	   Last week, the Kremlin acknowledged for the first time that
Yeltsin suffered several heart attacks in 1996 before he underwent
bypass surgery. The Russian media have been reporting this for some
time.
	   Renat Akchurin, the surgeon who operated on Yeltsin, said the
current bout of pneumonia, the second in as many years, is
apparently due to the president's weakened immunity and his age,
not heart problems.
	   Akchurin, speaking in an interview with the weekly Argumenty i
Fakty, said he has not examined Yeltsin for eight months, but
believed that heart problems were unlikely.
	   The doctor urged Yeltsin to heed doctors' advice and warned
about possible complications.
	   ``Pneumonia sometimes brings even healthy people to a tragic
end,'' Akchurin said. ``For those with a record of heart illness,
it always has a quite serious character.''
	   Yeltsin has made only rare public appearances in recent months,
and was visiting the Kremlin only two or three days a week before
he fell ill. Primakov has taken over many day-to-day duties in
Yeltsin's absence.

to persuade Britain to release former dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, who is wanted for trial in Spain.
	   But, Jose Miguel Insulza said Chileans' polarization about the
83-year-old former dictator was undermining his diplomatic efforts.
	   ``It is very difficult to make these efforts abroad when the
messages coming from Chile are so contradictory,'' Insulza said
upon his return from Madrid and London.
	   Still, Insulza said he returned ``with a cautiously positive
view of the efforts we have made and the ones we still have to
make.''
	   Pinochet is under police custody in London awaiting a decision
by Home Secretary Jack Straw on whether he will be extradited to
Spain to face charges of genocide and torture. Straw has until Dec.
11 to make a decision.
	   The government and the right-wing insist Pinochet should be
released, saying foreign courts have no business dealing with
events in Chile. Leftists and human rights advocates support the
arrest and eventual trial in Spain of Pinochet.
	   A Chilean government report concluded that 3,197 people _
including Spaniards and other foreigners _ were killed or
disappeared during Pinochet's rule from 1973-1990. The
democratically elected president, Salvador Allende, died in a 1973
coup Pinochet helped lead.
	   Based on a Spanish warrant, Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in a
central London hospital where he had undergone back surgery.
	   Insulza says Pinochet can indeed be tried in Chile, where he
enjoys diplomatic immunity as senator for life.
	   Insulza criticized three congressmen of his own Socialist Party
who sent a letter to Straw saying Pinochet's release would ensure
his impunity.
	   ``It is very important that Chileans understand that the problem
is the lack of agreement among them,'' Insulza said.

Officials: Local election `unusually harsh' even for Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A local election campaign in St. Petersburg is
``unusually harsh'' even by Russia's standards, officials said
Wednesday _ a strong statement in a country where murder,
corruption and fraud have become widespread.
	   The election to St. Petersburg's city legislature on Sunday is
believed to have played a part in the recent slaying of a prominent
liberal lawmaker. Multiple campaign violations have also been
reported, and two of the candidates have been formally accused of
corruption.
	   The campaign is proceeding ``in unusually harsh forms, far from
the methods of normal election struggles,'' the city electoral
commission said in a statement Wednesday.
	   Election officials also appealed to voters ``not to yield to
deception and psychological pressure by some candidates (who)
violate the law, moral norms and ethics,'' said the statement
quoted by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The commission promised to investigate all reports of
violations.
	   Russia's parliament also criticized the election campaign
Wednesday, saying that ``methods of deceiving and bribing voters,
and applying psychological pressure to them are widely used,''
ITAR-Tass reported.
	   ``This election may become a model for manipulating citizens'
freedom of expression in other regions of Russia,'' said a
statement by parliament's lower house, the State Duma.
	   St. Petersburg is a particularly crime-ridden city. Several
prominent political and business leaders have been killed or
attacked in there in recent weeks.
	   Police in St. Petersburg have said the city's 1,500 polling
stations will be heavily guarded on election day.
	   Russian media and politicians have suggested that lawmaker
Galina Starovoitova was killed to prevent her faction, Northern
Capital, from making a strong showing in the election.
	   Starovoitova was gunned down by unidentified assailants in her
apartment building in St. Petersburg last week. Police have
announced no major breakthroughs in the case.
	   Starovoitova was not on the ballot but was campaigning for her
allies, who have often spoken out against corruption.

Ireland announces big tax cuts due to `Celtic tiger' economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of minister's name to McCreevy, sted
McGreevy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Enjoying the fruits of Europe's
fastest-growing economy, Ireland's finance minister announced big
tax cuts Wednesday in his 1999 budget.
	   But Charlie McCreevy warned the Dail, Ireland's key lower house
of Parliament, that ``economic booms don't last forever,'' so he
would observe a 4 percent increase in government spending in hopes
of keeping the country's ``Celtic tiger'' economy under control.
	   He cut the rate of tax Ireland charges to businesses by 4
percentage points to 28 percent, one of the lowest in Europe, in
what was McCreevy's final budget before Ireland joins 10 other
countries Jan. 1 in forming a single currency run by the Central
European Bank in Frankfurt.
	   The cuts in corporation tax are expected to cost the government
200 million pounds (dlrs 300 million) in annual revenue.
	   Ireland has set a goal of levying just 12.5 percent on all
Irish-based firms by 2003, when Dublin's International Financial
Services Center loses its status as a special zone of 10 percent
corporation tax.
	   McCreevy also removed 80,000 low-income wage-earners from the
need to pay any income tax at all at Ireland's base 26 percent
rate. And he raised the cutoff point when larger earners start
paying the higher 46 percent rate. Together the moves were expected
to reduce government revenues by 300 million pounds (dlrs 450
million) annually.
	   Despite the cuts, McCreevy forecast that the government would
collect 2.3 billion pounds (dlrs 3.4 billion) more than it intends
to spend in 1999, and that the country's domestic product would
grow by 6.7 percent, defying recessionary trends overshadowing the
world economy.
	   He projected that unemployment would fall to 6.8 percent from
the current 7.8 percent, which is already a 14-year low.
	   Ireland's economy has been booming since 1994 on a wave of U.S.
high-tech investment, European Union funding, property development
and unprecedented domestic confidence. It has grown by 35 percent
in the past four years without fueling inflation, which has
remained constant around 2 percent annually.
	   And Ireland is now defying its history of emigration, with tens
of thousands of exiles and foreigners arriving in the past two
years.
	   McCreevy didn't change the rates of tax on alcohol and motor
fuels, but added 5 pence (7.5 cents) to each pack of cigarettes.

France hopes U.N. report on Iraq will lead to global review
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France said Wednesday it hoped a report on Iraqi
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspections will lead to a review of
Baghdad's compliance with Security Council resolutions.
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler met with French
officials in Paris on Wednesday, and Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Anne Gazeau-Secret said he described Iraq's cooperation as
``satisfactory.''
	   Butler, who is en route to Moscow, must inform the Security
Council on whether Iraq has resumed full cooperation with the U.N.
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, before the council can launch a
comprehensive review.
	   The Iraqi government is hoping the review will lead to a quick
lifting of sanctions, but the United States insists there is no
link.
	   Butler's report is expected later in December.
	   Gazeau-Secret expressed the hope that Iraq will show a
``satisfactory degree of cooperation'' that would allow for a
global review.
	   Iraq curtailed inspections on Aug. 5 and halted all cooperation
with UNSCOM on Oct. 31. Under threat of U.S. and British air
strikes, Baghdad agreed to resume full cooperation with the weapons
inspectors Nov. 14.

Center-left leader Ecevit asked to form Turkey's new government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: AMs; RECASTS throughout; ADDS quotes from Islamic party
leader, Ciller party official &QL; 
 &UR; By HARMONIE TOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's president asked on Wednesday
Bulent Ecevit, a political veteran who enjoys the military's
backing, to form a government, sidestepping a pro-Islamic leader to
avoid possible confrontation with the nation's generals over
secularism.
	   Center-left Ecevit, 73, who as prime minister in 1974 ordered
the invasion of Cyprus, leads only the fourth largest party in
Parliament, the Democratic Left (DSP).
	   The job of forming a government usually goes to the leader of
the largest party in Parliament, in this case Recai Kutan of the
pro-Islamic Virtue Party. But Kutan wasn't even asked.
	   President Suleyman Demirel was apparently aiming to avoid
another crisis reminiscent of the one in 1997 when the military
pressured an Islamic-led government out of power.
	   ``The president obviously got a green light from somewhere,''
said Mehmet Golhan, a deputy from former premier Tansu Ciller's
party, in an apparent reference to the military.
	   Objected Kutan, ``Ecevit's appointment is against democratic
rules.''
	   Demirel released a statement defending the appointment of
Ecevit, calling him the most likely candidate to form a government.
	   Three parties had announced they would not share power with
Virtue, leaving Kutan with no chance of surviving a confidence vote
had he been named.
	   Ecevit has already declared himself in favor of forming a
pro-secular coalition with two center-right parties and no Virtue
ministers.
	   ``The DSP is uncompromisingly dedicated to secularism,'' Ecevit
said hours before his appointment.
	   Mesut Yilmaz' government, in which Ecevit was deputy premier,
collapsed on Nov. 25 when the prime minister lost a no-confidence
vote in Parliament. Opposition parties had accused Yilmaz of
entertaining ties with mobsters and rigging the sale of a state
bank.
	   Although Yilmaz is open to a coalition with Ecevit, some
analysts doubted that former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, the other
potential partner, would join the alliance.
	   ``She wants to be prime minister and will not support a
government that is the same as the one that just collapsed,'' said
Ismet Berkan, columnist for the daily Radikal.
	   Ecevit said he would consult with party officials Thursday
before sounding out other leaders about a possible coalition.
	   His government would be Turkey's fifth since 1995 and faces the
prospect of being dissolved after April 18 parliamentary elections.
	   Meanwhile, Ecevit would have to lead Turkey's uphill diplomatic
battle with Italy for the extradition of Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan, detained in Rome on Nov. 12.
	   The mild-mannered Ecevit is best remembered for ordering the
1974 invasion of Cyprus by Turkish troops after a short-lived coup
by supporters of union with Greece. The island has since been
divided into two bitterly hostile sectors.

Nice pulls out of deal with Roma

ongoing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ The president of Nice soccer club has
decided not to sell the second division team to Italian soccer
giant AS Roma, the French sports daily L'Equipe reported Wednesday.
	   ``The club is no longer for sale. We have already lost precious
time and do not want to waste more,'' Nice president Milan Mandaric
was quoted as saying.
	   After talks with Roma officials, Mandaric, an American
businessman, decided a sale to Roma would not be in the club's
interest.
	   Mandaric told the paper that the club has attracted a new
investor.
	   However, a statement Wednesday by AS Roma suggested the deal was
not entirely off.
	   ``AS Roma notes that its only and declared objective _ in the
ongoing negotiations _ is to cooperate (with Nice) to make the
French franchise a club of international prestige,'' the statement
said.
	   On Tuesday, Roma officials had said a takeover was imminent. The
move was intended to encourage youth development at Nice and give
second string Roma players experience in the French league.

Mexico says three European tourists did not violate law
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Mexico will not
sanction three European tourists picked up by police for allegedly
getting involved in politics in the southern state of Chiapas.
	   The National Migration Institute announced late Tuesday that
there was no evidence the two Italians and a San Marino woman had
violated a Mexican law barring foreigners from participating in
domestic politics.
	   Police had detained the three _ Jean Piero and Danielle Aronna
of Italy, and Laura Macina of the tiny republic of San Marino near
northeast Italy _ on Sunday in Yehuitz, a village near the Mayan
ruins of Palenque.
	   Local officials accused the three of participating in political
meetings with supporters of the Zapatista National Liberation Army,
the leftist rebels who took up arms in 1994 to demand greater
democracy and Indian rights.
	   The tourists said they went to Yehuitz only because a map
indicated it was known for its skilled embroiderers.
	   Jose Montero, a human rights lawyer who advised the three
tourists, said local authorities had taken a ``xenophobic''
attitude and jumped to the wrong conclusion about the purpose of
the Europeans' visit.
	   Migration officials said the three will be allowed to remain in
Mexico as tourists until January, when their tourists visas expire.
	   Mexico has bolstered enforcement of its ban on foreign political
activity this year, deporting dozens of people from Chiapas.
	   In May, it expelled 40 Italian human rights observers who
overstayed their visas after touring Chiapan villages. Eighty other
Italians who left Mexico on time were banned from returning for 10
years because they had ignored official restrictions on visiting a
pro-Zapatista village.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ NATO forces on Wednesday arrested
the most senior Bosnian Serb military figure yet to be seized for
U.N. trial on genocide and war crimes charges.
	   Gen. Radislav Krstic was arrested in a section of northern
Bosnia controlled by U.S. troops serving in NATO's Stabilization
Force, better known as SFOR. The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal has
accused him of genocide, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions
and crimes against humanity.
	   SFOR spokeswoman Maj. Sheena Thomson said Krstic was arrested
without incident at noon and would be sent to The Hague for trial
on charge stemming from the wartime massacre of Muslims.
	   Tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour of Canada was delighted
at the arrest, calling Krstic ``a very significant military
leader.'' The tribunal had indicted him in October.
	   Arbour said Krstic's secret indictment covered offenses
allegedly committed following the rebel Serb takeover of the U.N.
safe haven of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia in July 1995, where
thousands of Muslims were massacred.
	   He is indicted for genocide, complicity to commit genocide,
extermination, murder, and persecution for his alleged personal
involvement in the atrocities and his command of troops carrying
out the massacres, the tribunal announced.
	   In a statement, Arbour said the arrest was ``very significant
for the continuing work of the tribunal.''
	   ``I'm very pleased that one of ... the executors of genocide,
the destruction of the entire population of a wider region of
Bosnia made it to The Hague,'' Amor Masovic, the head of the
Bosnian Muslim commission for missing people who has dealt the most
with mass graves and Srebrenica, told The Associated Press.
	   ``I expect his arrest to unveil important facts related to the
missing of more then 8,000 people from Srebrenica,'' Masovic said.
	   In Sarajevo, the Bosnian Muslim leadership welcomed the arrest
and expressed hope that NATO would now focus on apprehending the
key architects of the war.
	   ``We welcome this arrest and particularly the fact that they
have started arresting generals,'' Mirza Hajric, the adviser to
Bosnian Muslim member of the joint presidency, Alija Izetbegovic
said Wednesday. ``We hope they will soon switch over to
commanders,'' referring to former Bosnian Serb President Radovan
Karadzic and his wartime military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic, who also
have been indicted on genocide charges for allegedly masterminding
the massacre at Srebrenica.
	   But Petar Djokic, president of the Bosnian Serb parliament, said
Krstic's arrest on a secret indictment ``brings uncertainty to
people, a feeling that every citizen of Republika Srpska can be
regarded as a potential war criminal in the eyes of the tribunal,
and that SFOR is authorized to arrest anybody, anytime, anywhere.''
	   Republika Srpska is the Serb entity within Bosnia. Serbs account
for the vast majority of suspects publicly indicted by the U.N.
court.
	   Krstic was the commander of the 5th Corps of the Bosnian Serb
Army. He is believed to be a close associate Karadzic and Mladic,
the tribunal's top two indicted suspects.
	   ``Persons indicted for war crimes who are still at large should
realize they, too, will be brought to justice,'' NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana said Wednesday after the arrest.
	   Krstic is the ninth war crimes suspect to be arrested in the
former Yugoslavia by international forces. He was named head of the
Drina Corps of the Bosnian Serb Army in 1995 after the fall of
Srebrenica.
	   The last reported sighting of Krstic was at a joint military
exercise of the Yugoslav National Army and the Bosnian Serb
military in Manjaca, near Banja Luka, in October. SFOR banned his
5th Corps from taking part in the exercise, but let him monitor it.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES union deciding to push ahead with indefinite strike &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Customs officers Wednesday decided to
ignore a court order and push ahead with an indefinite strike that
has left gas stations dry and people bundling up in unheated homes.
	   Union leaders decided after a meeting to get around a judge's
decision issued early Wednesday by changing their demands.
	   As the court found the demands for the specific strike illegal,
it has to reconvene to issue a new order ending the walkout. But
union leaders indicated they would change their demands on a daily
basis.
	   The government had appealed for a court order declaring the
strike illegal. All non-European Union shipments of fuel and other
goods have been stranded at ports and border crossings since
Monday, when the five-day strike began.
	   If the government can't convince them to stop, it may be forced
to order a civil mobilization and draft the strikers.
	   The customs workers are protesting plans to consolidate their
pension funds with other agencies.
	   The strike has severely cut the flow of gasoline and heating oil
into Greece. Many gas stations were tapped out and apartment
managers and homeowners turned off burners to try to conserve
heating fuel.
	   Temperatures dropped to about 6 degrees Celsius (43 F) in some
rural areas in northern Greece on Wednesday.
	   Civil aviation workers held work stoppages Wednesday that
resulted in flight cancellations. Railway workers also began a
three-day work stoppage.
	   The strikes are just a few of the work stoppages currently in
Greece. Bus drivers, tax officials, doctors at state-run hospitals
and teachers had walkouts planned this week. Labor groups also have
announced a 24-hour strike for Dec. 15.
	   The strikes are part of growing labor union opposition to
government fiscal reforms aimed at qualifying Greece for the
European Union's single currency club by 2001.
	   Greece is the only country of the 15-member EU that failed to
qualify for the first round of the single currency. Britain,
Denmark and Sweden opted out of joining.

Study: Women at higher risk for deadliest lung cancer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EMMA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Among smokers who get lung cancer, women are
nearly twice as likely as men to develop the most deadly form of
the disease, new research suggests.
	   Experts say the British study of 1,601 lung cancer patients
represents the first time scientists have discovered a significant
difference between the sexes in the risk of small-cell lung cancer.
Virtually always caused by smoking, it is the hardest form of lung
cancer to treat successfully.
	   The study, presented Wednesday at a conference of the British
Thoracic Society in London, showed that women under 65 were 1.7
times more vulnerable than men to small-cell lung cancer, which
spreads so rapidly that by the time it is diagnosed, it is usually
too late to operate.
	   Seven out of 10 of those women could not be helped by surgery,
and half the patients die within five months of diagnosis, said the
lead researcher, Dr. Mike Pearson, associate director of the
research unit of the Royal College of Physicians in London.
	   Men were more susceptible to non-small cell lung cancer, which
is less severe and can be operated on in half the cases, he added.
	   ``One in four women will get small cell lung cancer, whereas the
figure for men was one in six,'' Pearson said.
	   About 2 million lung cancer cases are diagnosed every year
worldwide _ 85 percent of them linked to smoking.
	   Commenting on the study, Dr. Stephen Spiro, head of thoracic
medicine University College, London Hospital, said small-cell
cancer accounts for about 20 percent of overall lung cancer cases.
But because smoking is increasing among women, the latest study
indicates the figure is now closer to about 38 percent, he said.
	   ``We are absolutely seeing the mirror in women of what happened
to men 20 years ago,'' Spiro said. ``Twenty years ago, 38 percent
of men with lung cancer had small-cell, now it's 38 percent in
women'' and 16 percent in men.
	   In 1965, 66 percent of men and 25 percent of women in Western
countries smoked. By 1988, the proportion of men smoking dropped to
30 percent but the percentage of women smokers had increased to 35
percent, he noted.
	   The differences in the types of lung cancer that men and women
get may be due to changing patterns of smoking behavior, said
Pearson, the study's lead researcher.
	   ``Many women took up the habit a decade after men who smoked
heavily during the Second World War. Women may also smoke in a
different way to men, for example taking shorter, sharper
inhalations, which could have an effect on the kind and severity of
cancer that they develop,'' Pearson added.
	   Dr. John Moore Gillon, a specialist at St. Bart's Hospital in
London and chairman of the British Lung Foundation, called the
study ``a very important piece of research.''
	   ``The overwhelming majority who develop this sort of lung cancer
will die. Young women think they're immortal, but this shows it
really does matter,'' he said.
	   Lung cancer is more common than breast cancer, particularly in
younger women, Spiro said.
	   ``The interesting thing is that a lot of these people in this
study are not old. They are in their forties and fifties,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
	   Dozens of Palestinian university students waited at a traffic
circle Wednesday, holding rocks and concrete slabs. They screened
cars. ``Wait, it's an Arab,'' one said of the driver in an
approaching car. ``A Jew,'' another said. Seconds later, a hail of
stones hit the vehicle.
	   In the ambush, a young Israeli soldier was dragged out of the
car and, as he cowered on the pavement and raised his hands
defensively, was struck repeatedly on the head with rocks.
	   Captured by cameras, the attack was shown over and over on
Israeli television, making some Israelis wonder whether the
Palestinian Authority was trying to control violence as it pledged
in the U.S.-brokered Wye River land-for-peace agreement.
	   The ambush overshadowed the stabbing death earlier Wednesday of
an Arab street cleaner in Jerusalem, apparently by an Israeli
extremist. During the funeral procession for Osama Natche, a
41-year-old father of six, mourners torched an Israeli car and
stoned Israeli police who fired rubber bullets.
	   Hours later, rioting throughout traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem continued with masked Palestinians throwing stones at
cars and blocking roads with burning tires. Jerusalem police
spokesman Shmuel Ben Ruby said five Palestinians were arrested for
throwing stones which shattered a bus window and injured the
driver.
	   Israel and the Palestinian Authority blamed each other for the
violence.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said the Palestinian Authority has incited against
Israel in the dispute over the release of Palestinian prisoners.
	   ``The bottom line is that there will be no further withdrawals
unless the Palestinian Authority lives up to all its commitments.''
	   A statement from Netanyahu's office said the Palestinians must
acknowledge that Israel did not agree to release Palestinian
prisoners who have committed acts against Israel. The statement
also said: ``Israel demands that the Palestinian Authority announce
clearly that it is abandoning its intention to unilaterally declare
a Palestinian state and announce its commitment to continuous
negotiations until a final arrangement is achieved. Israel demands
that the Palestinian Authority immediately stop violent and
inciteful acts and punish rioters,'' the statement said.

	   On Tuesday, the Palestinian parliament speaker, Ahmed Qureia,
told protesters demanding that Israel release prisoners that they
had the backing of the Palestinian leadership which ``is prepared
once again to throw stones in order to free the people.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Israel was to blame
for the violence, saying Netanyahu raised tensions by not releasing
prisoners and continuing to expand Jewish settlements.
	   In the Wye agreement, Israel promised to release 750 Palestinian
prisoners by January. In a first stage last month, it freed 250
prisoners, but most were criminals, not those held for anti-Israeli
activities as the Palestinian Authority had expected.
	   Arafat raised the issue earlier this week with Clinton in
meetings with Washington. ``He (Clinton) promised us to make every
effort to solve this issue,'' said Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat upon his return from Washington.
	   About half of the 2,500 Palestinians held by Israel are members
of Arafat's Fatah faction and there has been growing anger in Fatah
ranks over the Palestinian Authority's failure to get detainees
released.
	   Most of those involved in Wednesday's attack on the soldier on
the outskirts of the West Bank town of Ramallah where Fatah
activists. Fatah may have been trying to embarrass Arafat with the
ambush in order to step up pressure on him to deal with the issue
of the prisoners.
	   The incident began when about 150 students from nearby Bir Zeit
University were bused to the center of Ramallah for a protest
organized by various political factions, including Fatah and the
Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   They staged a march seeking the release of prisoners, then
walked to a traffic circle at the outskirts of town and began
stoning Israeli cars.
	   At one point, a white car with Israeli license plates
approached. The vehicle was driven by a man wearing a skullcap, and
a soldier was in the passenger seat.
	   To shouts of ``Yahudi, yahudi,'' Arabic for Jew, about two dozen
Palestinians began pelting the car with stones and smashing its
windows. The driver fled from the moving car after a large rock
broke the side window and just missed his head.
	   The car came to a halt when it hit a wall. Some attackers jumped
on the hood. Others, rocks in hand, reached inside the car,
striking the soldier. One Palestinian pulled the soldier out and
delivered more blows as the Israeli cowered on the pavement.
Another seized the soldier's M-16 assault rifle.
	   The soldier eventually got up and ran to safety. As he escaped,
the attackers threw more stones at him, then doused the car with
kerosene and set it on fire.
	   Israeli troops fired live ammunition and a barrage of
rubber-coated metal bullets and tear gas to disperse the
Palestinians. Eleven Palestinians were injured by rubber bullets.
	   The soldier, Assaf Miara, was hospitalized for head injuries.
From his hospital bed, Miara, his head bandaged, watched the
incident on video and quietly cursed at one time.
	   Israel TV said Palestinian police later recovered the M-16 and
handed it over to the Israeli army. Troops sealed off Ramallah,
barring Palestinians from entering or leaving the city, TV said.

Chileans praise declassification of U.S. files on Pinochet regime
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Pinochet, Britain-Pinochet, Chile-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ The government on Wednesday praised a
U.S. decision to declassify secret files on abuses which occurred
during the 1973-90 dictatorship headed by Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
	   ``I think it is great, I had been asking for that for two
years,'' Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said.''I wish they
would declassify all the documents so we could learn much more
about things that happened in Chile during those years.''
	   Insulza, who was in Madrid and London this week pressing the
case for Pinochet to be returned home, said he thought the
documents could help the cause of justice in Chile.
	   For ``those of us who think it is possible to make justice in
Chile'' he said, we ``would gain more information to back our
cases.''
	   The once-secret U.S. intelligence files, released on Tuesday,
provide evidence linking Pinochet and his military regime to
repression of dissidents, including alleged assassinations.
	   Pinochet remains under police custody in London while Home
Secretary Jack Straw decides whether to let him to return home or
permit his extradition to Spain to face charges of genocide and
torture. He has until Dec. 11 to decide.
	   U.S. government officials said Tuesday they would release more
documents from national security archives.
	   Relatives of dissidents who were killed or disappeared during
Pinochet's rule also praised the decision to release the documents.
	   ``This shows that everywhere in the world there is concern over
what happened here,'' said Doris Montoya, a member of the
relatives' group. ``And the disclosures can provide, at least in
some cases, clues on what happened to our loved ones.''
	   Meanwhile, Senate President Andres Zaldivar argued the
declassification should have come earlier.
	   ``It would probably have helped us,'' he said. ``Everything that
contributes to knowing the truth is very positive.''

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ NATO forces on Wednesday arrested
the most senior Bosnian Serb military figure yet to be seized for
U.N. trial on genocide and war crimes charges.
	   Gen. Radislav Krstic was arrested in a section of northern
Bosnia controlled by U.S. troops serving in NATO's Stabilization
Force, better known as SFOR. The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal has
charged him in the 1995 massacre of Muslim civilians fleeing
Srebrenica.
	   Krstic was ``a very significant military leader,'' said Louise
Arbour, chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal.
Arbour said she was delighted at the arrest of Krstic, who was
indicted in October on charges of genocide, grave breaches of the
Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity.
	   SFOR spokeswoman Maj. Sheena Thomson said Krstic was arrested
without incident and would be sent to The Hague tribunal for trial
on charges stemming from the wartime massacre of thousands of
Muslims who fled the U.N. safe haven of Srebrenica after it was
taken over by Serb rebels.
	   He was indicted for genocide, complicity to commit genocide,
extermination, murder, and persecution for his alleged personal
involvement in the atrocities and his command of troops carrying
out the massacres, the tribunal announced.
	   In a statement, Arbour, of Canada, said the arrest was ``very
significant for the continuing work of the tribunal.''
	   Amor Masovic, the head of a Bosnian Muslim commission unearthing
mass graves containing victims of the 3 1/2-year war, said he
expected the case to yield important facts related 8,000 people
still missing from Srebrenica.
	   ``I'm very pleased that one of ... the executors of genocide,
the destruction of the entire population of a wider region of
Bosnia made it to The Hague,'' he said.
	   In Sarajevo, the Bosnian Muslim leadership welcomed the arrest
and expressed hope that NATO would now focus on apprehending the
key architects of the war.
	   ``We welcome this arrest and particularly the fact that they
have started arresting generals,'' Mirza Hajric, the adviser to
Bosnian Muslim member of the joint presidency, Alija Izetbegovic
said Wednesday.
	   ``We hope they will soon switch over to commanders,'' referring
to former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic and his wartime
military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic, who also have been indicted on
genocide charges for allegedly masterminding the massacre at
Srebrenica.

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON _ Several months ago, Curtis Johnson was sitting at his
desk in Baku, Azerbaijan, when an e-mail message flashed across his
computer.
	   The sender, a woman from Seattle, was unknown to him, but her
query immediately caught his attention. Three years earlier, the
woman had hosted a young blind girl from Baku while she had
attended an international conference for the disabled. During the
three-week visit, the two had become very close, but when the girl
returned to Baku, they were unable to stay in touch.
	   ``The mail service in Baku is terrible,'' explained Johnson.
	   The Seattle woman had come across a Web site set up by Johnson,
a University of Houston professor in the college of technology.
Since January, he has been on sabbatical in Baku, helping set up an
Internet Access and Training Program (IATP) funded by the United
States Information Agency (USIA).
	   ``She sent me her friend's name and phone number and asked if I
could try to locate the girl and make a connection, which I was
happy to do. I thought it was really sweet that she wanted to reach
out and make contact,'' Johnson said. ``We called and talked to her
father, who was overjoyed when he heard what we were calling
about.''
	   The young Azerbaijani woman, now 18, dictated a letter to her
friend in Russian, which Johnson's staffers translated into
English. They e-mailed it, along with a picture, to the Seattle
woman, who immediately responded with a letter and a photo of her
family. And so the connection was made, and the dialogue between
the two friends continues. The next step, Johnson said, is for the
young woman to bring in a friend who will take the computer
training he has set up and help her with the contact.
	   Baku is a city of a million-plus by the Caspian Sea. But it's
typical of a land and people who have been cut off by geography and
politics from the kind of global communication and access that many
Americans now take for granted.
	   Thanks to Johnson and others like him, that is slowly beginning
to change.
	   ``The idea is that the Internet is a way to open up the world to
these people,'' he said. ``And I feel like I'm doing just that.
It's both thrilling and a challenge.''
	   Johnson's adventures in Azerbaijan (formerly part of the Soviet
Union) began when his wife was asked by Exxon to work on a joint
project with other oil companies to get oil from the Caspian Sea.
Johnson, 58, spent the summer of 1997 in Baku with his wife, Helene
Blake, and helped Exxon with a plan to recruit Azerbaijanis for the
company.
	   Though he enjoyed his time there, Johnson had to get back to his
teaching job at UH. But that fall he got a call from USIA, asking
if he would lead a project that would provide Internet access and
e-mail to the people of Azerbaijan, one of several projects the
agency was trying to set up in some of the newly independent
states.
	   ``The original idea was to provide access to anyone who had come
to the United States to study and got familiar with computers,'' he
said. ``Then they decided it should be available to everyone,
especially teachers, journalists and intellectuals. There is
computer access, but it is limited and terribly expensive. A basic
connection to the Internet is $20 a month, which gives you four
hours of access; anything over that is $6 an hour, and that can add
up really fast. A good salary is $35 per month, so it's difficult.
Many of them learn about computers in school but never actually get
to use one.''
	   The project officially started in January 1998. With a budget of
$125,000, Johnson began setting up a training site, hired staff,
bought computers and renovated facilities to bring them up to
Western standards.
	   By April, the IATP-Azerbaijan Computer Center was up and running
_ located in a three-room office on the second floor of a hilltop
building overlooking Baku _ complete with 10 training computers.
Though Johnson had originally thought the center would have to
advertise, finding students has not been a problem. In fact, the
training classes have become tremendously popular, he said.
	   Though the basic mission was to provide affordable and easy
Internet and e-mail access, Johnson realized the access would be
worthless without computer skills. So, the first course ``clients''
take if they are computer illiterate is a basic eight-hour training
session, spread out over two weeks.
	   ``It's broken into four two-hour sessions, and that seems to be
enough,'' Johnson said. ``Our system is in Russian and English, and
we show them the basic window operations, word processing, how to
use the paint program, that kind of thing. We take them to the
point where they can turn the computer on, follow instructions and
become users.''
	   Then they are encouraged to take another six hours of training
on use of the Internet and e-mail. To date, 2,000 people have gone
through the free training. Seven hundred have signed up as clients,
another free service, that gives them a computer password, e-mail
access, an account and one hour a day of use. The center is open
more than 60 hours a week.
	   Teaching people who have never used a computer was a first for
Johnson and has provided some amusing moments. He designed a
program for beginners and remembers trying to explain to an English
teacher how to use a ``mouse.''
	   ``I heard her say: `I can't get it to work for me!' '' So I
turned around, and she was moving the mouse up and down in the air.
I had forgotten to tell her she had to move it around on the pad,''
he laughed. ``We have followed the growth of computers here, but
they are making a huge leap from typewriters and even long-hand to
advanced computers. Now we have professors and scholars researching
on the Internet and sending their work to colleagues around the
world. It's great to see it happen.''
	   Among them, said Johnson, was a professor of journalism at Baku
State University who at 55 was convinced he was too old to learn
computer skills. Now, Johnson said, he is at the center every day,
surfing the Web and sending e-mails _ a true computer nerd.
Recently one of the office cleaning ladies completed the training,
though so far she has not signed up as a client.
	   Johnson and his wife were in Houston recently for a brief visit
before they returned to Baku. Johnson will continue his work at the
center on a Fulbright Fellowship, which will keep him there through
at least May 1999. After that, he will return to UH. The next step,
he said, is to take the computer training to more remote sites,
like a library or a private university. Eventually, the goal is to
make the center self-sufficient, charging a very nominal fee for
computer use.
	   He would also like to help arrange a less expensive way for
people in Azerbaijan to get computer access. At the moment, he
explains, a high-speed connection for schools or companies costs
$5,500 a month and is basically used only by foreign companies. He
hopes to establish a free-net service, a low-cost access used by
nonprofits and colleges at a cost of about $1,000 a month, which
would make access less expensive and more possible for colleges and
scholars.
	   Johnson has found the people in Azerbaijan, who are 98 percent
Moslem and in some cases trilingual (speaking English, Russian and
Azeri), to be helpful, friendly and curious about the world,
especially the United States.
	   ``At first they couldn't believe we were providing the whole
service for free,'' Johnson said. ``As often as we can, we remind
them it is free and paid by the U.S. government. I can tell you,
we're making a lot of friends.''

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Customs officers Wednesday decided to
ignore a court order and push ahead with an indefinite strike that
has left gas stations dry and people bundling up in unheated homes.
	   Union leaders decided after a meeting to get around a judge's
decision issued early Wednesday by changing their demands.
	   As the court found the demands for the specific strike illegal,
it has to reconvene to issue a new order ending the walkout. But
union leaders indicated they would change their demands on a daily
basis.
	   The government had appealed for a court order declaring the
strike illegal. All non-European Union shipments of fuel and other
goods have been stranded at ports and border crossings since
Monday, when the five-day strike began.
	   If the government can't convince them to stop, it may be forced
to order a civil mobilization and draft the strikers.
	   ``Everyone has to assume their responsibilities, if they don't
then the government will take those steps necessary for the public
good,'' said Labor Minister Miltiades Papaioannou.

RAMALLAH: the agreement.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Dozens of Palestinian university students waited at a traffic
circle Wednesday, holding rocks and concrete slabs. They screened
cars. ``Wait, it's an Arab,'' one said of the driver in an
approaching car. ``A Jew,'' another said. Seconds later, a hail of
stones hit the vehicle.
	   In the ambush, a young Israeli soldier was dragged out of the
car and struck repeatedly on the head with rocks as he cowered on
the pavement, his hands raised in defense.
	   Captured by cameras, the attack was shown over and over on
Israeli television, making some Israelis wonder whether the
Palestinian Authority was trying to control violence as it had
pledged to do in the U.S.-brokered Wye River land-for-peace
agreement.
	   The ambush overshadowed the stabbing death earlier Wednesday of
an Arab street cleaner in Jerusalem, apparently by an Israeli
extremist. During the funeral procession for Osama Natche, a
41-year-old father of six, mourners torched an Israeli car and
stoned Israeli police who fired rubber bullets.
	   Hours later, rioting throughout traditionally Arab parts of
Jerusalem continued, with masked Palestinians throwing stones at
cars and blocking roads with burning tires. Jerusalem police
spokesman Shmuel Ben Ruby said five Palestinians were arrested for
throwing stones that shattered a bus window and injured the driver.
	   Israel and the Palestinian Authority blamed each other for the
violence.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said the Palestinian Authority has incited against
Israel in the dispute over the release of Palestinian prisoners.
	   ``The bottom line is that there will be no further withdrawals
unless the Palestinian Authority lives up to all its commitments,''
he said.
	   A statement from Netanyahu's office said the Palestinians must
acknowledge that Israel did not agree to release Palestinian
prisoners who have committed acts against Israel. The statement
also said: ``Israel demands that the Palestinian Authority announce
clearly that it is abandoning its intention to unilaterally declare
a Palestinian state and announce its commitment to continuous
negotiations until a final arrangement is achieved. Israel demands
that the Palestinian Authority immediately stop violent and
inciteful acts and punish rioters.''

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ The Israeli government Wednesday
announced it was suspending further troop withdrawals until the
Palestinians comply with a list of demands including a promise to
publicly abandon plans to declare a state in May.
	   The government said its decision was prompted in part by an
attack on an Israeli soldier and civilian by an angry Palestinian
mob in the city of Ramallah in the West Bank earlier Wednesday.
	   The decision came only 10 days before U.S. President Bill
Clinton was to arrive in the region to usher in stage two of the
Wye River land-for-security agreement he had held negotiate in
October.
	   The Israeli announcement raised questions about whether the
Clinton trip could take place while Israel was holding-up the
agreement.
	   Dozens of Palestinian university students waited at a traffic
circle Wednesday, holding rocks and concrete slabs. They screened
cars. ``Wait, it's an Arab,'' one said of the driver in an
approaching car. ``A Jew,'' another said. Seconds later, a hail of
stones hit the vehicle.
	   In the ambush, a young Israeli soldier was dragged out of the
car and, as he cowered on the pavement and raised his hands
defensively, was struck repeatedly on the head with rocks.
	   Captured by cameras, the attack was shown over and over on
Israeli television, making some Israelis wonder whether the
Palestinian Authority was trying to control violence as it pledged
in the U.S.-brokered Wye River land-for-peace agreement.
	   The ambush overshadowed the stabbing death earlier Wednesday of
an Arab street cleaner in Jerusalem, apparently by an Israeli
extremist. During the funeral procession for Osama Natche, a
41-year-old father of six, mourners torched an Israeli car and
stoned Israeli police who fired rubber bullets.
	   Hours later, rioting throughout traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem continued with masked Palestinians throwing stones at
cars and blocking roads with burning tires. Jerusalem police
spokesman Shmuel Ben Ruby said five Palestinians were arrested for
throwing stones which shattered a bus window and injured the
driver.
	   Israel and the Palestinian Authority blamed each other for the
violence.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said the Palestinian Authority has incited against
Israel in the dispute over the release of Palestinian prisoners.
	   ``The bottom line is that there will be no further withdrawals
unless the Palestinian Authority lives up to all its commitments.''
	   A statement from Netanyahu's office said the Palestinians must
acknowledge that Israel did not agree to release Palestinian
prisoners who have committed acts against Israel. The statement
also said: ``Israel demands that the Palestinian Authority announce
clearly that it is abandoning its intention to unilaterally declare
a Palestinian state and announce its commitment to continuous
negotiations until a final arrangement is achieved. Israel demands
that the Palestinian Authority immediately stop violent and
inciteful acts and punish rioters,'' the statement said.
	   On Tuesday, the Palestinian parliament speaker, Ahmed Qureia,
told protesters demanding that Israel release prisoners that they
had the backing of the Palestinian leadership which ``is prepared
once again to throw stones in order to free the people.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Israel was to blame
for the violence, saying Netanyahu raised tensions by not releasing
prisoners and continuing to expand Jewish settlements.
	   In the Wye agreement, Israel promised to release 750 Palestinian
prisoners by January. In a first stage last month, it freed 250
prisoners, but most were criminals, not those held for anti-Israeli
activities as the Palestinian Authority had expected.
	   Arafat raised the issue earlier this week with Clinton in
meetings with Washington. ``He (Clinton) promised us to make every
effort to solve this issue,'' said Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat upon his return from Washington.
	   About half of the 2,500 Palestinians held by Israel are members
of Arafat's Fatah faction and there has been growing anger in Fatah
ranks over the Palestinian Authority's failure to get detainees
released.
	   Most of those involved in Wednesday's attack on the soldier on
the outskirts of the West Bank town of Ramallah where Fatah
activists. Fatah may have been trying to embarrass Arafat with the
ambush in order to step up pressure on him to deal with the issue
of the prisoners.
	   The incident began when about 150 students from nearby Bir Zeit
University were bused to the center of Ramallah for a protest
organized by various political factions, including Fatah and the
Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   They staged a march seeking the release of prisoners, then
walked to a traffic circle at the outskirts of town and began
stoning Israeli cars.
	   At one point, a white car with Israeli license plates
approached. The vehicle was driven by a man wearing a skullcap, and
a soldier was in the passenger seat.
	   To shouts of ``Yahudi, yahudi,'' Arabic for Jew, about two dozen
Palestinians began pelting the car with stones and smashing its
windows. The driver fled from the moving car after a large rock
broke the side window and just missed his head.
	   The car came to a halt when it hit a wall. Some attackers jumped
on the hood. Others, rocks in hand, reached inside the car,
striking the soldier. One Palestinian pulled the soldier out and
delivered more blows as the Israeli cowered on the pavement.
Another seized the soldier's M-16 assault rifle.
	   The soldier eventually got up and ran to safety. As he escaped,
the attackers threw more stones at him, then doused the car with
kerosene and set it on fire.
	   Israeli troops fired live ammunition and a barrage of
rubber-coated metal bullets and tear gas to disperse the
Palestinians. Eleven Palestinians were injured by rubber bullets.
	   The soldier, Assaf Miara, was hospitalized for head injuries.
From his hospital bed, Miara, his head bandaged, watched the
incident on video and quietly cursed at one time.
	   Palestinian police later recovered the M-16 and handed it over
to the Israeli army, the army spokesman's office said. Troops
sealed off the intersection where the incident occured, barring
Palestinians from entering or exiting Ramallah from the
Israeli-controlled side.

With storm coming, organizers shuffle schedule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN, California (AP) _ The schedule for the women's
Alpine World Cup ski races at this resort was altered Wednesday as
officials faced the prospect of trying to beat a storm forecast for
Friday afternoon.
	   The super-giant slalom, which had been scheduled for Thursday,
was pushed back to Friday, with the slalom being moved up a day to
Thursday.
	   The race jury decided on the change because it was considered
likely weather would deteriorate Friday afternoon and jeopardize
the second run of the slalom. The one-run super-G would stand a
better chance of completion before snow and wind strike.
	   Bad weather is nothing new for this World Cup stop. In the
spring of 1997, slalom and super-G races were held on the same day
due to weather delays. And later that year, the super-G was set
back two days and started lower on the mountain when crews were
unable to remove drifts that accumulated after a 1-meter (3-foot)
overnight snowfall.

Blair offers two-stage end to hereditary members in House of Lords
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with dismissal of Tory leader in Lords &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair has offered to phase out
hereditary members of the House of Lords in two stages, but the
leader of the opposition rejected the compromise Wednesday.
	   Conservative Party leader William Hague later dismissed his
party leader in the House of Lords, Lord Cranborne, who reportedly
had accepted the government's offer.
	   The offer _ not previously disclosed by the government _
apparently was intended to avoid a prolonged and bitter fight
between the House of Commons and the House of Lords, which has
limited power to revise and delay legislation.
	   Blair's Labor Party manifesto for the 1997 election included a
pledge to abolish hereditary members.
	   Hague said in the House of Commons that he could not support
``major constitutional change that is based on no comprehensive
plan or principle.'' He complained that the government has not
spelled out how members of the House of Lords would be chosen.
	   Blair, however, said Cranborne had agreed to his offer to keep a
hundred hereditary peers in the chamber as an intermediate step.
There are now 759 hereditary nobles who are entitled to vote in the
House of Lords.
	   He has promised to appoint a commission to decide how members
will be chosen.
	   ``While we believe that your agreement to retain hereditary
peers after stage one is a huge climbdown on the part of the
government, let me make it clear that we believe it is wrong to
embark on fundamental change to the Parliament of this country
without any idea of where it is leading to,'' Hague said during
prime minister's questions in the House of Commons.
	   Blair replied that it was ``common sense ...to get this thing
done with as little fuss and as easily as possible, which we can
now do.''

Arab group asks for U.N. investigation of U.S. bombing in Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The 22 Arab states at the United Nations
have again asked the Security Council to approve a U.N.
investigation of the U.S. attack on a factory in Sudan, according
to a document released Wednesday.
	   The United States destroyed the Khartoum factory in August after
bombings at two U.S. embassies in Africa, saying the plant made
chemical arms and had links to Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden.
Sudan insisted the plant made only pharmaceuticals.
	   The Arab Group sent a revised draft resolution to the president
of the Security Council requesting Secretary-General Kofi Annan
dispatch a mission ``to verify all facts concerning the Al-Shifa
factory, including its production and ownership.''
	   The resolution asks Annan to submit a report on the mission's
findings within one month of the resolution's adoption.
	   Sudan requested a U.N. investigation immediately after the
attack and demanded compensation from the United States for the
cost of the plant, which it said was used to produce more than 50
percent of the country's medicines.
	   The Arab Group also asked for an investigation, but the council
shelved both requests.
	   The United States says a U.N. investigation is unnecessary
because U.S. intelligence showed that the plant produced chemical
weapons. U.S. officials have cited a soil sample taken from the
grounds of the complex that they say contained Empta, a precursor
chemical for the deadly nerve agent VX.
	   The United States considers Sudan a sponsor of terrorism and has
imposed trade and other economic sanctions.
	   The United States has accused bin Laden of being the architect
of the Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya, which
killed 224 people, including a dozen Americans.
	   On Aug. 20, the United States bombed the Khartoum factory and a
site in Afghanistan that Washington said was a terrorist camp
funded by bin Laden.

Jospin insults woman lawmaker, bringing her to tears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, issuing a sharp
insult, on Wednesday brought to tears an opposition lawmaker who
has led the battle against a government bill to give legal status
to unmarried couples.
	   Addressing the National Assembly, the Socialist Jospin, without
naming deputy Christine Boutin, asked how the conservative
opposition could ``entrust its vision of this problem of society to
a deputy who is marginal on the issues and excessive with her
words.''
	   Reproachful ``boos'' rose from the banks of lawmakers.
	   Boutin, wiping tears from an anguished-looking face, rose from
her seat and walked toward the podium but was stopped from
approaching the prime minister.
	   ``Mr. Jospin has shown us how he treats women,'' Boutin said.
``He has called me excessive and marginal. Me, I tell Mr. Jospin,
the French will be the judge.''
	   She then called for a demonstration against the bill, the Civil
Solidarity Pact, on Jan. 31 in Paris.
	   Boutin has fought hard to block the highly contested bill,
claiming it would undermine family values.
	   Legislators reopened debate on the bill, known as PACS, on
Tuesday, voting just one amendment in 10 hours of debate. Hundreds
of amendments have been attached to the bill, making its second
tour through the lower house. It was declared ``inadmissible'' in
an initial debate in October.
	   The right equates the bill with gay marriage and fears it will
lead to adoptions by homosexual couples.
	   The bill was revised and reintroduced for debate. But the right
is using delaying tactics to keep it from a vote.
	   The revised bill would allow two unrelated people to conclude a
union that would, among other things, allow them to file joint tax
returns, gain inheritance benefits, and take part in the other's
social security coverage.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After six weeks cooped up in a dark, arctic cabin,
a three-member documentary film crew returned to civilization
Wednesday little the worse for wear but happy for a change of
scenery.
	   ``I'm happy that we're not buried in that hut under the snow,''
Japanese producer Tatsuhiko Kabayashi told reporters after he and
his international crew arrived at a Moscow airport.
	   The three had gone to Wrangel Island, off Russia's far northeast
coast, to film polar bears in September and had intended to leave
Oct. 15. But early, severe winter weather stranded them until their
helicopter rescue Tuesday.
	   At that point, they were down to their last five days' food
rations, temperatures were down to minus 22 and the long arctic
night was beginning to take its toll.
	   ``It was practically complete darkness and snowstorms, and we
had nothing to do but stay in our hut,'' Kabayashi said. ``So we
sat in the darkness, because we had to save fuel. ... We were
sitting there listening to the sound of the snowstorms outside. It
drove me to despair.''
	   The other members of the crew were considerably more upbeat
about the experience, which was cushioned by a generator, satellite
telephone and e-mail. Still, they acknowledged that it got a bit
boring.
	   ``For my part, the experience has been one involving a lot of
patience and a lot of waiting, but not one of great hardship,''
said cameraman Rory McGuinness of New Zealand. ``If not for the
fact that we were stuck, I think it would have been a very positive
experience.''
	   A Russian crew member, naturalist Nikita Ovsyanikov, stressed
that the group was never in any danger. Had their food run out, he
said, villagers 80 miles away would have undertaken an arduous
journey by snow tractor to rescue them.
	   That became moot on Tuesday, when the weather finally cleared
enough for an emergency helicopter to get to the crew's hut, on
Wrangel's Cape Blossom.
	   McGuinness acknowledged that the stranded trio got on each
other's nerves. He described their hut as the size of a
``smallish'' Moscow apartment, which is about as small as human
habitat gets.
	   ``There were conflicts over things like who was going to do the
dishes tonight. ... I think that, given that we were three men
stuck in a hut for six weeks, we did OK,'' he said.
	   Kobayashi, who works for Japan's NHK television, was bothered by
complications from eye surgery that had taken place before the
trip. He showed no ill effects at the airport news conference
Wednesday.
	   He said the crew's work earlier in the fall had gone well. Among
the scenes they captured was a polar bear giving birth and later
romping with her offspring.
	   McGuinness said some of the best scenes came after they got
stuck. But it was a mixed blessing: He ran out of film in
mid-November. After that, he said, ``I was left to simply enjoy the
experience. That was great.''
	   McGuinness bristled a bit at suggestions that the crew had shown
irresponsibility by not getting out sooner or that they had planned
their trip poorly.
	   ``The fact that we stayed there six weeks longer than we planned
was an indication of fairly good contingency planning in the food
department,'' he said.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ The Israeli government said Wednesday
that it was suspending troop withdrawals until the Palestinians
comply with a list of demands that includes a promise to publicly
abandon plans to unilaterally declare statehood in May.
	   The government said it was prompted in part by an attack on an
Israeli soldier and civilian by a Palestinian mob in the city of
Ramallah in the West Bank on Wednesday.
	   The ambush overshadowed the stabbing death earlier Wednesday of
an Arab street cleaner in Jerusalem, apparently by an Israeli
extremist. During the funeral procession for Osama Natche, a
41-year-old father of six, mourners torched an Israeli car and
stoned Israeli police who fired rubber bullets.
	   Hours later, rioting throughout traditionally Arab areas of
Jerusalem continued, with masked Palestinians throwing stones at
cars and blocking roads with burning tires. Jerusalem police
spokesman Shmuel Ben Ruby said five Palestinians were arrested for
throwing stones that shattered a bus window and injured the driver.
	   Israel and the Palestinian Authority blamed each other for the
violence.
	   The suspension came 10 days before U.S. President Bill Clinton
was to arrive in the region to usher in Stage Two of the Wye River
land-for-security agreement he helped negotiate in October.
	   The Israeli announcement raised questions about whether the
Clinton trip could take place while Israel was holding up the
agreement.
	   The ambush of two motorists in Ramallah, captured by cameras,
was shown over and over on Israeli television, leading some
Israelis to wonder whether the Palestinian Authority was trying to
control violence, as it pledged to do in the U.S.-brokered Wye
River land-for-peace agreement.
	   In the attack, dozens of Palestinian university students waited
at a traffic circle, holding rocks and concrete slabs. They
screened cars. ``Wait, it's an Arab,'' one said of the driver in an
approaching car. ``A Jew,'' another said. Seconds later, a hail of
stones hit the vehicle.
	   A young Israeli soldier was dragged from the car and struck
repeatedly in the head with rocks as he held his hands up to defend
himself.
	   The political response was swift.
	   ``The bottom line is that there will be no further withdrawals
unless the Palestinian Authority lives up to all its commitments,''
said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan.
	   ``Israel demands that the Palestinian Authority announce clearly
that it is abandoning its intention to unilaterally declare a
Palestinian state and announce its commitment to continuous
negotiations until a final arrangement is achieved. Israel demands
that the Palestinian Authority immediately stop violent and
inciteful acts and punish rioters,'' a statement from Netanyahu's
office said.
	   Further, the Palestinians must acknowledge that Israel did not
agree to release Palestinian prisoners who have committed acts
against Israel, the statement said.
	   In the Wye agreement, Israel promised to release 750 Palestinian
prisoners by January. In a first stage last month, it freed 250
prisoners, but most were criminals, not those held for anti-Israeli
activities as the Palestinian Authority had expected.
	   The Palestinian parliament speaker, Ahmed Qureia, told
protesters demanding that Israel release prisoners on Tuesday that
they had the backing of the Palestinian leadership, which ``is
prepared once again to throw stones in order to free the people.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Israel was to blame
for Wednesday's violence, saying Netanyahu raised tensions by not
releasing prisoners and continuing to expand Jewish settlements.
	   About half of the 2,500 Palestinians held by Israel are members
of Arafat's Fatah faction and there has been growing anger in Fatah
ranks over the Palestinian Authority's failure to get detainees
released.
	   Most of those involved in Wednesday's attack on the soldier were
Fatah activists. Fatah may have been trying to embarrass Arafat
with the ambush in order to step up pressure on him to deal with
the prisoners issue.
	   The incident began when about 150 students from nearby Bir Zeit
University were bused to the center of Ramallah for a protest
organized by various political factions, including Fatah and the
Islamic militant group Hamas.
	   They staged a march seeking the release of prisoners, then
walked to a traffic circle at the outskirts of town and began
stoning Israeli cars.
	   A white car with Israeli license plates approached. The vehicle
was driven by a man wearing a skullcap, and a soldier was in the
passenger seat.
	   To shouts of ``Yahudi, yahudi,'' Arabic for Jew, about two dozen
Palestinians began pelting the car with stones and smashing its
windows. The driver fled after a large rock broke the side window
and just missed his head.
	   The car hit a wall and came to a halt. Some attackers jumped on
the hood. Others, rocks in hand, reached inside the car, striking
the soldier. One Palestinian pulled the soldier out and delivered
more blows as the Israeli cowered on the pavement. Another seized
the soldier's M-16 assault rifle.
	   The soldier finally got up and ran to safety. As he escaped, the
attackers threw more stones at him, then doused the car with
kerosene and set it on fire.
	   Israeli troops fired live ammunition and a barrage of
rubber-coated metal bullets and tear gas to disperse the
Palestinians. Eleven Palestinians were wounded by rubber bullets.
	   The soldier, Assaf Miara, was hospitalized for head injuries.
From his hospital bed, Miara, his head bandaged, watched the
incident on video and cursed quietly.
	   Palestinian police later recovered the M-16 and handed it over
to the Israeli army, the army spokesman's office said. Troops
sealed off the intersection where the incident occurred, barring
Palestinians from entering or exiting Ramallah from the
Israeli-controlled side.

Bad weather may stop shuttle launch

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Lousy weather forecast on both sides
of the Atlantic threatened to delay the liftoff Thursday of NASA's
first space station construction flight.
	   Clouds and rain were expected to move ashore. That could force
NASA to scrub space shuttle Endeavour's predawn launch with the
first American-built piece of the international space station.
	   What's more, cloudy skies and fog were forecast for the
emergency landing sites in Spain and Morocco. NASA will not launch
unless at least one of those sites is usable.
	   ``Basically, whether we get off the ground with respect to
weather is going to be a crap shoot,'' shuttle weatherman Ed
Priselac said Wednesday.
	   The flight is already a year late because of a cash crunch in
Russia, one of NASA's chief partners on the space station project.
	   Despite the dismal forecast, dignitaries from around the world
gathered to see Endeavour and its crew of six off. Most were
representatives of the 16 countries participating in the space
station effort. The guest list included Secretary of State Madeline
Albright.
	   The mission promises to be one of the most difficult in space
shuttle history. And the entire space station project promises to
be the most difficult undertaking since the Apollo moon landings
nearly 30 years ago.
	   ``We're not just testing just hardware as part of this
program,'' said Mikhail Sinelschikov, a Russian space official.
``We're testing our relationship very much and our mutual trust and
our confidence in each other.''
	   Two weeks ago, the Russians put the first piece of the space
station into orbit.
	   During Endeavour's 12-day flight, the astronauts will use the
shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian piece and attach it to the
American component. Then, two astronauts will perform three
spacewalks to hook up all the electrical connections and cables
between the two cylinders.
	   The U.S. piece, named Unity, is a connecting passageway. It is
essentially an aluminum can with big holes where other chambers
eventually will attach. It contains six miles of wiring and more
than 50,000 mechanical pieces.
	   The Russian component, named Zarya, which means sunrise,
contains the power and propulsion systems that will keep the
station aloft until the Russians can launch a permanent control
module.
	   In all, more than 100 components weighing 1 million pounds are
to be launched over the next five years, requiring 45 U.S. and
Russian flights.
	   ``It's going to start out kind of small, but it's going to grow
to the size of a football field,'' said Endeavour's commander,
Robert Cabana.
	   Unity should have been put in orbit last December. But station
assembly was put on hold because of Russia's economic crisis, which
prevented the country's space agency from completing the permanent
control module. NASA has since bailed out the Russian Space Agency.

Russia receives praise, but no money, from IMF chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo MOSB104 &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ IMF chief Michel Camdessus praised Russia for the
``pragmatic'' way it was dealing with its economic meltdown, but
made no promises Wednesday to release the frozen loans that Moscow
badly wants.
	   Still, after weeks of International Monetary Fund criticism of
the Russian government's plans, Camdessus' cautiously positive
evaluation was a good sign for Moscow.
	   Camdessus said a fund team would return to Russia next month for
further negotiations on the loan.
	   ``We are hoping 1999 will be excellent for cooperation between
Russia and the IMF,'' Camdessus told reporters.
	   Russia owes billions of dollars to workers, retirees and foreign
creditors and wants the IMF to provide new installments on a $22.6
billion bailout package, which also includes loans from the World
Bank and the Japanese government.
	   The lenders have released only $5 billion, putting the rest on
hold after the latest economic crisis hit in August, when Russia
devalued the ruble and defaulted on domestic debt. The IMF has been
demanding a realistic recovery plan from the Russian government and
has so far been unimpressed with Moscow's efforts.
	   During a second day of talks Wednesday with Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Camdessus praised Moscow's ``pragmatic''
course and its commitment to a budget that does not overstretch the
government's abilities.
	   Primakov ``wants a budget which tells the truth, is sincere and
doesn't promise what it can't fulfill,'' Camdessus said. ``I was
impressed by this insistence on sincerity.''
	   The statement came in sharp contrast to the conclusion of an IMF
team last week, which said the government's revenue forecast for
next year was overly optimistic.
	   But Camdessus refused to elaborate or say indicate whether he
had reviewed the 1999 budget draft in detail.
	   The Russians were even more enthusiastic.
	   ``It was important for us that the fund chief come to Moscow and
analyze and assess the situation,'' Primakov told reporters.
	   ``Don't measure the significance of Camdessus' visit by how much
money he brought. He has come with an attache case containing
documents, not cash. You shouldn't think that the question of
giving money to Russia will be solved now,'' Primakov said.
	   Primakov's government has moved cautiously in tackling Russia's
worst economic crisis since the Soviet collapse, refraining from
any radical measures and hoping that the IMF and other lenders will
offer help.
	   The last IMF mission also disapproved of the government's plans
to lower taxes, offer subsidies to ailing industries and increase
state regulation of the economy.
	   Camdessus' evaluation appeared more favorable. He said Russia
must make choices about what taxes it wants to reduce, and that the
Communist-dominated parliament must give the tax service ``the
means to do its job properly.''
	   Primakov also said Camdessus agreed that some state intervention
in the economy may be positive, provided it doesn't prevent the
development of a free market.

Turkmenistan bans most currency trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Turkmenistan has sharply tightened limits on
residents' access to foreign currency in an effort to protect its
dwindling hard currency reserves, a news report said Wednesday.
	   The only people allowed to exchange the Turkmen manat for
foreign currency are: those who need medical treatment outside the
impoverished central Asian nation, and then only with a certificate
from the Health Ministry; students going to school abroad; and
government employees traveling to other countries.
	   Companies operating in Turkmenistan can exchange money only to
buy medicines or raw materials or to repay government loans,
according to a Central Bank statement quoted by the Interfax news
agency.
	   Foreigners in the former Soviet republic can only buy foreign
currency they previously sold to the Central Bank.
	   The bank's hard currency reserve department said the move was
indefinite and was an effort to save the bank's hard currency
reserves, which have been depleted because of a plunge in natural
gas exports and the bank's intervention to keep the manat stable.
	   Turkmenistan's natural gas reserves are among the world's
largest, but revenues from gas exports have been constrained by
non-payment for deliveries by neighboring countries and the lack of
pipelines to access other markets.
	   Turkmenistan has also suffered some fallout from the economic
crisis in Russia.
	   The country inherited a highly specialized economy from the
Soviet period, and has failed to diversify since the 1991 Soviet
collapse or introduce any serious economic reforms.
	   It has also built up a huge foreign debt _ 75 percent of gross
domestic product, Interfax said.
	   In the absence of a fully convertible currency, the black market
for dollars has flourished.

Serie B's Atalanta shocks Fiorentina 3-2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERGAMO, Italy (AP) _ Second-division Atalanta rallied for a 3-2
upset Wednesday in an Italian Cup first-leg quarterfinal against
Serie A leader Fiorentina, which saw its Brazilian striker Edmundo
score one goal and set up another before being sent off for arguing
with the referee.
	   An unmarked Massimo Carrera headed in the winner from 10 meters
(yards) out with eight minutes to play for Atalanta, the only Serie
B team left in the competition.
	   Edmundo provided the fireworks in the first 37 minutes, but his
expulsion hurt Fiorentina's bid to hold onto its lead.
	   He stole the ball from Carrera, rounded 'keeper Alberto Fontana
and fired a shot that deflected off defender Fabio Rustico for a
1-0 lead in the eighth minute.
	   Another own-goal allowed Atalanta to tie the score 20 minutes
later, when midfielder Fabio Gallo's shot went in off Fiorentina
defender Moreno Torricelli's leg.
	   Edmundo made it 2-1 in the 34th, dribbling by two defenders and
sending a low blast inside the left post from 15 meters (yards).
Three minutes later, though, he was gone, as referee Alfredo
Trentalange pulled out the red card.
	   Buoyed by the man-advantage, Atalanta leveled again in the 65th,
when striker Fausto Rossini flicked in the ball with his heel. Then
Carrera decided the match, meeting Christian Zenoni's cross.
	   Argentine star Gabriel Batistuta had two shots fly off the post
for Fiorentina, the 1996 Italian Cup titlist.
	   On Wednesday, Udinese edged AC Parma 3-2 as Argentine defender
Mauro Esteban Navas slotted an injury-time winner past stand-in
'keeper Hernan Crespo.
	   Crespo, an Argentine striker, was forced to guard Parma's net
when starter Matteo Guardalben left with an injury after the team
had already used its three alloted substitutions.
	   Defending titlist Lazio of Rome hosts Internazionale of Milan in
another quarterfinal Thursday, while Juventus plays Bologna Jan. 13
in a match postponed because the Turin club played a Champions
League match at Istanbul Wednesday.
	   Second-leg games are slated for Jan. 26.

Iraq uses U.S. war veteran to blame Gulf War for illnesses

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Wednesday presented a former
American soldier allegedly suffering from war-related illnesses to
push its claim that U.S. shelling during the 1991 Gulf War
unleashed a radioactive substance, causing widespread cancer among
Iraqi civilians.
	   Her voice wavering and hands shaking, former Sgt. 1st Class
Carol Picou urged about 600 Iraqi scientists and doctors at a
medical conference to help explain what she said were unexplained
ailments.
	   ``I have numerous illnesses, brain damage, neurological
disorders,'' said Ms. Picou, a 42-year old native of Toccoa,
Georgia, who served as a nurse and truck driver in the U.S. Army.
	   Iraq also sponsored two former British soldiers to attend the
two-day conference. They stood in a row with five Iraqi officers.
All claim they suffer from similar neurological illnesses.
	   Ms. Picou and the Britons, Raymond Bristow and Colin
Dursell-Lee, said they had defied their governments' orders to
attend the conference.
	   The meeting will discuss what Iraq claims is the high incidence
of cancer among Iraqi civilians in southern Iraq exposed to
depleted uranium from shells fired by U.S. forces during the Gulf
War to end Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
	   Depleted uranium is a metal residue left when natural uranium is
refined. It is used in artillery shells and bombs designed to
penetrate the armor of tanks. On impact, the shells create an
airborne dust, which if inhaled or ingested, can be poisonous.
	   Sami Raoof, who heads a newly formed Iraqi office on the Gulf
War impact, said Iraqi scientists had found that cancer cases in
southern Iraq have increased by almost 200 percent since the war.
	   But there have been no independent studies to confirm that
claim. And a Western scientist attending the conference said it is
premature to blame depleted uranium for the illnesses.
	   ``Right now we have no idea whether it is depleted uranium or
oil fires. It will take a long time to know, and not in my
lifetime,'' Dr. Hari Sharma, a radiochemical specialist at Waterloo
University in Canada, said.
	   In March, an umbrella group of U.S. veterans claimed that at
least 400,000 service men and women had contact with depleted
uranium during the Gulf War.
	   Bernard Rostker, Pentagon's adviser on Gulf War illnesses, has
called the report exaggerated. He said too few Americans were on
the battlefield during the war and shortly afterward for so many to
have been exposed.
	   Most of the U.S. troops who came into direct contact with
depleted uranium were in vehicles hit by fellow Americans in
mistaken attacks the Army calls ``friendly fire.''

Estonian president sets election date
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) - Estonian President Lennart Meri has set
March 7 of next year as the date for regularly scheduled
parliamentary elections.
	   The election for the 101-seat Riigikogu legislature will be the
third since Estonia broke with the Soviet Union in 1991.
	   Meri said Tuesday he hoped the election would result in a
less-splintered parliament and a more stable, decisive government,
which he said was key to the nation's development.
	   Since Estonia regained independence, parliaments have been
fragmented and several governments have collapsed after losing
their fragile legislative majorities.
	   ''Our country needs efficient and resourceful administration,
not temporary, weak or hesitant governments,'' Meri said.
	   Estonia is considered one of the most successful economic
reformers among the 15 former Soviet republics, though turmoil on
world markets and in neighboring Russia have begun cutting into
economic growth.
	   Estonia has also made national security a top priority and, over
Russian objections, has sought membership in NATO. It is also
seeking membership in the European Union.
	   The Estonian president, who is not affiliated with any party,
said security questions were of paramount importance and he called
on competing political parties to form a consensus on defense and
foreign policy issues.
	   ``These issues should be not used as weapons by parties against
each other in campaigning,'' he said. ``I expect (voters) to
require from candidates, first and foremost, competence in foreign
and defense policy.
	   There are no clear front-runners for the election, though most
commentators say the center-right, strongly pro-reform opposition
is well positioned to make electoral gains.
	   The main party in the current minority coalition government, the
Coalition Party, has scored badly in recent opinion polls. It has
been criticized for being indecisive about economic policy.

Blair trying to broker progress among deadlocked Belfast
</HEADLINE>
politicians &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout with Blair's arrival, fresh comment &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony
Blair made a surprise visit to Belfast late Wednesday in hopes of
breaking the potentially dangerous deadlock between Protestant and
Catholic politicians.
	   It was Blair's second trip to Stormont Parliamentary Building in
east Belfast in a week, and was designed to counter widespread
fears that April's historic peace accord was festering through
neglect.
	   Blair didn't speak to reporters before meeting Protestant
politician David Trimble and Catholic politician Seamus Mallon, who
failed to form a multi-party administration by October as
envisioned in the accord.
	   Instead, they still haven't even agreed how many more positions
the administration should have _ Trimble says six, Mallon 10 _ nor
whether the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party can participate if the Irish
Republican Army doesn't start disarming. Trimble is demanding the
long-postponed gesture as evidence that the outlawed group, 16
months into a cease-fire, has really renounced violence.
	   Also in dispute is the extent of Northern Ireland's cooperation
with the Irish Republic, which won independence from Britain in
1922.
	   April's agreement specified that Belfast politicians should sit
in at least six committees with their southern Irish counterparts,
pursuing joint policy-making in noncontentious areas such as
fisheries, animal health and tourism.
	   Catholics hope this experiment will promote their goal of
eventual Irish unification, but Protestants are opposing Catholic
efforts to create more powerful committees that coordinate policies
like economic development.
	   Earlier Wednesday, opposition lawmakers in London's House of
Commons attacked Blair over his government's continuing paroles of
IRA members and pro-British militants.
	   ``I understand the concerns of people who see those who have
committed appalling murders being released on license,'' Blair
responded. ``However, it is important ... that we hold to our part
of the bargain.''
	   The agreement specified that convicted members of
truce-observing armed groups, responsible for the bulk of more than
3,400 killings in Northern Ireland's conflict, should be paroled by
May 2000.
	   But it also identified May 2000 as the deadline for those groups
to have finished destroying their hidden weapons stockpiles. The
IRA and the major pro-British groups, the Ulster Defense
Association and Ulster Volunteer Force, all insist they won't do
this.
	   The IRA position is most politically significant, since it has
by far the most weaponry and its affiliated politicians in Sinn
Fein have sufficient voter support to merit posts in the new
government.
	   Trimble said his Ulster Unionist Party and Mallon's Social
Democratic and Labor Party _ which represent most Protestant and
Catholic opinion in Northern Ireland _ were ``in one of those
rather tantalizing situations where we are actually very close to
getting things sorted.''
	   But Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams complained that voters in June
had elected a 108-member Assembly, and that legislature in July had
appointed Trimble and Mallon to be senior members of the future
administration _ but Trimble had since blocked everything.
	   ``Seven months after the Good Friday agreement, the only
institution standing is the one the unionists wanted,'' Adams said,
referring to the Assembly.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A U.S.-educated economist was designated
Lebanon's prime minister on Wednesday, and he promptly pledged to
continue a national rebuilding program _ with a hefty serving of
austerity.
	   Salim Hoss sought to calm fears that the departure of Rafik
Hariri would undermine Lebanon's renewal or devalue the currency.
Hariri was the architect of a multibillion dollar drive to rebuild
after the devastation of the 1975-90 civil war.
	   The new government will pursue ``austerity in the extreme'' in
the 1999 budget, which has to be presented in the coming weeks,
Hoss told reporters after President Emile Lahoud invited him to
form a government.
	   The government will ``set priorities in reconstruction and
development projects that do not exceed the financial capabilities
of the state,'' he said.
	   The national currency is solid, and measures will be taken
against speculators, he said.
	   The holder of an advanced degree in business and economics from
Indiana University at Bloomington, Hoss said he favored cutting
Lebanon's interest rate, which is currently at 14 percent. He has
argued that such high rates discourage investment.
	   Hoss was appointed earlier Wednesday after Lahoud received
constitutionally required recommendations from a majority of
Parliament members. Speaker Nabih Berri said Hoss had the support
of 95 of the 128 lawmakers in the half-Christian, half-Muslim
legislature.
	   Hoss, a legislator from Beirut who turns 69 on Dec. 20, has held
the premiership on four previous occasions.
	   The president had initially been inclined to re-appoint Hariri,
the billionaire businessman who had been prime minister since 1992.
Hariri had the majority support of legislators, but not the
overwhelming margin he had enjoyed in the past.
	   A chagrined Hariri bowed out of the race on Monday, but will
continue in a caretaker capacity until the Parliament approves the
new Cabinet.
	   Hoss is a Sunni Muslim, like every prime minister under
Lebanon's power-sharing arrangement. The arrangement also requires
the president to be a Maronite Catholic and the speaker a Shiite
Muslim.
	   A soft-spoken, down-to-earth man, Hoss's style of government and
economic policies are expected to be quite different from that of
the flamboyant Hariri.
	   One of his first challenges will be to draw up the budget for
the 1999 fiscal year, which begins in January. The budget deficit
is running at a high 17 percent of gross domestic product _ the
value of all goods and services produced within the country.
	   In his previous terms as prime minister, Hoss earned a
reputation for honesty. He is known to share Lahoud's goal of
ridding the administration of corruption.
	   Like almost all politicians in Lebanon, Hoss is an ally of
Syria, which maintains some 30,000 troops in Lebanon and is the
main powerbroker in the country.
	   He reaffirmed support for the guerrillas fighting Israel's
occupation of a zone in southern Lebanon. Israel has controlled the
area since 1985 as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on its
northern territory.

Bad weather may stop shuttle launch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with launch in doubt; Launch scheduled for
about 0900 GMT Thursday; launch window lasts just 10 minutes. &QL;

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP) _ Lousy weather forecast on both
sides of the Atlantic threatened to delay the liftoff Thursday of
NASA's first space station construction flight.
	   Clouds and rain were expected to move ashore. That could force
NASA to scrub space shuttle Endeavour's predawn launch with the
first American-built piece of the international space station.
	   What's more, cloudy skies and fog were forecast for the
emergency landing sites in Spain and Morocco. NASA will not launch
unless at least one of those sites is usable.
	   ``Basically, whether we get off the ground with respect to
weather is going to be a crap shoot,'' shuttle weatherman Ed
Priselac said Wednesday.
	   The flight is already a year late because of a cash crunch in
Russia, one of NASA's chief partners on the space station project.
	   Despite the dismal forecast, dignitaries from around the world
gathered to see Endeavour and its crew of six off. Most were
representatives of the 16 countries participating in the space
station effort. The guest list included Secretary of State Madeline
Albright.
	   The mission promises to be one of the most difficult in space
shuttle history. And the entire space station project promises to
be the most difficult undertaking since the Apollo moon landings
nearly 30 years ago.
	   ``We're not just testing just hardware as part of this
program,'' said Mikhail Sinelschikov, a Russian space official.
``We're testing our relationship very much and our mutual trust and
our confidence in each other.''
	   Two weeks ago, the Russians put the first piece of the space
station into orbit.
	   During Endeavour's 12-day flight, the astronauts will use the
shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian piece and attach it to the
American component. Then, two astronauts will perform three
spacewalks to hook up all the electrical connections and cables
between the two cylinders.
	   The U.S. piece, named Unity, is a connecting passageway. It is
essentially an aluminum can with big holes where other chambers
eventually will attach. It contains six miles (nine kilometers) of
wiring and more than 50,000 mechanical pieces.
	   The Russian component, named Zarya, which means sunrise,
contains the power and propulsion systems that will keep the
station aloft until the Russians can launch a permanent control
module.
	   In all, more than 100 components weighing 1 million pounds
(450,000 kilos) are to be launched over the next five years,
requiring 45 U.S. and Russian flights.
	   ``It's going to start out kind of small, but it's going to grow
to the size of a football field,'' said Endeavour's commander,
Robert Cabana.
	   Unity should have been put in orbit last December. But station
assembly was put on hold because of Russia's economic crisis, which
prevented the country's space agency from completing the permanent
control module. NASA has since bailed out the Russian Space Agency.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima met in
Athens with Premier Costas Simitis Wednesday, ahead of a summit of
European Union leaders in Vienna.
	   Klima, whose country currently holds the EU's rotating
presidency, is touring EU capitals to sound out leaders before
their mid-December meeting in Vienna. The summit will focus on the
union's funding arrangements in light of the Jan. 1 launch of the
single European currency.
	   We are considering ``the funds of the European Union and the
distribution of these funds,'' Simitis told reporters after meeting
Klima.
	   ``This is the central subject of negotiation in the European
Union at this time. Every country has its own position. The summit
will try and clarify some of these positions so that decisions can
be made and we can move on to another major issue _ enlargement of
the EU,'' Simitis said.
	   Greece is the only country of the 15-member EU that failed to
qualify for the first round of the single currency. Britain,
Denmark and Sweden opted out of joining.

NGOs accuse Angola gov't, former rebels of new mine planting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Four foreign non-governmental
organizations expressed concern Wednesday about a sharp rise of
casualties this year caused by new land mines allegedly being laid
by the government and the former rebel group UNITA in eastern
Angola.
	   In a letter addressed to both sides, the NGOs said in the past
two months 18 people had died and 36 were wounded in 12 land mine
explosions in the eastern province of Moxico, some 900 kilometers
(560 miles) southeast of the capital Luanda.
	   The total number of mine victims this year is 91, including 40
soldiers, the letter said.
	   It added that ``there have never been so many land-mine victims
since 1994,'' when a U.N.-brokered peace deal was signed to end a
two-decade-long civil war.
	   But a recent surge in tension has triggered fears that the
country is sliding back to war and that both sides have resumed
planting mines.
	   Angola is thought to have between 9 and 20 million mines
concealed in its soil, making it one of the world's most mined
countries.
	   The NGOs which sent the letter were the Jesuit Refugee Service,
Mines Advisory Group, Medico International, and Vietnam Veterans of
America Foundation.

U.S. recruits businesses to keep Russian nuclear prowess at home
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By H. JOSEF HEBERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Energy Department is looking for U.S.
businesses to help Russia create jobs for its economically
struggling nuclear scientists _ hoping to reduce the chances some
might sell their knowledge to other countries or terrorists.
	   Representatives from dozens of companies gathered Wednesday to
hear energy officials outline the program aimed at promoting new
economic development in Russia's 10 once highly secret nuclear
cities.
	   Tens of thousands of scientists and other nuclear workers once
lived elite lives within the fences of the secret cities, but in
recent years the workers have struggled as Russia scaled back its
nuclear program. Thousands have lost their jobs or been forced to
accept poverty wages. Some often go unpaid for months.
	   The U.S. program, which officials said will cost about $30
million by next Sept. 30, is designed to help Russian officials in
three of the cities. Its aim is to teach Russians more about
starting new businesses and attracting U.S. investors.
	   William Desmond, director of the Energy Department's Nuclear
Cities Initiative, admitted the program will take time because
``the challenges are absolutely incredible.'' He said 30,000 to
50,000 workers involved in Russia's nuclear program may face job
losses over the next five years.
	   ``We're going to take some fairly small steps to get started,''
Desmond said but expressed overall optimism.
	   Congress last year provided $15 million for the Russian
initiative, and Desmond said another $15 million or so will be
found in other DOE programs.
	   ``What this is all about is jobs,'' he said. The aim is for U.S.
know-how and new business ventures to produce several hundred new
jobs in each of the three cities earmarked for the early part of
the program.
	   Russian's deepening economic problems are making the situation
in the nuclear cities even more of a challenge, U.S. officials
said.
	   Kenneth Ames, an official at the DOE's Pacific Northwest
National Laboratory, recently returned from Sarov, one of the
nuclear cities. He said Wednesday he saw ``no sense of panic'' but
great uncertainty.
	   At Sarov, birthplace of the Soviet Union's atomic bomb, Ames
talked to managers of a factory that makes lenses for eyeglasses.
While they portrayed the venture as a success, he said, the company
was deeply in debt and faced possible bankruptcy. If it should
close, 103 jobs will be lost.
	   ``Saving jobs at this point is just as important as creating new
jobs,'' said Ames.
	   While showing interest, some businessmen at Wednesday's briefing
expressed hesitancy about investing in the program at a time of
great economic and political uncertainty in Russia.
	   Robert Summers, managing director of Technology &AMP; Systems
International, told Energy Department officials that his company
has worked in Russia and found in many cases ``a fundamental lack
of understanding'' of how to organize businesses.
	   John Soares, an official of Westinghouse Safety Management
Solutions Inc., a Potomac, Md., company that works with DOE at the
Savannah River weapons complex in South Carolina, said his company
could help develop new jobs in Russia related to nuclear cleanup
and storage.
	   But, he added, ``We need to have DOE tell us more about the
nuclear cities. ... We know very little about the workings of the
cities.''
	   Russia remains reluctant to provide large amounts of detailed
information about its nuclear program, which makes the job more
difficult for U.S. companies. ``Some of your questions probably
will never be answered,'' Desmond told Soares.

NATO detains Bosnian Serb general charged with genocide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ U.S. troops on Wednesday arrested
the highest-ranking Serb military officer seized so far in the
effort to bring to trial Bosnians who are accused of war crimes.
	   Radislav Krstic, a general, is accused of taking part, both
personally and through his troops, in the massacre of thousands of
Muslims after Bosnian Serbs took over the U.N. safe haven of
Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia in July 1995.
	   He was indicted in October by the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal,
which charged him with genocide, crimes against humanity and grave
breaches of the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of civilians
during war. The indictment was secret so he wouldn't be prompted to
flee.
	   Krstic was arrested in a section of northern Bosnia controlled
by U.S. troops serving in NATO's Stabilization Force, better known
as SFOR. A spokeswoman, Maj. Sheena Thomson, said Krstic was
arrested without incident at noon.
	   The chief prosecutor of the tribunal, Louise Arbour of Canada,
called Krstic ``a very significant military leader'' and said his
arrest was important to the tribunal's ability to continue to do
its job. Krstic is the most senior officer seized so far for trial
before the U.N. tribunal in The Hague.
	   Amor Masovic, the head of the Bosnian Muslim commission for
people missing in the war, said he expected the arrest to shed
light on the fate of more than 8,000 people missing in the
Srebrenica region.
	   Muslim leaders in Bosnia expressed hope NATO would now focus on
apprehending the key architects of the war, former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief Gen. Ratko
Mladic.
	   ``We welcome this arrest and particularly the fact that they
have started arresting generals,'' said Mirza Hajric, adviser to
Bosnian Muslim member of the country's joint presidency, Alija
Izetbegovic.
	   ``We hope they will soon switch over to commanders,'' Hajric
said.
	   He added the arrest ``could serve as a good example for the
French troops who have not yet arrested anybody.'' Bosnian Muslims
say Karadzic and Mladic are living in the part of the country under
French control.
	   Bosnian Serbs criticized Krstic's secret indictment. Petar
Djokic, president of the Bosnian Serb parliament, said it ``brings
uncertainty to people, a feeling that every citizen of Republika
Srpska can be regarded as a potential war criminal in the eyes of
the tribunal, and that SFOR is authorized to arrest anybody,
anytime, anywhere.'' Republika Srpska is the Serb entity within
Bosnia.
	   Krstic was the commander of the 5th Corps of the Bosnian Serb
Army. He is believed to be a close associate of Karadzic and
Mladic, who have been indicted for genocide for allegedly
masterminding the massacre of Muslims at Srebrenica.
	   ``Persons indicted for war crimes who are still at large should
realize they, too, will be brought to justice,'' NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said Wednesday after the arrest.
	   Krstic is the ninth war crimes suspect to be arrested in the
former Yugoslavia by international forces. He was named head of the
Drina Corps of the Bosnian Serb Army in 1995 after the fall of
Srebrenica.
	   The last reported sighting of Krstic was at a joint military
exercise of the Yugoslav National Army and the Bosnian Serb
military in Manjaca, near Banja Luka, in October. SFOR banned his
5th Corps from taking part in the exercise, but let him monitor it.

Italy's leader says Rome would consider third-country trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ If Rome's proposal for an international tribunal
fails, Italy would consider a trial in a third country for a
Kurdish rebel leader whose extradition is demanded by Turkey,
Premier Massimo D'Alema said Wednesday.
	   In any case, Italy is committed to seeing that Abdullah Ocalan,
detained at Rome's airport three weeks ago, has a ``fair'' trial,
D'Alema told the Camera of Deputies, which held debate over the
rebel leader's detention in Italy.
	   Right from the start, the Italian government refused to
extradite Ocalan because Turkey, which considers him a terrorist,
has the death penalty.
	   Ocalan's arrest was also sought by Germany. However, Germany has
held off on pushing for his extradition, which could enflame
Germany's large number of resident Turks, including many Kurds.
	   D'Alema seemed annoyed that Germany, which doesn't have capital
punishment, didn't take Ocalan off Italy's hands.
	   Germany's political decision not to push for extradition ``can
be understood but not taken as an ideal model. It's a
comprehensible but not coherent choice,'' D'Alema told the
deputies.
	   If a trial, either in a third country or by an international
court, isn't feasible, said D'Alema, then Italy would evaluate
Ocalan's request for political asylum as it studies ``the most
adequate measures to guarantee Ocalan's safety and to come out of a
condition of uncertainty.''
	   There is strong support for asylum among some members of
D'Alema's government, which includes Communists, although it is up
to judicial authorities to rule on refuge requests.
	   Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party has been fighting for Kurdish
autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984 in a war that has killed
37,000 and devastated the region.
	   Since his arrival in Rome on a flight from Moscow, he has
renounced armed struggle, but the guerrilla war goes on.
	   An Italian court ordered Ocalan to remain in Rome until Dec. 23
to give Germany more time to ponder extradition.
	   Turkish-Italian tensions over the Ocalan case have gone beyond
politics. Some Turks called for boycotts of Italian products and
services. And a soccer game in Istanbul between Italian and Turkish
champion teams was postponed a week, until Wednesday, to let
sentiment cool down.
	   D'Alema opened his speech with the wish that the game, between
Turin's Juventus team and Istanbul's Galatasaray, would represent
``a moment of detente'' between Turkey and Italy.
	   Two Italian ministers, including one with the sports and culture
portfolio, flew to Istanbul to attend the game.
	   Italy was committed, D'Alema said, to relaunching a European
initiative for a dialogue with Turkey both in terms of Ankara's
possible future membership in the European Union and of searching
for a solution for Turkey's Kurdish minority.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's central government ordered the arrest of
a prominent democracy campaigner and may use his contacts with
exiled Chinese dissidents to charge him with harming national
security, a colleague said Wednesday.
	   Two Beijing police officers spent 30 minutes telling Zha Jianguo
to stop trying to set up a political opposition party. Underscoring
the warning, they said his colleague, Xu Wenli, won't be released
soon and may be charged for having links to ``reactionary groups,''
Zha said.
	   Xu and another influential dissident, Qin Yongmin, were arrested
Monday night in police raids in two cities that delivered the
sternest blow so far to a five-month campaign to establish the
China Democracy Party and challenge the ruling Communist Party's
monopoly on power.
	   Qin was arrested for plotting to overthrow the government, a
crime that could land him in jail for life. A third Democracy Party
advocate, Wang Youcai, already in custody for a month, was also
formally arrested Monday although his family has not been informed
of the charges.
	   Zha, who helped Xu organize would-be party members in Beijing
and the nearby port of Tianjin, said police officers told him Xu's
arrest was ordered by the central government, not Beijing police.
	   He took the police reference to ``reactionary groups'' to mean
exiled dissidents in the United States. Under China's vague State
Security Law, such links may also be punishable by up to life in
prison.
	   Zha pledged to work with dissidents in China and exiles in the
United States to campaign ``to save Xu Wenli.''
	   On Wednesday, 190 dissidents from around the country demanded in
an open letter that the government release Xu, Qin and Wang Youcai,
saying the arrests run counter to U.N. human rights treaties China
has signed over the past 14 months.
	   The authorities ``are deceiving and cheating international
public opinion while on the other hand they are suppressing and
persecuting domestic political dissidents,'' said the letter faxed
to foreign news agencies.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the
United States deplored the detention and arrests of Xu and Qin.
	   ``We believe the peaceful political activities of this kind and
other forms of peaceful expression that they've been involved in
are fundamental human rights that should be protected by all
governments,'' Lockart said. ``We call on the Chinese government to
assure the protection in these cases of Mr. Xu and Mr. Qin.''
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin also called Xu's
detention ``a serious step in the wrong direction'' and called for
his release.

Study: Women at higher risk for deadliest lung cancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Among smokers who get lung cancer, women are
nearly twice as likely as men to develop the most deadly form of
the disease, new research suggests.
	   Experts say the British study of 1,601 lung cancer patients
represents the first time scientists have discovered a significant
difference between the sexes in the risk of small-cell lung cancer.
Virtually always caused by smoking, it is the hardest form of lung
cancer to treat successfully.
	   The study, presented Wednesday at a conference of the British
Thoracic Society in London, showed that women under 65 were 1.7
times more vulnerable than men to small-cell lung cancer, which
spreads so rapidly that by the time it is diagnosed, it is usually
too late to operate.
	   Seven out of 10 of those women could not be helped by surgery,
and half the patients die within five months of diagnosis, said the
lead researcher, Dr. Mike Pearson, associate director of the
research unit of the Royal College of Physicians in London.
	   Men were more susceptible to non-small cell lung cancer, which
is less severe and can be operated on in half the cases, he added.
	   ``One in four women will get small cell lung cancer, whereas the
figure for men was one in six,'' Pearson said.
	   About 2 million lung cancer cases are diagnosed every year
worldwide _ 85 percent of them linked to smoking.
	   Commenting on the study, Dr. Stephen Spiro, head of thoracic
medicine University College, London Hospital, said small-cell
cancer accounts for about 20 percent of overall lung cancer cases.
But because smoking is increasing among women, the latest study
indicates the figure is now closer to about 38 percent, he said.
	   In 1965, 66 percent of men and 25 percent of women in Western
countries smoked. By 1988, the proportion of men smoking dropped to
30 percent but the percentage of women smokers had increased to 35
percent, he noted.

Guyanese opposition leader fires secretary general
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT WILKINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ The leader of Guyana's main opposition
party has fired the secretary general amid grumbling by businesses
over racially charged street protests earlier this year.
	   People's National Congress leader Desmond Hoyte dismissed Aubrey
Norton Tuesday and replaced him with a longtime ally and former
domestic affairs minister, Oscar Clarke.
	   Party insiders said business leaders have been pressuring Hoyte
to eliminate party leaders as a way of renouncing the street
protests and violence that followed the December 1997 elections.
The unrest has been blamed for the country's sluggish economy this
year.
	   Hoyte has said no protests are planned in the next few weeks.
	   The firing comes less than two weeks after President Jagan's
son, Cheddi Jagan Jr., resigned from Parliament, claiming the
ruling People's Progressive Party was ``geriatric and fossilized''
and warning that racial politics were damaging the country. Jagan's
party is backed by people of East Indian descent, while Hoyte's
party is supported by Guyanese of African descent.
	   Guyana, a former British colony on the northeast corner of South
America, has long been divided along ethnic lines.
	   Analysts said the two actions herald an impending clash between
the new and old guards in both parties. Hoyte is 69, Janet Jagan is
78 and Clarke is 60, while Norton is 40 and Cheddi Jagan Jr. is 49.
	   Hoyte said he fired Norton, a British-educated political
scientist, for insubordination, but he did not elaborate.
	   Most political parties in the region elect their secretary
general, but in the PNC the official is appointed by Hoyte.
	   ``It is clear that the older-style leadership in the party
leadership does not want to give way to youth,'' said commentator
Wazir Mohamed, a former leader of the minority Working People's
Alliance.
	   Party insiders said all but two members of the party's central
executive vehemently opposed Norton's dismissal.

Duma seeks medical report on Yeltsin

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Communist-dominated parliament formally
demanded the release of Boris Yeltsin's medical records Wednesday
and asked the country's highest court to clarify how to determine
when a president is fit to govern.
	   The action by the lower house, the State Duma, came as Yeltsin
spent an 11th straight day in the hospital with what aides
described as pneumonia.
	   Yeltsin's frequent illnesses and his limited public appearances
have raised concerns about his ability to lead the country _ now
mired in its worst economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse _
through the end of his term in mid-2000.
	   Lawmakers repeatedly have sought more specifics on his health
but Wednesday was the first time they approved a written request.
The margin was overwhelming, 247-33.
	   The document urges the presidential doctors to report on
Yeltsin's health within 10 days.
	   ``The absence of trustworthy information on the president's
health has spurred abundant rumors, allegations and even guesswork
diagnosis, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease,'' it said.
``That stirs the public and causes doubts about the president's
ability to exercise his duties.''
	   Russian law gives the Duma no power to make an inquest into the
president's health, and the document did not say what would happen
if doctors ignored the 10-day deadline.
	   Alexander Kotenkov, Yeltsin's envoy to the Duma, quickly
dismissed the statement as having no legal meaning.
	   The Russian Constitution says the president may be dismissed
from office due to ``lasting inability to exercise his duties.''
But it doesn't spell out who must determine that or how.
	   Wednesday's document asks the Constitutional Court for a
clarification on that issue.
	   Yeltsin was to remain in the hospital through the end of the
week, but may return to the Kremlin on Monday, his deputy chief of
staff Yuri Yarov said Wednesday.
	   Yeltsin was handling limited paperwork and spoke on the
telephone Wednesday with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and French
President Jacques Chirac, the presidential press service said.
	   Another Yeltsin aide, Oleg Sysuyev, said Tuesday that Yeltsin,
known as a restless patient, is urging doctors to discharge him as
soon as possible.
	   Dr. Renat Akchurin, who performed Yeltsin's heart bypass
operation in 1996, said the current bout of pneumonia, the second
in as many years, is apparently due to the president's weakened
immunity and his age, not heart problems.
	   Akchurin, speaking with the weekly Argumenty i Fakty, said he
has not examined Yeltsin for eight months, but believed that heart
problems were unlikely.
	   Still, that didn't mean the illness could be taken lightly.
	   ``Pneumonia sometimes brings even healthy people to a tragic
end,'' Akchurin said. ``For those with a record of heart illness,
it always has a quite serious character.''
	   Yeltsin has made only rare public appearances in recent months,
and was visiting the Kremlin only two or three days a week before
he fell ill. Primakov has taken over many day-to-day duties in
Yeltsin's absence.

Blair trying to broker progress among deadlocked Belfast
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AMs. UPDATES throughout with Blair's arrival, fresh comment &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony
Blair made a surprise visit to Belfast late Wednesday in hopes of
breaking the potentially dangerous deadlock between Protestant and
Catholic politicians.
	   It was Blair's second trip to Stormont Parliamentary Building in
east Belfast in a week, and was designed to counter widespread
fears that April's historic peace accord was festering through
neglect.
	   Blair didn't speak to reporters before meeting Protestant
politician David Trimble and Catholic politician Seamus Mallon, who
failed to form a multi-party administration by October as
envisioned in the accord.
	   Instead, they still haven't even agreed how many more positions
the administration should have _ Trimble says six, Mallon 10 _ nor
whether the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party can participate if the Irish
Republican Army doesn't start disarming. Trimble is demanding the
long-postponed gesture as evidence that the outlawed group, 16
months into a cease-fire, has really renounced violence.
	   Also in dispute is the extent of Northern Ireland's cooperation
with the Irish Republic, which won independence from Britain in
1922.
	   April's agreement specified that Belfast politicians should sit
in at least six committees with their southern Irish counterparts,
pursuing joint policy-making in noncontentious areas such as
fisheries, animal health and tourism.
	   Catholics hope this experiment will promote their goal of
eventual Irish unification, but Protestants are opposing Catholic
efforts to create more powerful committees that coordinate policies
like economic development.
	   Earlier Wednesday, opposition lawmakers in London's House of
Commons attacked Blair over his government's continuing paroles of
IRA members and pro-British militants.
	   ``I understand the concerns of people who see those who have
committed appalling murders being released on license,'' Blair
responded. ``However, it is important ... that we hold to our part
of the bargain.''
	   The agreement specified that convicted members of
truce-observing armed groups, responsible for the bulk of more than
3,400 killings in Northern Ireland's conflict, should be paroled by
May 2000.
	   But it also identified May 2000 as the deadline for those groups
to have finished destroying their hidden weapons stockpiles. The
IRA and the major pro-British groups, the Ulster Defense
Association and Ulster Volunteer Force, all insist they won't do
this.
	   The IRA position is most politically significant, since it has
by far the most weaponry and its affiliated politicians in Sinn
Fein have sufficient voter support to merit posts in the new
government.
	   Trimble said his Ulster Unionist Party and Mallon's Social
Democratic and Labor Party _ which represent most Protestant and
Catholic opinion in Northern Ireland _ were ``in one of those
rather tantalizing situations where we are actually very close to
getting things sorted.''
	   But Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams complained that voters in June
had elected a 108-member Assembly, and that legislature in July had
appointed Trimble and Mallon to be senior members of the future
administration _ but Trimble had since blocked everything.
	   ``Seven months after the Good Friday agreement, the only
institution standing is the one the unionists wanted,'' Adams said,
referring to the Assembly.

Former associate of ruling couple sentenced to two years in jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Belgrade court sentenced Wednesday
a former neo-communist official once close to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and his influential wife, to two years in prison
for deliberately damaging state funds.
	   State-run Tanjug news agency reported Nenad Djordjevic, a
wealthy businessman, was convicted for closing a deal between a
computer company and the state health insurance company that he was
in charge of at a bogus and inflated price with the aim to secretly
channel part of the multi-million dollar deal to his personal
accounts.
	   Although Djordjevic was originally charged with earning money
illegally, the prosecution dropped that and the court ruled the
Djordjevic was guilty of signing the deal to buy information
services from the computer company for dlrs 42 million instead the
37 million the deal was supposed to be worth.
	   Djordjevic made most of his fortune _ estimated at dozens of
millions of dollars _ before taking over management of state funds.
During his tenure as director of the state Health Insurance Fund,
he was often blamed by independent media for shady business deals _
especially during the years when former Yugoslavia broke up and the
new federation was under strict U.N. sanctions.
	   He was arrested in February in downtown Belgrade, right after a
party meeting of the Yugoslav Left, the neo-Communist party run by
Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, also a coalition partner of
Milosevic's Socialists.
	   Djordjevic's surprise fallout with the ruling couple marked the
beginning of some major reshuffles this year in the establishment,
still firmly controlled by Milosevic and Markovic.

Land mines scattered through Central America after Hurricane Mitch
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By JULIE WATSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTA CATARINA, Honduras (AP) _ Calixto Carranza was planting
watermelons in a field flooded by Hurricane Mitch when he spotted
something in the dirt.
	   After years of farming near the Nicaraguan border, he had seen
his share of anti-personnel mines left over from civil wars in the
1980s _ small blue cans with metal sprouts out the top _ but this
looked like a wheel rim.
	   In fact, it was an anti-tank mine, much more powerful than the
mines he would have recognized. When he poked it with the point of
his machete, the blast threw him 80 feet (25 meters) into the air.
His body fell to the ground in pieces.
	   Workers spent years compiling maps of the tens of thousands of
mines left across Central America. But flooding unleashed by
Hurricane Mitch a month ago scattered many of those mines across
fields and villages. Nobody knows where they wound up.
	   ``We know the waters displaced land mines, but we don't know how
much, which will probably mean it will take more money and time to
finish sweeping areas,'' said Colombian Army Lt. Col. Guillermo
Leal, chief of the Organization of American States' mission to
clear Central America of land mines.
	   Meanwhile, farmers worry that they may unwittingly become the
detectors. Since the hurricane, land mines have killed three
farmers and injured eight in Nicaragua and Honduras.
	   ``We're terrified to return to the fields,'' said 17-year-old
Genaro Funez, whose jaw was broken in the blast that killed his
cousin, Carranza, in the town of Santa Catarina, 12 miles (20
kilometers) from the border.
	   Carranza, 34, was working in the watermelon fields with 14
people on Nov. 18. The explosion threw all of them to the ground.
Another of Carranza's cousins, 17-year-old Candido Ortiz, died half
an hour later in the field, his side blown open from the blast.
	   Help was nine miles (15 kilometers) away. Funez walked with a
broken jaw. A 13-year-old boy stumbled through the mud and debris
left by the hurricane, part of his forearm missing.
	   The others _ some cut by flying shrapnel _ followed, carrying
19-year-old Enrique Linares in a hammock because of his broken
thigh.
	   ``I'm in so much pain,'' Linares said at the hospital, wincing
as he struggled to adjust himself on a bed that was moist from his
oozing cast. ``But I don't have the money to buy pain medicine.''
	   Despite a three-year effort to remove them, more than 70,000
land mines remain in the ground in Nicaragua. The hurricane
significantly altered their locations, officials say.
	   In central Nicaragua this week, the army began mine sweeping
outside the town of Muy Muy under a destroyed bridge, where
officials found anti-personnel mines poking through the mud.
	   In nearby Waslala, 16-year-old Bernardo Ocampo Gonzalez died
Friday after a floating mine hit him and detonated as he bathed in
a river.
	   Nicaraguan officials planned to map out their strategy this
week. Meanwhile, the OAS, with the help of U.S. experts, was using
satellites to see how far the rivers could have carried the mines.
	   No one knows how many land mines remain in Honduras, nor who put
them there as Nicaragua's civil war spilled across the border.
	   Dr. Enrique Sandoval, director of Honduras' Hospital Sur near
the border, treated more than 75 land mine victims from 1988 to
1994 under a government rehabilitation program. Most of the
patients were young, poor farmers.
	   ``We know this instrument of death still exists here a decade
after a war that was never ours,'' he said. ``They were left here
indiscriminately without any care about the suffering they could
cause.''

Car explodes in busy downtown of Bahrain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ A car booby trapped with a cooking gas
tank exploded Wednesday in a parking lot in the crowded downtown of
Bahrain's capital, fire officials said. There were no reports of
casualties.
	   The explosion was heard several kilometers (miles) away.
	   Witnesses speaking on condition of anonymity said they saw a
ball of fire emanating from the parking lot and saw chunks of metal
and car parts flying high in all directions.
	   There were no immediate claims of responsibility and police
refused to comment. In the past, Shiite extremists have been blamed
for arson attacks and bombings in Bahrain, a Gulf island.
	   Fire engines rushed to the explosion site in Exhibition Road, a
commercial district of Manama, and put out a few minor fires
burning around some sections of the Toyota car, a late 1970s model.
	   A fire department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said a large-sized cooking gas tank placed inside the car was used
to set off the explosion, probably with the help of a timer.
	   The crumpled and blackened hood of the car with headlights still
attached lay in one corner. The rear portion was completely torn
into twisted metal, tires were strewn around and the middle section
was nowhere to be seen.
	   The blast appeared to have caused little damage to other cars in
the parking lot.
	   Since December 1994, Shiite Muslims have led a violent campaign
for democratic and social reforms that include restoration of the
National Assembly, which was dissolved in 1975.
	   Hundreds of activists have been detained in connection with the
violence, which has included bombings and arson attacks. More than
40 people have been reported killed in the unrest.
	   A slight majority of Bahrain's 400,000 citizens are Shiites, but
the ruling Al Khalifa family belongs to the mainstream Sunni sect
of Islam.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli government reacted to a violent
West Bank attack Wednesday by halting the latest Mideast peace
accord until the Palestinians comply with a list of demands
including a promise to publicly abandon plans to declare a state in
May.
	   Palestinian officials rejected the demands outright and charged
that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was looking for
excuses to knock the peace process off track.
	   An Israeli government statement said its decision was prompted
in part by the attack on an Israeli soldier and civilian by an
angry Palestinian mob in the city of Ramallah in the West Bank
earlier Wednesday.
	   The decision came only 10 days before U.S. President Bill
Clinton was to arrive in the region to usher in stage two of the
Wye River land-for-security agreement he helped negotiate in
October.
	   The Israeli announcement that it was suspending further troop
withdrawals from the West Bank and implementation of the accord
raised questions about whether the Clinton trip could take place
while Israel was holding-up the agreement.
	   ``Mr. Netanyahu is trying to create a crisis before the arrival
of President Clinton. We consider his conditions unacceptable.
Every day he imposes new conditions, this is an attitude that must
not continue, it will not be tolerated,'' said senior Palestinian
official Saeb Erekat.
	   Fresh from a demonstration calling on Israel to release
Palestinian prisoners, dozens of Palestinian university students
armed with rocks and slabs of concrete staked-out a traffic circle
Wednesday at an entrance to Ramallah in the West Bank.
	   As a car with Israeli license plates approached driven by a man
wearing a skullcap and carrying a soldier in its passenger seat,
the crowd began to shout ``Yahudi, yahudi,'' _ Arabic for Jew _ and
seconds later began pelting the car with stones and smashing its
windows.
	   The Israeli driver fled from the moving car after a large rock
broke the side window and just missed his head. The young Israeli
soldier was dragged out of the car and, as he cowered on the
pavement and raised his hands defensively, was struck repeatedly on
the head with rocks.
	   Captured by cameras, the attack was shown over and over on
Israeli television, making some Israelis wonder whether the
Palestinian Authority was trying to control violence as it pledged
in the latest accord.
	   ``Today's violent incident in Ramallah reflects the grave
deterioration in security for which Israel holds the Palestinian
Authority responsible,'' read the Israeli announcement. It said
that repeated Palestinian violations of the agreement culminated in
Wednesday's attack.
	   The ambush overshadowed the stabbing death earlier Wednesday of
an Arab street cleaner in Jerusalem, apparently by an Israeli
extremist. During the funeral procession for Osama Natche, a
41-year-old father of six, mourners torched an Israeli car and
stoned Israeli police who fired rubber bullets.
	   Hours later, rioting throughout traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem continued with masked Palestinians throwing stones at
cars and blocking roads with burning tires. Jerusalem police
spokesman Shmuel Ben Ruby said five Palestinians were arrested for
throwing stones which shattered a bus window and injured the
driver.
	   Israel and the Palestinian Authority blamed each other for the
violence.
	   Netanyahu issued a statement saying ``The Palestinian Authority
is encouraging acts of violence, such as today's brutal attack in
Ramallah, in an attempt to pressure Israel with regard to the
matter of the prisoners.''
	   His senior adviser David Bar-Illan said Israel would not allow
the peace process to continue under threats of violence. ``The
bottom line is that there will be no further withdrawals unless the
Palestinian Authority lives up to all its commitments.''
	   A statement from Netanyahu's office said the Palestinians must
acknowledge that Israel did not agree to release Palestinian
prisoners who have committed acts against Israel. The statement
also said: ``Israel demands that the Palestinian Authority announce
clearly that it is abandoning its intention to unilaterally declare
a Palestinian state and announce its commitment to continuous
negotiations until a final arrangement is achieved. Israel demands
that the Palestinian Authority immediately stop acts of violence
and incitement and punish rioters,'' the statement said.
	   On Tuesday, the Palestinian parliament speaker, Ahmed Qureia,
told protesters demanding that Israel release prisoners that they
had the backing of the Palestinian leadership which ``is prepared
once again to throw stones in order to free the people.'' The
comments were specifically listed in the Cabinet decision as an
example of threats which ``must cease.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Israel was to blame
for the violence, saying Netanyahu raised tensions by not releasing
prisoners and continuing to expand Jewish settlements.
	   In the Wye agreement, Israel promised to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank and release 750 Palestinian prisoners by
January. In a first stage last month, it withdrew from 2 percent of
the area and set free 250 prisoners, but most were criminals, not
those held for anti-Israeli activities as the Palestinian Authority
had expected.
	   Arafat raised the issue earlier this week with Clinton in
meetings with Washington. ``He (Clinton) promised us to make every
effort to solve this issue,'' said Erekat upon his return from
Washington.
	   About half of the 2,500 Palestinians held by Israel are members
of Arafat's Fatah faction and there has been growing anger in Fatah
ranks over the Palestinian Authority's failure to get detainees
released.
	   Jewish settlers, who oppose the latest peace deal, issued a
veiled threat of vigilantism following the attack. In a press
statement, settlers said if the Israeli army did not clamp a
closure barring Palestinians from leaving Ramallah, Jewish settlers
``will be forced to do it themselves. Failure to respond seriously
will encourage deeds of this kind as Clinton's visit draws near.''
	   Settler leader Ahron Dombe told The Associated Press, ``We don't
intend to allow Jews to be attacked without a response.'' Asked if
settlers were prepared to clash with Israeli troops over the
matter, he said, ``I hope we won't need to (but) I'm not ruling it
out as a possibility.''

Sudan's powerful parliament speaker quits to work for party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Hassan Turabi, the most influential
person in Sudan's government, resigned his post on Wednesday as the
Parliament speaker to work full time for the governing National
Congress party, state television said.
	   Turabi is widely regarded as the principal Islamic ideologue of
the military-backed government of President Omar el-Bashir. The
president must approve the resignation but that is considered a
formality.
	   The television said Turabi informed Parliament members he was
quitting so that he could ``devote all his time to the National
Congress.''
	   His widely anticipated resignation is not expected to reduce his
role as the power behind the scenes.
	   On Saturday, Deputy Speaker Ellison Magaia said Turabi would
resign but will continue heading the assembly until it approves
next year's budget on Dec. 17.
	   Political analysts see the resignation as a government attempt
to appease the opposition before adopting a new law to legalize
``political associations'' from Jan. 1.
	   The presence of the hard-line Turabi at the head of Parliament
had cast doubts on the seriousness of the government's openness to
the opposition.
	   Sudan's 6-month-old constitution does not clearly mention the
right to form political parties but does speak about the right to
organize political associations.
	   Some parliament members have pressed hard to replace such vague
phrases with a clear-cut reference to ``political parties.'' But
Turabi strongly opposed such a change.
	   Sudanese opposition leaders in exile, in their last meeting in
Egypt in August, rejected the new constitution which is based on
Islamic law. They vowed to keep up their struggle for democracy.
	   El-Bashir, who banned all political parties after seizing power
in a 1989 military coup, has said recently that the door was open
for the opposition figures to come back and form their political
associations.

Primakov criticizes regions for not cracking down on crime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov criticized
regional leaders Wednesday for not cracking down on crime,
corruption and tax evasion.
	   Speaking to the Federation Council, Russia's upper house of
parliament, Primakov said, ``The government can only wage the
struggle against crime and corruption together with the regions.''
	   The Federation Council is made up of Russia's regional
governors, who have substantial authority in their home
territories.
	   Primakov complained of widespread tax dodging, a chronic problem
that has worsened Russia's economic troubles, and urged tighter
control over privatization and bankruptcy proceedings to keep them
corruption-free.
	   One of Russia's biggest problems is unpaid wages to millions of
workers, many of them state employees. The central government says
that in many cases it has allocated the money to regional
officials, but they have diverted the funds for other projects.
	   Primakov also suggested a rehaul of Russian industry.
	   ``We have a market economy, but we must put it in order so the
subjects of the (Russian) Federation bordering each other do not
produce the same kind of production, such as tractors,'' Primakov
said.
	   Primakov also met Wednesday with International Monetary Fund
chief Michel Camdessus. Russia wants the IMF to release loans
frozen since the country's latest crisis hit.

Shalala brainstorms with Israeli public health officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services
Donna Shalala gave some pointers Wednesday to Israeli public health
professionals on bringing women's health issues into the
mainstream.
	   Shalala, who is in Israel to chair a two-day conference on
women's health, met with a Knesset committee on the status of women
where she touched on research, mass media campaigns and political
strategies.
	   She stressed the importance of researching women's health. In
the U.S., women were often left out of clinical trials until a
presidential directive mandated their participation, she said.
	   ``They no longer can do research that is paid for by the
government on a disease that affects women without having women in
the trial,'' Shalala said. ``The first research on breast cancer
was done on men.''
	   She also said women's health needs to encompass women's entire
lifespan, not just reproductive health issues. Accordingly, public
health campaigns in the U.S. have included anti-smoking, milk
consumption and mammograms.
	   Focus groups showed that campaigns be especially pitched for
gender. In anti-smoking campaigns directed at girls, concerns about
skin and a lingering bad smell are played up while messages for
boys stress smoking's ill-effects on athletic performance.
	   Marina Solodkin, chair of the Knesset committee on the status of
women, said she would consider some of Shalala's strategies in
campaigns for cancer screening, milk and smoking.
	   Shalala arrived in Israel for a four-day stay with her
91-year-old Lebanese-born mother, Edna. Wednesday, she met with
Israeli President Ezer Weizman. She will also receive an honorary
doctorate in philosophy from the University of Haifa and tour
Palestinian health facilities in the West Bank.

Macedonia will host NATO force for Kosovo, premier says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ The Macedonian government confirmed
Wednesday that it will allow a NATO force to be stationed in its
territory to serve as a back-up for international peace officials
in neighboring Kosovo.
	   Macedonian Premier Ljubco Georgievski said his newly elected
center-right government decided to allow the troops into the
country after NATO leaders offered the small Balkan nation
``special privileges,'' including assurances the move would bring
Macedonia closer to full membership in NATO.
	   NATO officials also assured Macedonia the troops would be ``part
of a peace operation, not a rapid reaction force,'' Georgievski
said.
	   Georgievski, who officially took office on Monday, said the
government made the ``difficult decision'' after much deliberation,
taking into consideration that Macedonia aspires to fully join NATO
and because it ``supports peaceful initiatives for solving the
Kosovo conflict.''
	   Macedonia, which has its own sizable ethnic Albanian community,
was reluctant to agree to hosting the force, for fear of upsetting
its relations with neighboring Yugoslavia.
	   Macedonia borders Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic, whose
Kosovo province erupted in war this year, with local ethnic
Albanians fighting government forces to win independence.
	   Under a U.S.-led initiative, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic agreed to pull out some of the government forces from
Kosovo. Milosevic also agreed to allow trained officials from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to verify
compliance on the ground.
	   The NATO-led force to be stationed in Macedonia would evacuate
the verifiers should they run into trouble.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Slogans denouncing a Kurdish guerrilla
group mixed with upbeat soccer chants and obscenities at Ali Sami
Yen Stadium Wednesday during the politically charged Champions
League match between Galatasaray and Juventus of Turin.
	   Around 22,000 police officers were deployed for the game amid
fears that angry Turkish fans might turn violent against the
Italians. But the scoreless first half came off without any
violence at the stadium.
	   Military troops in camouflage outfits stood guard around the
stadium, and police used their shields to prevent possible flying
objects from reaching the field.
	   The crowd shouted obscenities at the tense-looking Juventus
players who began their warm-up on the ground less than an hour
before kick-off.
	   A band in the spectator stands played Mozart's funereal
``Requiem.''

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's Muslim leaders
cheered the arrest Wednesday of a Bosnian Serb general wanted for
war crimes_ with hopes the action sets a new trend.
	   NATO troops in northern Bosnia arrested Gen. Radislav Krstic,
charged with genocide and crimes against humanity in the 1995
massacre of Muslims fleeing Srebrenica.
	   Krstic is the most senior person wanted by the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal to be arrested so far. He is also the first one
related to the 1995 massacre at Srebrenica, in which some 8,000
people went missing.
	   ``We welcome this arrest _ particularly the fact that they have
started arresting generals,'' said Mirza Hajric, the adviser to
Bosnian Muslim member of the joint presidency, Alija Izetbegovic.
``We hope they will soon switch over to commanders.''
	   Krstic was arrested in the northern part of Bosnia, controlled
by U.S. troops. Most of the nine actions against alleged war
criminals by international forces have taken place in either in the
British or U.S. sectors.
	   French troops, stationed in the eastern part of Bosnia, however,
have yet to arrest any of the indicted war criminals presumed to be
in their region _ including the most wanted duo of the alleged
civil and military commanders, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic.
	   ``This could serve as a good example for the French troops who
have not yet arrested anybody,'' Hajric said.
	   The Bosnian Muslim leadership considers France an obstacle to
arresting Bosnian Serb war-crimes suspects, after the French
government refused to let its officers testify in the tribunal in
The Hague, Netherlands, a source close to the Muslim leadership
said.
	   Many Muslim sources say the French sector is known as ``haven
for war-criminals.''
	   In the past three years, three high ranking French officers have
been caught secretly cooperating with the Serbs behind the back of
the United Nations and NATO.
	   To strengthen the current political atmosphere in Bosnia, it
would be important for the masterminds of crime to be arrested,
Hajric said.
	   ``It would be a message to hundreds of thousands of refugees
that they can prepare themselves to go home,'' he said.
	   As long as war-criminals remain at large, no minority returns
are expected to occur in the areas they move around.
	   In last September's nationwide elections, the Bosnian Serbs
elected Nikola Poplasen, a Bosnian Serb ultranationalist who
cooperated with Karadzic and Mladic during the 1992-95 war, as
president of their half of Bosnia.
	   The move frustrated international agencies charged with the
implementing the peace agreed upon in the 1995 Dayton accord.
	   ``This would also be an important message to Nikola Poplasen
that would made him understand that his policy has come to an
end,'' Hajric stressed.
	   Speaking in the capital of the Bosnian Serb republic, Poplasen
criticized the arrest by NATO-led troops, better known as SFOR.
	   ``Unfortunately...SFOR went beyond its mandate in this arrest,''
Poplasen said. ``It happened in a drastic way, several more of his
(Krstic's) associates were also arrested and that is contrary to
procedure.''
	   He did not specify how many others were arrested, or what had
been done with them.
	   Poplasen was meeting late Wednesday with the Bosnian Serb
republic's defense body, which was expected to comment on Krstic's
arrest. Heading into the meeting, he said their stand on the issue
``will be based on clear support to the Dayton peace agreement.''

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ NATO forces on Wednesday arrested
the most senior Bosnian Serb military figure yet to be seized for
U.N. trial on genocide and war crimes charges.
	   Gen. Radislav Krstic was arrested in a section of northern
Bosnia controlled by U.S. troops serving in NATO's Stabilization
Force, better known as SFOR. The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal has
accused him of genocide, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions
and crimes against humanity.
	   SFOR spokeswoman Maj. Sheena Thomson said Krstic was arrested
without incident at noon and would be sent to The Hague for trial
on charge stemming from the wartime massacre of Muslims.
	   Tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour of Canada was delighted
at the arrest, calling Krstic ``a very significant military
leader.'' The tribunal had indicted him in October.
	   Arbour said Krstic's secret indictment covered offenses
allegedly committed following the rebel Serb takeover of the U.N.
safe haven of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia in July 1995, where
thousands of Muslims were massacred.
	   He is indicted for genocide, complicity to commit genocide,
extermination, murder, and persecution for his alleged personal
involvement in the atrocities and his command of troops carrying
out the massacres, the tribunal announced.
	   In a statement, Arbour said the arrest was ``very significant
for the continuing work of the tribunal.''
	   ``I'm very pleased that one of ... the executors of genocide,
the destruction of the entire population of a wider region of
Bosnia made it to The Hague,'' Amor Masovic, the head of the
Bosnian Muslim commission for missing people who has dealt the most
with mass graves and Srebrenica, told The Associated Press.
	   ``I expect his arrest to unveil important facts related to the
missing of more then 8,000 people from Srebrenica,'' Masovic said.
	   In Sarajevo, the Bosnian Muslim leadership welcomed the arrest
and expressed hope that NATO would now focus on apprehending the
key architects of the war.
	   ``We welcome this arrest and particularly the fact that they
have started arresting generals,'' Mirza Hajric, the adviser to
Bosnian Muslim member of the joint presidency, Alija Izetbegovic
said Wednesday. ``We hope they will soon switch over to
commanders,'' referring to former Bosnian Serb President Radovan
Karadzic and his wartime military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic, who also
have been indicted on genocide charges for allegedly masterminding
the massacre at Srebrenica.
	   But Petar Djokic, president of the Bosnian Serb parliament, said
Krstic's arrest on a secret indictment ``brings uncertainty to
people, a feeling that every citizen of Republika Srpska can be
regarded as a potential war criminal in the eyes of the tribunal,
and that SFOR is authorized to arrest anybody, anytime, anywhere.''
	   Republika Srpska is the Serb entity within Bosnia. Serbs account
for the vast majority of suspects publicly indicted by the U.N.
court.
	   Bosnian Serb President Nikola Poplasen accused SFOR of going
beyond its mandate in making the arrest.
	   ``It happened in a drastic way, several more of his (Krstic's)
associates were also arrested and that is contrary to the procedure
set in SFOR mandate regarding arresting war crimes suspects,''
Poplasen said.
	   He did not say what had happened to the other Serbs who were
arrested.
	   Krstic was the commander of the 5th Corps of the Bosnian Serb
Army. He is believed to be a close associate Karadzic and Mladic,
the tribunal's top two indicted suspects.
	   Krstic is the ninth war crimes suspect to be arrested in the
former Yugoslavia by international forces. He was named head of the
Drina Corps of the Bosnian Serb Army in 1995 after the fall of
Srebrenica.
	   Krstic recently appeared at a Bosnian Serb Army exercise, near
Banja Luka. SFOR banned his 5th Corps from taking part in the
exercise, but let him monitor it.

Defense leaders say U.S. lifting of weapons ban has not fueled arms
</HEADLINE>
race &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) _ The U.S. decision last year to lift a
ban on weapons sales to Latin America has not fueled a regional
arms buildup as originally feared, regional defense leaders said
Wednesday.
	   ``As we predicted, this measure was not going to cause an arms
race,'' Argentine Defense Minister Jorge Dominguez told reporters
after meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen at the
conclusion of a three-day meeting of defense ministers from around
the Americas.
	   In July 1997, U.S. President Bill Clinton lifted the 20-year-old
ban on U.S. sales of advanced weapons to Latin America, citing the
region's move from military dictatorship to democracy.
	   Critics at the time said the move would spur a South American
arms race, raising tensions in a region replete with border
conflicts and divert resources needed to fight some of the world's
most wrenching poverty.
	   Those fears have proven unfounded, officials said.
	   Chile's defense minister, Jose Florencio Guzman, said economic
recession in his country has forced it to shelve plans to purchase
as many as two dozen F-16 fighter jets.
	   Argentina's Dominguez said his country had no plans to acquire
sophisticated aircraft. He said, however, that discussions were
``very advanced'' with the United States on a purchase of Hummer
vehicles and TOW anti-tank missiles for use by Argentine
peacekeeping troops.
	   The peacekeepers will form part of a new United Nations
rapid-reaction force that will also include soldiers from Denmark,
Canada, Austria, and other countries, Dominguez said.
	   Cohen, who was accused of trying to sell U.S. weapons during a
1997 visit to Latin America, said the United States would carefully
evaluate requests by countries in the region on a case-by-case
basis.
	   In separate comments to reporters, Cohen said the United States
was not concerned that a possible trial of former Chilean dictator
Gen. Augusto Pinochet would reveal unflattering details of U.S.
involvement in destabilizing the elected government of Salvador
Allende, whom Pinochet ousted in a coup in 1973.
	   The 83-year old Pinochet is under house arrest in London while
he is fighting extradition to Spain on genocide and terrorism
charges.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli government reacted to a violent
West Bank attack Wednesday by halting the latest Mideast peace
accord until the Palestinians comply with a list of demands
including a promise to publicly abandon plans to declare a state in
May.
	   Palestinian officials rejected the demands outright and charged
that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was looking for
excuses to knock the peace process off track.
	   An Israeli government statement said its decision was prompted
in part by the attack on an Israeli soldier and civilian by an
angry Palestinian mob in the city of Ramallah in the West Bank
earlier Wednesday.
	   The decision came only 10 days before U.S. President Bill
Clinton was to arrive in the region to usher in stage two of the
Wye River land-for-security agreement he helped negotiate in
October.
	   The Israeli announcement that it was suspending further troop
withdrawals from the West Bank and implementation of the accord
raised questions about whether the Clinton trip could take place
while Israel was holding-up the agreement.
	   ``Mr. Netanyahu is trying to create a crisis before the arrival
of President Clinton. We consider his conditions unacceptable.
Every day he imposes new conditions, this is an attitude that must
not continue, it will not be tolerated,'' said senior Palestinian
official Saeb Erekat.
	   The conditions also drew a sharp reaction from the United
States. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin
said the Israeli troop withdrawals were obligations which Israel
must carry out. ``We do not think it is appropriate to add new
conditions,'' Rubin said. He also condemned the attack.

World Cup: Spain 21, Portugal 17
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ Andrei Kovalenko kicked Spain to the
rugby union World Cup finals with six penalties in a 21-17 victory
over Portugal Wednesday even though the beaten Portuguese scored
the only two tries of the match.
	   A drop goal from center Fernando Diez completed the Spanish
scoring at Murrayfield, the home of Scottish rugby, with his team
already leading 18-10 near the end.
	   Rohan Hofman then scored Portugal's second try to go with the
score from Thiery Teixeira earlier in the game.
	   Spain and Scotland, who hammered the Portuguese 85-11 on
Saturday, advance to the finals in October next year while Portugal
must face Uruguay in a playoff game.
	   Fly halves Teixeira and Kovalenko each kicked a penalty in the
opening three minutes, and the Spanish kicker edged his team ahead
6-3 before his team was down to 14 men.
	   Flank forward Jose Diaz was shown the yellow card for preventing
Portugal taking a quick penalty and, when he argued the decision
with English referee Steve Lander, he was shown the red one.
	   Four minutes later the Portuguese then took the lead with a try
he constructed himself with a net chip forward. He collected the
ball and touched down by the posts and followed up with a
conversion which put the Portuguese 10-6 ahead.
	   But the Spaniards turned the score around with Kovalenko kicking
two more penalties to give his team a 12-10 halftime lead.
	   He stretched that to 18-10 before the drop goal by Diez in the
final minute put the game beyond the Portuguese, despite the late
try by Hofman.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ The Israeli government said Wednesday
that it was suspending troop withdrawals until the Palestinians
comply with a list of demands that includes a promise to publicly
abandon plans to unilaterally declare statehood in May.
	   Palestinian officials rejected the demands outright and charged
that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was looking for
excuses to knock the peace process off track.
	   An Israeli government statement said its decision was prompted
in part by the attack on an Israeli soldier and civilian by an
angry Palestinian mob in the city of Ramallah in the West Bank
earlier Wednesday.
	   The decision came only 10 days before U.S. President Bill
Clinton was to arrive in the region to usher in stage two of the
Wye River land-for-security agreement he helped negotiate in
October.
	   The Israeli announcement that it was suspending further troop
withdrawals from the West Bank and implementation of the accord
raised questions about whether the Clinton trip could take place
while Israel was holding-up the agreement.
	   ``Mr. Netanyahu is trying to create a crisis before the arrival
of President Clinton. We consider his conditions unacceptable.
Every day he imposes new conditions, this is an attitude that must
not continue, it will not be tolerated,'' said senior Palestinian
official Saeb Erekat.
	   The conditions also drew a sharp reaction from the United
States. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin
said the Israeli troop withdrawals were obligations which Israel
must carry out. ``We do not think it is appropriate to add new
conditions,'' Rubin said. He also condemned the attack.
	   The attack in Ramallah overshadowed the stabbing death earlier
Wednesday of an Arab street cleaner in Jerusalem, apparently by an
Israeli extremist. During the funeral procession for Osama Natche,
a 41-year-old father of six, mourners torched an Israeli car and
stoned Israeli police who fired rubber bullets.
	   Hours later, rioting throughout traditionally Arab areas of
Jerusalem continued, with masked Palestinians throwing stones at
cars and blocking roads with burning tires. Jerusalem police
spokesman Shmuel Ben Ruby said five Palestinians were arrested for
throwing stones that shattered a bus window and injured the driver.
	   Israel and the Palestinian Authority blamed each other for the
violence.
	   The ambush of two motorists in Ramallah, captured by cameras,
was shown over and over on Israeli television, leading some
Israelis to wonder whether the Palestinian Authority was trying to
control violence, as it pledged to do in the U.S.-brokered Wye
River land-for-peace agreement.
	   In the attack, dozens of Palestinian university students waited
at a traffic circle, holding rocks and concrete slabs. They
screened cars. ``Wait, it's an Arab,'' one said of the driver in an
approaching car. ``A Jew,'' another said. Seconds later, a hail of
stones hit the vehicle.
	   A young Israeli soldier was dragged from the car and struck
repeatedly in the head with rocks as he held his hands up to defend
himself.
	   The political response was swift.
	   ``The bottom line is that there will be no further withdrawals
unless the Palestinian Authority lives up to all its commitments,''
said Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan.

Tight security at match amid Turkey-Italy dispute over rebel leader

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A politically charged, high-security
soccer match here brought together Italian and Turkish ministers
who reportedly made progress toward resolving a bitter dispute
between both countries over a Kurdish rebel leader.
	   Turkey and Italy have locked horns over the fate of Abdullah
Ocalan, who asked Rome for political asylum after he was detained
in Italy last month, and there were fears the political tensions
might spill onto the soccer field.
	   But the scoreless first half between top teams Juventus of Turin
and Galatasaray of Istanbul came off without any violence at the
stadium, where some 22,000 police officers were deployed for the
Champions League match. Military units were on standby.
	   Hundreds of police were on hand when Juventus arrived at the
Istanbul airport Wednesday. A small group of airport employees
tossed flowers at the team bus in greeting. But, as loyal home-team
fans, they also chanted ``Turkey, Turkey!''
	   The road from the airport to the team's hotel was closed to
traffic, but people standing along the route waved to the bus.
	   Turkey's leaders had called on Turks to be hospitable and
refrain from doing anything to mar the match. However, upbeat
soccer cheers were mixed with obscenities aimed at Juventus
players.
	   In a show of top-level support, Italy's ministers of foreign
trade, Piero Fassino, and of sports, Giovanna Melandri, went to
Istanbul for the game.
	   Just hours before the match, the two held talks with the Turkish
Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu and Sports Minister Yucel
Seckiner.
	   After the meeting, Denizkurdu said the ministers ``may have
found a way out,'' the Anatolia news agency reported. He did not
elaborate, but said he would relate the discussion to Turkey's
prime minister.
	   ``I believe the talks were very useful, they can be a departure
point to overcome the disagreements of the past few weeks,''
Fassino was quoted as saying by Anatolia.

Aussie skier spends hectic summer after Olympic medal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CLARK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN, California (AP) _ Zali Steggall's summer was
hectic, crammed with media requests and personal appearances.
	   She treasured every moment.
	   ``I was definitely Australia's sweetheart for a while,''
Steggall said after claiming a bronze medal in the slalom in the
Winter Olympics at Nagano, Japan. It was Australia's first Olympic
Alpine medal.
	   ``It was amazingly big, which was fun,'' she said. ``Australia
is used to getting a lot of medals in the summer Olympics and the
public gets quite picky and only expects golds.
	   ``When it came to the Winter Olympics, I think Australia got
behind the fact that all of a sudden they had a medal in such a
traditional winter sport as skiing, which we've been in for decades
but hadn't come close yet.''
	   Steggall was thrilled with the reception.
	   ``I got a nice response,'' she said. ``I live in Manley, a beach
suburb of Sydney, and to have people come up to you and say
congratulations at the beach is fun.
	   ``It made it busier, but also more interesting. When you've been
struggling for six, seven years to get to the top and you finally
do, and with it comes more attention and more things to do and more
responsibilities, I always had looked forward to that. So in many
ways I enjoyed being busier. If you get to the top, get great
results, then have complete anonymity, it's a bit sad.
	   ``It's tough when you get to something like an Olympics where
there's so much pressure, and on top of that we only had, I think,
23 athletes from Australia and only about three people with a
chance of a token result. So it means the whole team, the media,
the coaches, everybody is looking at you and counting on you. That
means added pressure.
	   ``And ski racing is the kind of sport where you can't guarantee
you're going to cross the finish line. I remember the world
championships the year before, I had only one race and I fell in
the first run, before I even got to the intermediate. That showed
me the other end of the spectrum, of how bad it can feel.''
	   The Olympic medal wasn't a fluke for Steggall, who won the
season-opening race at Park City, Utah, and followed with three
other top-10 placings on the way to a final slalom standing of
ninth.
	   ``I was happy with my whole season last year,'' she said.
``There were a few up-and-down races, but on the whole it was a
very satisfying year.''
	   She opened this season with a solid seventh at Park City, a
result that showed her she's still among the best in the world and
capable of winning races. She has another opportunity Thursday in a
slalom at this resort in the Sierras.
	   Steggall spent 10 years in France as a youngster, growing up
racing in the French development system. She left France in 1989
and struggled for years to maintain her enthusiasm while Australia
put together an Alpine program from scratch to support her.
	   ``It meant that I had to dig deep to keep motivated, to keep
coming back every year,'' she said. ``I always felt that given the
right circumstances and support I could do it, and I guess I showed
it last year.''
	   There's another Olympic-sized goal this season, the world
championships at Vail, Colorado beginning Jan. 31. She'll use the
same strategy as she did for Nagano, taking a week off to go home
and recharge her batteries.
	   ``It's difficult to go home, though, because it's so much of a
change,'' Steggall said. ``You're going from altitude to sea level,
you're going from mid-winter to mid-summer, the temperature change
is huge, then you've got 10 hours jet lag.
	   ``But the physical drawbacks are completely outweighed by the
mental advantage that you get from getting that break. It worked
last year.''

U.N. Secretary-General to go to Libya after Tunis visit

 &UR; Precedes ALGIERS &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to show Annan in Tunis; adds background on Annan
considering Tripoli visit &QL; 
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) _ Secretary General Kofi Annan said
Wednesday he was extending his North African tour to include talks
with Libyan authorities.
	   The remark was made without elaboration at a news conference in
Algiers hours before his arrival in Tunis, his final scheduled stop
on a tour aimed at unblocking plans for a U.N. referendum on the
disputed Western Sahara.
	   During his visit to Tunis, Annan is to meet with authorities
here to discuss ``major regional and international issues and the
various initiatives aimed at solving unresolved problems,''
according to the local press.
	   A Western diplomat, speaking in Algiers on condition of
anonymity, said Annan would travel to Libya on Saturday to meet
with authorities there on the 1988 Pan Am bombing that has led to
U.N. sanctions against Libya.
	   Annan's trip to Tunisia is scheduled to end Friday, according to
the official program. The discrepancy in the timing could not be
immediately clarified.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions in 1992, including a
flight ban, to try to force Libya to hand over two suspects in the
bombing that killed 270 people.
	   The sanctions ban flights to and from the country. Neighboring
Tunisia provides a land route for those traveling to Libya from the
region.
	   A week ago, before leaving for North Africa, Annan held out the
possibility of a Libyan trip -- but only to help close a deal to
try the two suspects.
	   A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's
legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the
suspects in the Netherlands according to Scottish law and using
Scottish judges.
	   Annan had said last week that he had hoped for a breakthrough in
the case by the end of November. He said then that a trip to Libya
``to bring the issue finally to closure ... has not been
excluded.''

Five firefighters die in forest blaze near Ballarat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Five volunteer firefighters died
overnight battling Victoria state's first major forest fire of the
summer season, officials said Thursday,
	   The five, all from the Geelong area, were killed as they fought
to protect the small country town of Linton, near Ballarat. It is
not yet known how they became caught in the fire.
	   It was the single biggest loss of lives for the Country Fire
Authority since Victoria's Ash Wednesday bushfires of Feb. 16,
1983, when 75 people were killed in Victoria and South Australia.
	   Country Fire Authority spokesman Trevor Roche said the tragedy
was hard felt.
	   ``The death of these firefighters is really a tragic
circumstance for the CFA,'' Roche told reporters Thursday morning.
	   ``It has devastated our members and our friends but also anyone
who is associated or has been associated with the CFA.
	   ``I mean no one can imagine a worse start to any fire season
than this.''
	   Police said names of the victims would not be immediately
released as they were yet to be positively identified.
	   More than 300 firefighters, 42 fire trucks and five aircraft
battled Wednesday's fire.

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Substitute Suat Kaya headed in the
equalizer in injury time Wednesday to lift Turkey's Galatasaray
into a 1-1 draw with Italy's Juventus in a politically tinged
Champions League match that came off without a hitch.
	   The clubs' countries are locked in a dispute over the fate of
Abdullah Ocalan, a Kurdish rebel leader arrested in Rome who has
asked for political asylum.
	   Fears the tensions might spill onto the soccer field resulted in
postponement of the game for a week and extra security measures
Wednesday.
	   Kaya's goal, from steps away off a free kick, ended a late
flurry of offense from Galatasaray after Juventus had taken a 1-0
lead with 12 minutes to go on Nicola Amoruso's goal.
	   Amoruso, who entered the game in the 66th minute, fired French
playmaker Zinedine Zidane's lobbed cross from the left flank
between Galatasaray's Brazilian 'keeper Claudio Taffarel and the
near post.
	   The goal silenced the crowd of 23,000, barely outnumbering the
police officers present at Ali Sami Yen Stadium. Officers in riot
gear escorted the players and officials off the field after the
final whistle.
	   Authorities had also said they worried about a provocation by
the rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, aimed at
staining Turkey's image.
	   Such concerns led European soccer's governing body, UEFA, to put
off the match, originally slated for last Wednesday.
	   But while obscenities directed at Juve's players and chants of
``Down with PKK! Down with Italy!'' echoed through the stadium,
there was no real unruliness, much less violence.
	   Juventus was to leave Istanbul immediately after the game. The
club flew in just hours before the match, in defiance of UEFA rules
requiring clubs to arrive the day before a game.

Spectaular Ginola goal as Spurs oust Manchester United from League
</HEADLINE>
Cup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Chris Armstrong's two goals and a spectacular
strike by David Ginola fired Tottenham to a 3-1 victory over
Manchester United Wednesday as Spurs made it to the semifinal of
the League Cup by beating a United lineup missing nine rested
stars.
	   With his team facing Premier League leader Asto Villa on
Saturday and the Bayern Munich in the final round of Champions
League group games next Wednesday, United manager Alex Ferguson
left out many of his starters, even for a cup quarterfinal. Only
Gary Neville and Nicky Butt started even though there was a return
after a long injury of Ryan Giggs.
	   After a goal-less first half at White Hart Lane, Armstrong fired
Spurs ahead three minutes into the second half.
	   The second goal came seven minutes when Ginola sent over a cross
from the left and Armstrong left his marker to steer the ball home.
	   United hit back when former Spurs striker Teddy Sheringham
headed a goal in the 71st minute.
	   But Ginola made sure United was ousted from the competition when
he collected the ball two meters outside the area and fired home
left footed shot five minutes from the end.
	   In another quarterfinal, Leicester, who won the title two
seasons ago, downed Blackburn Rovers 1-0. Neil Lennon netted the
winner in the 67th minute with a downward header from Robbie
Savage's cross.
	   The other quarterfinals were on Tuesday when Wimbledon downed
defending titlist Chelsea 2-1 and Sunderland, the Division One
leader, overwhelmed Division Two Luton 3-0.

Iraq fails to meet deadline to hand over document to inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq asked the United Nations to denounce
the United States for its acts of aggression and ``flagrant
interference'' in Baghdad's internal affairs, according to a U.N.
document released Wednesday.
	   Iraq's Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf called on the
Security Council to assume its responsibility under the U.N.
Charter and ask the United States to refrain from any threats or
action against Iraq or its people.
	   Iraq agreed to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors
as the United States and Britain prepared to launch airstrikes on
Nov. 14.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton decided the following day to give
Iraq a last chance, but he left no doubt the United States would
attack if Baghdad didn't fully cooperate _ and he called for the
overthrow of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
	   In a letter dated Nov. 30, al-Sahhaf said the United States had
now made clear that its aim was not to ensure Iraqi compliance with
U.N. resolutions but ``to kill civilians and destroy Iraq's
industrial, defense and security infrastructure in order to
destabilize the country internally.''
	   This would have permitted the U.S. government ``to put into
effect its plan to overthrow the government of Iraq,'' he said.
	   Al-Sahhaf also accused the United States of threatening ``to use
its most destructive weapons to destroy all of Iraq, without any
regard for the fate that would befall the millions of Iraqis.''
	   He cited U.S. ``acts of aggression'' dating back to 1991,
including the bombing of military and civilian sites and the
imposition of no-fly zones.
	   Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon, who transmitted the letter
to the Security Council, said Wednesday he had not received a
response to al-Sahhaf's request that the council convene a meeting
to discuss its charges against the United States.
	   ``This is what we hope,'' Hamdoon said. ``This is what we
want.''
	   The foreign minister addressed the letter to the Security
Council president, a post which rotated on Dec. 1 from Deputy U.S.
Ambassador Peter Burleigh to Bahrain's Ambassador Jassim Mohammed
Buallay.
	   Whether the Iraqis get a better hearing with Bahrain in the
president's chair remains to be seen.
	   Bahrain was part of the U.S.-led coalition that drove Iraqi
forces out of Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf War and the two countries
have not exchanged any official visits since the conflict. But
Bahrain has often sent humanitarian aid to Iraq.
	   Bahrain is home to the largest U.S. naval base in the region,
the 5th Fleet. It also hosts the regional headquarters for the U.N.
weapons inspectors, known as UNSCOM.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
chemical, nuclear and biological weapons and long-range missiles
before the Security Council will lift sweeping sanctions imposed
after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   UNSCOM's executive director Richard Butler, who met with French
officials in Paris on Wednesday, described Iraq's cooperation in
recent weeks as ``satisfactory,'' according to Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
	   Butler's assessment of Iraqi compliance will be crucial to the
council's determination on whether to proceed with a comprehensive
review of Baghdad's compliance with U.N. resolutions. Iraqi leaders
say they expect the review to lead to the lifting of oil sanctions
_ but the United States insists there is no link.
	   Butler has been trying to get documents on weaponry from Iraq
and asked Iraq twice for an air force account of chemical munitions
used from 1983-88 during the Iran-Iraq war.
	   Iraq failed to meet Butler's target date to hand over the air
force account by Monday. Iraq's Deputy Foreign Minister Riyadh
al-Qaisi on Tuesday reiterated Baghdad's earlier position _ that
inspectors could review ``relevant portions'' of the document in
the presence of Annan's special envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah.

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A politically charged, high-security
soccer match here brought together Italian and Turkish ministers
who reportedly made some progress toward resolving a bitter dispute
between both countries over a Kurdish rebel leader.
	   Turkey and Italy have locked horns over the fate of Abdullah
Ocalan, who asked Rome for political asylum after he was detained
in Italy last month, and there were fears the political tensions
might spill onto the soccer field.
	   But the match between top teams Juventus of Turin and
Galatasaray of Istanbul came off without any violence at the
stadium, where some 22,000 police officers were deployed for the
Champions League game, which ended in a 1-1 tie. Military units
were on standby.
	   Hundreds of police were on hand when Juventus arrived at the
Istanbul airport Wednesday. A small group of airport employees
tossed flowers at the team bus in greeting. But, as loyal home-team
fans, they also chanted ``Turkey, Turkey!''
	   The road from the airport to the team's hotel was closed to
traffic, but people standing along the route waved to the bus.
	   Turkey's leaders had called on Turks to be hospitable and
refrain from doing anything to mar the match. However, upbeat
soccer cheers were mixed with obscenities aimed at Juventus players
on the field.
	   In a show of top-level support, Italy's ministers of foreign
trade, Piero Fassino, and of sports, Giovanna Melandri, went to
Istanbul for the game.
	   Just hours before the match, the two held talks with the Turkish
Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu and Sports Minister Yucel
Seckiner.
	   After the meeting, Denizkurdu said the ministers ``may have
found a way out,'' the Anatolia news agency reported. He did not
elaborate, but said he would relate the discussion to Turkey's
prime minister.
	   ``I believe the talks were very useful, they can be a departure
point to overcome the disagreements of the past few weeks,''
Fassino was quoted as saying by Anatolia.
	   The Italian news agency AGI quoted Melandri as saying: ``we had
a way to explain that Italy could find a solution to the Ocalan
affair but in respect for the laws of the Constitution that doesn't
allow extradition to a nation where capital punishment is
practiced.''
	   Italy doesn't have the death penalty while Turkey, which has
accused Ocalan of terrorism, does.
	   Earlier in the day, Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema said in Rome
that Italy would consider a trial in an impartial country if its
proposal for an international tribunal to judge Ocalan isn't
feasible. An Italian trial for Ocalan was also suggested as a way
out.

Castro says he's willing to meet pope on upcoming trip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro said Wednesday he
would be pleased to welcome Pope John Paul II to Cuba again when
the pontiff travels to Mexico next month, though no such visit has
been planned.
	   ``A visit by the pope would always be welcome,'' Castro told
reporters.
	   Castro said he heard rumors that the pope might consider
visiting Cuba during his upcoming travels, but said there was no
official plan for such a stop.
	   The pope is scheduled to travel to Mexico on Jan. 22 and then to
St. Louis on Jan. 26 before returning to Rome.
	   John Paul visited Cuba in January of this year.

Prison riot in Puerto Rico injures 27
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PONCE, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Inmates at one of Puerto Rico's
largest prisons attacked guards with stones and sticks during a
riot Wednesday that eventually was quelled with tear gas.
	   Ten guards and 17 inmates were injured, none seriously, at Las
Cucharas prison in southern Ponce. Police said they were unsure
what provoked the violence.
	   The riot occurred in the main section of the prison, which holds
between 200 and 300 of the complex's 6,000 inmates, said police Lt.
Col. Hector Luis Rodriguez. Police ringed the prison during the
riot to prevent escapes.
	   Puerto Rico's prisons have been plagued by riots, gang violence
and a lack of staff, prompting a court-appointed monitor to
recommend last year that the prison system be put under a federally
supervised receivership. The Puerto Rican government is arguing in
court that this is unnecessary.

Wolfsburg beats third-division team to reach semifinals

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with later results &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Two goals by Polish striker Andrzej
Juskowiak and one by American midfielder Claudio Reyna gave
Wolfsburg a 3-1 victory Wednesday over third-division Siegen and a
place in the semifinals of the German Cup.
	   Wolfsburg, one of the hottest Bundesliga teams at the moment,
reached the semifinals for the second time since 1995.
	   Werder Bremen, another first division team, also advanced by
beating TeBe Berlin 2-1 in extra time, while second-division
Oberhausen upset Borussia Moenchengladbach 2-0.
	   Juskowiak brought his season goal total to 13 by scoring in the
sixth and 45th minute. Reyna, who has been struggling to preserve
his place in the starting lineup, added the third in the 63rd.
	   Wolfsburg is now undefeated in 11 consecutive games.
	   Lithuanian midfielder Roman Cirba scored in the 22nd for Siegen,
which had eliminated one first-division and two second-division
teams from the competition.
	   A goal by Polish substitute Pavel Wojtala in the 108th minute
capped Bremen's comeback against second-division TeBe Berlin.
	   Norway's Harvard Flo clinched the extra time for Bremen by
equalizing four minute before the end of regulation time. Creso
Kovacec had given the Berlin team the lead in the 10th minute.
	   Bremen reached the semifinals for the 14th time, equaling
Schalke's record.
	   Goals by Lars Toborg and Achim Weber in the last 20 minutes gave
Oberhausen the upset victory over struggling first-division
Borussia Moenchengladbach.
	   On Tuesday, Bundesliga leader and cup holder Bayern Munich
crushed slumping VfB Stuttgart 3-0 in the subfreezing Olympic
stadium on goals by Carsten Jancker, Mario Basler and Alexander
Zickler.
	   The defeat could hasten the end of coach Winfried Schaefer's
reign in Stuttgart, which is now without a win in six games, with
four defeats
	   German media reports say Stuttgart players are rebelling against
the unpopular coach, who is also detested by fans.
	   Schaefer denied knowledge of a reported poll by Stuttgart
players, who allegedly voted 25-0 against the coach.
	   But Schaefer dropped Bulgarian star midfielder Krasimir Balakov
from the rosters, while starting striker Fredi Bobic only came on
in the second half-time against Bayern.
	   Schaefer said Bobic was in poor form, but the on-and-off
international immediately assailed the coach.
	   ``You can do this with an 18-year-old, but not with Fredi
Bobic,'' Bobic said.
	   ``That's exactly the problem of Stuttgart,'' Schaefer countered.
``He should have said that he deserved to be benched because he
hasn't performed well.''
	   ``The players blab into microphones instead of checking their
performances on the field,'' Schaefer said.

ISTANBUL: a game.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The result leaves Galatasaray tied atop the group with Norway's
Rosenborg. Both have 8 points with one rotation left before the
quarterfinals.
	   Juventus has tied all five of its games for 5 points and now
needs a win against Rosenborg coupled with a Galatasaray loss to
Spain's Athletic Bilbao next week.
	   Galatasaray reacted well after Amoruso's score.
	   First, the hosts produced a one-on-one chance for Hakan Unsal,
but reserve Juve 'keeper Michelangelo Rampulla _ who replaced
starter Angelo Peruzzi, a victim of leg cramps, in the 59th _
blocked the shot with eight minutes left.
	   Four minutes later, Juve defender Alessandro Birindelli cleared
off the line an errant clear attempt after Rampulla fumbled the
rain-slicked ball.
	   Winger Okan Buruk had nearly scored for Galatasaray in the 70th,
when a napping Juventus defense left him all alone to strike from
15 meters (yards), but Rampulla dove to his right to deflect the
dangerous shot.
	   A lackluster first half saw little initiative from either side,
and most of Juve's surges forward were stopped by the hosts'
effective offsides trap.
	   The Italians have had trouble scoring since star striker
Alessandro Del Piero went down with knee ligament damage. Juve has
gone three straight Serie A games without a goal.
	   Juve midfielder Antonio Conte sent a long blast off the mark in
the 20th minute, and center back Ciro Ferrara's glancing header
flew wide of the post after Taffarel failed to punch away a corner
kick in the 40th.
	   Galatasaray's offense ran through Romanian veteran Gheorge Hagi,
but his play, while pretty, rarely produced concrete chances.
	   Italian Sports Minister Giovanna Melandri and her Turkish
counterpart, Yucel Seckiner, both attended the game.
	   Before the match, police searched spectators for weapons or
items like loose change that could be hurled onto the field. Even
umbrellas and mobile phones were not allowed.
	   Some fans tossed objects from the stands, but police appeared to
block everything.

Angola's government, former rebels accused of planting new mines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angola's government and the former rebel
group UNITA have been planting new land mines, causing a sharp rise
in casualties, several non-governmental organizations said
Wednesday.
	   In a letter addressed to both sides, four organizations said 18
people had died and 36 were wounded in explosions during the past
two months in the eastern province of Moxico, about 560 miles (900
kilometers) southeast of the capital, Luanda.
	   The letter sent by the Jesuit Refugee Service, Mines Advisory
Group, Medico International and Vietnam Veterans of America
Foundation said the total number of mine victims this year is 91,
including 40 soldiers.
	   The groups added that the toll hadn't been so high since 1994,
when a U.N.-brokered peace deal was signed to end a two-decade-long
civil war.
	   A recent surge in tension between the government and UNITA has
triggered fears that the country is sliding back to war.
	   Angola is thought to have between 9 million and 20 million mines
concealed in its soil, making it one of the world's most mined
countries.

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Police on Thursday announced they
were looking for a 43-year-old man suspected of masterminding
Australia's biggest terrorist campaign, the mailing of at least 25
letter bombs to tax officials.
	   Australian Tax Office staff nationwide were put on alert
Wednesday after more than 20 explosive parcels were found addressed
to present and former tax office staff.
	   The alert was issued after an early morning letter bomb
explosion Wednessday at a Canberra mail center slightly injured two
postal workers who were hit by bits of plastic shrapnel.
	   Another 21 explosive parcels were found at the mail center,
while at least two more of the potentially lethal devices had been
found posted to homes in Sydney, and one in Melbourne.
	   The man sought by police was believed to be driving a blue 1985
Toyota Corona sedan with Canberra license plates.
	   Police issued a statement: ``Concerns are held for the well
being of the occupant and safety of the public and it is important
that the vehicle be located as soon as possible.''
	   Police were concerned more letter bombs could still be on their
way to past and present tax officials, sent by what they believe to
be a disgruntled, disturbed person. Police were investigating a
common link between all addressees.
	   Tax Commissioner Michael Carmody said the vast bulk of the
letter bombs were directed at present or former tax office staff.
	   Sources close to the investigation said the matter related to a
personal dispute.
	   The ATO has taken steps to protect its employees and a national
memo to its 17,000 staff warned: ``Please ensure that your families
and others likely to open your mail are informed immediately.''
	   The bombs are in white parcels about the size of a five
computer-disk package.
	   The bombs are designed to explode when opened, although the
device which exploded at the Canberra Mail Center went off when it
was thrown into a sorting basket, slightly injuring the workers.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's central government ordered the arrest of
a prominent democracy campaigner and may use his contacts with
exiled Chinese dissidents to charge him with harming national
security, a colleague said Wednesday.
	   Two Beijing police officers spent 30 minutes telling Zha Jianguo
to stop trying to set up a political opposition party. Underscoring
the warning, they said his colleague, Xu Wenli, won't be released
soon and may be charged for having links to ``reactionary groups,''
Zha said.
	   Xu and another influential dissident, Qin Yongmin, were arrested
Monday night in police raids in two cities that delivered the
sternest blow so far to a five-month campaign to establish the
China Democracy Party and challenge the ruling Communist Party's
monopoly on power.
	   Qin was arrested for plotting to overthrow the government, a
crime that could land him in jail for life. A third Democracy Party
advocate, Wang Youcai, already in custody for a month, was also
formally arrested Monday although his family has not been informed
of the charges.
	   Zha, who helped Xu organize would-be party members in Beijing
and the nearby port of Tianjin, said police officers told him Xu's
arrest was ordered by the central government, not Beijing police.
	   He took the police reference to ``reactionary groups'' to mean
exiled dissidents in the United States. Under China's vague State
Security Law, such links may also be punishable by up to life in
prison.
	   Zha pledged to work with dissidents in China and exiles in the
United States to campaign ``to save Xu Wenli.''
	   On Wednesday, 190 dissidents from around the country demanded in
an open letter that the government release Xu, Qin and Wang Youcai,
saying the arrests run counter to U.N. human rights treaties China
has signed over the past 14 months.
	   The authorities ``are deceiving and cheating international
public opinion while on the other hand they are suppressing and
persecuting domestic political dissidents,'' said the letter faxed
to foreign news agencies.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the
United States deplored the detention and arrests of Xu and Qin.
	   ``We believe the peaceful political activities of this kind and
other forms of peaceful expression that they've been involved in
are fundamental human rights that should be protected by all
governments,'' Lockart said. ``We call on the Chinese government to
assure the protection in these cases of Mr. Xu and Mr. Qin.''
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said U.S. officials
conveyed their concerns to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and urged that Xu be released immediately.
	   U.S. officials received confirmation Wednesday that Xu is being
detained on suspicion of ``having conducted activities damaging to
China's national security,'' Rubin said.
	   He said he had no information from Chinese authorities about Qin
or Wang.
	   Two other democracy party supporters taken into custody in
central Wuhan city along with Qin _ Chen Zhonghe and Xiao Shichang
_ were released Wednesday morning, said He Xintong, Xu Wenli's
wife. She added that police questioned the pair about the party as
well as Qin's human rights monitoring organizations.
	   Qin and Xu are towering figures in China's persecuted dissident
community. Their activism dates to the seminal Democracy Wall
movement of the 1970s. Wang was a student leader in 1989's
influential Tiananmen Square democracy movement. All have spent
time in prison, Xu for 12 years, much of it in solitary
confinement.
	   Xu's wife said she does not know where he is being held and, in
her 20-year experience with the authorities, believes they are
unlikely to tell her.
	   Released in 1993, Xu picked up his campaigning for political
change soon after his parole ended last year. He has tried to use
China's nascent legal system and the international treaties it
signed to push for reform.
	   ``My husband is innocent and there's nothing he can be
criticized for,'' said his wife, He Xintong. ``They're going to
have to expend a lot of effort to make him a criminal.''

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The Bosnian Muslim
leadership has welcomed the arrest of a Bosnian Serb general
indicted for war-crimes and hopes NATO will soon accelerate efforts
to arrest the architects of the Bosnian War.
	   on Wednesday, NATO troops arrested Gen. Radislav Krstic on
charges of alleged involvement in massacres of Muslims that
occurred after his troops overrun the eastern enclave of Srebrenica
in summer 1995.
	   Krstic was arrested in the northern part of Bosnia in the sector
controlled by U.S. troops.
	   ``We welcome this arrest and particularly the fact that they
have started arresting generals,'' Mirza Hajric, the adviser to
Bosnian Muslim member of the joint presidency, Alija Izetbegovic
said Wednesday. ``We hope they will soon switch over to
commanders,'' referring to former Bosnian Serb President Radovan
Karadzic and military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic.
	   The arrest also brought to the surface tensions between the
Muslim-led government and the French, whom the Muslims accuse of
blocking efforts to apprehend leading suspects.
	   ``This could serve as a good example for the French troops who
have not yet arrested anybody and in who's region of control the
alleged civil and military commanders, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko
Mladic are still living,'' he said.
	   Karadzic and Mladic are the two main indictees on the list of
the International War-Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.
	   The Bosnian Muslims consider France as an obstacle to the arrest
of Bosnian Serb war-crimes suspects after the French government
turned town a request of the International Tribunal to allow it's
officers to testify in front of the court, a source close to the
Muslim leadership said.
	   So far three high ranking French officers were caught secretly
cooperating with the Serbs behind the back of the United nations
and NATO.
	   NATO-led French troops now control the eastern part of Bosnia
considered a ``heaven for war-criminals,'' said a source close to
the Muslim leadership.
	   ``We wonder how long this is going to go on with the French
here,'' he said.
	   Wednesday's action against Krstic was the first one to result in
the arrest of a more senior person in the Bosnian Serb military
structure and the first one related to the Srebrenica massacre in
which some 8,000 people went missing.
	   For the current political atmosphere in Bosnia, it would be
important for the masterminders of crime to be arrested, Hajric
said.
	   ``It would be a message to hundreds of thousands of refugees
that they can prepare themselves to go home,'' he said. While
war-criminals remain at large, no minority returns are expected to
occur in the areas they move around.
	   On last September's nationwide elections, the Bosnian Serbs
chose Nikola Poplasen, a Bosnian Serb ultranationalist for
president of their half of Bosnia, to the frustration of
international agencies charged with the implementation of peace.
	   ``This would also be an important message to Nikola Poplasen
that would made him understand that his policy has come to an
end,'' Hajric stressed.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Substitute Suat Kaya headed in the
equalizer in injury time Wednesday to lift Turkey's Galatasaray to
a 1-1 draw with Italy's Juventus in a politically tinged Champions
League match that came off without a hitch.
	   The clubs' countries are locked in a dispute over the fate of
Abdullah Ocalan, a Kurdish rebel leader arrested in Rome who has
asked for political asylum.
	   Fears the tensions might spill onto the soccer field resulted in
postponement of the game for a week and extra security measures
Wednesday.
	   Kaya's goal, from steps away off a free kick, ended a late
flurry of offense from Galatasaray after Juventus had taken a 1-0
lead with 12 minutes to go on Nicola Amoruso's goal.
	   Amoruso, who entered the game in the 66th minute, fired French
playmaker Zinedine Zidane's lobbed cross from the left flank
between Galatasaray's Brazilian 'keeper Claudio Taffarel and the
near post.
	   The goal silenced the crowd of 23,000, barely outnumbering the
police officers present at Ali Sami Yen Stadium. Officers in riot
gear escorted the players and officials off the field after the
final whistle.
	   Authorities had also said they worried about a provocation by
the rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, aimed at
staining Turkey's image.
	   Such concerns led European soccer's governing body, UEFA, to put
off the match.
	   But while obscenities directed at Juve's players and chants of
``Down with PKK! Down with Italy!'' echoed through the stadium,
there was no real unruliness, much less violence.
	   Juventus was to leave Istanbul immediately after the game. The
club flew in just hours before the match, in defiance of UEFA rules
requiring clubs to arrive the day before a game.
	   The result leaves Galatasaray (2-2-1) tied atop Group B with
Norway's Rosenborg. Both have 8 points with one rotation left
before the quarterfinals.
	   Juventus has tied all five of its games for 5 points and now
needs a win against Rosenborg coupled with a Galatasaray loss to
Spain's Athletic Bilbao next week.
	   Galatasaray reacted well after Amoruso's score.
	   First, the hosts produced a one-on-one chance for Hakan Unsal,

rain-slicked ball.
	   Winger Okan Buruk had nearly scored for Galatasaray in the 70th,
when a napping Juventus defense left him all alone to strike from
15 meters (yards), but Rampulla dove to his right to deflect the
dangerous shot.
	   A lackluster first half saw little initiative from either side,
and most of Juve's surges forward were stopped by the hosts'
effective offsides trap.
	   The Italians have had trouble scoring since star striker
Alessandro Del Piero went down with knee ligament damage. Juve has
gone three straight Serie A games without a goal.
	   Juve midfielder Antonio Conte sent a long blast off the mark in
the 20th minute, and center back Ciro Ferrara's glancing header
flew wide of the post after Taffarel failed to punch away a corner
kick in the 40th.
	   Galatasaray's offense ran through Romanian veteran Gheorge Hagi,
but his play, while pretty, rarely produced concrete chances.
	   Italian Sports Minister Giovanna Melandri and her Turkish
counterpart, Yucel Seckiner, both attended the game in a show of
political goodwill.
	   Before the match, police searched spectators for weapons or
items like loose change that could be hurled onto the field. Even
umbrellas and mobile phones were not allowed.
	   Some fans tossed objects from the stands, but police appeared to
block everything.

U.S. Olympic chief: Don't deprive clean athletes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The drive to rid sports of drugs should not keep
athletes who abide by the rules from getting the money they need to
train and compete, the president of the U.S. Olympic Committee said
Wednesday.
	   To make sure both goals were met, the USOC could contribute some
of its own money while rounding up funds from government and
private sources, including ``ethical pharmaceutical companies,''
committee chief Bill Hybl said.
	   He also said in an interview that the fight against drugs had
become a ``watershed event'' for the Olympic community worldwide.
	   The International Olympic Committee is considering a worldwide
crackdown on doping that would include a dlrs 25 million research
program for preventing and detecting drug use.
	   Dick Pound, an IOC vice president from Canada and head of the
commission to find a way to pay for the anti-drug program, has said
the money probably would come from the IOC's share of
multibillion-dollar television rights fees, which generally is
redistributed to athletes through national Olympic committees and
IOC training programs.
	   Although the USOC does not share in that redistribution, Hybl, a
member of Pound's panel, said he feared that such a financing plan
for the drug program would cut into sports development as an
``infringement on television revenues that accrue to athletes for
training and support.''
	   Stressing that the anti-drug fight was among the most important
Olympic issues, Hybl said alternative revenue sources should be
tapped, such as the dlrs 1 million pledged last week by the White
House for drug research. Similar grants could come from the
Department of Health and Human Services as part of public health
programs, and ``ethical pharmaceutical companies will certainly be
asked to participate,'' Hybl said.
	   ``They have the finest research labs in the world,'' the USOC
official said. ``They have firsthand knowledge through development
research. And they have the financial ability to be very helpful to
the USOC and its athletes.''
	   Hybl also said the USOC might be willing to put part of its dlrs
11.3 million anti-drug budget toward the IOC research. He said the
committee was looking for an ``active role'' in the international
program.
	   The USOC's executive committee will hear from Pound and other
Olympic and government officials at a special meeting in Chicago on
Jan. 9.

	   ROME (AP) _ If Rome's proposal for an international tribunal
fails, Italy would consider a trial in a third country for a
Kurdish rebel leader whose extradition is demanded by Turkey,
Premier Massimo D'Alema said Wednesday.
	   In any case, Italy is committed to seeing that Abdullah Ocalan,
detained at Rome's airport three weeks ago, has a ``fair'' trial,
D'Alema told the Camera of Deputies, which held debate over the
rebel leader's detention in Italy.
	   Right from the start, the Italian government refused to
extradite Ocalan because Turkey, which considers him a terrorist,
has the death penalty. Turkey's official request for Ocalan arrived
on Wednesday, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.

Iraq fails to meet deadline to hand over document to inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Annan's deputy chief of staff visiting Iraq;
TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq asked the United Nations to denounce
the United States for its acts of aggression and ``flagrant
interference'' in Baghdad's internal affairs, according to a U.N.
document released Wednesday.
	   Iraq's Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf called on the
Security Council to assume its responsibility under the U.N.
Charter and ask the United States to refrain from any threats or
action against Iraq or its people.
	   Iraq agreed to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors
as the United States and Britain prepared to launch airstrikes on
Nov. 14.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton decided the following day to give
Iraq a last chance, but he left no doubt the United States would
attack if Baghdad didn't fully cooperate _ and he called for the
overthrow of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
	   In a letter dated Nov. 30, al-Sahhaf said the United States had
now made clear that its aim was not to ensure Iraqi compliance with
U.N. resolutions but ``to kill civilians and destroy Iraq's
industrial, defense and security infrastructure in order to
destabilize the country internally.''
	   This would have permitted the U.S. government ``to put into
effect its plan to overthrow the government of Iraq,'' he said.
	   Al-Sahhaf also accused the United States of threatening ``to use
its most destructive weapons to destroy all of Iraq, without any
regard for the fate that would befall the millions of Iraqis.''
	   Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon, who transmitted the letter
to the Security Council, said Wednesday he had not received a
response to al-Sahhaf's request that the council convene a meeting
to discuss its charges against the United States.
	   ``This is what we hope,'' Hamdoon said. ``This is what we
want.''
	   The foreign minister addressed the letter to the Security
Council president, a post which rotated on Dec. 1 from Deputy U.S.
Ambassador Peter Burleigh to Bahrain's Ambassador Jassim Mohammed
Buallay.
	   Whether the Iraqis get a better hearing with Bahrain in the
president's chair remains to be seen.
	   Bahrain was part of the U.S.-led coalition that drove Iraqi
forces out of Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf War and the two countries
have not exchanged any official visits since the conflict. But
Bahrain has often sent humanitarian aid to Iraq.
	   Bahrain is home to the largest U.S. naval base in the region,
the 5th Fleet. It also hosts the regional headquarters for the U.N.
weapons inspectors, known as UNSCOM.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
chemical, nuclear and biological weapons and long-range missiles
before the Security Council will lift sweeping sanctions imposed
after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   UNSCOM's executive director Richard Butler, who met with French
officials in Paris on Wednesday, described Iraq's cooperation in
recent weeks as ``satisfactory,'' according to Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
	   Rolf Knutsson, deputy chief of staff to Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, will visit Iraq from Dec. 9-14 for a first-hand look at the
U.N. operation and talks with Annan's special envoy to Iraq,
Prakash Shah, a U.N. official said.
	   Butler's assessment of Iraqi compliance will be crucial to the
council's determination on whether to proceed with a comprehensive
review of Baghdad's compliance with U.N. resolutions. Iraqi leaders
say they expect the review to lead to the lifting of oil sanctions
_ but the United States insists there is no link.
	   Butler has been trying to get documents on weaponry from Iraq
and asked Iraq twice for an air force account of chemical munitions
used from 1983-88 during the Iran-Iraq war.
	   Iraq failed to meet Butler's target date to hand over the air
force account by Monday. Iraq's Deputy Foreign Minister Riyadh
al-Qaisi on Tuesday reiterated Baghdad's earlier position _ that
inspectors could review ``relevant portions'' of the document in
the presence of Shah.

World Bank still sees a risk of recession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The world economy still faces a substantial
risk that it could plunge into recession next year rather than
experience sluggish growth, the World Bank said Wednesday.
	   Events that could cause a slump, a new report said, include a
worsening recession in Japan, a loss of investor confidence that
could halt the flow of international capital to developing
countries, especially in Latin America, and a 20- to 30-percent
plunge in stock markets in wealthy nations.
	   The lending institution made these observations in its annual
economic roundup that focuses on the developing countries and their
experiences with the economic crises that began in Asia 17 months
ago and then spread to Russia and Latin America.
	   In addition to forecasting growth rates for developing
countries, the report also deals with why the crisis had such a
damaging effect, even in countries with sound economies, and
prevention of future shocks by the international community.
	   With the frequency and cost of global crises rising, remedies
need to be devised and applied swiftly, said Joseph Stiglitz, the
bank's chief economist.
	   ``When there is an isolated accident on the road, one tends to
blame the driver,'' Stiglitz said. ``But when accidents occur
repeatedly at the same bend in the curve one begins to suspect
something is wrong in the road.
	   ``This report is devoted to understanding precisely what is
wrong with the road and how we can make it safer, both for the
countries and especially the poorest within them and how best to
respond to the accidents that inevitably will occur.''
	   According to the report, growth in developing countries is
expected to diminish to 2 percent in 1998 from 4.8 percent in 1997,
the worst slowdown in 30 years for these nations.
	   ``Although 1999 is likely to be another year of slow growth in
developing countries their situation could improve in 2000 and
following years when their per capita growth could return to the
3.5 percent pace of recent years,'' the report said.
	   The report said that in Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand, the
three Asian countries hardest hit by the crisis, unemployment is
expected to more than triple, while the number of people forced
into poverty could reach 25 million in Indonesia and Thailand
alone.
	   These countries and some other economies in Asia are unlikely to
witness a revival of the booming growth rates they recorded earlier
in the decade.
	   ``Following their deep crisis, East Asian economies are unlikely
to return to their extremely rapid growth rates of the early 1990s
but recover to more moderately strong growth , with more reliance
on productivity gains and less on high investment,'' the bank said.
	   The report said world economic growth in 1998 is expected to be
1.8 percent this year, down from 3.8 percent in 1997 with only a
modest recovery to 1.9 percent in 1999.
	   But the report also includes a worst-case scenario that shows
the global economy displaying no growth in 1999, with contraction
in Japan and the United States offset only by a modest expansion in
Europe.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Slogans denouncing a Kurdish guerrilla
group mixed with upbeat soccer chants and obscenities at Ali Sami
Yen Stadium Wednesday during the politically charged Champions
League match between Galatasaray and Juventus of Turin, which ended
in a 1-1 tie and with no violence.
	   Around 22,000 police officers were deployed for the game amid
fears that angry Turkish fans might turn violent against the
Italians.
	   Military troops in camouflage outfits stood guard around the
stadium, and police used their shields to prevent possible flying
objects from reaching the field. After the game, as a precaution,
police in Ankara, the Turkish capital, blocked off a main street
leading to the Italian embassy with water canons.
	   In Istanbul, the crowd shouted obscenities at the tense-looking
Juventus players who began their warm-up on the ground less than an
hour before kick-off.

Mexico says decision to extend oil cut hinges on Venezuelan
</HEADLINE>
elections &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico will wait for the outcome of
Venezuela's elections and other key developments in other countries
before deciding whether to extend oil cuts beyond June 1999, Energy
Secretary Luis Tellez said Wednesday.
	   Tellez said the government wants to see whether whoever wins
Sunday's vote in Venezuelan will support output agreements made by
the current government.
	   ``I expect the new Venezuelan government will ratify the
agreement due to current price elasticity and weak demand,'' he
said.
	   The government said earlier it was willing to extend its
reduction in oil exports to the end of 1999 if members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, did the
same.
	   OPEC made no decision on extending oil cuts at its meeting in
Vienna last month.
	   Mexico agreed in June 1998 to reduce oil exports by 200,000
barrels a day to 1.64 million barrels a day under a deal with Saudi
Arabia and Venezuela.
	   Tellez said he expected low world oil prices to continue in the
near future for three main reasons: output expansion projects by
several large oil producers, including the launch of new oil wells
in the Caspian Sea and other maritime zones; new technologies for
exploration and production; and recent mergers and strategic
alliances between market participants.
	   He said those factors also will lead to expanded output after
the year 2000 by OPEC members mostly because Saudi Arabia, Kuwait
and Iran plan to open some energy sectors to foreign investment.
	   He said the Mexican government will continue its diplomatic
efforts to promote the recovery of world oil prices, and if OPEC
members decide to meet before their scheduled meeting in March,
that would signal they are willing to take new measures to support
oil prices.
	   OPEC president Algerian Oil Minister Youcef Yousfi, has called
for a summit of OPEC heads of state to discuss a long-term strategy
for the organization.
	   Tellez also said that despite the recent drop in oil prices, the
government plans no immediate changes to its forecast of an average
1999 export price of dlrs 11 per barrel.
	   The export price of Mexico's crude oil mix fell to lows of dlrs
7.60 per barrel following the OPEC meeting last month, but has
recovered slightly since then, he said.

Oil giant, cosmetics concern merge pharmaceuticals sectors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Elf Aquitaine, the oil giant, and L'Oreal, the
cosmetics concern, on Wednesday announced plans to merge their
pharmaceutical subsidiaries into a new company touted as the sixth
largest such group in Europe and among the top 20 worldwide.
	   A joint statement said the merger project was approved Wednesday
by the boards of directors of Elf Aquitaine and L'Oreal, which are
to merge their respective pharmaceutical subsidiaries, Sanofi and
Synthelabo.
	   The new group is to be named Sanofi-Synthelabo. it will be
listed on the Paris stock exchange.
	   Elf Aquitaine and L'Oreal will hold 35.1 percent and 19.4
percent, respectively, of the capital in the new group, and
approximately 45 percent and 25 percent, respectively, of the
voting rights.
	   The statement said that Sanofi-Synthelabo ``will have an
enhanced base to greatly increase its development in the U.S.
market.''
	   According to the statement, with pro-forma 1998 sales of 35
billion francs (about dlrs 6.3 billion), the new company would rank
sixth among European pharmaceutical firms and among the top 20
worldwide.
	   The statement quoted Elf Aquitaine Chief Executive Officer
Philippe Jaffre as saying the merger reflects the December 1996
decision by the Board of Directors to accelerate Sanofi's
development.
	   ``This merger with L'Oreal is an excellent outcome ...,'' the
statement quoted Jaffre as saying.

 &UR; Israel suspends movement in peace process over soldier beating

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli government reacted to a West Bank
ambush Wednesday by halting the latest Mideast peace accord until
the Palestinians comply with a list of demands, including a promise
to publicly abandon plans to declare a state in May.
	   Palestinian officials rejected the demands outright and charged
that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was looking for
excuses to knock the peace process off track.
	   An Israeli government statement said its decision was prompted
in part by the attack on an Israeli soldier and civilian by an
angry Palestinian mob in the city of Ramallah in the West Bank
earlier Wednesday.
	   The attack followed the stabbing death earlier Wednesday of an
Arab street cleaner in Jerusalem, apparently by an Israeli
extremist. During the funeral procession for Osama Natche, a
41-year-old father of six, mourners torched an Israeli car and
stoned Israeli police who fired rubber bullets.
	   Hours later, rioting throughout traditionally Arab areas of
Jerusalem continued, with masked Palestinians throwing stones at
cars and blocking roads with burning tires. Jerusalem police
spokesman Shmuel Ben Ruby said five Palestinians were arrested for
throwing stones that shattered a bus window and injured the driver.
	   The Israeli announcement that it was suspending further troop
withdrawals from the West Bank came 10 days before U.S. President
Bill Clinton was to arrive in the egion to usher in stage two of
the Wye River land-for-security agreement he helped negotiate in
October.
	   The announcement raised questions about whether the Clinton trip
could take place while Israel was holding up the agreement.
	   ``Mr. Netanyahu is trying to create a crisis before the arrival
of President Clinton. We consider his conditions unacceptable.
Every day he imposes new conditions, this is an attitude that must
not continue, it will not be tolerated,'' said senior Palestinian
official Saeb Erekat.
	   The conditions also drew a sharp reaction from the United
States. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin
said the Israeli troop withdrawals were obligations which Israel
must carry out. ``We do not think it is appropriate to add new
conditions,'' Rubin said. He also condemned the attack on the
Israeli soldier.
	   Fresh from a demonstration calling on Israel to release
Palestinian prisoners, dozens of Palestinian university students
armed with rocks and slabs of concrete staked out a traffic circle
Wednesday at an entrance to Ramallah in the West Bank.
	   As a car with Israeli license plates approached driven by a man
wearing a skullcap and carrying a soldier in its passenger seat,
the crowd began to shout ``Yahudi, yahudi,'' _ Arabic for Jew _ and
seconds later began pelting the car with stones and smashing its
windows.
	   The Israeli driver fled from the moving car after a large rock
broke the side window and just missed his head. The young Israeli
soldier was dragged out of the car and, as he cowered on the
pavement and raised his hands defensively, was struck repeatedly on
the head with rocks.
	   Captured by cameras, the attack was shown over and over on
Israeli television, making some Israelis wonder whether the
Palestinian Authority was trying to control violence as it pledged
in the latest accord.
	   Israel and the Palestinian Authority blamed each other for the
violence.
	   Netanyahu issued a statement saying ``The Palestinian Authority
is encouraging acts of violence, such as today's brutal attack in
Ramallah, in an attempt to pressure Israel with regard to the
matter of the prisoners.''
	   His senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said Israel would not allow
the peace process to continue under threats of violence. ``The
bottom line is that there will be no further withdrawals unless the
Palestinian Authority lives up to all its commitments.''
	   A statement from Netanyahu's office said the Palestinians must
acknowledge that Israel did not agree to release Palestinian
prisoners who have committed acts against Israel.
	   Israel also demanded that the Palestinian Authority announce
clearly that it is abandoning its intention to unilaterally declare
a Palestinian state, that it is committed to continuous
negotiations, and that it immediately stop acts of violence and
incitement and punish rioters.
	   On Tuesday, the Palestinian parliament speaker, Ahmed Qureia,
told protesters demanding that Israel release prisoners that they
had the backing of the Palestinian leadership, which ``is prepared
once again to throw stones in order to free the people.'' The
comments were specifically listed in the Israeli Cabinet decision
as an example of threats which ``must cease.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Netanyahu had raised
tensions by not releasing prisoners and continuing to expand Jewish
settlements.
	   In the Wye agreement, Israel promised to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank and release 750 Palestinian prisoners by
January. In a first stage last month, it withdrew from 2 percent of
the area and set free 250 prisoners, but most were criminals, not
those held for anti-Israeli activities as the Palestinian Authority
had expected.
	   Arafat raised the issue earlier this week with Clinton in
meetings with Washington, and Erekat said, Clinton promised to make
every effort to solve this issue.
	   About half of the 2,500 Palestinians held by Israel are members
of Arafat's Fatah faction and there has been growing anger in Fatah
ranks over the Palestinian Authority's failure to get detainees
released.
	   Jewish settlers, who oppose the latest peace deal, issued a
veiled threat of vigilantism following the attack. In a press
statement, settlers said if the Israeli army did not clamp a
closure barring Palestinians from leaving Ramallah, Jewish settlers
``will be forced to do it themselves. Failure to respond seriously
will encourage deeds of this kind as Clinton's visit draws near.''
	   Settler leader Ahron Dombe told The Associated Press, ``We don't
intend to allow Jews to be attacked without a response.'' Asked if
settlers were prepared to clash with Israeli troops over the
matter, he said, ``I hope we won't need to (but) I'm not ruling it
out as a possibility.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli government reacted to a West Bank
ambush Wednesday by halting the latest Mideast peace accord until
the Palestinians comply with a list of demands, including a promise
to publicly abandon plans to declare a state in May.
	   Palestinian officials rejected the demands outright and charged
that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was looking for
excuses to knock the peace process off track.
	   An Israeli government statement said its decision was prompted
in part by the attack on an Israeli soldier and civilian by an
angry Palestinian mob in the city of Ramallah in the West Bank
earlier Wednesday.
	   The attack followed the stabbing death earlier Wednesday of an
Arab street cleaner in Jerusalem, apparently by an Israeli
extremist. During the funeral procession for Osama Natche, a
41-year-old father of six, mourners torched an Israeli car and
stoned Israeli police who fired rubber bullets.
	   Hours later, rioting throughout traditionally Arab areas of
Jerusalem continued, with masked Palestinians throwing stones at
cars and blocking roads with burning tires. Jerusalem police
spokesman Shmuel Ben Ruby said five Palestinians were arrested for
throwing stones that shattered a bus window and injured the driver.
	   The Israeli announcement that it was suspending further troop
withdrawals from the West Bank came 10 days before U.S. President
Bill Clinton was to arrive in the egion to usher in stage two of
the Wye River land-for-security agreement he helped negotiate in
October.
	   The announcement raised questions about whether the Clinton trip
could take place while Israel was holding up the agreement.
	   ``Mr. Netanyahu is trying to create a crisis before the arrival
of President Clinton. We consider his conditions unacceptable.
Every day he imposes new conditions, this is an attitude that must
not continue, it will not be tolerated,'' said senior Palestinian
official Saeb Erekat.
	   The conditions also drew a sharp reaction from the United
States. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin
said the Israeli troop withdrawals were obligations which Israel
must carry out. ``We do not think it is appropriate to add new
conditions,'' Rubin said. He also condemned the attack on the
Israeli soldier.
	   Fresh from a demonstration calling on Israel to release
Palestinian prisoners, dozens of Palestinian university students
armed with rocks and slabs of concrete staked out a traffic circle
Wednesday at an entrance to Ramallah in the West Bank.
	   As a car with Israeli license plates approached driven by a man
wearing a skullcap and carrying a soldier in its passenger seat,
the crowd began to shout ``Yahudi, yahudi,'' _ Arabic for Jew _ and
seconds later began pelting the car with stones and smashing its
windows.
	   The Israeli driver fled from the moving car after a large rock
broke the side window and just missed his head. The young Israeli
soldier was dragged out of the car and, as he cowered on the
pavement and raised his hands defensively, was struck repeatedly on
the head with rocks.
	   Captured by cameras, the attack was shown over and over on
Israeli television, making some Israelis wonder whether the
Palestinian Authority was trying to control violence as it pledged
in the latest accord.
	   Israel and the Palestinian Authority blamed each other for the
violence.
	   Netanyahu issued a statement saying ``The Palestinian Authority
is encouraging acts of violence, such as today's brutal attack in
Ramallah, in an attempt to pressure Israel with regard to the
matter of the prisoners.''
	   His senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said Israel would not allow
the peace process to continue under threats of violence. ``The
bottom line is that there will be no further withdrawals unless the
Palestinian Authority lives up to all its commitments.''
	   A statement from Netanyahu's office said the Palestinians must
acknowledge that Israel did not agree to release Palestinian
prisoners who have committed acts against Israel.
	   Israel also demanded that the Palestinian Authority announce
clearly that it is abandoning its intention to unilaterally declare
a Palestinian state, that it is committed to continuous
negotiations, and that it immediately stop acts of violence and
incitement and punish rioters.
	   On Tuesday, the Palestinian parliament speaker, Ahmed Qureia,

Tyson's plea could land him in jail
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVE HERMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Just as his boxing career is getting back on
track, Mike Tyson faces a possible return to jail as he awaits word
on his fate from authorities in Maryland and Indiana.
	   The former heavyweight champion pleaded no contest Tuesday to
misdemeanor assault in Maryland stemming from a traffic accident in
August, a move that leaves him legally vulnerable on several
fronts:
	   He faces sentencing in Maryland early next year, and he also
could be put back in jail in Indiana, where he already has served
three years for rape and has less than four months left on
probation. In addition, Nevada authorities have the power to revoke
his newly granted boxing license.
	   Tyson is scheduled to fight Francois Botha on Jan. 16 in his
first bout since his boxing license was revoked for biting Evander
Holyfield's ears during a title match in June 1997.
	   A news conference will be held Tuesday in Los Angeles to
announce the Tyson-Botha bout in Las Vegas, according to a boxing
source who spoke on condition he not be identified.
	   Indiana authorities want to hear the terms of Tyson's sentencing
in Maryland before deciding if he violated probation.
	   Shelly Finkel, Tyson's boxing adviser, said he believed
sentencing will be ``in late January or early February.'' Mary
Moffett, supervisor of the traffic and criminal division of
Montgomery County (Maryland) District Court, said no sentencing
date has been set.
	   Tyson pleaded no contest to charges he kicked and punched two
drivers who were involved in a minor accident with Tyson's wife,
Monica, in the Washington suburb of Gaithersburg, Maryland on Aug.
31.
	   The two already have reached a settlement with Tyson to avoid a
civil suit. However, the prosecutor wants jail time on the criminal
charges.
	   The Maryland action will have a direct bearing on his status in
Indiana, where Tyson's probation is to expire in late March.
	   ``At the point that he is sentenced there, we would review the
case,'' spokeswoman Beverly Phillips of the Marion County
Prosecutor's Office said Wednesday.
	   Since Indiana law does not allow no-contest pleas, prosecutors
have to weigh the effect of Tyson's plea on his probation, Phillips
said.
	   Steve Johnson, executive director of the Indiana Prosecuting
Attorneys Council, said probation could be revoked even if Tyson
has not been convicted in Maryland.
	   ``Good behavior is always a condition of probation,'' Johnson
said. ``A no-contest plea would not necessarily preclude a
revocation of probation if evidence were brought to Judge
(Patricia) Gifford that a criminal act had occurred.''
	   Johnson said judges routinely warn offenders that they need not
be convicted of another offense to risk being sent back to jail.
	   Gifford, who presided at Tyson's 1992 trial, said the probation
office must await word from Maryland before it can review his
probation.
	   Telephone messages left Tuesday and Wednesday for George Walker,
Tyson's probation officer, were not returned.
	   Although Tuesday's plea was not an admission of guilt, Tyson
could face up to 20 years in prison _ 10 years on each count. He
also could be fined up to dlrs 5,000.
	   Tyson told the judge he didn't expect leniency or a lighter
sentence in return for the no-contest plea, and he was aware it
could affect his probation in Indiana.
	   Phillips said prosecutor Scott Newman had not yet heard from
authorities in Maryland.
	   ``I can't get into what-ifs at this point,'' Phillips said.
``The most I can say is once Maryland reaches a final disposition,
at that point we would review what action we're going to take.''
	   Tyson is undergoing psychiatric treatment, one of the conditions
that led to reinstatement of his boxing license by the Nevada
Athletic Commission in October.
	   At the time of the Holyfield bout in 1997, Indiana authorities
reviewed Tyson's probation but took no action.
	   The Nevada Athletic Commission could again revoke or suspend
Tyson's license to box in that state.
	   ``The commission certainly has a right to review that
information (from Maryland and Indiana),'' Kirk Hendrick, Nevada
deputy attorney general, said Wednesday. ``It has a right to
consider disciplinary action if what he's done brings discredit to
the sport of boxing.''
	   Hendrick said the commission's executive director or chairman
would have to ask that the panel hear new evidence before anything
could be done.

Government partners agree to work more closely after a week of
</HEADLINE>
disunity &QL; 
 &UR; By COLLEEN BARRY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ During a late meeting Wednesday to
curb growing signs of disunity between Germany's new governing
partners, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder agreed to work more closely
with his junior coalition partner, the Greens, by attending their
policy sessions.
	   Leaders of the Social Democrats and the environmental Greens met
as their 6-week-old government comes under increasing scrutiny for
apparently conflicting positions.
	   Denying a coalition crisis, the parties' leaders in parliament
described the mood in the meeting as relaxed and said the
gatherings would be a regular feature of the new government _
although the Social Democrats had previously resisted the idea.
	   Schroeder also agreed to lay out goals for 1999 in January, and
to follow up by attending working sessions not of only his party,
but also of the Greens, to work out the details. The unprecedented
arrangement was welcomed by Greens' parliamentary leader Rezzo
Schlauch.
	   Among the priorities for next year: raising government payments
to families with children, reforming the energy tax, and putting
more Germans to work by fostering government, industry and union
cooperation.
	   Though differences between the Social Democrats and the
sometimes dogmatic Greens were obvious from the start of their
government, conflicting goals have become increasingly evident in
the last week.
	   Schroeder was reportedly angered by a Greens' parliamentary
leader's call this weekend to raise the tax on gas well beyond the
6 pfennigs (3.5 cents) agreed to by both parties during coalition
talks.
	   Other examples of apparent disunity: A Greens politician's call
to lift the ban on the Kurdistan Workers Party Tuesday was promptly
rejected by Interior Minister Otto Schily.
	   And while Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping was meeting with
U.S. officials in Washington last week, Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer called on NATO to consider abandoning its doctrine allowing
a nuclear strike without first being targeted.
	   Scharping, a Social Democrat, tried to play down Fischer's
comments, as U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen dismissed the
proposal out of hand.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Fischer, who led anti-nuclear demonstrations
in the 1980s, and Scharping presented a united front to
parliamentary committees, committing Germany to whatever NATO
decides at an April meeting on overhauling its doctrine.
	   But there also has been discord within the Social Democrats. The
governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state, Wolfgang Clement, upset
fellow party members suggesting an increase in the value-added tax
as his party discusses ways to fulfill promises of easing the tax
burden on average wage-earners. Clement backed down from the
position after being called to a meeting by the chancellor.

Italy says Iran pledges efforts in fight against terrorism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Iran has pledged to work with Italy for better
understanding, including along the lines of international efforts
against terrorism, Italy's foreign ministry said Wednesday.
	   The ministry statement summed up a meeting between Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini and his Iranian counterpart, Kamal
Kharrazi, who had come to Italy for a forum on Italian-Iranian
relations.
	   The U.S. State Department considers Iran a sponsor of terrorism,
but the Clinton administration is trying to capitalize on what it
sees as a strain of moderation in Tehran.
	   Wednesday's talks between the Italian and Iranian allowed each
side to restate their commitment ``to develop dialogue and to
reinforce mutual comprehension, in line with the taking up by Iran
of positions constructive and in line with principles shared by the
international community, among them, the fight against terrorism
and the promotion of human rights,'' the italian communique said.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's Muslim leaders
cheered the arrest Wednesday of a Bosnian Serb general wanted for
war crimes_ with hopes the action sets a new trend.
	   NATO troops in northern Bosnia arrested Gen. Radislav Krstic,
charged with genocide and crimes against humanity in the 1995
massacre of Muslims fleeing Srebrenica.
	   Krstic is the most senior person wanted by the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal to be arrested so far. He is also the first one
related to the 1995 massacre at Srebrenica, in which some 8,000
people went missing.
	   ``We welcome this arrest _ particularly the fact that they have
started arresting generals,'' said Mirza Hajric, the adviser to
Bosnian Muslim member of the joint presidency, Alija Izetbegovic.
``We hope they will soon switch over to commanders.''
	   Krstic was arrested in the northern part of Bosnia, controlled
by U.S. troops. Most of the nine actions against alleged war
criminals by international forces have taken place in either in the
British or U.S. sectors.
	   Muslim leaders in Bosnia expressed hope NATO would now focus on
apprehending the key architects of the war, former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief Gen. Ratko
Mladic.
	   To strengthen the current political atmosphere in Bosnia, it
would be important for the masterminds of crime to be arrested,
Hajric said.
	   The State Department said the arrest served as a warning to
other suspects still at large.
	   ``All persons indicted for war crimes, including Radovan
Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, belong in The Hague in the custody of
the International Criminal Tribunal,'' State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin said.
	   In last September's nationwide elections, the Bosnian Serbs
elected Nikola Poplasen, a Bosnian Serb ultranationalist who
cooperated with Karadzic and Mladic during the 1992-95 war, as
president of their half of Bosnia.
	   The move frustrated international agencies charged with the
implementing the peace agreed upon in the 1995 Dayton accord.
	   ``This would also be an important message to Nikola Poplasen
that would made him understand that his policy has come to an
end,'' Hajric stressed.
	   Speaking in the capital of the Bosnian Serb republic, Poplasen
criticized the arrest by NATO-led troops, better known as SFOR.
	   ``Unfortunately...SFOR went beyond its mandate in this arrest,''
Poplasen said. ``It happened in a drastic way, several more of his
(Krstic's) associates were also arrested and that is contrary to
procedure.''
	   He did not specify how many others were arrested, or what had
been done with them.
	   Poplasen was meeting late Wednesday with the Bosnian Serb
republic's defense body, which was expected to comment on Krstic's
arrest. Heading into the meeting, he said their stand on the issue
``will be based on clear support to the Dayton peace agreement.''

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ NATO forces on Wednesday arrested
the most senior Bosnian Serb military figure yet to be seized for
U.N. trial on genocide and war crimes charges.
	   Gen. Radislav Krstic was arrested in a section of northern
Bosnia controlled by U.S. troops serving in NATO's Stabilization
Force, better known as SFOR. The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal has
charged him in the 1995 massacre of Muslim civilians fleeing
Srebrenica.
	   Krstic was ``a very significant military leader,'' said Louise
Arbour, chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal.
Arbour said she was delighted at the arrest of Krstic, who was
indicted in October on charges of genocide, grave breaches of the
Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity.
	   SFOR spokeswoman Maj. Sheena Thomson said Krstic was arrested
without incident and would be sent to The Hague tribunal for trial
on charges stemming from the wartime massacre of thousands of
Muslims who fled the U.N. safe haven of Srebrenica after it was
taken over by Serb rebels.
	   He was indicted for genocide, complicity to commit genocide,
extermination, murder, and persecution for his alleged personal
involvement in the atrocities and his command of troops carrying
out the massacres, the tribunal announced.
	   In a statement, Arbour, of Canada, said the arrest was ``very
significant for the continuing work of the tribunal.''
	   Amor Masovic, the head of a Bosnian Muslim commission unearthing
mass graves containing victims of the 3 1/2-year war, said he
expected the case to yield important facts related 8,000 people
still missing from Srebrenica.
	   ``I'm very pleased that one of ... the executors of genocide,
the destruction of the entire population of a wider region of
Bosnia made it to The Hague,'' he said.
	   In Sarajevo, the Bosnian Muslim leadership welcomed the arrest
and expressed hope that NATO would now focus on apprehending the
key architects of the war.
	   ``We welcome this arrest and particularly the fact that they
have started arresting generals,'' Mirza Hajric, the adviser to
Bosnian Muslim member of the joint presidency, Alija Izetbegovic
said Wednesday.
	   ``We hope they will soon switch over to commanders,'' referring
to former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic and his wartime
military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic, who also have been indicted on
genocide charges for allegedly masterminding the massacre at
Srebrenica.
	   The U.S. State Department also said the arrest served as a
warning to other suspects still at large.
	   ``All persons indicted for war crimes, including Radovan
Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, belong in The Hague in the custody of
the International Criminal Tribunal,'' State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin said.
	   But Petar Djokic, president of the Bosnian Serb parliament, said
Krstic's arrest on a secret indictment ``brings uncertainty to
people, a feeling that every citizen of Republika Srpska can be
regarded as a potential war criminal in the eyes of the tribunal,
and that SFOR is authorized to arrest anybody, anytime, anywhere.''
	   Republika Srpska is the Serb entity within Bosnia. Serbs account
for the vast majority of suspects publicly indicted by the U.N.
court.
	   Bosnian Serb President Nikola Poplasen accused SFOR of going
beyond its mandate in making the arrest.
	   ``It happened in a drastic way, several more of his (Krstic's)
associates were also arrested and that is contrary to the procedure
set in SFOR mandate regarding arresting war crimes suspects,''
Poplasen said.
	   He did not say what had happened to the other Serbs who were
arrested.
	   Krstic was the commander of the 5th Corps of the Bosnian Serb
Army. He is believed to be a close associate of former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief Gen. Ratko
Mladic, the tribunal's top two indicted suspects.
	   Both Karadzic and Mladic have been indicted for genocide for
allegedly masterminding the massacre of Muslims at Srebrenica.
Neither is in custody.
	   ``Persons indicted for war crimes who are still at large should
realize they, too, will be brought to justice,'' NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said Wednesday after the arrest.
	   Krstic is the ninth war crimes suspect to be arrested in the
former Yugoslavia by international forces. He was named head of the
Drina Corps of the Bosnian Serb Army in 1995 after the fall of
Srebrenica.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ As an OSCE foreign ministers' meeting
focused Wednesday on the organization's risky task of maintaining
peace in Kosovo, Yugoslavia said it should have been included.
	   The 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, or OSCE, is sending 2,000 unarmed observers to the Kosovo,
a province of the dominant Yugoslav republic of Serbia, in hopes of
stopping the violence between the government and ethnic Albanian
separatists.
	   The monitors' mission, one of the riskiest and biggest
undertakings by the OSCE, was a key topic during the opening day of
a two-day foreign ministers meeting in the Norwegian capital. The
group fears that failure could lead to violence spreading in the
Balkans.
	   ``The OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission is undoubtedly the
greatest challenge the OSCE has ever faced,'' said Austrian Foreign
Minister Wolfgang Schussel, speaking on behalf of the European
Union. ``The operation is not without risk, and we highly value the
importance the mission attaches to the security of its members.''
Austria is the current EU chairman.
	   In Kosovo, hundreds have been killed and up to 300,000 mainly
ethnic Albanians have been displaced since Serbia launched a
crackdown on separatists in February.
	   Yugoslavia was suspended from the OSCE in 1992 for allegedly
fomenting ethnic conflict in the former Yugoslav republics of
Croatia and Bosnia. It was not officially represented in Oslo, and
the Belgrade government on Wednesday wrote to the OSCE to complain.
	   ``I have seen a letter in which they say they would very much
like to be here. And I don't see that as a protest,'' said
Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek, who takes over the
OSCE's rotating membership in January. ``They say that since we
were discussing the question of Kosovo, they should be present at
this discussion.''
	   At a briefing after the first day of closed meetings, Vollebaek
said Yugoslavia and its president, Slobodan Milosevic, still have
to meet tough requirements before they will be allowed to rejoin
the OSCE.
	   Facing threats of a NATO airstrike, Milosevic agreed to a
U.S.-brokered truce that is shaky and troubled by sporadic
violence. The deal included allowing 2,000 members of the Kosovo
Verification Mission into the province under NATO protection.
	   Vollebaek said 499 were in place as of Wednesday, and would
continue arriving at the rate of 250 a week until the total of
2,000 is reached by mid-January.
	   Although the Seventh Ministerial Meeting of the OSCE drew
foreign ministers from about 45 countries, some key countries _
including the United States and Britain _ sent lower ranking
delegations.
	   At the end of the meeting, the ministers hope to adopt a series
of resolutions on a broad range of topics.

Sex offender status for Tyson in Arizona
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ If Mike Tyson settles his legal problems in
Maryland and follows through on plans to make the Phoenix area his
new home, he'll have to register with the sheriff's office as a sex
offender.
	   Tyson has been living temporarily in Scottsdale while he trains
for his first fight since he bit Evander Holyfield's ears during a
June 1997 bout.
	   If Tyson makes his residence permanent, he will have to register
as a sex offender because of his 1992 rape conviction in Indiana,
Scottsdale police Sgt. Doug Dirren said.
	   Tyson pleaded no contest in Maryland Tuesday to misdemeanor
assault for his role in a scuffle after a traffic accident.
	   Indiana authorities must decide whether the no-contest plea
violates his probation, which could send the former heavyweight
champion back to prison.

	   HAVANA (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro said Wednesday he
would be pleased to welcome Pope John Paul II to Cuba again when
the pontiff travels to Mexico next month, though no such visit has
been planned.
	   ``A visit by the pope would always be welcome,'' Castro told
reporters during a two-day meeting of the Latin American Economic
System, a group of regional financial leaders.
	   Castro said he heard rumors that the pope might consider
visiting Cuba during his upcoming travels, but said there was no
official plan for such a stop.
	   The pope is scheduled to travel to Mexico on Jan. 22 and then to
St. Louis on Jan. 26 before returning to Rome.
	   John Paul visited Cuba in January of this year.

Norwegian journalist killed in road accident in Iraq

were in car, UPDATES with Saether returned to Amman, more details,
quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A car carrying a Norwegian television team
ran off the road and overturned on Wednesday, killing one of the
journalists and injuring the other, a Norwegian diplomat said.
	   In Oslo, officials at Norway's TV2 said that two of its staffers
were involved in the accident on the desert road near the
Iraq-Jordan border. They said cameraman Knut Andre Danielsen, 33,
was killed and reporter Anders Saether was injured.
	   The driver, a Jordanian, also was hurt in the crash.
	   The accident occurred 350 kilometers (210 miles) west of
Baghdad, said Mohsin Tarfa, acting director of the Iraqi Press
Center in Baghdad.
	   The car was traveling to Baghdad from the Jordanian capital of
Amman along a route that is one of the few ways into the country
because of U.N. sanctions that ban air travel. Nearly all visitors
to Iraq must take the 12-hour journey from Amman to Baghdad.
	   Saether, the injured reporter, arrived at an Amman hotel in a
four-wheel drive taxi that picked him from the accident site
shortly after the 6.30 a.m. crash.
	   He was taken in a wheelchair into the hotel and declined to
speak to reporters.
	   Hashem Sublaban, the Jordanian taxi driver who evacuated
Saether, said he was driving a British Broadcasting Corp. crew from
Amman to Baghdad when he saw the wreckage. Saether was lying on the
side of the highway, he said.
	   Danielsen's body was brought to Baghdad, said Aram Semerjian,
the Norwegian consul-general. It will then be driven to Amman for a
flight to Oslo, he said.
	   The two journalists had planned to stay in Iraq for about four
days to produce a feature film.
	   Iraqi officials initially had said that three Norwegian
journalists were in the car.

Sudan's powerful parliament speaker quits to work for party

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Hassan Turabi, the most influential
person in Sudan's government, resigned his post as the Parliament
speaker on Wednesday to work full time for the governing National
Congress party, state television said.
	   Turabi is widely regarded as the principal Islamic ideologue of
the military-backed government of President Omar el-Bashir. The
president must approve the resignation but that is considered a
formality.
	   The television report said that Turabi informed Parliament
members he was quitting so that he could ``devote all his time to
the National Congress.''
	   His widely anticipated resignation is not expected to reduce his
role as the power behind the scenes.
	   On Saturday, Deputy Speaker Ellison Magaia said Turabi would
resign but will continue heading the assembly until it approves
next year's budget on Dec. 17.
	   Political analysts see the resignation as the government's
attempt to appease the opposition before adopting a new law to
legalize ``political associations'' from Jan. 1.
	   The presence of the hard-line Turabi at the head of Parliament
had cast doubts on the seriousness of the government's openness to
the opposition.

United names Rongen coach

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With Bruce Arena hired away by the U.S.
national team, D.C. United named Thomas Rongen on Wednesday to
coach Major League Soccer's most successful team.
	   United will be Rongen's third MLS team. He was the league's
coach of the year in 1996 after leading Tampa Bay to a 20-12
regular season record, then moved to the New England Revolution the
following year and posted records of 15-17 and 8-18 before he was
fired Aug. 22.
	   Arena led United to four major titles _ the MLS Cup in 1996 and
1997, the U.S. Open Cup in 1996 and the CONCACAF Champions Cup this
year _ before he was named to lead the U.S. team on Oct. 27.
	   ``Obviously, his are big shoes to fill,'' United general manager
Kevin Payne said. ``Ultimately, I had to trust my initial instinct
that a coach with roots in the American game would be best suited
to D.C. United.''
	   A product of the famed Dutch club Ajax Amsterdam, Rongen was
been playing and coaching in the United States for 20 years. This
is his second stint in Washington _ he played for the Diplomats of
the long-extinct North American Soccer League in 1980.
	   Arena will coach D.C. United one final time Saturday in the
second leg of the Interamerican Cup against Brazil's Vasco da Gama
at Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Vasco da Gama won the first leg 1-0.

All eyes on labor talks in Manhattan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Wednesday's developments &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Even though this is the first week of December,
the opposing sides in the National Basketball Association lockout
may try to get somewhere by acting like it's June.
	   The owners and players have given themselves the opportunity to
go back to square one in their stalemated labor mess by wiping any
previous progress off the table.
	   When formal collective bargaining talks resume at 10 a.m. EST
(1500 GMT) Thursday, the sides may decide to start from scratch.
	   ``We may have to go a totally different path,'' deputy
commissioner Russ Granik said. ``Maybe there will be something on
Thursday that will surprise me.''
	   ``It may be too late for that,'' union director Billy Hunter
said Wednesday, already finding himself in disagreement with
Granik.
	   In what will be only the second full bargaining session since
the season was supposed to begin Nov. 3, the entire negotiating
teams of owners and players will meet in Manhattan.
	   The last time they met, Nov. 20, both sides called it their most
productive session to date. Yet things quickly fell apart in the
next couple of days as the union said the owners' proposed changes
to free agency timing rules were a ``deal-killer'' and the owners
then said the union had reneged on its acceptance of a complicated
tax formula in the final years of a six- or seven-year deal.
	   The bickering led to 13 days of inactivity, and the sides only
agreed to talk again by agreeing that everyone is flexible and
everything is negotiable.
	   If they can't come up with a solution in the next couple of
weeks, the entire 1998-99 season will be canceled.
	   ``I'm sticking to my statement that we'll be playing by early
January or mid-January,'' Hunter said.
	   So far, the first two months of the season have been scrapped as
the sides have fought over how to divide about dlrs 2 million in
projected annual revenues.
	   The owners have asked for a 50-50 split, while the players have
tied many of their concessions to receiving 60 percent.
	   The owners moved to 52 and 53 percent on Nov. 20 and the players
dropped to 57 percent, but those concessions are now void under the
ground rules that have been set for the new talks.
	   ``It's not even about finding a middle ground that both sides
can be happy with, it's about finding a middle ground that the
sides can be equally unhappy with,'' said union negotiating team
member Danny Schayes of the Orlando Magic.
	   The sides might decide to scrap their complicated escrow tax
system, which was designed to be a fail-safe in case revenues did
not drop to an agreed-upon level by the fourth year of the deal.
	   Players had previously proposed setting aside 10 percent of
their paychecks in the escrow years, but the owners wanted a backup
in case the 10 percent failed to cover the bill.
	   The sides then agreed in concept on an additional tax on the
highest-spending teams, although they disagreed on how high the tax
rate would be.
	   ``We're creating the most complicated deal in the history of
labor negotiations,'' Granik said. ``Everything is negotiable and
there's always flexibility, but we need to bring the percentage
down and they don't really want to. And that's the problem.''
	   Many players have emphatically told union director Billy Hunter
not to offer anything lower than 57 percent, while the owners have
tied several conditions to their moving higher than 50 percent.
	   Players received 57 percent of revenues last season, and the
owners had the right to seek a new deal if the percentage rose
above 52 percent.
	   Both sides know by now that they'll have to find a number
somewhere in the middle.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police issuing description of suspect in letter
bombings &QL;

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Police on Thursday announced they
were looking for a 43-year-old man suspected of masterminding
Australia's biggest terrorist campaign, the mailing of at least 25
letter bombs to tax officials.
	   Australian Tax Office staff nationwide were put on alert
Wednesday after more than 20 explosive parcels were found addressed
to present and former tax office staff.
	   The alert was issued after an early morning letter bomb
explosion Wednesday at a Canberra mail center slightly injured two
postal workers who were hit by bits of plastic shrapnel.
	   Another 21 explosive parcels were found at the mail center,
while at least two more of the potentially lethal devices had been
found posted to homes in Sydney, and one in Melbourne.
	   The man sought by police was believed to be driving a blue 1985
Toyota Corona sedan with Canberra license plates.
	   Police issued a statement: ``Concerns are held for the well
being of the occupant and safety of the public and it is important
that the vehicle be located as soon as possible.''
	   Police were concerned more letter bombs could still be on their
way to past and present tax officials, sent by what they believe to
be a disgruntled, disturbed person. Police were investigating a
common link between all addressees.
	   Tax Commissioner Michael Carmody said the vast bulk of the
letter bombs were directed at present or former tax office staff.
	   Sources close to the investigation said the matter related to a
personal dispute.
	   The ATO has taken steps to protect its employees and a national
memo to its 17,000 staff warned: ``Please ensure that your families
and others likely to open your mail are informed immediately.''
	   The bombs are in white parcels about the size of a storage box
that would hold five computer discs.
	   The bombs are designed to explode when opened, although the
device which exploded at the Canberra Mail Center went off when it
was thrown into a sorting basket, slightly injuring the workers.

	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Grenada's governor general
dissolved Parliament Wednesday, paving the way for early elections
amid charges of nepotism and corruption in Prime Minister Keith
Mitchell's government.
	   In a brief statement, Gov. General Sir Daniel Williams said he
was acting on a Tuesday request by Mitchell.
	   Mitchell did not set a date for new elections. But Williams'
action means people in the former British Caribbean colony must go
to the polls within 90 days.
	   The move comes three days after Foreign and Legal Affairs
Minister Raphael Fletcher resigned, charging that government
contracts at inflated prices were improperly being given to friends
and supporters of the government.
	   Mitchell has accused Fletcher of being backed by Libya in a
sinister plot to bring down the government and have himself elected
prime minister.
	   In addition, Fletcher is now under police guard following a
radio report that the government had ordered him killed.
	   Both men have denied all the allegations.
	   Neverthelesss, the suggestion of a Libyan connection has raised
fears that the United States, which has declared Libya a terrorist
state, might block aid to Grenada through international agencies
like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
	   In 1983, the United States invaded Grenada in the chaos
surrounding a failed Marxist revolution, saying the island was in
danger of becoming a satellite of Cuba.
	   Tuesday night, Mitchell announced on television he had asked
Williams to dissolve Parliament, a formality. Williams is the
representative of Britain's monarch in this independent country
that is part of the Commonwealth.
	   As for Fletcher's resignation, Mitchell said he heard about it
on national radio. Hours later, respected radio commentator Stanley
Charles, on a talk show, said that the government had ordered
Fletcher killed. The former minister is under police protection.
	   Fletcher and at least three government ministers have alleged
that there is government corruption. Their charges are bolstered by
an independent study that reported the tendering process was
manipulated, workers were overpaid and party supporters were
favored in hiring.
	   While Mitchell mentioned no election date, business sources
close to the prime minister, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said elections could be held within three weeks.
	   Fletcher's resignation, combined with the simultaneous defection
of a legislator to an opposition party, left Mitchell with control
of only seven of the 15 seats in Parliament.
	   ``My intention was to call a general election one year from
now,'' Mitchell said. But ,''I have decided that it is in the best
interest that the Parliament of Grenada should be dissolved.''
	   He said the political climate had caused uncertainty among
foreign investors, Grenadians and tourists.
	   ``I understand the concerns and I agree that it is important not
to allow those feelings of uncertainty to continue for too long,''
Mitchell said.
	   He accused ``some disgruntled political elements'' of trying to
destabilize the government and disrupt Grenada's development.
	   Mitchell defended his government's 3 1/2 years in office, citing
increased government
	   projects, a construction boom, the erection of a multimillion
dollar national stadium with aid from Cuba and a ministerial
complex.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Blue-chip stocks posted only modest losses
Wednesday, recovering from a third straight day of profit-taking
from the market's record-setting rebound. The Dow Jones industrial
average dropped 69.00 points _ or by 0.8 percent _ at 9,064.54,
bouncing back from a slide below 9,000 for the second day in a row.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Elf Aquitaine, the oil giant, and L'Oreal, the
cosmetics concern, on Wednesday announced plans to merge their
pharmaceutical subsidiaries into a new company touted as the
sixth-largest such group in Europe and among the top 20 worldwide.
A joint statement said the merger project was approved Wednesday by
the boards of directors of Elf Aquitaine and L'Oreal, which are to
merge their respective pharmaceutical subsidiaries, Sanofi and
Synthelabo. The new group is to be named Sanofi-Synthelabo. Elf
Aquitaine and L'Oreal will hold 35.1 percent and 19.4 percent,
respectively, of the capital in the new group.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Deutsche Bank will buy Credit Lyonnais
Belgium for about 1 billion marks (dlrs 590 million), continuing
its European expansion after recent ventures in the United States
and Japan, the bank announced Wednesday. The planned purchase of
the Belgian bank, a subsidiary of France-based Credit Lyonnais SA,
came just days after Deutsche Bank announced its 17 billion mark
(dlrs 10 billion) takeover of Bankers Trust Corp. Last month it
announced an asset-management joint venture with Japan's Nippon
Life Insurance Co. (GERMANY-DEUTSCHE BANK-CREDIT LYONNAIS)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Undaunted by news of falling profitability and job
cuts at U.S. rival Boeing, Europe's Airbus Industrie said Wednesday
that it has a long backlog of orders and plans to increase output
by 30 percent next year. Cautious expansion of its output in the
past three years is the reason behind the backlog, the company
said, adding that the European consortium has been little affected
by the Asian financial crisis. Airbus has ``a backlog of 1,300 firm
orders,'' said spokeswoman Barbara Kracht. Airbus said it plans to
increase output to 290 aircraft in 1999, 30 percent higher than the
likely total production of 230 aircraft this year, Ms. Kracht said.
(AIRBUS-OUTPUT)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Air France reported a drop in net profit of
half-a-billion francs (dlrs 88 million) in the six months that
ended Sept. 30, mainly due to costs associated with a June pilots'
strike, the company said Wednesday. Net profit fell to 1.3 billion
francs (dlrs 230 million) from 1.8 billion francs (dlrs 319
million), the company said. Air France estimated the cost of the
strike at 1.3 billion francs (dlrs 230 million). Air France hopes
that a partial privatization that was delayed because of the strike
will be able to go ahead early next year. (FRANCE-AIR FRANCE)
	   BATTLE CREEK, Michigan (AP) _ Kellogg Co. is cutting 525
salaried jobs, or about 21 percent of the salaried positions in its
North American operations, as part of a previously disclosed
restructuring plan. The world's largest cereal maker also disclosed
Wednesday it was cutting 240 contract positions such as those held
by temporary workers. That represents about 20 percent of its
contract work force in North America, The cuts are designed to
reduce costs by about dlrs 105 million a year starting in 1999. The
cuts affect workers at the Battle Creek headquarters and other
North American operations. (US-KELLOGG CUTS)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany will seek tough budget reforms in
the European Union during its six-month presidency of the trade
bloc starting Jan. 1, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said
Wednesday. His comments drew battle lines, including with Germany's
key partner France, over difficult efforts to streamline the EU to
allow it to welcome the first nations from the former Soviet bloc
after 2000. A priority will be to cut Germany's share of the dlrs
100 billion EU budget, Fischer said in reply to lawmakers'
questions. Germany is the largest contributor, paying for about a
third of EU spending. (GERMANY-EUROPE)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The world economy still faces a substantial
risk that it could plunge into recession next year rather than
experience sluggish growth, the World Bank said Wednesday. Events
that could cause a slump, a new report said, include a worsening
recession in Japan, a loss of investor confidence that could halt
the flow of international capital to developing countries,
especially in Latin America, and a 20- to 30-percent plunge in
stock markets in wealthy nations. The lending institution made
these observations in its annual economic roundup that focuses on
the developing countries and their experiences with the economic
crises that began in Asia 17 months ago and then spread to Russia
and Latin America. (WORLD BANK OUTLOOK)

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli government reacted to a West Bank
ambush Wednesday by halting the latest Mideast peace accord until
the Palestinians comply with a list of demands, including a promise
to publicly abandon plans to declare a state in May. Palestinian
officials rejected the demands outright and charged that Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was looking for excuses to knock
the peace process off track. An Israeli government statement said
its decision was prompted in part by the attack on an Israeli
soldier and civilian by an angry Palestinian mob in the city of
Ramallah in the West Bank earlier Wednesday. The Israeli
announcement that it was suspending further troop withdrawals from
the West Bank came 10 days before U.S. President Bill Clinton was
to arrive in the region to usher in stage two of the Wye River
land-for-security agreement he helped negotiate in October.
(ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ NATO troops on Wednesday arrested
the highest-ranking Serb military officer seized so far in the
effort to bring to trial Bosnians who are accused of war crimes.
Radislav Krstic, a general, is accused of taking part, both
personally and through his troops, in the massacre of thousands of
Muslims after Bosnian Serbs took over the U.N. safe haven of
Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia in July 1995. He was indicted in
October by the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, which charged him with
genocide, crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the Geneva
Conventions on the treatment of civilians during war. The
indictment was secret so he wouldn't be prompted to flee. Krstic
was arrested in a section of northern Bosnia controlled by U.S.
troops serving in NATO's Stabilization Force, better known as SFOR.
A spokeswoman, Maj. Sheena Thomson, said Krstic was arrested
without incident at noon. (BOSNIA-WAR CRIMINALS, NATO-BOSNIA-WAR
CRIMES)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's central government ordered the arrest of
a prominent democracy campaigner and may use his contacts with
exiled Chinese dissidents to charge him with harming national
security, a colleague said Wednesday. Two Beijing police officers
spent 30 minutes telling Zha Jianguo to stop trying to set up a
political opposition party. Underscoring the warning, they said his
colleague, Xu Wenli, won't be released soon and may be charged for
having links to ``reactionary groups,'' Zha said. Xu and another
influential dissident, Qin Yongmin, were arrested Monday night in
police raids in two cities that delivered the sternest blow so far
to a five-month campaign to establish the China Democracy Party and
challenge the ruling Communist Party's monopoly on power.
(CHINA-DISSIDENTS)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq on Wednesday presented a former
American soldier allegedly suffering from war-related illnesses to
push its claim that U.S. shelling during the 1991 Gulf War
unleashed a radioactive substance, causing widespread cancer among
Iraqi civilians. Her voice wavering and hands shaking, former Sgt.
1st Class Carol Picou urged about 600 Iraqi scientists and doctors
at a medical conference to help explain what she said were
unexplained ailments. Iraq also sponsored two former British
soldiers to attend the two-day conference. Ms. Picou and the
Britons, Raymond Bristow and Colin Dursell-Lee, said they had
defied their governments' orders to attend the conference. The
meeting will discuss what Iraq claims is the high incidence of
cancer among Iraqi civilians in southern Iraq exposed to depleted
uranium from shells fired by U.S. forces during the Gulf War to end
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. (IRAQ-GULF WAR SYNDROME)
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ One week after Turkey's government
collapsed, the president asked a center-left political veteran on
Wednesday to form a new administration, sidestepping a pro-Islamic
leader opposed by the nation's powerful military. Bulent Ecevit,
73, a former prime minister who leads only the fourth-largest party
in Parliament, would head Turkey's fifth government since 1995,
which will face the prospect of being dissolved after parliamentary
elections in less than five months. The job of forming a government
usually goes to the leader of the largest party in Parliament _ in
this case Recai Kutan of the pro-Islamic Virtue Party. But Kutan
wasn't even asked. President Suleyman Demirel was apparently trying
to avoid a recurrence of the 1997 crisis in which the military
pressured an Islamic-led government out of power. (TURKEY-POLITICS)

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ The Grand Ole Opry is returning to
its longtime former home _ the Ryman Auditorium _ but only for a
visit.
	   Three Opry shows are scheduled for Jan. 15-16 at the downtown
Ryman, where the country radio show was broadcast from 1943-1974.
	   ``It's a wonderful feeling in that building,'' said Porter
Wagoner, an Opry cast member for 41 years. ``The sound is great,
and people are so close to the stage it's like entertaining at your
home.''
	   The 103-year-old Ryman, a former church, and its neighborhood
deteriorated in the '70s and the Opry left, but refurbishment of
the building helped bring about a revival of the area, and it was
reopened as a concert hall.
	   The Opry, which launched Patsy Cline and many other country
greats, won't be giving up the 4,400-seat Grand Ole Opry House in
suburban Nashville any time soon.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The four-year marriage of Dudley Moore and
wife No. 4, Nicole Rothschild, is officially over.
	   Details of the settlement weren't disclosed by the actor's
publicist Michelle Bega, but she confirmed Wednesday that the
divorce is final.
	   Moore's divorce petition cited irreconcilable differences. The
marriage, which produced a 2-year-old son, was turbulent from the
start.
	   Ms. Rothschild filed a lawsuit alleging abuse by the star of
``Arthur'' and ``10,'' then dropped it in June, citing Moore's
health problems.
	   Moore, 63, underwent heart surgery in 1997 because of a blocked
artery.
	   ``He's recovered very well and he's doing very well,'' Ms. Bega
said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ A judge refused to throw out obscenity charges
against ``Hustler'' magazine publisher Larry Flynt.
	   Flynt argued the charges against him and his brother Jimmy
should be dismissed because Ohio's obscenity law goes beyond the
legal test established in a landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision.
	   Common Pleas Judge Patrick Dinkelacker ruled Tuesday that the
law is reasonable and the charges will stand.
	   The brothers go on trial in January for allegedly selling
sexually explicit videotapes at the Hustler store they operate in
downtown Cincinnati. Each faces 24 years in prison if convicted.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Kathy Bates replaces the late Roddy McDowall
on the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences governing board.
	   Ms. Bates joins Gregory Peck and Karl Malden on the three-person
board, the first to be made up entirely of Oscar winners.
	   McDowall died of cancer Oct. 3. Ms. Bates' term was announced
Tuesday.
	   Ms. Bates, 50, won her Academy Award for her portrayal of an
obsessed fan in the 1990 movie ``Misery.'' She has also appeared in
``Titanic,'' ``Fried Green Tomatoes'' and ``The Waterboy.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Fresh from their partnership on ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks will co-produce a 13-hour
HBO miniseries based on a U.S. Army unit in World War II, the
network said Tuesday.
	   ``Band of Brothers'' will begin production next year. No air
date has been set for the miniseries.
	   The project is based on the nonfiction book by Stephen Ambrose,
about an Army rifle company that parachuted into France on D-Day.
The miniseries may also include material from Ambrose's book,
``Citizen Soldiers,'' which follows soldiers through the end of the
war.
	   Spielberg produced and Hanks starred this summer in the movie,
``Saving Private Ryan,'' about an effort to rescue a soldier in
Europe during World War II.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Now that he's been back on Earth for a few
weeks, John Glenn can chuckle as he admits to the embarrassing
details of his history-making flight: The flying part was fine but
the return was a problem.
	   After the space shuttle Discovery ended its nine-day mission,
there was a long time lapse before its crew emerged for the
traditional inspection walk around the craft.
	   America's oldest astronaut gave a reason Tuesday: nausea. John
Glenn was throwing up.
	   ``I didn't feel so hot,'' he told Ohio reporters gathered for a
year-end interview.
	   Glenn, who is retiring as a Democratic senator from Ohio, said
he'd been concerned about space sickness, which many astronauts
experience while aloft, so he took precautions during liftoff.
	   On the return, however, ``I preloaded with too much fluid coming
down,'' he said.

sends everybody scurrying around chasing dreams, illusions, wars,
peace, love, hate, all that. Unknown is what it is. Accept that
it's unknown and it's plain sailing _ John Lennon (1940-1980).

Radiologist: Ultrasound can detect prostate cancer sooner
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TAMMY WEBBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Waiting for blood tests to reveal prostate cancer
could prove fatal for black men and others at high risk for the
disease, a researcher said.
	   Instead, men with abnormal levels of a blood substance should
not wait several months for a new test, as is usually suggested,
but should consider a biopsy technique in which ultrasound is used
to target suspicious areas, according to a new study presented
Wednesday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of
North America.
	   A large-scale study shows the method detects cancer better than
standard biopsies and should be used early, said Dr. Peter J.
Littrup, director of radiology research at Harper Hospital in
Detroit and an associate professor at Wayne State University.
	   Men who show mildly elevated levels of PSA _ prostate specific
antigen _ in blood tests often are advised to wait and have the
test repeated in six months or a year, rather than having an
immediate biopsy.
	   But Littrup said any PSA increase, even if it is in the normal
range, is suspicious, especially if the man is black. Prostate
cancer is more common and aggressive in black men.
	   ``The main message here is to find the cancer,'' Littrup said.
``Prostate cancer is more common and deadly in African-American men
and we proved that if we find it early ... we have a better chance
of making a difference and possibly saving lives.''
	   He said ultrasound usually is used only to locate the prostate
for biopsy, then a needle is used to randomly extracts six tissue
samples, possibly resulting in missed tumors. He said his technique
can easily see tumors, because ultrasound is used to look inside
the prostate and target suspicious areas.
	   ``Random biopsies are like shooting in the dark; you could miss
it,'' Littrup said.
	   His study of 2,368 black men and 1,090 white men, conducted over
the last four years, detected cancer in 31 percent of blacks and 24
percent of whites.
	   He said the study did not compare detection rates between the
two methods, but proved ultrasound-guided therapy, along with color
imaging, detects cancer at lower PSA levels, when cancers are more
curable.
	   A physician not involved in the research said the test makes
sense and could reduce the number of repeat biopsies.
	   Once men have abnormal PSA, ``they are on what we call a
slippery slope,'' said Dr. Otis W. Brawley, a medical oncologist
specializing in prostate cancer at the National Cancer Institute.
	   But Dr. William J. Catalona, chief of urologic surgery at
Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said
sometimes ultrasound is unnecessary. He there are reliable blood
tests to detect cancer, and biopsies can cause inflammation and
scarring, complicating later surgical procedures.

	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) _ State economic development officials see
a Russian aircraft ejection seat maker's first U.S. landing in East
Hartford as an example of the kind of major public-private
partnership the state wants to build.
	   IBP Aerospace Group Inc. announced Tuesday it would open a plant
in the Prestige Park industrial complex next fall.
	   Arthur Diedrick, a development official in the administration of
Gov. John G. Rowland, said the company has promised to stay in East
Hartford for at least 10 years.
	   The state offered a $7 million aid package to the company, which
has manufactured 12,000 seats in Russia and the former Soviet Union
since 1965.
	   The move will immediately generate about 200 full-time jobs, and
double that number by the year 2004, IBP officials said during a
news conference here Tuesday.
	   James F. Abromaitis, commissioner of the state Department of
Economic and Community Development, said IBP's move ``will work as
a catalyst'' and increase international exposure.
	   IBP would join Hamilton Standard as a major aerospace contractor
with operations in East Hartford.
	   ``This is a dynamite opportunity for the town and for the
state,'' said East Hartford Mayor Timothy D. Larson.
	   All parts for the seats, considered the most technologically
advanced in the world, will be manufactured locally to Russian
standards, said Kenneth J. Szalai, the company's president and
chief executive officer. The former senior NASA official said the
company will use vendors and suppliers within a 50-mile radius of
the local plant.
	   IBP also has offices in McLean, Va.
	   Szalai said the local plant will benefit from the estimated $500
million spent on development of the product since the early 1960s.
	   Based on the Russian K-36 ejection seat, the American-built
seats will equip pilots weighing between 103 and 240 pounds, and
are designed to prevent injury upon ejection. The seats will be
used in a wide range of American fighter aircraft.

Ukrainian nuclear disarmament leaves army officers homeless
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Viacheslav Havlytsky still recalls the day
when his nuclear weapons unit relinquished its last bomb in
exchange for a promise of new housing.
	   It was 1993 when Ukraine agreed to turn over its former Soviet
nuclear arsenal, the world's third-largest, to Russia for
dismantling. The United States, eager to promote nuclear
disarmament, agreed to fund construction of about 2,000 apartments
for officers who would be left jobless as a result.
	   But Havlytsky, a retired lieutenant colonel who served at a
nuclear weapons base, says the apartments have been misappropriated
by senior commanders for their own use.
	   ``We were deceived in the rudest possible way,'' Havlytsky said.
``Now no one needs us.''
	   The officers were told to choose among several cities where
apartments were to be built _ a generous offer in a country with
thousands of homeless military retirees and career officers.
	   The schedule for construction and distribution of apartments,
conducted with financial assistance from the United States, was
finally approved by the Defense Ministry in 1996.
	   Under the plan, officers in Havlytsky's detachment, which ran a
secret base for storing nuclear warheads, were to receive 159
apartments, with 93 to be ready by the end of 1997.
	   ``All the high-ranking guests who visited our base, including
the president and the defense minister, reassured us that each of
us would have a place to live,'' said retired Maj. Oleksandr
Kuzmych, another officer from Object S, the nuclear base's code
name.
	   But only 21 officers received apartments last year, and none so
far this year.
	   Havlytsky produced a letter from the U.S. Embassy saying the
apartments had been built. A written inquiry about the homes' fate
sent by The Associated Press to the Defense Ministry went
unanswered for a month.
	   When the officers asked when they would get their new homes,
they were told their old unit had been transferred to another
command that was not eligible for the apartment program.
	   ``We were told we can no longer count on apartments distributed
under the agreement because our base is not part of the former
nuclear force,'' Kuzmych said in an interview.
	   That was a shock to the officers, many of them in their forties,
who saw their hopes of starting a new life abruptly vanish.
	   Entangled in military red tape, they wrote numerous letters to
the Defense Ministry, trying to prove they should still be eligible
for new homes as direct participants in Ukraine's nuclear
disarmament.
	   But the response they received from the 43rd Army in July
contained little in the way of promises: ``One thousand
seventy-nine officers in our army do not have apartments, so we do
not have a possibility to consider allocating apartments for your
unit in the near future,'' it said.
	   The ex-officers believe they are victims of the country's
rampant corruption and say the apartments apparently were
distributed to top officers who were not supposed to get them.
	   Today, they stay with their families at military homes near the
former nuclear base, surviving on $35 monthly pensions, of which
$29 is spent on apartment fees.
	   The officers have tried to return to army service, but their
expertise as nuclear professionals is no longer needed in
nuclear-free Ukraine.
	   Havlytsky recalls how in May 1996 his unit bid farewell to the
last nuclear warhead before dispatching it to Russia.
	   ``We wrote `feeding mother' on it as we really depended on these
weapons for our living,'' he said. ``Now we understand how
prophetic we were then.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A fire swept through at least 15 floors of an
unfinished building of Russia's Supreme Court today, forcing
workers to evacuate the main courthouse next door, news reports
said.
	   No casualties were reported. It was unclear whether anyone was
in the central Moscow building when it caught fire.
	   The cause of the fire was also not known.
	   More than 10 fire trucks and a firefighting helicopter were sent
to the scene, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   At least 15 floors of the building were ablaze, including
scaffolding, timber and building materials, Interfax and the
ITAR-Tass news agency said. Gusts of wind were carrying burning
fragments of plastic into nearby streets.

Hunger striking kidnappers in Brazil determined to continue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Eight people convicted of abducting a
businessman said after two weeks of a hunger strike that they were
determined to die if the government doesn't release them.
	   The prisoners are hoping to pressure the government to pardon
the Brazilian convict and expel the seven other hunger strikers,
who include five Chileans and two Argentines, said a spokesman for
the hunger strikers, who are in Sao Paulo's Hospital das Clinicas.
	   They ``have made it very clear that they prefer to die before
returning to their cells,'' Breno Altman, president of the
Committee to Free Political Prisoners, said on Wednesday.
	   They are conscious and lucid, but are becoming more and more
susceptible to infection, hospital spokesman Flavio Tine said on
Wednesday. The inmates are drinking only water, the Folha De Sao
Paulo newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The kidnappers were sentenced to 26 years to 28 years in Sao
Paulo's Carandiru Penitentiary for kidnapping Abilio Diniz, the
owner of Brazil's largest supermarket chain, in 1989. They held
Diniz for six days before police freed him unharmed.
	   Two Canadians convicted with them were transferred to a
Vancouver prison on Nov. 20.
	   At their trial, the kidnappers claimed to be political prisoners
because they belonged to a group that planned to funnel the dlrs 30
million ransom they were demanding to Salvador's leftist
guerrillas. The Supreme Court denied their claim.
	   The prisoners stopped eating on Nov. 16, claiming authorities
reneged on an agreement that ended their 16-day hunger strike in
April, Altman said.
	   The foreigners were to have been transferred to a
minimum-security prison and allowed to participate in a
work-release program that would trigger their expulsion under
Brazilian law.
	   ``Foreigners without fixed residence and proper working papers
are not allowed to be gainfully employed,'' Altman explained.
	   Sao Paulo court officials weren't available to respond to the
convicts' claims they reneged on the agreement.

Paraguay's Supreme Court orders former general back to jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ Paraguay's Supreme Court on Wednesday
struck down a presidential decree that freed a former army
commander from prison, where he had been serving a 10-year sentence
for rebellion.
	   But lawyers disagreed over whether former Gen. Lino Cesar Oviedo
must return to the military prison to serve out a conviction for
refusing to resign as army chief-of-staff.
	   Oviedo was convicted in March of rebellion for initially
refusing a presidential order in 1996 to step down as the army's
top commander.
	   A tense 27-hour standoff ended when Oviedo agreed to quit in
exchange for then-President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's promise to name
him defense minister. The crisis tested Paraguay's young democracy.
	   Oviedo was pardoned as the first act by new President Raul
Cubas, who issued the August decree to overturn a military tribunal
ruling that sentenced Oviedo to 10 years in prison.
	   The nine members of Paraguay's highest court ruled by a vote of
5-4 that Cubas' decree was unconstitutional.
	   The Supreme Court also upheld an April conviction, handed down
by a military court formed under Wasmosy, which had sent the
54-year-old general to prison.
	   Neither Cubas nor Oviedo commented on the decision.
	   Issued days after his inauguration, Cubas' controversial
decision set off a political crisis as congressional critics
quickly called for impeachment hearings and the president's own
brother abruptly resigned from his administration.
	   Angry lawmakers appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.
	   Oviedo's lawyers said Wednesday's verdict was annulled by a new
military court convened by Cubas during the early days of his
administration.
	   ``Oviedo was acquitted by a military court organized by the
president,'' said Alejandro Davalos, one of the general's lawyers.
``His liberty is signed and has been executed.''
	   But detractors lobbied around the latest ruling of the Supreme
Court, saying Oviedo, who took part in bringing Paraguay's 34-year
military dictatorship to an end, should return to prison.
	   ``As the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, President Cubas
should arrest Oviedo and send him back to jail,'' said Jorge
Vasconsellos, a lawyer working on behalf of the legislators seeking
to reverse the president's decision.

Japanese stocks fall, dollar lower against yen in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks fell sharply in early trading
Thursday following a decline on Wall Street overnight, while the
U.S. dollar was lower against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 164.35 points,
or 1.10 percent, to 14,822.27 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Wednesday, the index had risen 151.21 points, or 1.02 percent.
	   The dollar bought 120.04 yen in early trading, down 1.84 yen
from late Tokyo but slightly above its late New York level of
119.93 yen overnight.
	   Traders said Japanese stock investors were discouraged by
Wednesday's drops in U.S. stock prices and the dollar.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 69 points to 9,064.54 on
concerns about deteriorating corporate earnings outlooks because of
weak demand from Asia.
	   The dollar's steep drop overnight in New York continued to push
down the currency in Tokyo, while also weighing on the share prices
of Japanese exporters in the stock market. A weaker dollar
decreases their overseas earnings when repatriated into yen.
	   Major exporters Sony, NEC, Fujitsu, Aiwa, Fuji Photo,
Bridgestone, Honda, Toyota and Kyocera were lower in early trading.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 11.94 points, or 1.04 percent, to 1,135.21. The
TOPIX rose 4.89 points, or 0.43 percent, the previous day.
	   The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond was
quoted at 1.120 percent, down from Wednesday's close of 1.155
percent, driving its price up to 105.85 yen from the previous day's
105.53.

	   HOHENWALD, Tennessee (AP) _ Where do elephants go in their old
age? A few of them end up in the unlikely surroundings of rural
Tennessee where Carol Buckley is only too happy to lavish love and
care on them.
	   She fell in love with elephants when she was 20, and nearly 25
years later, her passion is undimmed. ``Once you meet an elephant,
that's it,'' she says.
	   Three years ago she opened the Elephant Sanctuary to give aging
and sick captive elephants a natural setting in which to live out
their remaining years.
	   It's the only shelter of its kind in the United States.
	   ``Humans have been the reason the elephants have been in the
situation they're in,'' Buckley says. ``This is exactly what the
elephants need.''
	   In captivity, Buckley says, elephants usually are in chains,
which destroy their cartilage and induce arthritis. Food clogs
their digestive systems and boredom can make them neurotic.
	   At the sanctuary, the animals have healthy food and a fenced-in
tract of 112 acres (45 hectares) of rolling pasture to roam.
	   It all began when Buckley was studying exotic animals at
California's Moorpark College and spotted Tarra, a 6-month-old
Asian elephant, pacing in the back of a pickup truck.
	   Tarra was being used to promote a local tire store, and
Buckley's heart ached for her.
	   Buckley got her father to co-sign a dlrs 25,000 loan and bought
Tarra and a plot of land in Ojai, California, just north of Los
Angeles, where she built a barn for the elephant.
	   Tarra became a celebrity, appearing in the movie ``Annie'' and
on the TV show ``Little House on the Prairie.'' Buckley now says
she would never allow such exploitation of an elephant, but at the
time it seemed the best way to ensure proper care.
	   When Tarra became too old for show business, Buckley tried some
zoos. The elephant seemed unhappy, so in 1990 Buckley took her to a
safari park in Cambridge, Ontario.
	   There Buckley met Scott Blais, who would become her partner at
the sanctuary. Blais, now 25, says Buckley's devotion to elephants
immediately was apparent.
	   ``That really caught my eye,'' he says. ``It allowed me to open
up to the elephants a little bit, and I finally learned what
elephants are all about and how wonderful they truly are.''
	   He and Buckley shrugged off the skeptics, pooled their savings
and paid dlrs 130,000 for the tree-rimmed pasture and small
farmhouse in Hohenwald, about 65 miles (100 kilometers) southwest
of Nashville.
	   ``For me, she's an inspiration,'' says Buckley's friend Ellen
Leach, who works with an animal behavior consulting company in
Seattle. ``To take this leap in caring for elephants. ... The
potential for financial burden is huge.''
	   The donor-supported sanctuary costs dlrs 200,000 a year to run,
and Blais and Buckley worked for free when it opened. To Buckley,
money comes second to the comfort for elephants.
	   ``Her whole goal and focus in life is to help elephants,'' says
Kathi Murray, a friend who works at a Georgia wildlife park.
	   Blais and Buckley have built two heated barns that shield the
elephants in winter and serve to quarantine new arrivals being
checked for disease.
	   Buckley wishes she could take every elephant, but can accept
only the sickest. Tarra has been joined by Barbara and Jenny.
	   Barbara arrived in 1996 after a life in captivity, mainly in
circuses, and was malnourished and 2,000 pounds (907 kilograms)
underweight. She has since regained most of that weight.
	   Jenny was rescued from an animal shelter outside Las Vegas where
she was dumped because she was too crippled and emaciated to
perform.
	   A fourth elephant could arrive by the end of the year.
Eventually, Buckley and Blais hope to have 12 Asian elephants.
	   As she does her daily chores, Buckley stands on her toes to hug
and kiss the elephants. She rubs Tarra's stomach, eliciting happy
purrs. ``Oh, I hear your motor's going,'' she exclaims.
	   She and Blais say they have been contacted by a group interested
in opening a 5,000-acre (2,000-hectare) sanctuary for African
elephants elsewhere in the United States.
	   While Buckley doesn't seek publicity, it has found her and
Blais. ``Time for Kids'' listed them among their 10 ``Heroes for
the Planet.'' They also have been featured in ``People'' magazine
and on several network television programs.
	   ``We've set the example,'' Buckley says. ``It takes two people
who will dedicate their lives to it and believe in it. ... I'm no
different from you. I just said, `Hey, I'm going to do this.'''

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico will wait for the outcome of
Venezuela's elections and other key developments in other countries
before deciding whether to extend oil cuts beyond June 1999, Energy
Secretary Luis Tellez said Wednesday.
	   Tellez said the government wants to see whether whoever wins
Sunday's vote in Venezuela will support output agreements made by
the current government.
	   The government said earlier it was willing to extend its
reduction in oil exports to the end of 1999 if members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries did the same.
	   OPEC made no decision on extending oil cuts at its meeting in
Vienna last month.
	   Mexico agreed in June 1998 to reduce oil exports by 200,000
barrels a day to 1.64 million barrels a day under a deal with Saudi
Arabia and Venezuela.
	   Tellez also said that despite the recent drop in oil prices, the
government plans no immediate changes to its forecast of an average
1999 export price of dlrs 11 per barrel.
	   The export price of Mexico's crude oil mix fell to lows of dlrs
7.60 per barrel following the OPEC meeting last month, but has
recovered slightly since then, he said.

	   OAXACA CITY, Mexico (AP) _ A simmering land dispute between
farmers in southern Mexico has erupted in violence, leaving four
dead, three wounded and one missing.
	   Armed with rifles, residents of the village of Santo Domingo
Teojomulco opened fire Tuesday on farmers from a rival town, San
Lorenzo Texmelucan, Oaxaca state officials said.
	   The two villages long have fought over 40 acres (16 hectares) of
land. About 130 people have died in the conflict over the last 30
years.
	   In the clash Tuesday, gunmen killed Claudio Marcial Bailen, 18;
Hermelando Perez Martinez, 22; and Pioquinto Marcial Perez, 22.
Four others were seriously wounded.
	   Authorities said they had little information on the clash
because the Oaxaca governorship changed hands Tuesday and new
officials were moving into state offices. It was unclear whether
any arrests had been made.
	    &UR; ___
	   ALMOLOYA DE JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) _ One of Mexico's most
controversial trials neared an end as lawyers for the brother of
former President Carlos Salinas on Wednesday presented final
arguments in which they accused prosecutors of bribing witnesses.
	   The case against Raul Salinas _ the first involving such serious
charges against the brother of a former president _ has been
plagued with irregularities.
	   Raul Salinas is charged with plotting the 1994 assassination of
Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, his former brother-in-law and the
secretary-general of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party.
	   The defense submitted its argument in two volumes of documents.
A final summation hearing, which will be attended by Salinas as
well as lawyers for both sides, will be held within five days. A
judgment is expected before January.
	   The defense accused the attorney general's office of rewarding
witnesses to implicate Salinas, paying dlrs 500,000 in one case.
	   Salinas has been jailed since 1995 in a maximum-security prison
west of Mexico City. Apart from the murder charges, he is accused
of ``illegal enrichment,'' an allegation that covers such things as
taking bribes, aiding drug traffickers and misusing public funds.
	   Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who left Mexico in disgrace after his
brother was arrested in 1995, lives in self-imposed exile in
Ireland. He has not been charged with any crime.
	    &UR; ___
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ The Interamerican
Development Bank agreed Wednesday to loan dlrs 117 million to the
Dominican Republic for repair efforts in the wake of Hurricane
Georges.
	   The loan contract was signed Wednesday in Washington, Dominican
officials said.
	   Most of the money will go toward replacing roads, bridges, power
lines and other infrastructure damaged by the storm, which hit the
Caribbean country Sept. 22. About dlrs 30 million will go toward
social services and medical care.
	   The Dominican Republic will repay the loan over 25 years, with
an initial grace period of two years.
	   Hurricane Georges killed 283 people in the Dominican Republic,
left 287,000 homeless and caused an estimated dlrs 1.7 billion in
damage.
	    &UR; ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A court in Guatemala convicted a man
Wednesday of leading a lynch mob that burned two alleged thieves to
death, and sentenced him to 25 years in prison.
	   A judge in the western city of Solala convicted Miguel Tzep of
the 1997 lynching in a nearby village in which the two men were
beaten, sprayed with gasoline and set afire.
	   There have been at least 147 lynchings in Guatemala in the last
three years, according to government figures.

At age 95, chemist dazzled by uses of his decades-old discovery

<TEXT>
	   CORNING, New York (AP) _ When he figured out a way to make
exceptionally pure glass, chemist Frank Hyde knew his discovery
would have myriad applications.
	   But who, back in 1934, could have foreseen spaceship windows,
precision lenses to build ever-so-tiny computer chips, or the
gossamer strands of optical fiber?
	   ``I'm surprised at some of the things it has gone into, but I'm
not surprised at the versatility of such a beautiful and useful
material,'' said Hyde, who at age 95 has lived to see the
blossoming of a scientific discovery that lay mostly dormant until
he was closing in on retirement in the 1960s.
	   It's called fused silica, and it remains the most immaculate
commercial glass on Earth. Hyde was a 31-year-old organic chemist
at Corning Glass Works when he came up with a practical method of
making it in bulk.
	   His inspiration? A monumental telescope being built atop
California's Palomar Mountain.
	   At 200 inches (508 centimeters) in diameter, its reflector would
soon be the largest ever molded. Corning had won the contract to
make it with Pyrex, a glass it developed in 1915 that can withstand
big swings in temperature without changing shape.
	   Hyde's pioneering work in the laboratory came too late to
influence that project, but he knew it would eventually have
far-reaching uses.
	   Among those he has lived to see:
	   The galaxy-gazing Hubble Space Telescope;
	   Space shuttle windows durable enough to shield against hazardous
meteorite fragments;
	   Giant optical cameras that can mass-produce microchips with 250
circuit lines printed across the width of a human hair.
	   All rely on a glass of such astonishing clarity that if it
filled the seas, the ocean bed would be visible from the surface.
	   Signal-carrying laser beams can travel for miles (kilometers)
through fused silica fibers without dissipating or scattering, a
1970s breakthrough at Corning that set in motion the fiber-optic
revolution in telecommunications.
	   ``Mother Nature usually doesn't give you optical transparency,
high mechanical strength, outstanding chemical durability, all of
these things at once,'' said George Sigel, professor of ceramic and
materials engineering at Rutgers University. ``This material
provides that. It really is special.''
	   In the 19th century, scientists had tried melting quartz
crystals to make fused silica, but that required heat in excess of
1,725 degrees Centigrade, which was prohibitive. Besides, the
molten glass couldn't easily be cooled into shapes.
	   Hyde attacked the puzzle from an unconventional angle: He heated
the basic raw materials _ sources of silicon and oxygen _ by
running a volatile gas called silicon tetrachloride through an
oxygen flame.
	   The ultra-pure vapors formed a fine, glassy powder of silicon
dioxide that, he said, ``could be pressed into a shape just like
clay.''
	   Hyde's vapor-to-solid method is known as frame hydrolysis. That
concept, Sigel said, has since been broadened to build all kinds of
high-performance materials, ``an atom and a molecule at a time.''
	   Hyde, who grew up near Syracuse, had been hired by Corning in
1930 at a time when newly discovered plastics were threatening to
usurp the place of glass.
	   The Palomar telescope, which drew the kind of headlines that the
space race generated in the 1960s, got many scientists hunting for
new materials to make even bigger mirrors. Hyde, an astronomy buff,
dropped everything in 1932 to begin his fused silica experiments.
	   Eventually producing it in thumbnail-size lumps, Hyde pondered
using the glass in a spring for measuring infinitesimal weights or
as a filler in rubber. He even wondered if it might be drawn out
into long fibers. But after winning his patent, he moved on to
other projects.
	   ``When an idea builds up and becomes useful, it involves the
knowledge and skill of many people in different businesses,'' Hyde
said. ``I want to emphasize that.''
	   Fused silica found its first real-life use in a type of radar
for detecting Japanese warships during World War II.
	   Although Hyde's glass is many times more resistant than Pyrex to
sudden jolts of hot or cold, Corning colleague Martin Nordberg
added titanium compounds in 1939 to create a zero-expansion glass
used today in telescope mirrors nearly twice as big as Palomar's.
	   The glass also serves as a key conduit in the semiconductor
industry. Microlithographic ``stepper'' lenses made of fused silica
provide the high transmission critical to miniaturizing computer
chips.
	   In the early 1970s, three Corning scientists invented optical
fiber, which is rapidly replacing copper as the backbone of
America's telephone, cable television and computer networks.
	   ``Someone asked Isaac Newton, how was he so great? He said, `You
can see further if you stand on the shoulders of giants,''' said
one of the three, Donald Keck. ``Technological giants like a Frank
Hyde, we just don't applaud them enough. He's the grandfather of
the field of optical communication.''
	   Optical fiber is now Corning's biggest business; the company,
based in rural western New York, corners more than a third of the
world's supply. But fused silica is manufactured by many companies
worldwide, its sales running into billions of dollars a year.
	   Hyde lives alone on Marco Island off southwestern Florida. His
three children visit regularly from the mainland.
	   ``At my age, you slow down,'' he said, chuckling. ``It isn't
long after washing the breakfast dishes to start the dinner, that
sort of thing!''
	   His wife of 61 years, Hildegard, died in 1991. ``When you lose
someone close to you like that, you really never get over it,'' he
said softly.
	   Despite his age, Hyde's memory for scientific detail remains
keen, particularly when he dwells on those halcyon days in the lab
six decades ago.
	   ``It gives you a great feeling of satisfaction that you did
something useful in life,'' he said. ``That was an accomplishment
that I can always be proud of.''

	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ In 2020, the fashionably wired mother of three
will make no ordinary trip to the grocery store.
	   After scanning her cupboards, she will recite a list into a
microphone built into her eyeglasses. The items will be translated
into text and appear on a computer screen built into the lenses.
Inside the store, the woman's identification ring will broadcast
her buying habits to the store computer, which will beam back
discount prices to the monitor in her eyeglasses.
	   Those are some of the visions of the hundreds of computer
engineers who came to Pittsburgh recently for the Second
International Symposium on Wearable Computers. They swapped ideas
and showed off gadgets.
	   ``This conference is mostly the geeks who are pushing like mad:
`What can we do?''' said Randy Pausch of conference-host Carnegie
Mellon University.
	   But with computer advances doubling every 18 months on average,
the day when computers are tiny enough to sew into everyday
clothing or build into normal eyeglasses is not far off, he said.
	   ``These guys really can do anything. It just takes time _ and
not much time,'' he said.
	   From a distance, the conference resembled a gathering of
jewelers. Many people wore plastic headbands holding thick
cyborg-like eyepieces that displayed monitor screens. Some had
keyboards in the form of clunky fingerless gloves strapped to their
palms. The devices were typically connected to laptop-sized
processors in a bag or awkwardly hooked to a belt.
	   ``The big heavy bulky stuff is all current technology that
nobody actually believes will be used by any normal human being,''
said Steve Feiner, associate professor of computer science at
Columbia University.
	   Instead, mass-marketed wearable computers are expected to be
much more elegant. Feiner pointed to Motorola's existing
watch-pager.
	   ``Things that are gadgety are going to be on our bodies in ways
we're comfortable with,'' Feiner said.
	   One big hit at the conference was a pair of ordinary-looking,
black-rimmed eyeglasses with a built-in monitor. The translucent
display was about the width of a pencil eraser and sat in the
middle of one eyeglass lens. Electronic circuits in one of the
glasses' temples beam the images onto the display.
	   The wearer sees the image of a monitor that appears to be about
3 feet away and a quarter the size of a normal screen. But the
monitor is translucent, so it does not block the wearer's view.
	   The glasses are being developed by MicroOptical Corp. of Boston
with the help of grants from the Department of Defense.
	   ``The soldier needs his hands free, so the monitor needs to be
unobtrusive, preferably in something the soldier carries anyway,
such as eyeglasses,'' said Mark Spitzer, MicroOptical's chief
executive officer. In a war, the monitor could display things like
maps, targets and instructions from officers.
	   The monitor will work with prescription lenses, and Spitzer said
they could be available through optometrists within five years.
	   By next year, Spitzer hopes to distribute them for specialty
fields such as medicine and industrial maintenance. For example,
somebody repairing the electronic controls of an airplane could
refer to detailed instructions while using both hands to work.
	   ``You're really freed from your desk,'' he said. ``But for the
average person to be able to get these, we need a big market.''
	   And the eyeglasses still have some bugs. Designers have not
figured out how to fit a battery into the 3-ounce frames, so they
work now with a wire connected from the back of the earpiece to a
portable computer. Also, the circuitry in the temples remains too
bulky to fit seamlessly into most frame styles.
	   Spitzer hopes that one day a tiny microphone could be added to
the frames to work with voice-recognition software, so the wearer
could tell the computer what to do.

Heavy rains soak course at Sun City

	   SUN CITY, South Africa (AP) _ Nick Price faces 11 of the world's
top golfers _ including red-hot Lee Westwood, rising star David
Duval and Tiger Woods _ in defending his title at the Million
Dollar Challenge.
	   But the 13th man _ rain _ may be his toughest obstacle, at least
on the opening round Thursday. Nearly 3 inches (70 millimeters)
caused the cancellation of the pro-am tournament Wednesday and
threatened Thursday's round.
	   It has made the course tougher, pushing the kikuyu grass up high
and worsening the roughs.
	   The conditions could help Woods, a strong and straight driver,
against local favorite Ernie Els and Zimbabwe's Price.
	   ``This is a big advantage for me, being able to fly over
trouble,'' Woods said Wednesday.
	   Price, who has won the event four times and been runner-up three
times, called the par-72, 7,597-yard (6,947-meter) layout a ``long,
tough course.''
	   ``Even if it's only a limited field event, you'll have to play
great golf to win here,'' he said.
	   The field at the Gary Player Country Club course also includes
Mark O'Meara, Tom Watson, Justin Leonard, Jim Furyk, Bernhard
Langer, Colin Montgomerie and Jesper Parnevik. It is the strongest
group since the first edition in 1981.
	   With more rain forecast, tournament chairman Tobin Prior said if
Thursday's opening round had to be canceled, two rounds would be
played Friday.
	   ``We want a single round finish'' Sunday, he said.
	   The tournament, which has total prize money of dlrs 2.57
million, is by invitation only. All travel and expenses for the
players are paid. The winner gets dlrs 1 million and the last-place
finisher takes home dlrs 100,000.
	   The tournament in this Vegas of Africa, a hotel-entertainment
complex that was a gambling refuge under apartheid, will serve as a
tune-up for the Americans playing in next week's Presidents Cup in
Australia.
	   It will also give emerging European star Westwood of England a
chance to cap a stellar season. He has 10 wins in the past 12
months, including his two previous tournaments, in Japan.
	   Westwood decided to play here instead of defending his title at
the Australian Open, angering the Aussie organizers.
	   For Woods, whose first appearance on an African course has
excited South Africa's black majority population, the tournament
comes at the end of a modest year by his standards.
	   After winning four times in 1997, including at the Masters,
Woods has won only once on the U.S. PGA tour this year. He is still
No. 1 in the world rankings.
	   Woods practiced early Tuesday, and was mobbed by youngsters, who
see him as a hero for black South Africans.
	   `It was really neat,'' Woods said. ``They came in droves. It's
very special.''
	   On Monday, Woods met privately with President Nelson Mandela. He
called the experience ``unbelievable,'' and said Mandela had been
following his career.

Five firefighters die in forest blaze near Ballarat

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Five volunteer firefighters died
overnight battling Victoria state's first major forest fire of the
summer season, officials said Thursday,
	   The five, all from the Geelong area, were killed as they fought
to protect the small country town of Linton, near Ballarat, some 77
miles (125 km) west of Melbourne.
	   It is not yet known how they became caught in the fire, but a
shift in the wind may have flown the inferno back on them.
	   It was the single biggest loss of lives for the Country Fire
Authority since Victoria's Ash Wednesday bushfires of Feb. 16,
1983, when 75 people were killed in Victoria and South Australia.
	   Country Fire Authority spokesman Trevor Roche said the tragedy
was hard felt.
	   ``The death of these firefighters is really a tragic
circumstance for the CFA,'' Roche told reporters Thursday morning.
	   ``It has devastated our members and our friends but also anyone
who is associated or has been associated with the CFA.
	   ``I mean no one can imagine a worse start to any fire season
than this.''
	   Police said names of the victims would not be immediately
released as they were yet to be positively identified.
	   More than 300 firefighters, 42 fire trucks and five aircraft
battled Wednesday's fire.

Exemption to save Sydney Olympics millions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government's proposal to
minimize the effect of a goods-and-services (GST) tax on the Sydney
Olympics would save the organizing committee 200 million Australian
dollars (123 million U.S. dlrs), Olympics Minister Michael Knight
said Thursday.
	   Knight, who is also president of the Sydney Organizing Committee
for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) said he welcomed the plan outlined by
Prime Minister John Howard in a letter to New South Wales state
Premier Bob Carr, although Knight said SOCOG would have preferred a
total exemption from the tax.
	   Under the proposed legislation, most of SOCOG's contracts
involving ticket sales, sponsorships and television rights would be
classified as exports and therefore free from the tax.
	   The legislation would also apply to the Sydney Paralympic Games.
	   ``While it's not our preferred mechanism, it does look like it
will solve the problem for us,'' Knight said.
	   The sale of tickets was SOCOG's biggest concern and it feared a
GST might apply because the seats were provided in September 2000,
after the introduction of the new tax.
	   ``I appreciate this would place SOCOG in a difficult position
given the agreement it has with the International Olympic Committee
in relation to ticket prices,'' Howard said.
	   SOCOG has budgeted to receive a games record Australian dlrs 600
million (372 million U.S. dlrs) from ticket sales.
	   Howard said the deal was conditional on a Memorandum of
Understanding between the government and SOCOG being settled soon,
preferably before Christmas. (djp)

Clemens demands trade from Blue Jays
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Roger Clemens, angered the Toronto Blue Jays
won't spend enough money to field a contender next season, told the
team Wednesday he wants to be traded.
	   The five-time Cy Young Award winner, who won the honor for the
second straight year, wants to be dealt to a contender or closer to
his home in Katy, Texas.
	   The World Series champion New York Yankees, Houston Astros and
Texas Rangers are considered the top contenders to land the
36-year-old right-hander.
	   When Clemens signed with the Blue Jays before the 1997 season,
his agents, Randy and Alan Hendricks, had a handshake agreement
with Toronto general manager Gord Ash that he would attempt to deal
the pitcher if Clemens didn't think the team would contend.
	   The team's owner, the Belgian company Interbrew SA, has not set
a budget for next year. While the Yankees, Baltimore and other
American League East teams have already spent big money in the
offseason, the Blue Jays have done nothing.
	   ``The Hendricks brothers phoned Gord today and indicated Roger
would like to be moved,'' Blue Jays spokesman Howard Starkman said.
``We'll endeavor to do something, but as to how soon, we're not
sure.''
	   Clemens, who won his first three Cy Youngs with Boston in 1986,
1987 and 1991, went 20-6 with a 2.65 ERA, striking out 271 in 234
2-3 innings last season. He went unbeaten in his final 22 starts,
winning 15 decisions after starting 5-6. He led the AL in ERA and
strikeouts and tied for the lead in wins after finishing first in
all three categories in 1997.
	   Ash said the Blue Jays wanted to decide quickly, saying he
wanted to make a decision within 10 days.
	   ``I think it's important not to let this drag out,'' he said.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ At least 25 people, mostly children,
were killed in a pre-dawn fire Thursday which devastated an aging
Manila orphanage, fire officials said.
	   Fire officials said at least 70 people were inside the orphanage
and children's home, which includes a two-story building and two
cottages, when the fire broke out about 2 a.m.
	   The dead included about 20 children, officials said.
	   Fire Captain Filemon Jaotian said more victims might be under
the rubble of the Bahay Kalinga orphanage in Manila's Paco
district.
	   ``Others may still be buried in the debris because the buildings
have been completely razed to the ground,'' he said. ``It will take
several more hours to determine whether there are still people
there.''
	   City officials said they suspect that faulty electrical wiring
triggered the fire, which spread rapidly through the old wooden
buildings.

	   GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) _ The Gold Coast Chargers have
folded, reducing the National Rugby League to 17 teams for 1999,
Chargers chairman David Barnhill announced Thursday.
	   On Tuesday, the Adelaide Rams folded. There is a possibility of
a merger between Sydney team Balmain and another club, reducing the
league to 16 teams.
	   Barnhill said the Gold Coast club's directors had pursued every
avenue to keep the Chargers in the competition in 1999.
	   ``After considering the criteria that the NRL has in place for
the year 2000 competition, the board has resolved to withdraw and
not compete in the 1999 NRL competition.'' (djp)

Clean water is major issue in elections in southern Taiwan

<TEXT>
	   KAOSHIUNG, Taiwan (AP) _ For as long as most residents of this
southern city can recall, putting on the kettle has first required
a stop at the local filling station.
	   Water, which from the tap is undrinkable even after boiling, is
obtained for a fee through a gas pump-like nozzle at any of the
thousands of self service water stations located throughout the
city. The arrangement, many residents say, makes a mockery of
Taiwan's remarkable economic progress.
	   Cleaning up the water supply is a major issue in the Dec. 5
mayoral elections, but the outrage doesn't seem strong enough to
dislodge two-term incumbent Wu Den-yih.
	   Though the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party has
channeled voter dissatisfaction to snatch most of southern Taiwan
from the Nationalists, the ruling party maintains its hold in
Kaohsiung through cooperation with powerful business interests and
organization in state-owned industries and military communities.
	   Though competition this year is the hottest on record, surveys
show Wu maintaining a comfortable lead over his three rivals. On
Dec. 5, Taiwanese also elect a new 225-seat legislature and the
city councils of Taipei and Kaohsiung.
	   Kaohsiung's water comes mostly from the Kaoping river that flows
through the outlying county. Salination caused by leaching from
aquaculture and contamination by hog raising operations have
rendered its waters undrinkable.
	   Wu blames the central government for failing to provide funds
for the large-scale treatment plant he says is needed to solve the
problem. His major opponent, Frank Hsieh of the Democratic
Progressive Party, says Wu has had eight years in office _ plenty
of time _ to get the job done, proving the mayor's heart isn't in
the work.
	   ``Wu doesn't want to be mayor, He'd rather be a minister in
Taipei,'' Hsieh tells reporters.
	   Other contenders _ Wu Chien-kuo of the small New Party, and
independent Tseng Teh-yao _ echo those accusations. But they say
Hsieh, a transplanted Taipei native, isn't familiar enough with
Kaohsiung's problems to develop an effective solution.
	   ``We can solve the problem without central government help if we
can establish city control over the water supply,'' says Wu, a
U.S.-trained engineer who stresses that removing pig farms has to
be part of a solution.
	   Largely blue collar Kaohsiung _ Taiwan's second largest city
with a population of 1.5 million _ has long chaffed at what it sees
as its relegation to second class status. The central government
has developed recreation, infrastructure and culture in Taipei
while turning Kaohsiung into a Dickensian jungle of polluting
industries, residents complain.
	   In addition to its water woes, the tropical city, where Taiwan's
tallest buildings rise along palm-lined streets, suffers from the
poorest air quality in Taiwan. Work has yet to begin on a
long-delayed subway system and residents say a downturn in heavy
industry has accelerated population and brain drain to the north.

while turning Kaohsiung into a Dickensian jungle of polluting
industries, residents complain.
	   In addition to its water woes, the tropical city, where Taiwan's
tallest buildings rise along palm-lined streets, suffers from the
poorest air quality in Taiwan. Work has yet to begin on a
long-delayed subway system and residents say a downturn in heavy
industry has accelerated population and brain drain to the north.

Tax office evacuated by bomb scare

office due to bomb scare. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Police evacuated a downtown building
housing a tax office Thursday and rushed in bomb experts after a
suspicious package was found, a day after 25 letter bombs were
discovered by the post office.
	   Police evacuated the building in Collins Street, which houses an
office of the Australian Taxation Office, and it was believed
Special Operations Group and explosive experts were being brought
to the scene.
	   On Wednesday, a nationwide alert was issued after 21 letter
bombs were found at the Canberra mail sorting center after one
exploded, slightly injuring two postal workers.
	   The previous day a letter bomb had been delivered to a private
Sydney address but it was defused by the police bomb squad when the
person became suspicious.
	   Another two parcel bombs were delivered to homes in Sydney and
Melbourne on Wednesday.
	   Most of the potentially deadly parcels had been addressed to
former or current Australian Taxation Office staff, but some
members of the Human Rights Commission also had been targeted.
	   One was reportedly sent to the Sydney home of federal privacy
commissioner Moira Scollay and another to the Melbourne home of
former federal sex discrimination commissioner Sue Walpole.
	   Police announced they were looking for a 43-year-old man
suspected of masterminding Australia's biggest terrorist campaign,
the mailing of at least 25 letter bombs.
	   The man sought by police was believed to be driving a blue 1985
Toyota Corona sedan with Canberra license plates.
	   Police issued a statement: ``Concerns are held for the well
being of the occupant and safety of the public and it is important
that the vehicle be located as soon as possible.''
	   Police were concerned more letter bombs could still be on their
way to past and present tax officials, sent by what they believe to
be a disgruntled, disturbed person. Police were investigating a
common link between all addressees.
	   Tax Commissioner Michael Carmody said the vast bulk of the
letter bombs were directed at present or former tax office staff.
	   Sources close to the investigation said the matter related to a
personal dispute.
	   The ATO has taken steps to protect its employees and a national
memo to its 17,000 staff warned: ``Please ensure that your families
and others likely to open your mail are informed immediately.''
	   The bombs are in white parcels about the size of a five
computer-disk package.
	   The bombs are designed to explode when opened, although the
device which exploded at the Canberra Mail Center went off when it
was thrown into a sorting basket, slightly injuring the workers.

General Assembly demands that Israel support land for peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. General Assembly adopted
resolutions Wednesday calling Israel's control of Jerusalem illegal
and demanding that Israel support the principle of land for peace
and withdraw from Palestinian territory occupied in 1967.
	   The assembly also called on Israel to withdrawal from the Golan
Heights and to resume talks with Syria and Lebanon.
	   Israel voted against all three resolutions, which are not
legally binding. The United States voted against the resolutions on
the Palestinians and the Golan Heights, and abstained on Jerusalem.
	   The voting this year almost mirrored the vote on similar
resolutions last year:
	   By a vote of 154-2, with three abstentions, the assembly
approved a resolution stressing the need to bring the Mideast peace
process back on track. It also reiterated the inalienable rights of
the Palestinian people to self-determination, and the necessity for
Israel to support the principle of land for peace.
	   By a vote of 149-1 with seven abstentions, the assembly again
adopted a resolution calling Israel's proclamation of Jerusalem as
its capital ``null and void'' and demanding that it be rescinded.
	   By a vote of 97-2 with 58 abstentions, the assembly repeated its
demand for Israel to withdrawal from the Golan Heights to the line
before the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Syrian Ambassador Mikhail Wehbe said Israel was gradually
departing from all the agreements between parties to the peace
talks, to the point of invalidating the peace process which began
in Madrid in 1991.
	   Israel's attempt to replace ``land for peace,'' which was one of
the pillars of the peace process, with a different formula of
``security for peace'' or ``peace for peace'' could result in a
violent tragedy, he warned.
	   In contrast to Israel, he said, Syria said ``yes'' to the Madrid
process and the principle of ``land for peace'' and was in favor of
resuming peace talks at the point where they had been interrupted.
	   Israel's Ambassador Dore Gold said the expression ``land for
peace'' did not appear anywhere in U.N. Security Council
resolutions or at the Madrid conference.
	   If Israel was called on to agree to specific boundaries as
opposed to negotiations for secure borders, that would set a
precedent for the United Nations, he said.
	   Gold said Israel had stated on many occasions its willingness to
resume negotiations with Syria without preconditions. But he said
the resolution attempted to predetermine the outcome by demanding
Israel's withdrawal to the 1967 border.
	   Palestinian observer Nasser al-Kidwa lamented that the
resolution on the peace process could not be adopted without
opposition _ as it was from 1993-96 _ because of Israel's
opposition to the term ``land for peace.''
	   Unfortunately, he said, Israel did not want to return occupied
land to its rightful owner.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh said the United States
opposed the resolution on Mideast peace and the Palestinians
because it injected the General Assembly into issues that were the
subject of direct negotiations between the parties. This was
inappropriate and unhelpful, he said.

Arab group asks for U.N. investigation of U.S. bombing in Sudan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to update with comment from Sudanese
ambassador &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The 22 Arab states at the United Nations
have again asked the Security Council to approve a U.N.
investigation of the U.S. attack on a factory in Sudan, according
to a document released Wednesday.
	   The United States destroyed the Khartoum factory in August after
bombings at two U.S. embassies in Africa, saying the plant made
chemical arms and had links to Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden.
Sudan insisted the plant made only pharmaceuticals.
	   The Arab Group sent a revised draft resolution to the president
of the Security Council requesting Secretary-General Kofi Annan
dispatch a mission ``to verify all facts concerning the Al-Shifa
factory, including its production and ownership.''
	   The resolution asks Annan to submit a report on the mission's
findings within one month of the resolution's adoption.
	   Sudan requested a U.N. investigation immediately after the
attack and demanded compensation from the United States for the
cost of the plant, which it said was used to produce more than 50
percent of the country's medicines.
	   The Arab Group also asked for an investigation, but the council
shelved both requests.
	   The United States says a U.N. investigation is unnecessary
because U.S. intelligence showed that the plant produced chemical
weapons. U.S. officials have cited a soil sample taken from the
grounds of the complex that they say contained Empta, a precursor
chemical for the deadly nerve agent VX.
	   Sudan's U.N. Ambassador Elfatih Mohamed Ahmed Erwa said Bahrain,
the current Security Council president and a member of the Arab
Group, was sponsoring the resolution.
	   ``Now, we're waiting for the Americans to veto it,'' he said
with a laugh.
	   The United States considers Sudan a sponsor of terrorism and has
imposed trade and other economic sanctions.
	   The United States has accused bin Laden of being the architect
of the Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya, which
killed 224 people, including a dozen Americans.
	   On Aug. 20, the United States bombed the Khartoum factory and a
site in Afghanistan that Washington said was a terrorist camp
funded by bin Laden.

Papua New Guinea police search for 50 prison escapees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ More than 50 prisoners
remained at large Thursday following their escape from the
country's biggest prison while hundreds of other inmates protested
food shortages and poor conditions.
	   According to newspaper reports Thursday, 53 prisoners at the
Bomana jail, outside Port Moresby, were still at large after the
breakout about 8 a.m. Wednesday.
	   Correctional Institutions Commissioner Ken Serupi said all 559
prisoners at the jail trampled down a six-foot (two-meter) high
perimeter fence during a roll-call outside their cells.
	   Prison officers managed to herd most of the prisoners back
inside the jail but 58 of them escaped.
	   By last night, four had been recaptured and one had surrendered
to jail staff.
	   The Post-Courier newspaper said hundreds of prisoners who had
been herded back into the jail refused to return to their cells and
stayed in the middle of the jail's sports ground.
	   They remained there until an announcement was made that food
would be sent to the jail.
	   The National newspaper said prisoners had been without proper
meals for three days and only had biscuits to eat.
	   Police were searching for the escapees.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An ambush on an Israeli soldier and a civilian
by a Palestinian mob sent the Mideast peace process into a
tailspin, with Israel halting implementation until the Palestinians
meet a list of demands already deemed unacceptable.
	   The latest crisis hit 10 days before U.S. President Bill Clinton
was to arrive in the region to oversee the next phase of the Wye
River land-for-peace agreement he helped bring to life.
	   In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
that repeated violations of that agreement by Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority had culminated in Wednesday's attack in the
West Bank city of Ramallah.
	   The attack followed the stabbing death earlier Wednesday of an
Arab street cleaner in Jerusalem, apparently by an Israeli
extremist. During the funeral procession for Osama Natche, a
41-year-old father of six, mourners torched an Israeli car and
stoned Israeli police who fired rubber bullets.
	   Hours later, rioting throughout traditionally Arab areas of
Jerusalem continued, with masked Palestinians throwing stones at
cars and blocking roads with burning tires. Jerusalem police
spokesman Shmuel Ben Ruby said five Palestinians were arrested for
throwing stones that shattered a bus window and injured the driver.
	   Netanyahu's security Cabinet announced as a result that it would
not carry out the next troop withdrawal schedule and would not
implement any other areas of the agreement unless Arafat publicly
forsakes plans to unilaterally declare statehood next May.
	   Israel also said the Palestinians must accept that Israel will
not release Palestinian prisoners sentenced for political or
militant acts against Israel and must halt incitement and threats
of violence of any kind.
	   The statement specifically pointed to remarks made a day earlier
by Palestinian legislative speaker Ahmed Qureia, who told
protesters that they had the backing of the Palestinian leadership
which ``is prepared once again to throw stones in order to free the
people.''
	   Both the Palestinians and the United States rejected the Israeli
conditions.
	   ``Mr. Netanyahu is trying to create a crisis before the arrival
of President Clinton. We consider his conditions unacceptable.
Every day he imposes new conditions, this is an attitude that must
not continue, it will not be tolerated,'' said senior Palestinian
official Saeb Erekat. He urged the U.S. administration to
``interfere to ensure the precise and accurate implementation of
the agreement.''
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said
the Israeli troop withdrawals were obligations which Israel must
carry out. ``We do not think it is appropriate to add new
conditions,'' Rubin said. He also condemned the attack against the
soldier.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said Israel would
not allow the peace process to continue under threats of violence.
``The bottom line is that there will be no further withdrawals
unless the Palestinian Authority lives up to all its commitments.''
	   Netanyahu issued a statement saying ``The Palestinian Authority
is encouraging acts of violence, such as today's brutal attack in
Ramallah, in an attempt to pressure Israel with regard to the
matter of the prisoners.''
	   Netanyahu has found himself trapped in a tightening political
vise since he signed the latest accord with Arafat at the White
House in October.
	   Hard-liners in his own coalition opposed to ceding war-captured
territory have all but abandoned Netanyahu in Israel's parliament,
efforts to return a moderate deserted back to his fold have been
fruitless and Jewish settlers, who helped him win election have
said they will run a candidate against him in future.
	   In the Wye agreement, Israel promised to withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank and release 750 Palestinian prisoners by
January. In a first stage last month, it withdrew from 2 percent of
the area and set free 250 prisoners, but most were criminals, not
those held for anti-Israeli activities as the Palestinian Authority
had expected.
	   Arafat raised the issue earlier this week with Clinton in
meetings with Washington.
	   About half of the 2,500 Palestinians held by Israel are members
of Arafat's Fatah faction and there has been growing anger in Fatah
ranks over the Palestinian Authority's failure to get detainees
released.
	   Jewish settlers, who oppose the latest peace deal, issued a
veiled threat of vigilantism following the attack. In a press
statement, settlers said if the Israeli army did not clamp a
closure barring Palestinians from leaving Ramallah, Jewish settlers
``will be forced to do it themselves. Failure to respond seriously
will encourage deeds of this kind as Clinton's visit draws near.''
	   Settler leader Ahron Dombe told The Associated Press, ``We don't
intend to allow Jews to be attacked without a response.'' Asked if
settlers were prepared to clash with Israeli troops over the
matter, he said, ``I hope we won't need to (but) I'm not ruling it
out as a possibility.''

West Bank attack on Israeli soldier shocks Israelis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinians &QL; 
 &UR; By EYAL WARSHAVSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Dozens of Palestinian university
students waited at a traffic circle, holding rocks and slabs of
concrete. They screened cars. ``Wait, it's an Arab,'' one said. ``A
Jew,'' another said.
	   Seconds later, a hail of stones hit the vehicle, smashing its
windows.
	   In the ambush, a young Israeli soldier was dragged out of the
car and, as he cowered on the pavement and raised his hands
defensively, was struck repeatedly on the head with rocks.
	   Captured by cameras, Wednesday's attack was shown over and over
on Israeli television, making some Israelis wonder if the
Palestinian Authority was really trying to control violence as it
pledged in the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace agreement.
	   Earlier, in Jerusalem, an Arab street-cleaner was stabbed to
death, apparently by an Israeli extremist. During the funeral
procession for Osama Natche, a 41-year-old father of six, mourners
torched an Israeli car and stoned Israeli police who fired rubber
bullets.
	   Israel and the Palestinian Authority blamed each other for the
violence, which came 10 days before U.S. President Bill Clinton was
to arrive to usher in the second stage of the land-for-security
agreement.
	   In the Wye agreement, Israel promised to release 750 Palestinian
prisoners by January. It freed 250 prisoners, but mostly criminals,
not those held for anti-Israeli activities.
	   About half of the 2,500 Palestinians held by Israel are members
of Arafat's Fatah faction _ and there has been growing anger in the
ranks over the Palestinian Authority's failure to get them
released.
	   In fact, Fatah members may have been trying to embarrass Arafat
with Wednesday's attack.
	   It began when 150 students from nearby Bir Zeit University were
bused to the West Bank town of Ramallah for a protest. They staged
a march seeking the release of prisoners, then walked to a traffic
circle on the outskirts of town and began stoning Israeli cars.
	   At one point, a white car with Israeli license plates
approached. The vehicle was driven by a man wearing a skullcap, and
a soldier was in the passenger seat.
	   To shouts of ``Yahudi! Yahudi!'' _ the Arabic word for Jew _
about two dozen Palestinians began pelting the car with stones. The
driver fled from the moving car after a large rock broke the side
window and just missed his head.
	   The car then hit a wall, and some attackers jumped on the hood.
Others, rocks in hand, reached inside the car, striking the
soldier. One Palestinian pulled the soldier out and delivered more
blows. Another seized the soldier's M-16 assault rifle.
	   The soldier eventually got up and ran to safety. As he escaped,
the attackers threw more stones at him, then set the car on fire.
	   Israeli troops fired live ammunition and a barrage of
rubber-coated metal bullets and tear gas to disperse the
Palestinians. Eleven Palestinians were injured.
	   The soldier, Assaf Miara, was hospitalized for head injuries.
	   Later, from his hospital bed, Miara watched the incident on
video and quietly cursed once.

Japan's first Olympic gold medalist Mikio Oda dies at 93
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mikio Oda, Japan's first Olympic gold medalist and
a contributor to the nation's track and field development, has died
of a ruptured artery, his family said Thursday. He was 93.
	   Oda, who died Wednesday, won the gold in the triple jump at the
1928 Amsterdam Olympics with a leap of 15.21 meters, boosting
Japanese interest in the world's most prestigious international
event. Three years later, he set a world record by improving his
Olympic record to 15.58 meters.
	   Oda, a native of Hiroshima, had previously set a national record
at the age of 17.
	   Known for his self-discipline and commitment in training, Oda
forced himself to work so hard he once fell asleep over dinner
while holding chopsticks, the national newspaper Asahi wrote
Thursday in its front-page obituary.
	   Oda later became a sports writer for the Asahi before becoming a
professor in the athletics department at Waseda University, his
alma mater.
	   Oda also served as a member of the Japanese Olympic Committee
and an honorary president of the Japan Amateur Athletic Federation.
	   He is survived by his two sons.

Welch says fund use was common
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CARTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ The former head of the Salt Lake Olympic
bid committee said it was common for the privately funded program
to pay for favors for members of the International Olympic
Committee.
	   Thomas K. Welch, who directed the special projects fund for the
Salt Lake Olympic Committee, denied allegations that the favors
were veiled bribes intended to buy the support of IOC members.
	   ``We didn't do anything any different than any other bid
committee,'' he said.
	   SLOC has come under scrutiny since it was revealed last week
that it had helped pay the college tuition for the daughter of an
IOC member. Welch acknowledged the fund and its use to ``help
members of the Olympic family.''
	   That help ranged from the tuition payment to paying the way for
foreign bid committees to come to the United States to learn
English.
	   ``Family helps family, that's what the Olympics is all about,''
Welch said from Park City, Utah. ``This is an insignificant amount
and issue in relation to Salt Lake's winning the bid.''
	   The assistance program apparently was funded with private
donations. More than dlrs 14 million in private donations was
raised to cover the costs of city's bids for the 1998 and 2002
Winter Games.
	   The only known recipient of the program so far is the daughter
of the late IOC member from Cameroon, Africa, Rene Essomba. Sonia
Essomba was given an undetermined amount of money for college
tuition during the time the city was seeking the Olympic bid.
	   Welch, who resigned from SLOC last year following allegations of
spouse abuse, said he could not recall whether anyone else's
tuition was paid, but he did say there were other recipients of the
program's largess.
	   ``I fully suspect and would hope that if somebody needed help in
the Olympic family, that the organizing committee would help
them,'' he said.
	   Salt Lake won the 2002 Games by an overwhelming first-ballot IOC
vote in June 1995.
	   According to a letter dated September 1996, made public last
week, Sonia Essomba was given a SLOC check for more than dlrs
10,000, described as ``our last payment for tuition'' due to budget
constraints.
	   Frank Joklik, the current head of the 2002 Winter Games, said he
had little personal knowledge of the fund, but he denied that it
was used to bribe IOC officials to favor Salt Lake's bid.
	   ``I think it's a sort of defamation which is regrettable,''
Joklik told Around the Rings, an Olympic newsletter published in
Sydney, Australia.
	   ``The aid provided was not any sort of quid pro quo for anyone's
vote, and there was not to my knowledge any suggestion of that.''
	   SLOC is doing its best to produce records from the program,
Joklik said, but some may no longer exist. The organizing committee
has promised to make its findings public.
	   The assistance program has caught the attention of several Utah
officials, who are concerned about the effect the payments will
have on public confidence in Olympic organizers.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Even though this is the first week of December,
the opposing sides in the National Basketball Association lockout
may try to get somewhere by acting like it's June.
	   The owners and players have given themselves the opportunity to
go back to square one in their stalemated labor mess by wiping any
previous progress off the table.
	   When formal collective bargaining talks resume at 10 a.m. EST
(1500 GMT) Thursday, the sides may decide to start from scratch.
	   ``We may have to go a totally different path,'' deputy
commissioner Russ Granik said. ``Maybe there will be something on
Thursday that will surprise me.''
	   ``It may be too late for that,'' union director Billy Hunter
said Wednesday, already finding himself in disagreement with
Granik.
	   In what will be only the second full bargaining session since
the season was supposed to begin Nov. 3, the entire negotiating
teams of owners and players will meet in Manhattan.
	   The last time they met, Nov. 20, both sides called it their most
productive session to date. Yet things quickly fell apart in the
next couple of days as the union said the owners' proposed changes
to free agency timing rules were a ``deal-killer'' and the owners
then said the union had reneged on its acceptance of a complicated
tax formula in the final years of a six- or seven-year deal.
	   The bickering led to 13 days of inactivity, and the sides only
agreed to talk again by agreeing that everyone is flexible and
everything is negotiable.
	   If they can't come up with a solution in the next couple of
weeks, the entire 1998-99 season will be canceled.
	   ``I'm sticking to my statement that we'll be playing by early
January or mid-January,'' Hunter said.
	   So far, the first two months of the season have been scrapped as
the sides have fought over how to divide about dlrs 2 billion in
projected annual revenues.
	   The owners have asked for a 50-50 split, while the players have
tied many of their concessions to receiving 60 percent.
	   The owners moved to 52 and 53 percent on Nov. 20 and the players
dropped to 57 percent, but those concessions are now void under the
ground rules that have been set for the new talks.
	   ``It's not even about finding a middle ground that both sides
can be happy with, it's about finding a middle ground that the
sides can be equally unhappy with,'' said union negotiating team
member Danny Schayes of the Orlando Magic.
	   The sides might decide to scrap their complicated escrow tax
system, which was designed to be a fail-safe in case revenues did
not drop to an agreed-upon level by the fourth year of the deal.
	   Players had previously proposed setting aside 10 percent of
their paychecks in the escrow years, but the owners wanted a backup
in case the 10 percent failed to cover the bill.
	   The sides then agreed in concept on an additional tax on the
highest-spending teams, although they disagreed on how high the tax
rate would be.
	   ``We're creating the most complicated deal in the history of
labor negotiations,'' Granik said. ``Everything is negotiable and
there's always flexibility, but we need to bring the percentage
down and they don't really want to. And that's the problem.''
	   Many players have emphatically told union director Billy Hunter
not to offer anything lower than 57 percent, while the owners have
tied several conditions to their moving higher than 50 percent.
	   Players received 57 percent of revenues last season, and the
owners had the right to seek a new deal if the percentage rose
above 52 percent.
	   Both sides know by now that they'll have to find a number
somewhere in the middle.

Brazilian government suffers setback; Congress blocks austerity
</HEADLINE>
measure &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEX DUFF &QC;

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's government suffered a
major setback in its effort to approve a dlrs 24 billion austerity
package for 1999 when Congress voted against one of its key
measures.
	   Sparking cheers by opposition legislators, Congress voted
205-187 Wednesday to block a proposal to raise the monthly social
security contributions of public workers and, for the first time,
will require retired civil servants to pay. It is the first measure
to be blocked so far.
	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso strongly criticized the
vote, calling it ``incomprehensible'' because international lenders
have approved an aid package worth dlrs 41.5 billion, CBN radio
reported.
	   The aid package, aimed at rescuing Brazil's faltering economy,
was put together on condition the country adopt firm austerity
measures.
	   The proposal's defeat will necessitate extra cuts in public
works and will deprive states of some federal funding, Cardoso
spokesman Sergio Amaral said in a TV interview.
	   It also will delay a fall in interest rates, he said. Rates were
increased to 50 percent in August to stop a rapid outflow of
dollars and have been lowered slowly since then.
	   The proposal was part of a series of tax increases and spending
cuts announced by the government Oct. 28. Other measures include a
higher tax on bank transaction charges and corporate earnings.
	   Amaral said a new vote on the blocked measure would be held in
1999.

Mets hope Ventura signing ends third base problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSH DUBOW &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Robin Ventura, a five-time Gold Glove and potent
left-handed bat, signed a dlrs 32 million, four-year contract with
the Mets on Wednesday, showing the team's willingness to spend
money this offseason and strengthening two infield positions.
	   ``This was the best fit for me,'' said Ventura, who also talked
to Baltimore after the Chicago White Sox decided not to meet his
contract demands.
	   ``They were looking for a left-handed hitting third baseman and
I kind of fit that. After being on a young team the last couple
years, I was looking for a team that could compete. It boiled down
to going to the place with the best chance of winning and that's
why I'm here.''
	   The addition of Ventura means Alfonzo, once thought to be the
answer at third base, will move to second. Alfonzo, who batted .278
with 17 homers and 78 RBIs last season, instantly becomes one of
the top second baseman in the league behind Houston's Craig Biggio
and offers a strong improvement over the departed Carlos Baerga
(.266, 7, 53).
	   Ventura, who broke in with Chicago at the tail end of the 1989
season, has a career average of .274 with 171 homers. After playing
just 54 games in 1997 after breaking his leg and dislocating his
ankle in a spring training slide, he struggled at times last
season, finishing at .263 with 21 homers and 91 RBIs.
	   Ventura will be the 115th player to play third for the Mets.
Only nine of them _ Howard Johnson, Wayne Garrett, Hubie Brooks, Ed
Charles, Dave Magadan, Alfonzo, Lenny Randle, Ray Knight and
Charlie Smith _ played in more than 200 games.

Padres, Hernandez agree to dlrs 6.5 million, three-year deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Slowly reassembling the team that made it to
the World Series, the San Diego Padres on Wednesday gave free agent
catcher Carlos Hernandez a dlrs 6.5 million, three-year contract.
	   Remaining on the market, however, are ace Kevin Brown _ targeted
as the Padres' top offseason priority _ and center fielder Steve
Finley.
	   ``We're glad Carlos is back,'' general manager Kevin Towers
said. ``The one thing we've had that's been a problem over the last
couple of years is the ever-changing catcher when you're trying to
develop pitchers. This should give us a little bit of continuity,
which is important.''
	   In the last three seasons, the Padres have had Brian Johnson,
Brad Ausmus, John Flaherty and Hernandez behind the plate. Last
season was Hernandez's first as a starter after spending one year
as a backup here and seven years as a backup with the Dodgers.
	   Towers and Hernandez's agent, Elliott Vallin, said they hope
re-signing Hernandez has some effect on the Padres' pursuit of
Brown.
	   ``One of the key things with Kevin Brown is that he wanted to
make sure that if he comes back to San Diego, it's with a lot of
his teammates who were here during the special year we had,''
Towers said.
	   Vallin said Hernandez planned to call Brown from his home in
Venezuela.
	   ``He just wanted to say hello and let him know he's coming back,
and that the Padres are always thinking about Kevin,'' Vallin said.
``And when they put the whole thing together, they hope Kevin and
Carlos can be reunited again.''

Tax office evacuated by bomb scare

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with police evacuating Melbourne
building housing tax office due to bomb scare &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Police evacuated a downtown building
housing a tax office Thursday and rushed in bomb experts after a
suspicious package was found, a day after 25 letter bombs were
discovered by the post office.
	   Police evacuated the building on Collins Street, which houses an
office of the Australian Taxation Office, and it was believed
Special Operations Group and explosive experts were being brought
to the scene.
	   On Wednesday, a nationwide alert was issued after 21 letter
bombs were found at the Canberra mail sorting center after one
exploded, slightly injuring two postal workers.
	   The previous day a letter bomb had been delivered to a private
Sydney address but it was defused by the police bomb squad when the
person became suspicious.
	   Another two parcel bombs were delivered to homes in Sydney and
Melbourne on Wednesday.
	   Most of the potentially deadly parcels had been addressed to
former or current Australian Taxation Office staff, but some
members of the Human Rights Commission also had been targeted.
	   One was reportedly sent to the Sydney home of federal privacy
commissioner Moira Scollay and another to the Melbourne home of
former federal sex discrimination commissioner Sue Walpole.
	   Police announced they were looking for a 43-year-old man
suspected of masterminding the mailing of at least 25 letter bombs,
Australia's biggest terrorist campaign.
	   The man sought by police was believed to be driving a blue 1985
Toyota Corona sedan with Canberra license plates.
	   ``Concerns are held for the well being of the occupant and
safety of the public and it is important that the vehicle be
located as soon as possible,'' police said in a statement.
	   Police were concerned more letter bombs could still be on their
way to past and present tax officials, sent by what they believe to
be a disgruntled, disturbed person. Police were investigating a
common link between all addressees.
	   Tax Commissioner Michael Carmody said the vast bulk of the
letter bombs were directed at present or former tax office staff.
	   Sources close to the investigation said the matter related to a
personal dispute.
	   The ATO has taken steps to protect its employees and a national
memo to its 17,000 staff warned: ``Please ensure that your families
and others likely to open your mail are informed immediately.''
	   The bombs are in white parcels about the size of a storage box
that would hold five computer discs.
	   The bombs are designed to explode when opened, although the
device which exploded at the Canberra Mail Center went off when it
was thrown into a sorting basket, slightly injuring the workers.

there was no time to rescue children, other details throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ At least 25 people, mostly children,
were killed in a pre-dawn fire Thursday which raged through an
aging Manila orphanage, fire officials said.
	   Fire officials said at least 70 people were inside the orphanage
and children's home, which includes a two-story building and two
cottages, when the fire broke out about 2 a.m.
	   The dead included about 20 children, officials said.
	   Rescuers gingerly lifted the bodies of infants wrapped in
blankets from the remains of the buildings, which were constructed
between 1913 and 1927.
	   Thirteen dead children were found huddled together in a
storeroom, where they apparently ran in an attempt to escape the
blaze.
	   Elsewhere, a dead adult was found clinging to two children, all
charred beyond recognition.
	   Staff members said the fire burned so quickly that they didn't
have time to rescue many of the children.
	   Some children of working parents also were cared for at night at
the Bahay Kalinga orphanage in Manila's Paco district, and parents
and other relatives wept as they waited for word of their children.
	   Fire Captain Filemon Jaotian said more victims might be under
the rubble.
	   ``Others may still be buried in the debris because the buildings
have been completely razed to the ground,'' he said. ``It will take
several more hours to determine whether there are still people
there.''
	   Fire officials said faulty electrical wiring may have triggered
the fire.
	   ``Most probably the electrical system was also old,'' said Capt.
Pennimore Jaudian, chief arson unit investigator.

WTO appeals for more free trade to cure global woes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 1300 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By CLARE NULLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ World trade is expected to grow by only four
percent this year but pick up slightly in 1999, the World Trade
Organization said Thursday.
	   In its annual report, the WTO urged renewed efforts to open
markets as the best medicine for the current financial woes.
	   ``Resisting protectionism is vital _ but it is not enough,''
said the WTO. ``If the momentum of trade liberalization stops,
recession becomes a real prospect.''
	   ``Global trade in goods and services is the circulatory system
of the world economy,'' it added. ``If this system fails, the
patient will not improve, no matter what the macroeconomic
medicine.''
	   The economic turmoil that has swept through Asia and Russia has
provoked growing calls in the region for more regulation to curb
the excesses of the free market, as well as questions about the
once unchallenged concept of globalization.
	   The WTO, which is responsible for promoting free trade, said
protectionism would be disastrous especially for developing
economies, now that 25 percent of global production is exported.
	   Ever since World War II, the boom in exports and imports has
acted as the engine of economic growth. Trade has grown by a yearly
average of six percent, compared with an average 3.7 percent for
output.
	   In 1997, trade soared by 10 percent.
	   The WTO said trade growth this year was likely to be only 4
percent to 5 percent _ lower than originally predicted.
	   The crisis in Asia _ and particularly Japan _ was primarily to
blame, it said. This was only partly offset by strong demand from
the United States and continental Europe.
	   The slump in oil prices to a 25-year-low and in commodity prices
meant that the value of world trade is likely to stagnate or even
decline this year, it said. The value of world exports last year
was dlrs 5.4 trillion.
	   Asia's share of trade, which rose sharply throughout the 1990's,
will decrease, it said. Shares are also expected to decline in the
Middle East and Africa because of the collapse of oil and commodity
prices.
	   Intra-Asian trade shrunk by one quarter in the first nine months
of the year, said the WTO. Exports from Asia to the rest of the
world fell 7 percent and imports 16 percent.
	   Latin America, which recorded the most dynamic performance of
all regions last year, suffered a sharp slowdown. Exports expanded
by more than 10 percent in 1997, but declined in the third quarter
of this year compared to the same period last year. Brazil was
worst affected.
	   By contrast, the United States played a ``very significant''
role in helping sustain international trade expansion. Imports into
the United States rose 10 percent in real terms and exports about 3
percent in the first nine months, it said.
	   Uncertainty, especially in Russia, made accurate forecasts for
next year very difficult, it said.
	   ``Most forecasters regard a moderate acceleration in volume
growth compared to 1998 as the most likely scenario,'' it said.

Sweden defense forces falling after Cold War
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARALD MOLLERSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ When the Cold War was at its iciest,
Sweden's military was one of the world's strongest. Now the warming
political climate is melting away its might.
	   Sweden hasn't been in a war since 1814 and a cornerstone of
staying at peace for so long was having formidable defense forces.
The strategy was especially important in the decades when the
nearby Soviet Union was seen as a potential threat.
	   After the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia's military was shown
to be poorly maintained and badly fed, the threat from the East
seemed less dire and Sweden began cutting down.
	   Top commanders watched uneasily as defense outlays were shaved _
from 11 percent of the national budget in 1975 to 6.9 percent last
year. The air force, which had been the world's fifth-largest 40
years ago with 850 planes, now is down to 220.
	   The Swedish navy has been pared from a fleet of more than 130
warships including a dozen destroyers and 26 submarines to just 24
lightly armed surface vessels and nine submarines. The army that
once comprised 31 brigades and 155,000 soldiers has seen its force
reduced to 13 brigades and 65,000 men.
	   In the latest blow to the military, the government on Tuesday
announced that it wouldn't appropriate more money to pay for new
equipment that was ordered years ago. Instead, the government
suggested, the military could cover some of the 9.3-billion-kronor
(dlrs 1.16 million) debt by borrowing against future defense
budgets.
	   Supreme Commander Owe Wiktorin found the suggestion humiliating.
	   ``We have always kept our budgets. To borrow money to solve your
problems is a bad solution. Every breadwinner knows that,''
Wiktorin said. ``This is the worst possible scenario.''
	   Wiktorin says the current defense budget of 44 billion kronor
(dlrs 5.5 billion) is about 3 billion kronor (dlrs 375 million)
short. To close the gap, Wiktorin says, the military may have to
limit itself to 6,000 conscripts next year instead of the usual
25,000 and postpone or cancel equipment orders.
	   The latter would be a crushing blow to Sweden's defense
industry, which makes submarines, surface vessels, armaments and
planes. Especially vulnerable would be Saab, the maker of the JAS
Gripen warplane. Sweden is the only country using the Gripen,
although South Africa has indicated it wants to order about two
dozen of the planes.
	   The latest military budget decision reflects not only the new
post-Cold War politics but a new political balance in Sweden.
	   After weak election results in September, the governing Social
Democrats now rely on the Greens and the former communist Left
Party to stay in power _ and those two parties used their strength
to block more money to the military.
	   ``It's unthinkable that defense policy should rest on the Left
Party's and the Greens' views,'' Defense Minister Bjoern von Sydow
complained Tuesday.
	   Early next year the defense staff will submit a report on the
security situation which will form the basis for a government
decision on further cutbacks.

President opens free trade meet in Suriname
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Saying improved roads, ferries and
ports are essential to regional commerce, Suriname's president
urged Caribbean and Latin American countries to cooperate on
infrastructure projects during a meeting on free trade.
	   ``Without realization of projects for joining national transport
systems, the smaller economies of our region will not be able to
realize the promise of the future of the Free Trade Area of the
Americas,'' President Jules Wijdenbosch said.
	   Delegates from 34 countries that comprise the Caribbean and
Latin America are meeting in Paramaribo to discuss details of the
proposed free trade agreement, which seeks to create a European
Community-style free trade area in the Western Hemisphere.
	   Wijdenbosch pointed to Suriname's new ferry to Guyana and plans
to pave the road to Brazil, and said he is seeking money from
international agencies and the Interamerican Development Bank to
fund further transportation projects.
	   Wijdenbosch also emphasized that free trade agreements should be
written to include agricultural exports early in the process of
integration, since smaller countries produce few industrial goods.
	   Hundreds of striking government workers gathered outside the
conference to protest Wijdenbosch's speech and demand his
resignation. They are in the fifth week of a strike demanding
higher wages.

Mexican authorities quell prison disturbance, one inmate dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A brief disturbance by inmates at a prison in
the northern state of Sonora was quelled after one prisoner was
shot to death, apparently by a guard.
	   The disturbance began late Tuesday when about 150 inmates at the
overcrowded Huatabampo prison 810 miles (1,300 kms) northwest of
Mexico City protested unfair treatment and punishment by guards,
the government news agency Notimex reported.
	   Authorities described the incident as a fight among inmates, but
one prisoner was found to have died of shotgun wounds apparently
inflicted by a guard at the facility. Five guards are under
investigation in the shooting, Sonora state Attorney General Miguel
Angel Cortes Ibarra said.
	   Six other inmates and five guards suffered light injuries in the
disturbance, which ended Wednesday.
	   The Huatabampo prison was built to hold 90 inmates but currently
houses 320.

Tax office evacuated by bomb scare

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Police evacuated a downtown building
housing a tax office Thursday and rushed in bomb experts after a
suspicious package was found, a day after 25 letter bombs were
discovered by the post office.
	   Police evacuated the building in Collins Street, which houses an
office of the Australian Taxation Office, and it was believed
Special Operations Group and explosive experts were being brought
to the scene.
	   On Wednesday, a nationwide alert was issued after 21 letter
bombs were found at the Canberra mail sorting center after one
exploded, slightly injuring two postal workers.
	   The previous day a letter bomb had been delivered to a private
Sydney address but it was defused by the police bomb squad when the
person became suspicious.
	   Another two parcel bombs were delivered to homes in Sydney and
Melbourne on Wednesday.
	   Most of the potentially deadly parcels had been addressed to
former or current Australian Taxation Office staff, but some
members of the Human Rights Commission also had been targeted.
	   One was reportedly sent to the Sydney home of federal privacy
commissioner Moira Scollay and another to the Melbourne home of
former federal sex discrimination commissioner Sue Walpole.
	   The federal human rights commission has contacted all past and
present staff believed endangered by a mail bomber targeting tax
office and commission workers, it said Thursday.
	   All mail was now being screened and staff had been warned to
check their home mail carefully before opening it, Human Rights and
Equal Opportunity Commission executive director Diana Temby said.
	   Police announced they were looking for 43-year-old Colin George
Dunstan of Canberra, whom they said was suspected of masterminding
Australia's biggest terrorist campaign, the mailing of at least 25
letter bombs.
	   He was believed to be driving a blue 1985 Toyota Corona sedan
with Canberra license plates.
	   Police were concerned more letter bombs could still be on their
way to past and present tax officials, sent by what they believe to
be a disgruntled, disturbed person. Police were investigating a
common link between all addressees.
	   Tax Commissioner Michael Carmody said the vast bulk of the
letter bombs were directed at present or former tax office staff.
	   Sources close to the investigation said the matter related to a
personal dispute.
	   The ATO has taken steps to protect its employees and a national
memo to its 17,000 staff warned: ``Please ensure that your families
and others likely to open your mail are informed immediately.''
	   The bombs are in white parcels about the size of a five
computer-disk package.
	   The bombs are designed to explode when opened, although the
device which exploded at the Canberra Mail Center went off when it
was thrown into a sorting basket, slightly injuring the workers.

Report: Thai youth who raped two girls offers to marry them
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A member of a gang that abducted two
girls from a Bangkok bus and raped them, has offered to make amends
by taking the two as his wives, The Nation newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   A lawyer for Surisan Praphansak said his client had written a
letter to the court seeking bail and offering a ``compromise by
saying I'll take the two girls as my wives and seek leniency,''
according to the newspaper.
	   Surisan is one of five vocational school students arrested for
allegedly forcing the girls, 14 and 17 years of age, off a city bus
at knife point last month, taking them to a nearby house and gang
raping them.
	   The case has caused an uproar in Thailand, with newspapers
running several news and feature stories questioning how young Thai
men could be capable of such an act, and why the bus passengers did
not help the girls.
	   Politicians and other public figures have offered explanations
such as that the youths were frustrated with the bureaucracy of the
education system. Some have proposed shutting their vocational
school.
	   Some women's activists have been quoted as pointing to a
cultural view of women as property.

Oscar-winning cinematographer Freddie Young dies at 96
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARA D. BELLABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Freddie Young, a triple Oscar winner for his
cinematography on the legendary films ``Lawrence of Arabia,''
``Doctor Zhivago'' and ``Ryan's Daughter,'' has died. He was 96.
	   He died Tuesday in London, according to obituaries in British
newspapers. No cause of death was given.
	   Young was responsible for what some consider the greatest shot
in cinema _ the three-minute segment of David Lean's ``Lawrence of
Arabia'' in which Peter O'Toole and his guide watch a figure slowly
emerge from the desert heat.
	   Born in London on Oct. 9, 1902, Young was the seventh of eight
children. He left school at 14 and worked briefly at a munitions
factory before becoming an apprentice in the film industry.
	   His first film credit as assistant cameraman appeared in 1922 on
``Rob Roy,'' and by 1934 he had notched 25 credits on mostly
forgettable films, The Guardian reported.
	   In 1937, Young worked on his first big-budget film, the
historical drama ``Victoria the Great'' by director Herbert Wilcox.
The film's final reel ran in color, launching Young's career as a
color cinematographer. That led to more films and, finally, his
breakthrough in Michael Powell's ``49th Parallel'' in 1941,
starring Eric Portman and Laurence Olivier.
	   Young continued working nonstop for more than a quarter century,
producing some of his best work when he neared _ and passed _
retirement age.
	   He received his first Oscar nomination for work on ``Ivanhoe''
in 1950, directed by Richard Thorpe. He followed that with work on
John Ford's ``Mogambo'' in 1953 and Gene Kelly's ``Invitation to
the Dance'' in 1956.
	   In 1962, he filmed ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' winning his first
Oscar at the age of 60. That was followed by another David Lean
film and another Oscar for his work on ``Doctor Zhivago'' in 1965.
	   His later films _ when he was well into his 70s _ included
Oscar-winning work on Lean's ``Ryan's Daughter'' which took a
grueling 15 months to complete in 1970. He also won an Emmy for a
television version of ``Macbeth.''
	   In 1972, he was named a Fellow of the British Association for
Film and Television Arts _ only the second person to receive that
honor after Alfred Hitchcock.
	   While in his 80s, Young turned his hand to directing, making a
small film about an elderly man's devotion to his cricket field.
The Times said Young recently had been working on his memoirs, and
a book, ``Seventy Light Years: A Life in Movies'' is scheduled for
publication in February.
	   Young is survived by his second wife, Joan, and a son, David.
His first wife, Marjorie, died in 1963.
	   Funeral arrangements were not available.

 &UR; Norman tied for early clubhouse lead &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: WILL BE LED at end of play Thursday, likely about 0800GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Greg Norman fashioned an up-and-down
2-under-par 70 Thursday to take the early first-round clubhouse
lead with Canadian Rick Gibson at the Australian Open golf
championship.
	   Under ideal weather conditions at the tough par-72 Royal
Adelaide course _ temperatures of 18C (65F) and a light breeze _
Norman, playing his first 72-hole tournament since undergoing
shoulder surgery eight months ago, was at 3-under through eight
holes after birdies on the par-5 second, the par-3 seventh and
par-4 eighth.
	   But Norman, a five-time winner of this tournament and who lost
in a playoff to England's Lee Westwood last year, took a
double-bogey seven after hitting into the high green-side rough on
the ninth to make the turn in 36, one under the card.
	   He made successive birdies on 10 and 11 before bogeying the
tough par-4, 395-meter 13th, bogeyed 15 and birdied 17 before his
15-foot downhill right-to-left birdie putt on 18 was short.
	   ``I think it's going to be hard for anyone to go around this
course without hitting two or three bogeys,'' Norman said. ``The
course forces you to play defensively. But overall I'm pleased with
the way things went.''
	   Gibson was 3-under after nine and went to 4-under after
birdieing the par-3 12th, but bogeyed 13 and 15.
	   Five-time British Open champion Peter Thomson was commissioned
by the Australian Golf Union to revamp Royal Adelaide for the Open.
	   Thomson, who is also captain of the International team for next
week's Presidents Cup, added about 300 meters to the now
6,565-meter (7,178-yard) course, grew out the rough and extended it
further into the fairways and added 20 bunkers.
	   Although the conditions were ideal for the first round, Norman,
Gibson and Australian David Watson (71) were the only players to
break par with about one-quarter of the 126-man field finished
their rounds. (djp)

Japanese stocks, dollar fall against yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks fell sharply during morning trading
Thursday following an overnight decline on Wall Street. The U.S.
dollar slid against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 257.36 points,
or 1.72 percent, to 14,729.26 points at the end of the morning
session. On Wednesday, the index had risen 151.21 points, or 1.02
percent.
	   The dollar bought 120.41 yen in late morning trading, down 1.47
yen from late in Tokyo Wednesday but higher than its late New York
level of 119.93 yen overnight.
	   The dollar remained above the New York level as institutional
investors bought the U.S. currency earlier in the session for new
investments in dollar-denominated assets, traders said.
	   Many traders said, however, that the dollar could face more
selling pressure given uncertainly over the outlook for U.S.
financial markets.
	   On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 69 points to
9,064.54 on concerns about the deteriorating corporate earnings
outlook because of weak demand from Asia.
	   On the Tokyo stock market, share prices were under selling
pressure following an overnight drop in U.S. stocks and the
dollar's overnight retreat against the yen.
	   Investors also turned bearish amid uncertainty about the
Japanese government's upcoming economic measures, traders said.
	   ``The market lacks both buying and selling incentives and
activities are sparse,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko
Securities Co.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party and opposition Liberal Party
are currently coordinating economic policies, including what to do
about the country's unpopular consumption tax.
	   Trading was rather subdued ahead of the ``special quotation''
settlement of December futures and options next week, traders said.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 15.01 points, or 1.31 percent, to 1,132.14. The
TOPIX rose 4.89 points, or 0.43 percent, the previous day.
	   The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond fell to
1.130 percent from Wednesday's close of 1.155 percent, driving its
price up to 105.76 yen from the previous day's 105.53 yen.

Former coup leader urges tumult not to tolerate election fraud

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The former coup plotter leading polls
for next weekend's presidential vote urged hundreds of thousands of
supporters in downtown Caracas not to tolerate any attempts to
steal the elections.
	   ``Let us declare ourselves on alert ... because these elections
will not be stolen from us,'' former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez intoned
Wednesday during the final rally of his campaign. If the victory he
expects is not respected, he said, ``we will make them respect
it.''
	   It wasn't a direct call to violence, but Chavez has said in the
past he would not be able to control the masses if the kind of
fraud seen in past Venezuelan elections occurs on Sunday.
	   Chavez's anti-corruption candidacy has polarized Venezuela
between millions of poor people who see him as a hero and the
wealthy establishment that fears he will install a Cuba-like
dictatorship.
	   A sea of supporters of the former army paratrooper wore his
trademark red beret and cheered wildly when the candidate gave a
fiery speech steeped in messianic imagery and peppered with
biblical references and quotes from South American liberator Simon
Bolivar.
	   Sporting his own red beret, a militaristic image that has scared
many in the Venezuelan elite, Chavez spoke from a hydraulic lift
high above a wide, 10-block avenue jammed with people.
	   He repeatedly referred to his Feb. 4, 1992, attempt to overthrow
then-President Carlos Andres Perez _ an attempted coup that landed
him in jail for two years.
	   ``We said we would go to prison but that we would return. And
here we are,'' Chavez said. The crowd roared.
	   Recent polls have given Chavez a comfortable lead over his
nearest rival, Yale-educated businessman Henrique Salas Romer.
	   During the past week, Venezuela's two traditional parties have
dumped their respective candidates and threw their support to Salas
in a last ditch effort to head off a Chavez victory.
	   ``The miracle here is that all those who are corrupt have joined
forces so that we can sweep them all away together,'' Chavez
declared. ``They've made our job easier.''

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ At least 27 people, mostly children,
were killed in a pre-dawn fire Thursday which raged through an
aging Manila orphanage, fire officials said.
	   At least 70 people were inside the orphanage and children's home
when the fire broke out at about 2 a.m., officials said.
	   The dead included at least 20 children.
	   Rescuers gingerly lifted the bodies of small infants wrapped in
blankets from the remains of the structures, which included a
two-story building and two cottages which were built between 1913
and 1927.
	   Thirteen dead children were found huddled together in a
storeroom of one of the cottages where they apparently ran in an
attempt to escape the blaze.
	   ``Nobody was able to escape from that cottage because the fire
was there,'' said Clever Regoso, a boy survivor, who listed the
names of friends who had died.
	   Elsewhere, a dead adult was found clinging to two children, all
charred beyond recognition.
	   Staff members said the fire burned so quickly that they did not
have time to rescue many of the children.
	   Some children of working parents also were cared for at night at
the private Bahay Kalinga orphanage in Manila's Paco district, and
parents and other relatives wept as they waited for word of their
children.
	   Fire officials said the main building's second floor collapsed,
and more victims might be under the rubble.
	   ``Others may still be buried in the debris because the buildings
have been completely razed to the ground,'' said Fire Captain
Filemon Jaotian. ``It will take several more hours to determine
whether there are still people there.''
	   Fire officials said faulty electrical wiring may have triggered
the fire.
	   ``Most probably the electrical system was also old,'' said Capt.
Pennimore Jaudian, chief arson unit investigator.

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Police evacuated a downtown building
housing a tax office Thursday and rushed in bomb experts after a
suspicious package was found, a day after 25 letter bombs were
discovered by the post office in the capital, Canberra.
	   Police evacuated the building in Collins Street, which houses an

	   On Wednesday, a nationwide alert was issued after 21 letter
bombs were found at the Canberra mail sorting center after one
exploded, slightly injuring two postal workers.
	   The previous day a letter bomb had been delivered to a private
Sydney address but it was defused by the police bomb squad when the
person became suspicious.
	   Another two parcel bombs were delivered to homes in Sydney and
Melbourne on Wednesday.
	   Most of the potentially deadly parcels had been addressed to
former or current Australian Taxation Office staff, but some
members of the Human Rights Commission also had been targeted.
	   One was reportedly sent to the Sydney home of federal privacy
commissioner Moira Scollay and another to the Melbourne home of
former federal sex discrimination commissioner Sue Walpole.
	   The federal human rights commission has contacted all past and
present staff believed endangered by a mail bomber targeting tax
office and commission workers, it said Thursday.
	   All mail was now being screened and staff had been warned to
check their home mail carefully before opening it, Human Rights and
Equal Opportunity Commission executive director Diana Temby said.
	   Police announced they were looking for 43-year-old Colin George
Dunstan of Canberra, whom they said was suspected of mailing at
least 25 letter bombs, masterminding Australia's biggest terrorist
campaign.
	   He was believed to be driving a blue 1985 Toyota Corona sedan
with Canberra license plates.
	   Police were concerned more letter bombs could still be on their
way to past and present tax officials, sent by what they believe to
be a disgruntled, disturbed person. Police were investigating a
common link between all addressees.
	   Tax Commissioner Michael Carmody said the vast bulk of the
letter bombs were directed at present or former tax office staff.
	   Sources close to the investigation said the matter related to a
personal dispute.
	   The ATO has taken steps to protect its employees and a national
memo to its 17,000 staff warned: ``Please ensure that your families
and others likely to open your mail are informed immediately.''
	   The bombs are in white parcels about the size of a storage box
that would hold five computer discs.
	   The bombs are designed to explode when opened, although the
device which exploded at the Canberra Mail Center went off when it
was thrown into a sorting basket, slightly injuring the workers.

Secretary-general accuses Afghanistan's neighbors of promoting
</HEADLINE>
unrest &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite knowing that fighting in
Afghanistan threatens their own security, neighboring nations are
still interfering in and exacerbating the conflict, the U.N. chief
said in a report.
	   A cease-fire and the start of peace talks to create a
multi-ethnic and representative government for Afghanistan ``cannot
be attained without a concerted effort by all the outside powers
concerned,'' Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in the report to the
General Assembly released Wednesday.
	   Reports of mass killings and other human rights violations by
the Taliban religious militia were of major concern, Annan said. He
said he planned to ask that a U.N. mission begin monitoring parts
of Afghanistan to promote respect for humanitarian law and human
rights.
	   Annan didn't name specific nations contributing to the Afghan
conflict, but the Taliban _ who now control about 90 percent of
Afghanistan _ accuse Iran, Russia and the Central Asian nations of
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan of arming and financing their opponents.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance, which controls about 10 percent of
the country, say Pakistan is arming the Taliban and sending in
military advisors and soldiers to bolster their ranks, a charge
Pakistan denies.
	   While Annan welcomed efforts by eight nations that are trying to
work out a solution to the Afghan situation _ Iran, Pakistan,
Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, China and the United
States _ he said he was disappointed that some of those countries
were still supplying weapons and other war material which were
fueling the conflict.
	   ``Afghanistan, once a flashpoint of superpower rivalry, has now
become the stage for a new, regional version of the `Great Game,'
in which the domestic, economic and national security interests of
Afghanistan's neighbors and their supporters are played out,'' the
secretary-general said.
	   ``A vicious cycle has developed in which the inability of the
Afghan factions to agree to a political settlement is both the
cause and the effect of persistent outside interference in the
affairs of Afghanistan,'' he said.
	   While he recognized that countries had legitimate interests to
protect in Afghanistan, Annan said he found it paradoxical that
instead of promoting peace ``these countries continue their
clandestine military support for their favored Afghan factions,
despite their professed recognition that the prolongation of the
conflict poses a threat to their own stability.''
	   While the Taliban has scored military victories and taken
control of most of the country, Annan said their success on the
battlefield appeared to have lessened the desire for a negotiated
peace.
	   The Taliban victories have also increased the prospect of a
``deeper regionalization'' of the conflict, Annan said.
	   Annan said it was his ``strong hope'' that U.N. staff will
shortly be able to return to Afghanistan but stressed that the
Taliban must provide complete reports on the slayings of three U.N.
workers.
	   The United Nations withdrew its international staff after the
deaths, and has said staffers won't return without guarantees that
their security will be assured and that they can work without
constraints imposed by the Taliban.

Customs Service drug searches prompt horror tales, lawsuits

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Returning to Chicago from Jamaica, Gwendolyn
Richards was plucked from a line of air travelers by a Customs
Service inspector and ordered into a bare, windowless room. Over
the next five hours, she was strip-searched, handcuffed, X-rayed,
and probed internally by a doctor.
	   The armed Customs officers who led Richards in handcuffs through
O'Hare International Airport and drove her to a hospital for
examination suspected she might be smuggling drugs. They found
nothing.
	   ``I was humiliated _ I couldn't believe it was happening,'' said
Richards, who is black and has joined a civil rights lawsuit
against Customs. ``They had no reason to think I had drugs.''
	   Richards, 27, isn't alone.
	   Officers last year ordered partial or full strip searches or
X-rays for 2,447 airline passengers, and found drugs on 27 percent
of them, according to figures compiled by the U.S. Customs Service.
	   Customs officials say tough tactics are necessary to catch the
growing number of smugglers who swallow cocaine-filled balloons,
insert packages of heroin into their body cavities, even hide drugs
in a hollow leg or under cover of a fake pregnancy.
	   ``We still have a major drug problem in this country,'' Customs
Commissioner Raymond Kelly said in an interview Wednesday. ``We
have to do this.''
	   Richards and others who have sued Customs have alleged they were
targeted because of their race. Sixty percent of those pulled aside
last year for body searches or X-rays were black or Hispanic,
Customs figures show. Thirty-three percent of Hispanics who were
searched were found to have drugs compared with 31 percent of
blacks and 26 percent of whites.
	   Kelly said race isn't a factor. ``There are higher risk
countries and higher risk flights,'' he said. ``Those flights may
be more populated by a particular ethnic group.''
	   Last year, the Customs Service seized 858 pounds (386 kilograms)
of cocaine and 803 pounds (361 kilograms) of heroin attached to or
inside international air travelers' bodies, officials said. More
than 70 percent of the heroin seized at airports was smuggled that
way.
	   Acknowledging that searches ``can get pretty traumatic,'' Kelly
said Customs is reviewing its policies and experimenting with new
technology that might reduce the number of body searches. The
review comes after several lawsuits and complaints from travelers
who say they suffered abusive treatment and hours of confinement.
For instance:
	   _A Florida mother says her baby was born prematurely because
Customs officials forced her to take a prescription laxative when
she was seven months pregnant. In a lawsuit filed last month,
Janneral Denson, 25, said she was taken from the Fort
Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and shackled to a
hospital bed for two days so inspectors could watch her bowel
movements. She says her son, born 12 days later, suffered damage.
	   _Two Jamaican-born U.S. citizens each filed a dlrs 500,000 claim
in September over body cavity searches and X-rays in Tampa,
Florida. One of the women learned afterwards she was pregnant and
agonized that her fetus might have been harmed, according to their
attorney, Warren Hope Dawson. The baby was born healthy. Customs
policy requires a pregnancy test before a woman is X-rayed, but
Dawson said the pregnant woman was not tested.
	   _A 51-year-old widow returning from an around-the-world trip was
held for 22 hours at a San Francisco hospital, x-rayed and given
the same powerful laxative. Amanda Buritica of Port Chester, New
York won a dlrs 451,001 lawsuit last February. A Boston nurse,
Bosede Adedeji, won dlrs 215,000 in a similar lawsuit in 1991.
	   Customs officials note that fewer than 2 percent of the 68
million fliers who pass through Customs each year have their
luggage opened. Far fewer _ about 49,000 people _ are personally
searched, usually with a pat down.
	   The 1,772 strip searches last year ranged from people told to
remove their socks to passengers like Richards who were ordered to
take off their underwear and bend over. Strip searches are
performed by officers of the same gender.
	   The Customs review found 19 passengers who were subjected to
pelvic or rectal exams by doctors while inspectors watched. Drugs
were found in 12 of those cases.
	   Congress and courts have given Customs broad authority to search
for drugs, weapons and other illegal imports.
	   The Supreme Court ruled that Customs officers at airports and
border crossings don't need the probable cause or warrants that
police need to search possessions. Customs officers can perform a
strip search based on ``reasonable suspicion'' that someone might
be hiding something illegal.
	   A Customs handbook obtained by The Associated Press advises
officers that reasonable suspicion usually requires a combination
of factors, including someone who: appears nervous, wears baggy
clothing, gives vague or contradictory answers about travel plans,
acts unusually polite or argumentative, wears sunglasses or acts
sick. Race isn't cited.

Blair ends meeting among deadlocked Belfast politicians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS pvs to UPDATE with Blair's departure and no major
breakthrough &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony
Blair emerged from seven hours of grueling talks in Belfast early
Thursday without breaking the impasse between Protestant and
Catholic politicians.
	   But Protestant leader David Trimble and Catholic leader Seamus
Mallon said some progress had been made, and they planned to brief
party members Thursday in the hope of reaching a deal to get the
historic April peace accord back on track. Although Trimble
cautioned that no one should expect any ''dramatic'' announcements.
	   ''The deal is not yet done, but we are getting there,'' said a
British government spokesman, speaking with customary anonymity, as
Blair left for London. Blair did not comment to reporters.
	   Blair flew in Wednesday _ his second trip to Stormont
Parliamentary Building in east Belfast in a week _ in a move
designed to counter widespread fears that the Good Friday agreement
was festering through neglect.
	   The multi-party administration envisioned in the accord has not
yet been formed. Instead the planned leaders, Trimble and Mallon,
still haven't agreed how many more positions the administration
should have _ Trimble says six, Mallon 10. Although, there was some
suggestion after the talks Thursday that Trimble might agree to a
compromise of 10 positions, in exchange for the withdrawal of some
other Catholic demands.
	   The more contentious point, however, is whether the IRA-allied
Sinn Fein party can participate if the Irish Republican Army
doesn't start disarming. Trimble is demanding the long-postponed
gesture as evidence that the outlawed group, 16 months into a
cease-fire, has really renounced violence.
	   Also in dispute is the extent of Northern Ireland's cooperation
with the Irish Republic, which won independence from Britain in
1922.
	   April's agreement specified that Belfast politicians should sit
in at least six committees with their southern Irish counterparts,
pursuing joint policy-making in noncontentious areas such as
fisheries, animal health and tourism.
	   Catholics hoped this experiment would promote their goal of
eventual Irish unification, but Trimble refused to agree to the
creation of more powerful committees coordinating policies like
investment and economic development.
	   Trimble said talks with Blair had brought them ''closer to a
resolution.'' And Mallon called the progress ''significant.''
	   Trimble's Ulster Unionist Party and Mallon's Social Democratic
and Labor Party represent most Protestant and Catholic opinion in
Northern Ireland.
	   Meanwhile, opposition lawmakers in London's House of Commons
attacked Blair on Wednesday over his government's continuing
paroles of IRA members and pro-British militants.
	   ``I understand the concerns of people who see those who have
committed appalling murders being released on license,'' Blair
responded. ``However, it is important ... that we hold to our part
of the bargain.''
	   The agreement specified that convicted members of
truce-observing armed groups, responsible for the bulk of more than
3,400 killings in Northern Ireland's conflict, should be paroled by
May 2000.
	   But it also identified May 2000 as the deadline for those groups
to have finished destroying their hidden weapons stockpiles. The
IRA and the major pro-British groups, the Ulster Defense
Association and Ulster Volunteer Force, insist they won't do this.

Baseball team investigating reports of sign-stealing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese professional baseball team is
investigating reports that accuse its players and employees of a
complex sign-stealing scam: using a stadium TV camera and a person
in the stands signaling with a megaphone.
	   The embarrassing allegations against the Daiei Hawks, based in
Fukuoka, southwestern Japan, have alarmed this baseball-crazy
country. The scandal has dominated news coverage since it first
surfaced Wednesday in the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper.
	   Daiei _ which finished tied for third this season in the
six-club Pacific League _ will present the results of its
investigation to the league office within a week, a team official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Thursday,
	   ``I can't believe it,'' Daiei manager Sadaharu Oh, a former
Yomiuri Giants slugger who holds Japan's career record of 868 home
runs, told reporters. ``I'd like to believe my players.''
	   The three Daiei players accused of involvement in the scam
denied any wrongdoing, the team official said.
	   According to the charges, a team employee sitting in front of a
TV monitor watched footage from one of four cameras around Fukuoka
Dome, Daiei's home stadium, that clearly showed the catcher of the
other team.
	   The employee deciphered the catcher's signs and used a
walkie-talkie to tell what pitch was coming to a youngster in the
stands, who had been especially hired for the job, Japanese media
reports said.
	   The youngster then relayed that information to the batter, using
his megaphone. A megaphone held before his face meant the pitcher
was about to throw a fastball. A megaphone held out toward the
right was a curve or a slider, and to the left a forkball, the
reports say.
	   Daiei President Hiroshi Murakami held a news conference
Wednesday, promising to get to the bottom of the scandal. The
cheating allegedly began last year and continued into the latest
season ending in October, Daiei said.
	   Blatant spying is against Japanese professional baseball rules,
although the Pacific League does not clearly state the penalties.
The rival Central League has the punishment in writing, including a
possible lifetime ban from baseball.
	   Trying to figure out an opposing team's next play by deciphering
managers' and players' signs is common, especially in Japanese
baseball, which, unlike the U.S. major leagues, tends to rely more
on strategy than physical prowess.
	   Catchers around the world use signs to communicate with their
pitchers, but some Japanese catchers use extremely complicated
signs to avoid detection from the other team.

Honduran official: Government did not inflate Mitch death toll
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Interior Secretary Delmer Urbizo
has denied that Honduras had exaggerated reports of deaths caused
by Hurricane Mitch, after press reports suggested that high counts
may have been a bid to attract aid.
	   Urbizo spoke at a press conference on Wednesday, one day after
the government suspended a governor for inflating her region's
death toll from Mitch and lowered its official nation-wide death
count by 1,350 people.
	   ``Honduras has never had an interest or a need to inflate
figures from Hurricane Mitch,'' Urbizo said.
	   ``The death toll is only part of the tragedy ... The fundamental
thing is that Honduras was completely destroyed'' by flooding
caused by the storm early this month, he said.
	   The latest death toll _ lowered from 7,007 to 5,657 _ was
compiled after the government sent teams to verify reports from
regions across Honduras, the Interior Secretariat said Tuesday. In
addition to the dead, Honduras said it had verified 8,058 missing,
12,272 injured and 1.4 million homeless throughout the country.
	   On Nov. 2, Honduras' official death toll jumped from 600 to
5,000. Later, authorities raised the figure to 6,400, then last
week to 7,007.
	   The revised figure from Honduras lowers the overall death toll
in Central America from Hurricane Mitch to 9,071.

Asian Games athletes blow off Bangkok pollution worries
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GRANT PECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Where there's bad traffic, there's bad
pollution, so athletes taking part in the 13th Asian Games
beginning Sunday in Bangkok ought to be worried, right?
	   Yes and no.
	   The harmful effects of pollutants such as ozone, carbon
monoxide, fine particles, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and lead
are well known. Air pollution contributes to lung disease,
including respiratory tract infections, asthma and lung cancer.
	   A person taking rigorous exercise increases his intake of air by
as much as 10 times over his intake at rest. For endurance
athletes, such as marathon runners and cyclists, the increase is
even higher.
	   At the same time, breathing through the mouth bypasses the nose,
the body's natural filter against impurities in the air.
	   All of which means that if there are nasty things in the air, an
athlete will get more than his or her fair share.
	   Children at play breathe more and faster than adults, and are
generally more at risk. Some cities ban school sports when there
are heavy smog levels, as happened in January last year in Lyon,
France.
	   When it comes to major international sporting competitions,
however, air pollution seems to be a minor concern.
	   Pollution levels don't seem to be a big consideration when it
comes to selecting competition sites _ witness the choice of past
and future Olympic cities such as Mexico City, Los Angeles, Atlanta
and Athens, Greece, none of which would win any clean-air awards.
	   Statistically, Bangkok's pollution levels don't fare
particularly better or worse than other megacities, an observation
supported by the comments of some visiting teams.
	   Dr. Raul Alcantara, a sports doctor accompanying the Philippine
team, is bringing asthma drugs just in case his athletes suffer any
pulmonary problems.
	   ``If the pollution in Bangkok will just be the same level as in
Manila, I don't think that will pose much of a problems for our
athletes,'' Alcantara said.
	   Air pollution is not a concern of the Japanese team, said Hitomi
Kurokawa, a spokeswoman for the Japan International Olympic
Committee.
	   Members of the Chinese basketball team were similarly unfazed.
China's cities suffers from some of the worst air pollution in the
world.
	   ``Pollution is pretty terrible in Beijing these days too,'' said
player Wang Zhizhi.
	   Team leader Kuang Lubin put a better face on it.
	   ``The Asian Games village is in the suburbs of Bangkok so I
think the air there should be quite good,'' Kuang said.
	   His opinion is shared by many people, including at least one
member of the Bangkok games medical subcommittee.
	   Pollution levels at the competition sites are apparently not
known. An official at the Pollution Control Department of
Thailand's Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment said
Wednesday they had taken no measurements at the venues.
	   Pollution and environmental issues have barely been addressed by
the Bangkok games' organizers. Serious efforts are being made to
curb traffic, but this is more to facilitate travel between venues
than out of explicit concern for air quality.
	   Atlanta, which hosted the 1996 Olympics, has yet to meet U.S.
federal clean air standards for ozone that were set in 1990.
	   But in an effort to curb pollution at the games, it organized a
``Clean Air Team'' transport fleet of 700 trucks, vans, sedans and
buses operating on alternative fuels such as natural gas,
electricity and propane.
	   Athens, picked last year to host the 2004 Olympics, has some of
the highest pollution levels in Europe. For several years the
government has mandated staggered working hours, and during
periodic smog emergencies, it places limits on traffic in the city
center. It has a plan to reduce smog by 25 percent by the time the
games roll around.
	   Thailand has successfully tackled some of its air pollution
problems in recent years, most notably bringing down the levels of
lead and carbon monoxide.
	   Particulates remain a major problem, however, and the Pollution
Control Department's most recent available daily reading, for
Tuesday, showed the amount of fine particles in the air around the
capital to be on the cusp between ``moderate'' and ``unhealthful''
levels, still a long way from the worst category of ``hazardous.''
	   Fine particles are a matter of health concern ``because they can
easily reach the deepest recesses of the lungs,'' says the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.

Neighbors beg Papua New Guinea to set up Bougainville
</HEADLINE>
reconciliation government &QL; 
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Pacific neighbors Australia and New
Zealand jointly appealed to Papua New Guinea on Thursday to quickly
set up a reconciliation government on the secessionist island of
Bougainville.
	   Papua New Guinea's Parliament adjourned Wednesday without
passing the legislation needed to set up the proposed all-party
government, agreed upon as part of cease-fire arrangements after a
secessionist conflict lasting some 10 years on Bougainville.
	   Parliament is not due to reconvene in Papua New Guinea until
next July 13.
	   Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and his New
Zealand counterpart Don McKinnon made the appeal together in
Canberra, after regular talks between the two governments.
	   The Papua New Guinea opposition blamed that country's Prime
Minister Bill Skate for the failure, saying he had adjourned
Parliament early to avoid a no-confidence motion that would have
brought down his government.
	   Papua New Guinea opposition leader Bernard Narakobi said Skate
had put the entire country's political and social stability at
risk.
	   Both Downer and McKinnon urged the Papua New Guinea Parliament
to reconvene, however briefly, to pass the legislation needed to
set up the reconciliation government.
	   McKinnon said the women of Bougainville, in particular, are
anxious for peace and stability to be restored on the island, the
site of what was once the world's biggest copper mine.
	   ``The important thing is to get things back to normal,''
McKinnon said.
	   He said children on the island had not attended school for 10
years, because of the secessionist conflict.
	   Bougainville became part of Papua New Guinea, when that country
gained independence from its colonial ruler, Australia, in 1975.
	   But racial and financial differences quickly led to the
secessionist conflict.
	   Despite its riches, Bougainville is one of the least developed
places on earth, and the schools and hospitals it had all ceased to
operate during the war.
	   New Zealand helped to broker the cease-fire that brought the
fighting to at least a temporary end.
	   Australia is supporting it logistically with peace monitoring
troops and other resources, costing some 4 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.5 million) a month.
	   The interim reconciliation government was to have been made up
of a mix of elected and appointed representatives from all factions
involved in the conflict on Bougainville, which ended with the
signing of the peace accord early this year.
	   An interim government will continue to rule the island until the
reconciliation government is established.

Thai opposition will impeach Prime Minister over IMF dealings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The opposition will impeach Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai for allegedly violating the new constitution
by signing letters of intent to the International Monetary Fund
without consulting parliament, Thai newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The New Aspiration Party of former Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh will file a petition on Dec. 9 to dismiss Chuan and
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, The Nation quoted NAP
spokesman Suraporn Danaitangtrakul as saying.
	   According to a new constitution passed last year, a government
can be dismissed if three-fifths of the House of Representatives
and the Senate vote to do so.
	   While Chuan should easily survive any vote in the House where
his coalition government has a commanding majority of 255-132, he
faces stiff opposition among the 258 appointed Senators.
	   The NAP will charge with Chuan of violating article 224 of the
constitution which stipulates that any agreement affecting the
country's boundary and state power or which leads to legislation
must be approved by parliament.
	   Chuan and Tarrin breached article 224 by sending four letters of
intent to the IMF pledging financial reforms that require the
passage of laws, said NAP deputy secretary general Likhit
Dhiravekin, according to the Bangkok Post.
	   The most controversial is the sixth, and latest, letter of
intent which promises to pass legislation on bankruptcy and
foreclosures, alien businesses and leasing land to foreigners.
	   Current laws on bankruptcy and foreclosures allow lenders to
take action against debtors only after they have not made a
repayment installment in five years.
	   Then, if the debtor makes one payment, the five-year waiting
period for legal action begins again, making it nearly impossible
for banks and other institutions to recover assets from non payers.
	   Thai banks are mired in a sea of bad debt, with analysts
estimating that as much as 45 percent of their loans are
nonperforming.
	   The Senate is strongly opposed to the Chuan government's
attempts to change the law to make it easier for banks to initiate
foreclosure proceedings and debtors to declare bankruptcy.
	   The Senate is comprised largely of wealthy businessmen, many of
whom, according to The Nation, are deeply in debt and haven't
repaid their loans.
	   Other Senators, some House members and some pro-democracy groups
are also angry over proposed laws that they believe give foreigners
too much advantage over locals in doing business in Thailand.
	   They have charged that the IMF is infringing on Thailand's
sovereignty.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panichpakdi has responded that
the proposed laws are not imposed by the IMF, but are the
administration's own initiatives to bring Thailand's laws in line
with international standards.

<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ Dixon Ward scored his team-leading 10th
goal and Dominik Hasek continued his mastery at home with 27 saves
as the Buffalo Sabres defeated the Florida Panthers 2-1 on
Wednesday night.
	   Ward, who leads the National Hockey League in shooting
percentage, scored the game-winner at 12:01 of the second period
when he scored on a rebound of his own shot to beat Florida
goaltender Kirk McLean.
	   Hasek has started the last 39 home games for the Sabres and has
a 23-8-8 record and a 1.56 goals-against average. He also has seven
shutouts in that span.
	   Buffalo (11-5-4) is off to its best start in nine years, when
the Sabres began the season 12-4-3. The Sabres are unbeaten in
their last seven home games.
 &UR; Hurricanes 4, Canadiens 1
	   In Greensboro, North Carolina, Ray Sheppard and Keith Primeau
scored 5 1/2 minutes apart and the Carolina Hurricanes won their
fourth straight by defeating the slumping Montreal Canadiens.
	   Sheppard's game-winner came with 4:19 left in the second period,
while Primeau scored his team-leading 12th goal 1:09 into the third
period just seconds after Carolina goaltender Trevor Kidd had made
several key saves.
	   The Southeast Division-leading Hurricanes have now outscored
opponents 13-3 during their season-high winning streak with Kidd in
goal for three of the wins.
	   Montreal, in last place in the Northeast Division, lost its
fifth straight road game and fell to 0-9-2 when opponents score
first.
 &UR; Rangers 3, Islanders 2
	   In Uniondale, New York, Mike Richter stopped 25 shots as the New
York Rangers beat the New York Islanders for their third straight
victory.
	   Mike Knuble, Petr Nedved and Wayne Gretzky scored for the
Rangers, who snapped a three-game losing streak at Nassau Coliseum
since a 5-2 victory on Feb. 8, 1997. The Rangers have beaten the
Islanders three straight games overall.
	   The Rangers are currently on a 4-1-2 streak, and have held
opponents to one or two goals in five of those seven games.
	   Robert Reichel had both goals for the Islanders, who have lost
three straight games and six of their last eight. Tommy Salo
stopped 14 shots.

Hall wins 50-meter freestyle in FINA World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) _ Olympic gold medalist Gary Hall
Jr., who secured a court order to participate in the FINA Swimming
World Cup, won the 50-meter freestyle on Wednesday night.
	   FINA, the governing body for swimming, suspended Hall in July
after he tested positive for marijuana use during a competition May
15 in Phoenix.
	   The suspension kept him out of the Goodwill Games and the U.S.
Senior Nationals. Hall obtained a temporary restraining order the
night before the World Cup meet started this week.
	   On Wednesday, he won the 50-meter freestyle race in 21.98
seconds.
	   ``It was my comeback meet. I've been looking forward to this,''
Hall said.
	   ``I spent the better part of the night out roaming around the
campus here (Texas A and M), and I got back kind of late and there
was a message on my answering machine saying you could compete, so
I had to pull myself together quickly,'' he said.
	   Hall, who lives in Phoenix, won gold medals as part of the U.S.
400-meter freestyle and 400 medley relay teams in the 1996 Atlanta
Games. He also won silver medals in the 50- and 100-meter
freestyle.

Survey: Forty-eight percent oppose Emperor's visit to South Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Most Japanese oppose Emperor Akihito's proposed
visit to South Korea, according to a newspaper survey published
Thursday.
	   The emperor's visit has long been a sensitive issue for Japan,
which is struggling to face up to its wartime past.
	   Many Koreans harbor bitter feelings against Japan for its
1910-1945 brutal colonization of Korea.
	   In an attempt to thaw relations, Korean officials have recently
invited the emperor for a visit _ which would be the first ever.
	   The Yomiuri newspaper found that 48 percent of the 1,983
respondents expressed caution about such a visit, saying there is
``no need to hurry.''
	   Sixteen percent were against it, and 31 percent supported it,
the survey found. As in most other Japanese polls, the survey,
conducted Nov. 14-15, provided no margin of error.
	   An earlier survey by another national newspaper Mainichi shortly
after South Korean President Kim Dae-jung's visit here in October
found that 53 percent of the 1,089 respondents supported Akihito's
visit to South Korea.
	   Thirteen percent opposed the visit, the Mainichi said.
	   During Kim's visit, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi made Japan's
fullest apology to date over its colonial rule and signed an accord
hailing the beginning of a new era.

it will impeach Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai for allegedly
violating the new constitution by signing letters of intent to the
International Monetary Fund without consulting parliament.
	   The New Aspiration Party of former Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh will file a petition on Dec. 9 to dismiss Chuan and
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, NAP spokesman Suraporn
Danaitangtrakul said.
	   ``This is an impeachable offense. Prime Minister Chuan clearly
violated the law knowingly,'' Suraporn told The Associated Press.
	   According to a new constitution passed last year, a government
can be dismissed if three-fifths of the House of Representatives
and the Senate vote to do so.
	   While Chuan should easily survive any vote in the House where
his coalition government has a commanding majority of 255-132, he
faces stiff opposition among the 258 appointed Senators.
	   ``This is not about who has more votes. What we have here is a
violation of the law that has to be exposed,'' Suraporn said.
``What we are concerned with is an abuse of power.''
	   The NAP will accuse Chuan of violating article 224 of the
constitution which stipulates that any agreement affecting the
country's boundary and state power or which leads to legislation
must be approved by parliament.
	   The opposition's position is that Chuan and Tarrin breached
article 224 by sending four letters of intent to the IMF pledging
financial reforms that require the passage of laws, Suraporn said.
	   Government Spokesman Akaphol Sorasuchart countered that the
letters of intent are neither laws nor binding, and therefore it
isn't necessary to submit to parliament for scrutiny.
	   The most controversial letter of intent is the sixth, and
latest, which promises to pass legislation on bankruptcy and
foreclosures, alien businesses and leasing land to foreigners.
	   Current laws on bankruptcy and foreclosures allow lenders to
take action against debtors only after they have not made a
repayment installment in five years.
	   Then, if the debtor makes one payment, the five-year waiting
period for legal action begins again, making it nearly impossible
for banks and other institutions to recover assets from non-payers.
	   Thai banks are mired in a sea of bad debt, with analysts
estimating that as much as 45 percent of their loans are
non-performing.
	   The Senate is strongly opposed to the Chuan government's
attempts to change to the law to make it easier for banks to
initiate foreclosure proceedings and debtors to declare bankruptcy.
	   The Senate is comprised largely of wealthy businessmen, many of
whom, according to The Nation, are deeply in debt and haven't
repaid their loans.
	   Other Senators, some House members and some pro-democracy groups
are also angry over proposed laws that they believe give foreigners
too much advantage over locals in doing business in Thailand.
	   They have charged that the IMF is infringing on Thailand's
sovereignty.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panichpakdi has responded that
the proposed laws are not imposed by the IMF, but are the
administration's own initiatives to bring Thailand's laws in line
with international standards.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Substitute Suat Kaya headed in the
equalizer in injury time Wednesday to lift Turkey's Galatasaray to
a 1-1 draw with Italy's Juventus in a politically tinged Champions
League match that came off without a hitch.
	   The clubs' countries are locked in a dispute over the fate of
Abdullah Ocalan, a Kurdish rebel leader arrested in Rome who has
asked for political asylum.
	   Fears the tensions might spill onto the soccer field resulted in
postponement of the game for a week and extra security measures
Wednesday.
	   Kaya's goal, from steps away off a free kick, ended a late
flurry of offense from Galatasaray after Juventus had taken a 1-0
lead with 12 minutes to go on Nicola Amoruso's goal.
	   Amoruso, who entered the game in the 66th minute, fired French
playmaker Zinedine Zidane's lobbed cross from the left flank
between Galatasaray's Brazilian 'keeper Claudio Taffarel and the
near post.
	   The goal silenced the crowd of 23,000, barely outnumbering the
police officers present at Ali Sami Yen Stadium. Officers in riot
gear escorted the players and officials off the field after the
final whistle.
	   Authorities had also said they worried about a provocation by
the rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, aimed at
staining Turkey's image.
	   Such concerns led European soccer's governing body, UEFA, to put
off the match.
	   But while obscenities directed at Juve's players and chants of
``Down with PKK! Down with Italy!'' echoed through the stadium,
there was no real unruliness, much less violence.
	   Juventus left Istanbul immediately after the game. The club flew
in just hours before the match, in defiance of UEFA rules requiring
clubs to arrive the day before a game.
	   The result leaves Galatasaray tied atop the group with Norway's
Rosenborg. Both have 8 points with one rotation left before the
quarterfinals.
	   Juventus has tied all five of its games for 5 points and now
needs a win against Rosenborg coupled with a Galatasaray loss to
Spain's Athletic Bilbao next week.
	   Galatasaray reacted well after Amoruso's score.
	   First, the hosts produced a one-on-one chance for Hakan Unsal,
but reserve Juve 'keeper Michelangelo Rampulla _ who replaced
starter Angelo Peruzzi, a victim of leg cramps, in the 59th _
blocked the shot with eight minutes left.
	   Four minutes later, Juve defender Alessandro Birindelli cleared
off the line an errant clear attempt after Rampulla fumbled the
rain-slicked ball.
	   Winger Okan Buruk had nearly scored for Galatasaray in the 70th,
when a napping Juventus defense left him all alone to strike from
15 meters (yards), but Rampulla dove to his right to deflect the
dangerous shot.
	   A lackluster first half saw little initiative from either side,
and most of Juve's surges forward were stopped by the hosts'
effective offsides trap.
	   The Italians have had trouble scoring since star striker
Alessandro Del Piero went down with knee ligament damage. Juve has
gone three straight Serie A games without a goal.
	   Juve midfielder Antonio Conte sent a long blast off the mark in
the 20th minute, and center back Ciro Ferrara's glancing header
flew wide of the post after Taffarel failed to punch away a corner
kick in the 40th.
	   Galatasaray's offense ran through Romanian veteran Gheorge Hagi,
but his play, while pretty, rarely produced concrete chances.
	   Italian Sports Minister Giovanna Melandri and her Turkish
counterpart, Yucel Seckiner, both attended the game.
	   Before the match, police searched spectators for weapons or
items like loose change that could be hurled onto the field. Even
umbrellas and mobile phones were not allowed.
	   Some fans tossed objects from the stands, but police appeared to
block everything.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Slogans denouncing a Kurdish guerrilla
group mixed with upbeat soccer chants and obscenities at Ali Sami
Yen Stadium Wednesday during the politically charged Champions
League match between Galatasaray and Juventus of Turin, which ended
in a 1-1 tie and with no violence.
	   Around 22,000 police officers were deployed for the game amid
fears that angry Turkish fans might turn violent against the
Italians.
	   The Juventus team flew back immediately after the game to avoid
possible trouble.
	   Military troops in camouflage outfits stood guard around the
stadium, and police used their shields to prevent possible flying
objects from reaching the field. After the game, as a precaution,
police in Ankara, the Turkish capital, blocked off a main street
leading to the Italian embassy with water canons.
	   A group of about a hundred people gathered in front of the
canons to shout slogans denouncing the rebel group. Hundreds of
cars formed a long convoy through the streets with passengers
waving flags and chanting ``down with the PKK'' referring to the
guerrilla group.
	   In Istanbul, the crowd shouted obscenities at the tense-looking
Juventus players who began their warm-up on the ground less than an
hour before kick-off.
	   A band in the spectator stands played Mozart's funereal
``Requiem.''
	   Turkey and Italy are locked in a bitter dispute over the fate of
Abdullah Ocalan, a Kurdish rebel leader arrested in Rome who has
asked for political asylum, and there were fears the political
tensions might spill onto the soccer field.
	   Authorities also said they worried about a provocation by the
rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, aimed at staining
Turkey's image.
	   ``Down with the PKK,'' chanted thousands of Turkish spectators
who filed into the stadium four hours before kickoff.
	   Others yelled more traditional soccer cheers in support of
Galatasaray, while a scoreboard flashed a cartoon Galatasaray
player handing flowers to a Juventus counterpart.
	   But there was bitterness in the air.
	   No Italian fans attended the match because of security concerns.
	   Hundreds of police were on hand when the Italian team arrived at
the Istanbul airport Wednesday. A small group of airport employees
tossed flowers at the Juventus bus in greeting. But, as loyal
home-team fans, they also chanted ``Turkey, Turkey!''
	   The road from the airport to the team's hotel was closed to
traffic, but people standing along the route waved to the bus.
	   Turkey's leaders have been calling on Turks to be hospitable and
refrain from doing anything to mar the match.
	   Sports ministers of both Turkey and Italy are scheduled to
attend the game.
	   ``Sports is an international language. Tonight we will watch a
very nice competition,'' said Italian Sports and Culture Minister
Giovanna Melandri.
	   Her Turkish counterpart Yucel Seckiner said, ``Let's all
together applaud the team that wins.''
	   Juventus official Romy Gai agreed. ``We are here to play a game,
only a game. We don't care about other things,'' he said.
	   At the stadium entrance, police searched spectators for weapons
or items like loose change that could be hurled onto the field.
Even umbrellas and mobile phones were not allowed.

Hong Kong's largest bank announces pay freeze
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ British banking giant HSBC Holdings will freeze
salaries for more than 13,000 employees at its flagship unit, Hong
Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp. in Hong Kong.
	   The decision was made recently, to ``reflect economic
conditions'' in the territory, Gareth Hewett, a company spokesman,
said Thursday. He declined to say if the bank expects the Hong Kong
economy to deteriorate further.
	   HSBC makes up about 25 percent to 30 percent of the blue-chip
Hang Seng Index on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
	   Since the Asian financial turmoil hit Hong Kong in October 1997,
the economy has suffered rising unemployment and massive lay-offs
and freezes on salaries.
	   The government announced last Friday that the economy slid 7
percent in the third quarter, the biggest decline since records
were kept in Hong Kong. Unemployment also is at a record 5.3
percent.
	   HSBC's other local subsidiary, Hang Seng Bank Ltd., said it
hasn't yet decided on employees' pay scales for next year, a
spokeswoman for the bank said Thursday.
	   The board usually makes decisions on salaries before late
December every year, she said.
	   Hang Seng Bank employs about 7,800 staff in Hong Kong.

Chinese police official sentenced to death for smuggling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ A police official has been sentenced to
death in eastern China for car smuggling, embezzlement and tax
evasion, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Thursday.
	   A court in Lianyungang in Jiangsu province convicted Huang Ning
and two other officials of smuggling 71 cars and evading tax on
22.2 million yuan (dlrs 2.7 million) in income, the report said.
	   The other officials, Zhu Jiaxing and Liu Dianbin, were sentenced
to 16 and 12 years in prison, respectively, Xinhua said.
	   Huang's death sentence was suspended, the report said. Such a
reprieve is intended to let the convict show remorse, and the
penalty can be reduced to a prison term.
	   The crimes occurred in 1993 and 1994, the report said. It did
not say when the trial or sentencing took place or give any details
about the officials.
	   Huang also was convicted of embezzling 3.2 million yuan (dlrs
400,000) in public funds, Xinhua said. Zhu and Liu were convicted
of taking bribes totaling 1 million yuan and 40,000 yuan,
respectively.

Top Cambodian resistance general surrenders command
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian resistance general Nhek
Bunchhay surrendered command of his forces Thursday, paving the way
for his royalist troops to rejoin the national army they have
fought for the past 17 months.
	   The army split last year when Cambodian leader Hun Sen ousted
his co-premier, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a bloody coup. After
two days of intense fighting in Phnom Penh, Nhek Bunchhay's
pro-Ranariddh forces fled to Cambodia's rugged northern border with
Thailand.
	   Hun Sen and Ranariddh settled their feud last month and entered
a coalition agreement that made Hun Sen sole prime minister and the
prince president of the National Assembly. Their parties share
control of the ministries of defense and interior.
	   The deal broke more than three months of political deadlock
following parliamentary elections in July.
	   In a faxed statement sent from the resistance stronghold in the
border town of O'Smach, Nhek Bunchhay announced his resignation
from the army and ordered his troops to prepared for reintegration
with Hun Sen's forces.
	   ``I would like to sacrifice everything for the sake of happiness
and peace for the nation and our people,'' Nhek Bunchhay said.
``Any affairs (concerning me) will be up to the new coalition
government to decide.''
	   Nhek Bunchhay and fellow commander Serey Kosal were convicted of
treason by the Phnom Penh military court in a March show trial.
They were given pardons last month as part of the coalition deal.
	   Serey Kosal quietly returned to Phnom Penh this week for the
first time since the coup.
	   Ranariddh's co-defense minister, Prince Sisowath Sirirath, said
Thursday that Serey Kosal has been named Ranariddh's personal
adviser and will continue to live in the capital.
	   Resistance general Khan Savoeun, who won a seat in the National
Assembly in the election, will quit the parliament and become a
deputy chief of staff in the Cambodian army, Sirirath said.
	   Rumors have circulated that Nhek Bunchhay will also be given a
position in the new government, perhaps as a provincial governor,
but Sirirath said it is still too early to say what will happen to
him.
	   ``He will take a leave of absence and stay low for a little
while,'' Sirirath said. ``Our immediate task is to see the
reintegration of the forces that went to the border.''
	   Integration of the army has been slow to start as the Defense
Ministry works to verify troop lists forwarded by the pro-Ranariddh
forces. Nhek Bunchhay claims to have 20,000 soldiers under his
command, but independent estimates are well under half that number.
	   Complicating the process is the suspected presence on the lists
of Khmer Rouge guerrillas who fought alongside the resistance in an
alliance of convenience against Hun Sen.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Northern Territory Parliament house evacuated,
26th letter bomb turns up in Queensland. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Police evacuated a downtown building
housing a tax office Thursday and rushed in bomb experts after a
suspicious package was found, a day after 25 letter bombs were
discovered by the post office in the capital, Canberra.
	   The building on Collins Street houses a government office, but
police later determined that the suspicious package was not a bomb.
	   In Darwin, the Northern Territory Parliament House was evacuated
Thursday after the discovery of an unattended package matching the
description of the letter bombs posted to government employees.
	   A police spokeswoman refused to give details, saying police
believed it was only a bomb hoax.
	   On Wednesday, a nationwide alert was issued after 21 letter
bombs were found at the Canberra mail sorting center after one
exploded, slightly injuring two postal workers.
	   The previous day a letter bomb had been delivered to a private
Sydney address but it was defused by the police bomb squad when the
person became suspicious.
	   Another two parcel bombs were delivered to homes in Sydney and
Melbourne on Wednesday.
	   And Thursday, another letter bomb was delivered to the home of a
public servant in Queensland, bringing the total found so far to
26. No one was hurt in the latest incident.
	   Most of the potentially deadly parcels had been addressed to
former or current Australian Taxation Office staff, but some
members of the Human Rights Commission also had been targeted.
	   One was reportedly sent to the Sydney home of federal privacy
commissioner Moira Scollay and another to the Melbourne home of
former federal sex discrimination commissioner Sue Walpole.
	   The federal human rights commission has contacted all past and
present staff believed endangered by a mail bomber targeting tax
office and commission workers, it said Thursday.
	   All mail was now being screened and staff had been warned to
check their home mail carefully before opening it, Human Rights and
Equal Opportunity Commission executive director Diana Temby said.
	   Police announced they were looking for 43-year-old Colin George
Dunstan of Canberra, whom they said was suspected of mailing at
least 25 letter bombs, Australia's biggest terrorist campaign.
	   Dunstan's neighbours said he was a former Australian Taxation
Office employee who had been out of work for several years.
	   He was believed to be driving a blue 1985 Toyota Corona sedan
with Canberra license plates.
	   Police were concerned more letter bombs could still be on their
way to past and present tax officials, sent by what they believe to
be a disgruntled, disturbed person. Police were investigating a
common link between all addressees.
	   Tax Commissioner Michael Carmody said the vast bulk of the
letter bombs were directed at present or former tax office staff.
	   Sources close to the investigation said the matter related to a
personal dispute.
	   The ATO has taken steps to protect its employees and a national
memo to its 17,000 staff warned: ``Please ensure that your families
and others likely to open your mail are informed immediately.''
	   The bombs are in white parcels about the size of a storage box
that would hold five computer discs.
	   They are designed to explode when opened, although the device
that exploded at the Canberra Mail Center went off when it was
thrown into a sorting basket, slightly injuring the workers.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ At least 28 people, mostly children,
were killed in a predawn fire Thursday that raged through an
orphanage in a Manila squatter area, fire officials said.
	   About 70 people were inside the orphanage and children's home
when the fire broke out at about 2 a.m., officials said. The dead
included at least 23 children.
	   Rescuers gingerly lifted the bodies of small infants wrapped in
blankets from the remains of the buildings, which included a
two-story main structure and two cottages, all built between 1913
and 1927. Toys and children's clothes were scattered among the
debris.
	   Thirteen dead children were found huddled together in a
storeroom of one of the cottages where they apparently ran in an
attempt to escape the blaze.
	   ``Nobody was able to escape from that cottage because the fire
was there,'' said Clever Regoso, a boy who survived the fire.
	   Elsewhere, a dead adult was found clinging to two children,
charred beyond recognition.
	   Staff members said the fire spread so quickly they did not have
time to rescue many of the children.
	   ``I was sleeping on the ground floor when I was woken up,'' said
Carina Bellosillo, a teacher.
	   ``Already, the ceiling was on fire and the stairs going up to
the second floor were burning. I wanted to go upstairs to save the
babies, but my companions pulled me back.''
	   The ceiling later collapsed, and many of the children's bodies
were found on the ground.
	   Some children of working parents also stayed at the Catholic-run
Bahay Kalinga orphanage in Manila's Paco district, and parents and
relatives wept as they waited for word of their children.
	   ``Others may still be buried in the debris because the buildings
have been completely razed to the ground,'' said Fire Captain
Filemon Jaotian.
	   ``It will take several more hours to determine whether there are
still people there.''
	   Fire officials said faulty electrical wiring may have started
the fire.
	   ``Most probably the electrical system was also old,'' said Capt.
Pennimore Jaudian, chief arson unit investigator.

 &UR; Appleby takes first-round clubhouse lead &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Appleby taking lead, will be led at conclusion of
play Thursday &QL; 
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australian Stuart Appleby, tuning up
for next week's Presidents Cup, shot a 3-under-par 69 Thursday to
take the clubhouse lead midway through the first round of the
Australian Open golf championship.
	   Appleby, playing for the first time in Australia since the death
of his wife, Renay, in a London traffic accident in July, had
back-to-back birdies to start the back nine, took consecutive
bogeys on 14 and 15 then finished with a pair of birdies over the
par-72 Royal Adelaide course.
	   ``I'm generally pretty happy with the day,'' Appleby said. ``I'm
under-golfed a bit so I'm trying to get enough good shots in the
bag.''
	   Appleby said it's still tough concentrating without his wife
nearby on the golf course.
	   ``It is hard to even say it, not having her all the time is
hard,'' said Appleby. ``I suppose I have lived the nightmare for
four months and it's not easier. One minute I'm good, one minute
I'm bad.''
	   One stroke back of Appleby after first-round 70s are Greg
Norman, Canadian Rick Gibson, Australians Peter Senior and Kenny
Druce and New Zealander Stephen Scahill. Appleby and Norman will
both play for the International team against the United States at
next week's Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne.
	   Under good weather conditions _ temperatures of 18C (65F) and a
light breeze _ Norman, playing his first 72-hole tournament since
undergoing shoulder surgery eight months ago, was at 3-under
through eight holes after birdies on the par-5 second, the par-3
seventh and par-4 eighth.
	   But Norman, a five-time winner of this tournament and who lost
in a playoff to England's Lee Westwood last year, took a
double-bogey seven after hitting into the high green-side rough on
the ninth to make the turn in 36, one under the card.
	   ``It was just missing a shot in the wrong place,'' Norman said
of his problems on the ninth. ``There is no intermediate rough. You
can almost be unplayable.''
	   Norman made successive birdies on 10 and 11 before bogeying the
tough par-4, 395-meter 13th, bogeyed 15 and birdied 17 before his
15-foot downhill right-to-left birdie putt on 18 was short.
	   ``I think it's going to be hard for anyone to go around this
course without hitting two or three bogeys,'' Norman said. ``I
don't care how good you are hitting the ball. The course forces you
to play defensively.''
	   Five-time British Open champion Peter Thomson was commissioned
by the Australian Golf Union to revamp Royal Adelaide for the Open.
	   Thomson, who is also captain of the International team, added
about 300 meters to the now 6,565-meter (7,178-yard) course, grew
out the rough and extended it further into the fairways and added
20 bunkers.

Survey: Business at Japan's small firms worsen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ More and more small companies in Japan are posting
losses, underlining the nation's slumping economy, according to a
bank survey released Thursday.
	   As many as 40.6 percent of small businesses surveyed said they
were running a deficit in the three months from September through
November, the Japan Finance Corp. for Small Businesses said.
	   That was the highest since the government-financed bank began
taking statistics in 1974.
	   ``The survey shows that it is too early to say that the
country's economy has headed into a recovery path,'' said official
Chieko Nashimoto.
	   The Japan Finance Corp. for Small Businesses surveyed 620 small
companies in manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors, not
including retail and service companies.
	   Last week, the government unveiled its largest stimulus package
totaling 24 trillion yen (dlrs 200 billion), including 4 trillion
yen (dlrs 33 billion) in income tax cuts.
	   More than two-thirds of Japanese workers are employed in small
firms.

Back from injury, relaxed Norman says he's glad to be back at work
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Greg Norman cast off a mixed start to
his first 72-hole tournament in eight months and said Thursday he's
glad to be back at work.
	   Playing his first four-day event since undergoing shoulder
surgery in April, Norman shot an up-and-down 2-under-par 70 in the
first round of the Australian Open golf championship at the tough
par-72 Royal Adelaide course.
	   ``I'm very happy ... considering it is my first competitive
round since April,'' said Norman, a five-time winner of this
tournament.
	   The injury-forced layoff triggered a shift in focus for the
Australian, who rediscovered a life outside of golf and has
returned with a more relaxed attitude.
	   He said there was no sense of anticipation about getting back
into a four-round tournament again.
	   ``I was quietly excited about doing it ... I was looking forward
to going back to work,'' Norman said.
	   ``I wasn't thinking, `Well, tomorrow is your first real round
since April'. I just let it go. I think that has a lot to do with
how my head is right now.''
	   The tough Adelaide course, redesigned by five-time British Open
champion Peter Thomson, who added 300 meters, 20 bunkers and grew
out the rough, forced Norman to play ``very defensively.''
	   Norman, who lost this tournament in a playoff to England's Lee
Westwood last year, was at 3-under through eight holes after
birdies on the par-5 second, the par-3 seventh and par-4 eighth.
	   He took a double-bogey seven after hitting into the high
green-side rough on the ninth to make the turn in 36, one under the
card.
	   He made successive birdies on 10 and 11 before bogeying the
tough par-4, 395-meter 13th, bogeyed 15 and birdied 17 before his
15-foot downhill right-to-left birdie putt on 18 was short.
	   Norman said he had hit a lot of good ``feel shots'' and he was
comfortable with his in-between shots.
	   ``There were a lot of shots and putts out there today that did
not seem like I was off the game for eight months.''
	   At the 266-meter, par-4 third Norman it a six-iron off the tee,
the first time he's ever done that in a tournament.
	   ``It was defensive play,'' said Norman. ``Sure the other guys
hit the fairway but if you missed that fairway by six feet down
there, you could rack up a six very quickly if you get caught up in
that grass.''
	   Norman said he was happy to let the tournament evolve in the
early rounds.
	   ``If I'm still hanging around, if I get to the lead, it will be
a different story then. That's when riding a bike comes back into
play.''
