<HEADLINE> Driver of car that killed Stanford professor in coffee shop faces DWI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ENGLEWOOD, N.J. (AP) - The driver of a car that killed a
Stanford University astrophysicist when it crashed into a coffee
shop here has been charged with driving while intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Willick, 40, who had said his studies examined the
''large-scale structure of the universe,'' died while working on a
laptop computer while sitting in a Starbucks along Route 4. He had
been visiting family nearby.
</P>
<P>
   A 2000 Ford Mustang GT driven by Joseph A. Santiglia, 53, of
Wilkes-Barre, Pa., veered off the right lane of the busy highway at
2:49 p.m. Sunday into a parking lot and then slammed into the shop,
Assistant Bergen County Prosecutor John L. Higgins said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Willick was pinned between a wall and the vehicle, Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no indication that this was a deliberate attempt to
avoid traffic or cut through,'' said Higgins, chief of the
prosecutor's fatal accident investigation unit.
</P>
<P>
   Santiglia was given a summons for driving while intoxicated
based on observations made by officers, Higgins said. No breath or
mobility tests were administered because Santiglia was checked for
injuries at a hospital after being extricated from the car, Higgins
said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities await the results in two to three weeks of a blood
test to determine if Santiglia's glassy eyes, slurred speech and
imbalance were due to alcohol, drugs or the crash, Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash has not been determined. The vehicle's
speed has yet to be calculated, and the Mustang is to be examined
for any mechanical defects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustang had antilock brakes, which typically do not leave
skid marks if they are operating, but the parking lot is being
checked for marks the tires may have left.
</P>
<P>
   Willick is the son of Martin S. Willick of Teaneck, a prominent
psychiatrist and lecturer at Columbia University, according to The
Record of Hackensack.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Willick lived in Palo Alto, Calif., with his wife
and a son and daughter. The couple were expecting a third child.
</P>
<P>
   Santiglia was taking his parents back to their home in Fort Lee
from a family function, Higgins said. His mother Maria Fabie, 76,
and stepfather, Alfred Fabie, 78, were checked at a hospital but
had no major injuries and went home, Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   Santiglia has an unlisted telephone number and could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Willick, an assistant professor of physics at Stanford since
1995, has said, ''My work addresses the 'big questions' facing
contemporary cosmology: Is the universe flat? Is there a nonzero
cosmological constant? Did structure in the contemporary universe
emerge from the very nearly uniform primordial distribution of
matter solely via the process of gravitational instability? What is
the nature of the 'dark matter' believed to constitute 90 percent
of the total mass of the universe?''
</P>
<P>
   Willick got his bachelor's degree in chemistry and physics in
1981 from Harvard University, his master's in physics at the
University of California, Berkeley in 1983, and his doctorate in
physics at Berkeley in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   He taught physics at Dwight Englewood High School in Englewood
from 1983-84, and at Berkeley from 1984-85, where he was a research
assistant from 1985-91. He did postdoctoral work at the Carnegie
Observatories from 1991-95.

<HEADLINE> Military jet crashes during air show, pilot and crew member killed  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLOW GROVE, Pa. (AP) - Investigators examined a wooded area
Monday as they attempted to piece together the cause of an air show
crash that left two naval aviators dead and horrified tens of
thousands of spectators.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy released few details of the investigation, refusing to
confirm whether the flight recorders were recovered or if the
pilots attempted to eject before crashing on private land about 100
yards from the Willow Grove Naval Air Station.
</P>
<P>
   The two men killed in the crash were pilot Lt. William Joseph
Dey, 30, of Hightstown, N.J., and radar intercept officer Lt. David
Erick Bergstrom, 31, of Annandale, Va. Both fliers were assigned to
Fighter Squadron 101 from the Oceana Naval Air Station in Oceana,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   The F-14A Tomcat fighter was taking part in the next-to-last
performance at the Willow Grove 2000 Sounds of Freedom air show
Sunday when it banked steeply, shook and plunged into the woods
across a busy highway.
</P>
<P>
   Both the pilot and radio officer were experienced flyers who had
been in the Navy eight years. Dey was an instructor pilot with more
than 1,400 total flight hours and more than 1,100 flight hours in
the F-14. Bergstrom had more than 1,200 total flight hours and more
than 1,000 flight hours in the F-14.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots were ''performing routine tactical maneuvers'' at the
time of the accident, Willow Grove spokeswoman Sherri Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the Tomcat was displaying a ''wave-off''
maneuver, in which the plane comes in at slow speed to make a
landing, then circles for another attempt as if waved off from the
first.
</P>
<P>
   It is an easy maneuver, especially for an experienced pilot like
Dey, according to retired Navy Cmdr. Woody Woodward, who viewed an
amateur video of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing dangerous or magic about a wave-off
maneuver,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, who flew in F-14s for 23 years as a radar intercept
officer, said he could not determine from the video what went
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, the things you would like to be able to see are
indistinct in the tape,'' said Woodward, a volunteer coordinator at
the National Museum of Naval Aviation in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Eldridge, Dey's aunt, called him ''the best guy there
was.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He was the top gun of our family,'' she said from Dey's
grandmother's house in Hightstown, N.J., Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dey graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy, she said.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Deb, and their 18-month-old daughter, Kamryn,
lived in Virginia. His wife traveled to Pennsylvania on Saturday to
watch the air show with Dey's family and celebrate their fifth
wedding anniversary. Eldridge said the family was not at the show
Sunday when his plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Dey also is survived by his parents and three sisters.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy permitted journalists a brief visit to the crash site
Monday, and the bulk of the wreckage was barely visible through a
thick stand of oak trees. About 100 feet away in plain site,
however, was a piece that appeared to be a seat.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators sealed off a two-block-square area around the
crash site, including several nearby homes and businesses. At least
one, a dental practice directly in front of the wreckage, was
expected to be closed until Wednesday, said a woman who answered
the phone there.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful, acrobatic Tomcat is one of the most highly sought
after attractions at air shows, said John B. Cudahy, president of
the International Council of Air Shows, an industry trade group.
There are only two Tomcat teams in the nation, and up to 450 air
shows a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A show considers itself lucky indeed to have a Tomcat come in
and fly,'' Cudahy said. ''It's just a very dramatic plane that
represents all that is good about the Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilots in the demonstration flights are instructors at Oceana
Naval Air Station, a training base for F-14 pilots and crew
members. They are chosen in a highly competitive selection process
and undergo additional training for the shows, said Mike Maus, a
spokesman for the Naval Air Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, in Norfolk,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   The status of the Willow Grove show is uncertain. The commanding
officer of the naval air station, Capt. Thomas Nagelin, will have
final say.
</P>
<P>
   ''An air show is for the community. He'll evaluate what the
community would like,'' said Jones, the air base spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is being handled by the Federal Aviation
Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Naval
Safety Center and the Military Mishap Board, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones confirmed the $38 million jet had some ''recording
systems,'' but would not specify whether data from them were
recovered. She also did not say how old the airplane was.

Taiwan Offers Summit With China
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- President Chen Shui-bian offered on Tuesday to hold
Taiwan's first-ever summit with China, saying he believed the two leaders could
''create history'' like their Korean counterparts. At his first news conference
since taking office one month ago, Chen said he hopes to shake hands with
President Jiang Zemin of China and to seek reconciliation during a summit held
in any location and any format that Jiang chooses. The two rivals have never
held a summit meeting, only talks between lower-ranking officials.

in the village of Duma, on Halmahera island about 1,600 miles northeast of
Jakarta, leaving at least 70 people wounded, the report said. The clash lasted

House Votes To Bar Tobacco Suit Aid
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Monday to bar the Justice Department from
accepting funds from another agency to help pay for the federal lawsuit against
the tobacco industry, even as Attorney General Janet Reno warned that such steps
would force her to drop the multibillion-dollar litigation. By a 207-197 vote,
the House stood behind language in a spending bill that would force the
Department of Veterans Affairs to abandon its plans to give the Justice
Department $4 million to help it pay for the huge lawsuit. The legal action
seeks to recover billions spent by Medicare and other federal programs to treat
illnesses caused by smoking.

Gore Questions Oil Company Profits
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Toughening his stand on high gas prices, Vice President Al
Gore voiced suspicion Monday over oil companies' huge profits and called for an
investigation into collusion, antitrust violations and price gouging. Gore said
he just learned that the ''big oil companies'' saw a steep increase in profits
for the first quarter of the year. ''Now you put two and two together and look
at the huge price increases that they say they can't explain and look at the 500
percent increase in profits and look at the way they've been getting bigger,''
Gore told CNN.

Molecule May Help Alzheimer's Study
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dye-like compound that moves into the brain and
pinpoints areas affected by Alzheimer's disease has been demonstrated in
laboratory animal experiments, researchers say. In a study appearing tomorrow in
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers at the
University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine say they have made a molecule
called BSB that in mice will link specifically with brain tissue affected by
Alzheimer's disease. When injected in the bloodstream, the molecule travels to
the brain and attaches itself to the diseased tissue. If the technique can be
developed for human use, it would enable clinicians, for the first time, to see
the extent of brain tissue affected by Alzheimer's disease.

<HEADLINE> Billy Graham Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Evangelist Billy Graham was hospitalized at
the Mayo Clinic after undergoing a procedure to relieve fluid
buildup around his brain, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The 81-year-old evangelist is doing well and is expected to
recover, according to A. Larry Ross, chief spokesman for Graham
Crusades in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Ross declined to discuss specifics about Graham's health but
said his condition is not life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said Graham is undergoing ''a number of diagnostic
procedures and ongoing therapy to optimize his Parkinson's
condition and overall health.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham's condition ''is quite stable,'' Ross said Mayo officials
told him Monday evening. A spokesman for the Rochester clinic was
not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said that after Graham's crusade in Nashville early this
month, doctors advised Graham to slow down because of fatigue. He
said they recommended rest in order to prepare for Amsterdam 2000,
a world gathering of 10,000 evangelists from July 29 through Aug.
6.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Graham has undergone treatment for Parkinson's
disease at the Mayo Clinic. He was diagnosed with the degenerative
brain condition about six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   His Billy Graham Evangelistic Association is based in
Minneapolis.

<HEADLINE> Ilitch's Kin To Control Tigers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- The daily operations of the Ilitch empire of
hockey, entertainment and pizza have been passed to two of Mike and
Marian Ilitch's seven children.
</P>
<P>
   The Ilitch empire includes ownership of the Detroit Red Wings
and Tigers, and Little Caesar Enterprises, the nation's
third-largest pizza chain.
</P>
<P>
   The family's holdings also include the Fox Theatre, Hockeytown
Cafe, Second City Comedy Theatre and concessions at Cobo Arena, Joe
Louis Arena and Comerica Park.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Ilitch, 44, and her youngest brother Chris, 35, will
share the newly created title of president and oversee day-to-day
operations of the family's privately held companies, Ilitch
Holdings Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're turning this over to the next generation, I think
that's how my father would describe this,'' Denise Ilitch said.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit Lions vice president Tom Lewand, who has overseen
negotiations for a new football stadium, said Denise Ilitch was the
family's point person in 1996 talks to build side-by-side stadiums
for the Ilitch-owned Tigers and the Ford family's Lions.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's an intelligent, savvy business person. She struck me as
somebody who's very passionate and very fair,'' said Lewand.
</P>
<P>
   While Mike Ilitch transformed the Red Wings into one of the
NHL's most successful teams, he has not had similar success with
the struggling Tigers. Their new home, Comerica Park, has lagged in
attendance compared to other new ballparks, and the team sits in
last place.

<HEADLINE> Magazine asks readers to vote in political cookie contest  </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - If this is an election year, it must be time for
a cookie contest.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed it is. Family Circle magazine is asking readers to
decide which of the could-be first ladies, Laura Bush or Tipper
Gore, bakes the best cookies in its Third National Bipartisan
Cookie Cook-off.
</P>
<P>
   The current issue of the magazine, dated July 11, puts Bush's
Texas Governor's Mansion Cowboy Cookies up against Gore's Ginger
Snaps. Readers are asked to make a batch of each, and then send in
postcards by Aug. 1 to vote for which one they liked best.
</P>
<P>
   The cookie cook-off was started in 1992, after Hillary Rodham
Clinton stirred up some controversy for defending her legal career
by remarking that ''I suppose I could have stayed home and baked
cookies and had teas.''
</P>
<P>
   She apologized for the statement, and put up a recipe she used
against one used by Barbara Bush. Clinton's recipe won, and like
her husband, it ran successfully for re-election in 1996 against a
recipe for pecan roll cookies from Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, since her husband is no longer eligible to run,
neither can Clinton's cookie recipe. And so the baton passes to
Gore, to see if she can continue the Democrat dominance in this
culinary contest.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a challenge - this year, it's the Republican spouse
who has the recipe for the cookie with the chips. And coconut, and
pecans, and rolled oats. Gore's ginger snaps are chip-less, and
contain ingredients like molasses and cinnamon. It remains to be
seen if that will be enough to wow the nation's sweet tooth.
</P>
<P>
   While there's no contest for Senate spouses - yet - a cook-off
in New York might show whether President Clinton has the culinary
skills to match his political abilities.

<HEADLINE> 114 Said Killed in Jakarta Violence  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Christians and Muslims battled on a
remote eastern Indonesian island, killing at least 116 in the
latest chapter in a longrunning sectarian conflict, police and
witnesses said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police said 108 Christians and eight Muslims died in Monday's
clash in the Maluku islands.
</P>
<P>
   The official Antara news agency said 70 people also were wounded
in the violence in the Christian village of Duma, on Halmahera
island about 1,600 miles northeast of Jakarta. The clash lasted for
about one hour.
</P>
<P>
   Antara said the dead were killed with homemade guns and bombs as
well as bows and arrows. However, a local Protestant clergy man,
Father Hadi, told The Associated Press by telephone that some
Muslim attackers were armed with military-style weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Antara said 292 homes and a church were burned.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials in the region were not immediately available
to confirm details of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's violence is the latest outbreak in an 18-month gang war
between Muslims and Christians in the Maluku islands, also known as
the Moluccas, where more than 2,500 people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   wounded victims had been evacuated to Tobelo, about 20 miles
north of Duma village, army officer Maj. Puguh, who like many
Indonesians uses only one name, told Antara.
</P>
<P>
   He said soldiers and marines dispersed the warring gangs.
However, the situation on Halmahera remained tense Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At least two soldiers had been wounded, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Hadi, who is based in Tobelo, said fleeing villagers from Duma
told him that about 500 Muslims fighters in black and white
uniforms descended upon their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very quick attack. They had automatic rifles but the
Christians only had homemade weapons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hadi said about 1,000 mainly Christians live permanently in
Duma, but its population had swelled by 2,000 from people who fled
violence in the surrounding countryside in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Hadi said there were only about 30 soldiers on duty in the
village and were unable to stop the violence until the military
reinforcements arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Local Muslim groups were not immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The violence continues to rage in the Maluku islands, known as
the Spice Islands in Dutch colonial times, despite repeated peace
efforts by Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid, a respected
Muslim cleric who espouses religious tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month Pope John Paul II urged Indonesia's leaders
to do more to stop the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 210 million people are Muslim,
making it the world most populous Islamic country. But Christians
are the majority in the Maluku islands, which had been renowned for
religious tolerance before violence broke out in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some blame the conflict on economic and social pressure from an
increasing numbers of Muslims settlers from other parts of the
sprawling Southeast Asian nation.

<HEADLINE> S.C. St's Season Opener Canceled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- South Carolina State's season opener
against Benedict has been canceled after officials at the
historically black colleges couldn't decide how to honor the
NAACP's boycott of the state over the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our stand as an institution is that we will honor the economic
sanctions that are in place and we will not try to bring in major
athletic activities,'' Benedict athletics director Willie
Washington said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina State athletics director Tim Autry confirmed the
Sept. 2 game is off.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's game, the first between the teams in 33 years, drew
24,577 people and brought in more than $166,000.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict will not have to pay a penalty for backing out of its
contract. The school opens the season Aug. 26 against Fayetteville
State.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina State was scheduled to open in the Sept. 2 game.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers and Bulldogs are seeking new opponents to fill the
vacancies on their schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd like to find another game, but it's kind of late for
that,'' Washington said. ''We're looking into it, but we're not
going to panic, because we do have 10 games.''
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP started the boycott Jan. 1 because the flag flew above
the Statehouse. The civil rights organization says plans to move it
to a monument on Statehouse grounds July 1 would still leave it in
too prominent a position.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's disgraceful. The people of South Carolina lose out,''
said Sen. Kay Patterson, who earned his graduate degree from South
Carolina State in 1970. ''The alumni of both schools lose out
because somebody's talking about a boycott. How sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Benedict also has moved its Oct. 28 homecoming game against
Elizabeth City State to Charlotte, N.C. The Tigers' four remaining
home games this season will be played in Columbia at Bolden
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''Homecoming is our largest crowd and you've got a large number
of alumni returning. That's why homecoming has been moved,''
Washington said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Volz, president and chief executive officer of the Columbia
Metropolitan Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau, said it's more expensive
for fans to celebrate in Charlotte.

   ''Hotel rooms are 20 to 25 percent higher if they plan to spend
the night,'' Volz said. ''Every dollar we don't get is a
consequence. But we don't know how much is spent here, so we don't
know what the loss is.''
</P>
<P>
   But Washington's hope is the alumni will turn out for the game
in Charlotte just as they would in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still expect to make as much or more with the game in
Charlotte,'' Washington said.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Quake Hits Central Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A moderate earthquake shook central Taiwan
on Tuesday, the latest in a series of tremors rattling this island.
No damage or injuries were immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   The 5.7-magnitude quake's epicenter was about 30 miles southeast
of Taichung, Taiwan's third-largest city, the Central Weather
Bureau said. Taichung is about 80 miles south of the capital,
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-magnitude quake can cause considerable damage.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a 6.7-magnitude quake struck near Mount Yu in central
Taiwan 180 miles south of Taipei, triggering rock slides and
injuring 36 people.
</P>
<P>
   The tremors were among the thousands that have rattled this
island since a 7.6-magnitude quake struck in September, killing
2,400 people and destroying thousands of homes.
</P>
<P>
   Seismologists have said it is not unusual for aftershocks from a
major tremor to continue for a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Located along the earthquake-prone Pacific Rim and crisscrossed
by 51 fault lines, Taiwan is hit by scores of earthquakes each
year, but few cause serious damage.

<HEADLINE> Indiana's Miller Falls Short  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The script was laid out for Reggie Miller.
Yet for the fourth time in the NBA Finals, he inexplicably seemed
to forget his lines at the most dramatic moment.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was held to one field goal in the final quarter as Los
Angeles beat the Indiana Pacers 116-111 in Game 6 Monday night,
giving the Lakers the NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   Miller made himself famous by seizing control in the fourth
quarter, but he couldn't produce during the final period of four
critical games in his first trip to the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, he finished with 25 points but only four came
in the fourth quarter. And with that, Indiana's chances of forcing
a decisive seventh game evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Only a long jumper with 2:41 on the clock that pulled the Pacers
within 110-105 ended Miller's drought. He heaved a desperation
3-pointer that missed at the buzzer, making him 8-of-19 from the
field for the game and 1-of-4 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Miller shared a few congratulatory hugs with some of the Lakers,
then walked wistfully off the court and to the Pacers' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three games of the series, Miller failed to produce
a fourth-quarter field goal. Two of those games were at the Staples
Center, and that must have made it a difficult performance for
Miller to digest.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Riverside, a one-hour drive from downtown Los
Angeles, and he was a college star at UCLA. And he was playing in
his first NBA Finals in front of several family members and close
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Ron Harper's defense for blanketing Miller, who shot a
dismal 1-of-16 in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers had a good game plan and executed it well for 3&AMP;frac12;
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   After winning Game 5 back home in Indiana by 33 points, the
Pacers knew they needed to carry the momentum back to Los Angeles.
They also knew they had to shoot well at the cavernous Staples
Center to keep the game close early.
</P>
<P>
   When Mark Jackson swished an over-the-shoulder shot from near
halfcourt at the first-quarter horn, the Pacers had the early lead
they needed and it seemed it could be a magical night for Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, for his part, scored 11 points by halftime and padded it
with 10 in the third quarter as Indiana took an 84-79 lead in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers patiently chipped at the deficit, taking their
first lead since the first quarter at 91-90 with 9:02 remaining.
After that, Miller and the Pacers were on their heels.

<HEADLINE> Jury selection begins in trial of woman charged with manslaughter for supplying alcohol to minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Jury selection is underway in the case of
a woman charged with manslaughter for supplying alcohol to minors
at her daughter's graduation party.
</P>
<P>
   Forty year-old Leslie Welsh of Avon 19 miles southwest of
Rochester is accused of supplying alcohol to minors at a graduation
party last year.
</P>
<P>
   A jury will decide whether Welsh can be held responsible for the
death of 20 year-old Joe Kingsbury, who died after drinking at the
party.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsbury was celebrating with friends on a night filled with
graduation parties. The celebration ended some time at the Welsh
home some time after 3 a.m. when he collapsed on a mattress in the
garage. Kingsbury never woke up; his blood alcohol level was four
times the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Lapine, Welsh's attorney, said there might have been
negligence and carelessness involved, but not a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't send people to state prison for an accident,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh has been charged with manslaughter, criminally negligent
homicide, and seven other counts of providing alcohol to minors.
Jury selection will continue Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Axl Rose Stalker Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- A woman who violated a 1997 court order to
stay away from Axl Rose has been sentenced to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Lawrence Mira sentenced Karen McNeil, a
39-year-old Ohio resident, to a year in jail on Monday for
violating probation. Rose, the former Guns 'n Roses singer, called
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies May 16 to report a stalker
was trying to enter his property.
</P>
<P>
   Rose's assistant, Betta Lebeis, testified at the probation
violation hearing that McNeil had been to Rose's property at least
six times in the past four years. The court order barred McNeil
from being within 300 yards of Rose's home.

<HEADLINE> More Drama Surrounding Brockovich  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. (AP) -- There's more drama surrounding the
real-life Erin Brockovich.
</P>
<P>
   An arraignment for three men accused of trying to extort
$310,000 from Brockovich and her boss was postponed again as
lawyers battled over where the case should be tried.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys representing Brockovich's ex-husband, ex-boyfriend and
their attorney filed a change-of-venue motion claiming that the
case does not belong in Ventura County, where Brockovich and
attorney Ed Masry are considered ''local heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The hit movie 'Erin Brockovich' may be the biggest movie to
ever feature Ventura-area residents and it could not be more
current in the public's consciousness,'' the motion said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Erin Brockovich,'' which stars Julia Roberts, details how as a
novice legal assistant Brockovich helped uncover power plant
pollution in a desert town to win a huge settlement for clients.
</P>
<P>
   Brockovich's ex-husband, Shawn William Brown, 38; ex-boyfriend
Jorg Lawrence Halaby, 46; and lawyer John Jeffrey Reiner, 53, were
arrested on extortion charges after a two-month investigation by
the Ventura County district attorney's office and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint alleged that the men threatened to tell tabloid
media that Brockovich and Masry had a sexual relationship and that
she was a bad mother -- neither of which was true, according to
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Another hearing was scheduled for July 14.

<HEADLINE> Leach Reaches Settlement in Court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The next time Robin Leach endorses
something, chances are he'll be familiar with it -- at least if he
follows the guidelines of a court settlement he reached with
several states.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys general from 12 states announced Monday that they had
settled a lawsuit against the former host of ''The Lifestyles of
the Rich and Famous,'' who promised dream vacations from a
Florida-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers said the ''dream vacation'' and ''Bahamas cruise''
cost them thousands of dollars; the ''cruise'' consisted of a
daylong ferry ride with ''Las Vegas-style'' bingo.
</P>
<P>
   Leach promoted the vacations in behalf of National Travel
Services Inc. and Plaza Resorts Inc. of Fort Lauderdale. The states
contended that Leach did not investigate the packages and therefore
could not honestly claim they were the ''vacation experience of a
lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Leach admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement but agreed to
endorse only those products with which he is personally familiar,
in keeping with Federal Trade Commission guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lawsuit really is a powerful warning to celebrity pitchmen
that they will be held accountable,'' said Connecticut Attorney
General Richard Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   A message seeking comment from Leach's Florida attorney was not
returned Monday, nor was one left with National Travel Service.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement covers Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois,
North Carolina, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Washington,
West Virginia and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Charles Donates $2M to University  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILBERFORCE, Ohio (AP) -- It's music to their ears: Students at
Wilberforce University will benefit from a $2 million gift from Ray
Charles to fund entertainment scholarships and pay visiting
artists.
</P>
<P>
   It is the largest single gift in the history of the private,
historically black university.
</P>
<P>
   Charles' gift was made through the Ray Charles Robinson
Foundation for Hearing Disorders. The money will be used to set up
a scholarship fund for students studying music, dance, theater and
voice, and to establish a chair in which musicians, artists and
scholars come to the school and serve as temporary lecturers.
</P>
<P>
   Charles' career has covered rhythm and blues, jazz, rock, gospel
and country. He visited Wilberforce in December to receive an
honorary doctorate of humane letters degree.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was impressed on my campus visit with the quality of the
students and the faculty, and I knew the rich history of
Wilberforce,'' said Charles. ''In my small way, I wanted to be part
of this great history.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilberforce, which has about 1,000 students, is about 15 miles
east of Dayton.

<HEADLINE> Jury undecided on Peeler sentence  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - A judge has asked a jury to continue
deliberating whether Russell Peeler Jr. should be executed for
ordering the murders of an 8-year-old witness and the boy's mother,
despite word that the panel was deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
   The jury had sent Judge G. Sarsfield Ford flurry of notes
Monday, saying they could not come to an agreement on either of the
two capital felony charges against Peeler, who faces either life in
prison or execution.
</P>
<P>
   One of the counts refers to Peeler's conviction on killing
8-year-old Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown Jr., who was scheduled to testify
against Peeler in an earlier murder case. The second count refers
to Peeler's conviction of killing two people at the same time -
B.J. and his mother, Karen Clarke. Mother and son were gunned down
in their Bridgeport home on Jan. 7, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Peeler had his brother, Adrian, shoot the mother
and son to keep the boy from testifying. Adrian will tried later.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors told the judge they were confused by the wording of the
jury verdict form, which asked them to weigh mitigating factors
presented by Peeler's defense lawyers and aggravating factors
presented by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he would have a supplemental verdict form
submitted to them Tuesday so they can take a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   In its first note, the jury told the judge they could not agree
on whether mitigating factors outweighed aggravating factors on the
first capital felony count, the killing of B.J.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are divided and there is no room for movement on either
side,'' the jury's note said.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the judge said he would be inclined to sentence
Peeler to life in prison, based on the jury's apparent deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict, however, told the
judge he thought the law provided for the judge to instead declare
a mistrial and allows the state to then hold a new death penalty
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, the jury sent the judge another note saying
they could not agree on whether the state had proven a single
aggravating factor on the second capital felony count -the killing
of B.J. and his mother at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are deadlocked and there will be no movement whatsoever,''
the note read.
</P>
<P>
   The judge then read the jury an amended version of the so-called
''Chip Smith'' instruction aimed at preventing a hung jury by
urging jurors to reach an agreement. Normally, the Chip Smith
charge instructs jurors in the minority to consider the majority
position, an instruction that some lawyers consider coeercive. But
Judge Ford simply asked each juror to consider the opinions of the
other jurors.
</P>
<P>
   When the jury came back again with a note saying they still
could not agree and were confused by the jury form, the judge sent
them home for the day and told them to return Tuesday, when they
will be given an amended form.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had argued that Peeler committed the crimes in an
especially cruel, heinous or depraved manner, knowing that the
mother and son would experience psychological torture when they
were shot in front of each other.
</P>
<P>
   Other aggravating factors cited by the state were payments
Peeler made to co-conspirators in the murder plot: a handful of
crack cocaine to Lee and a bag full of cash to the alleged getaway
driver.
</P>
<P>
   For mitigating factors, Peeler's defense lawyers argued that
Peeler's participation in the crime was limited because he did not
actually pull the trigger. They also presented family members who
said Peeler was deeply affected by the death of his mother to
cancer when he was 21.

<HEADLINE> Bird Leaves Pacers With Head High  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Larry Bird walked away from coaching without
a backward glance, just like he said he would.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching career of one of the game's greatest players came
to an end Monday night at Staples Center when the Los Angeles
Lakers beat his Indiana Pacers 116-111 in Game 6 of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   As the Pacers' final rally fell short, Bird jawed with the
referees until the final buzzer. When the championship celebration
began, Bird shook hands with Los Angeles coach Phil Jackson and
longtime Lakers fan Jack Nicholson, hugged several players and
unceremoniously departed for Indiana's locker room.
</P>
<P>
   His final season as a coach ended against his greatest rival as
a player -- the Lakers. Bird had a brief encounter on the way to the
locker room with Magic Johnson, the Lakers star whose playing
career paralleled his.
</P>
<P>
   Bird's three seasons on the Pacers' bench were yet another
success for the man who led the Boston Celtics to three titles as a
high-scoring forward. He signed a three-year contract with the
Pacers in 1997 and said repeatedly he had no desire to coach any
longer than his contract.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated that position just moments after leaving the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a great experience, (but) three years is enough,''
Bird said. ''I'm not cut out to be a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   His resume would seem to disagree. Bird failed to lead his
home-state team to a title, but in his short tenure, he picked up
one Coach of the Year Award and led Indiana to three conference
finals appearances, two Central Division crowns and its first
Eastern Conference title.
</P>
<P>
   Not too bad for someone who expressed little interest in
coaching until he unexpectedly took over for Larry Brown in 1997,
saying he still had the desire to be a competitor but could no
longer do it on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, everyone from young Indiana fans carrying
''Say It Ain't So, Larry'' signs at Conseco Fieldhouse to team
president Donnie Walsh begged him to stay for at least another
year. Bird won't, saying only that players tend to tune out coaches
after three seasons in charge.
</P>
<P>
   But he enjoyed himself to the very end. Asked how he felt in the
moments before Game 6, he said, ''I'm nervous, I'm scared, and it's
a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird was named Coach of the Year in 1998 after just one year on
the job. He led the Pacers to a 58-24 record and the Eastern
Conference finals, where they were edged by Michael Jordan's last
Chicago Bulls team in seven thrilling games.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana got back to the conference finals after the
strike-shortened 1999 season but lost to the New York Knicks. The
Pacers won the Central Division this season and knocked off New
York in the conference finals, but they were unable to win in three
tries at Staples Center during the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Bird said he has no regrets about how his final season turned
out -- nor does he have any rekindled desire to come back next
season, even though he said he has ''nothing else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been offered a front-office position with the Pacers, and
he said he probably will decide whether to accept it within the
next few days, probably after a stop at his Florida home to ''take
a deep breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird's departure is the first step in what could be a
dismantling of the Pacers. Six players are free agents -- including
every starter except Dale Davis -- and big men Rik Smits and Sam
Perkins are talking retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were a couple of bounces here and there from making those
plays and doing something special,'' Pacers guard Reggie Miller
said. ''As for next year, we don't know anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird seemed calm and happy during the final days of his tenure.
He leaves the Pacers in much better shape than he found them, and
he took them places they had never been.
</P>
<P>
   But his competitive nature isn't quenched. Right before he left
the podium in his final news conference as coach, he was asked how
happy he was to be through.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll probably be miserable the rest of my life, to tell you
the truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to tell if he was kidding.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Offers Summit With China  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- President Chen Shui-bian offered Tuesday
to hold Taiwan's first-ever summit with China, saying he believed
the two leaders could ''create history'' like their Korean
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   At his first news conference since taking office one month ago,
Chen said he hopes to shake hands with President Jiang Zemin of
China and to seek reconciliation during a summit held in any
location and under any format that Jiang chooses.
</P>
<P>
   China has long considered Taiwan a renegade state and demanded
that it be rejoined to the Chinese mainland. The two rivals have
never held a summit meeting, only unofficial talks between senior
statesmen. The last round occurred in Beijing in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Koreans have made a historic stride forward,'' Chen said,
referring to the first-ever summit meeting between North and South
Korea. Recently held in Pyongyang, it produced an agreement to work
toward reconciliation. ''We can also make changes and create
history.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the common wish of people across the Taiwan Strait,''
Chen said. ''I believe we will have the same wisdom and creativity
to fulfill the mission impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen said he has placed in his study room a picture of the two
Korean leaders shaking hands at their historic summit last week so
that he can learn from them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the many differences between Taiwan and China, Chen said
recent developments in the two sides, including his own election,
could pave the way for their eventual reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's leadership change has created a new phase conducive to
ending half a century of confrontation with China, while recent
improvements in the political stability of the mainland also could
encourage Jiang to seek a more positive stance toward Taiwan, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction to Chen's offer from China.
However, following the inter-Korean summit on June 13-15, Beijing
rejected any comparisons between the Koreas and China and Taiwan,
saying the island would have to tacitly recognize Chinese
sovereignty over it before any such meeting between the leaders
could take place.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan and China split amid civil war in 1949. Taiwanese have
refused to reunify with the less-developed and totalitarian
communist China. China has threatened to use force against the
island to prevent it from making a permanent break with the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Most nations have formal ties only with China and don't
recognize Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which has about 90,000 soldiers based in East
Asia, has agreed to supply Taiwan with adequate weapons to defend
itself from any attack by China.
</P>
<P>
   However, many Taiwanese regret that a political thaw between
Taiwan and China is nowhere in sight, even though civilian
exchanges have boomed over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, the situation across the Taiwan Strait has
been less volatile than the Korean peninsula, where the two Koreas
share the world's most heavily armed border and have been divided
by the Demilitarized Zone since the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Koreas, China and Taiwan have allowed family reunions
and significant trade between the mainland and Taiwan's free-market
economy. Bowing to demands by businesspeople, Chen has pledged to
launch direct shipping links with China.
</P>
<P>
   Many Taiwanese are eager to see a Taiwan-China summit to remove
all remaining trade barriers and to clear the threat of war. But
China has refused to meet and also has insisted on dictating terms
of any talks with Taiwan, while Taipei has demanded an equal seat
at the table.

<HEADLINE> Nike Golf Ball Wins With Tiger  </HEADLINE>
By CRISTINE GONZALEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Tiger Woods kept his eye on the ball. So
did executives at Nike Golf, but for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Watching this weekend, we lived and died with every shot,''
said Mike Kelly, marketing director of Nike Golf, which makes the
ball Woods used to win the 100th U.S. Open by a record-breaking 15
strokes at Pebble Beach on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' victory was by the largest margin in any of golf's major
championships, breaking the mark set by Old Tom Morris in the
British Open in 1862.
</P>
<P>
   By using the Nike golf ball Woods turned his sponsor into a
major industry player almost overnight. The company, which only has
1 percent of the ball market share, has been flooded with calls
from players who want to test the ball and retailers who want to
sell it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously putting such a historical moment into context is our
next goal,'' Kelly said Monday. ''Both golfers and nongolfers saw
what happened, now it's our job to leverage that into a commercial
success.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tour Accuracy is a multilayered ball that spins less, giving
players more consistency and more options around the green. The
multilayered construction breaks tradition with once-preferred
wound balls.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said the wound ball tended to peak a little more in
flight, while multilayered balls were more likely to be a little
more flat.
</P>
<P>
   ''It allows him to be much more creative around the greens and
hit more shots around the greens,'' Bob Wood, president of Nike
Golf, told CNN. ''This ball flies through the wind very, very well
-- and that had something to do with his decision to switch before
the majors.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods began testing the Nike balls earlier this year while at
home in Florida. He put the Nike ball in play for the first time in
a tournament in Germany, and used it to cruise to a five-stroke
victory at the Memorial in late May.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until two weeks before the U.S. Open that he
formally switched from using Titleist golf balls to the Nike ball.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' decision ended a marketing conflict between his top two
golf sponsors that began last year when Nike entered the ball
market. Instead of filing a lawsuit, Titleist reworked Woods' deal
so that he was paid only when he used Titleist equipment in
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Nike took advantage of the switch by putting together an
advertising campaign explaining the switch that was aired
throughout NBC's broadcast of the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said it would be difficult to top the exposure it got
every time the camera focused on Woods' ball, with the Nike
trademark swoosh, during the tournament. But it may consider
producing new commercials with Woods next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it has updated its Web site, and rejiggered
print advertisements going out this week that emphasize Woods'
decision to switch to Tour Accuracy. And, it is focusing on
distributing the ball and other golf merchandise at on-course golf
shops in addition to those off-course.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' use of the Nike golf ball gave no immediate boost to the
company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Nike stock
fell 68.7 cents, or by 1.8 percent, to close at $36.563 a share.

<HEADLINE> Parties Planned for Harry Potter  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL BECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Harry Potter's wizardry has already cast a spell
upon readers worldwide, but bookstores are hoping he'll create some
cash-register magic with next month's launch of the fourth story in
the best-selling series.
</P>
<P>
   Many merchants are staying open until the early morning hours of
July 8, when the as-yet untitled book is released. Others are
organizing Harry Potter-themed parties with magic shows and live
owls. Internet retail giant Amazon.com, meanwhile, is countering by
promising FedEx quick delivery for up to 250,000 online shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are opening at midnight to sell at the earliest possible
moment,'' said Becky Whidden, a manager at The Children's Book Shop
in the Boston suburb of Brookline. ''People are extremely anxious
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the first Harry Potter book was released in Britain in
1997, the series by author J.K. Rowling has been a runaway
sensation, remaining a constant on best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   The 752-page fourth book will land with a first printing of 3.8
million copies, which many in the publishing business say is a
record for the industry. It will be launched simultaneously in the
United States and Britain -- a change from the other three books,
which appeared overseas first.
</P>
<P>
   Demand has been so great for No. 4 that its U.S. publisher
Scholastic has set up a help desk for booksellers just to ask
questions about orders and shipping of the new book.
</P>
<P>
   The craze for Harry Potter, the orphan who hones his magical
skills at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, has added
lots of excitement to the children's book business, and has managed
to turn many children on to reading in general. And while it was
written for the younger set, it has become a phenomenon among
adults too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they're going to be classics, like right up there with
'Old Yeller' and 'A Wrinkle in Time,''' said Leah Williams, a
12-year-old who plans to be at Square Books in Oxford, Miss., the
first morning the new book goes on sale. ''I like stuff that's not
real because it takes me into a different world.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the attention, many bricks-and-mortar stores view the
launch as a way to offer shoppers something more than they could
find at the Internet superstores, most of which will take a few
days to deliver the new book.
</P>
<P>
   Some merchants -- from small independent stores to giant chains
like Barnes &AMP; Noble -- are keeping their doors open past 12:01 a.m.
on July 8 when it officially goes on sale.
</P>
<P>
   Others are opening at dawn with their stores transformed into
their interpretation of Harry Potter's world.
</P>
<P>
   At the Red Balloon Bookshop in St. Paul, Minn., face-painters
will be drawing lightning bolts on children's foreheads -- just like
the one Harry Potter has on his skull -- and there will be three
live owls, which are considered friends and messengers in the
books.
</P>
<P>
   In Buckhannon, W.Va., owner Michael Oldaker is considering
building a set of scenes from the book in front of his store. The
staff at The Blue Marble in Ft. Thomas, Ky., will dress up like
witches and wizards and offer cinnamon oatmeal from a black
cauldron for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, the 209 branches of Waterstone's bookstores are
planning a range of activities, from wizards with wheelbarrows in
the town center of Canterbury to general knowledge quizzes and
guess-the-title competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably the most important book that booksellers will
sell this year,'' said Liz Sich, who handles publicity for
Waterstone's.
</P>
<P>
   While die-hard Harry Potter fans will find lots to do at
traditional bookstores, there is no guarantee that these shops
won't sell out fast. Many, in fact, are expecting Christmas-like
crowds and already have dozens, if not hundreds or thousands of
pre-orders.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Internet superstores are seeking out an advantage.
If a consumer shops at their site, they are immediately told
whether or not the book is in stock and when they will be able to
get it.
</P>
<P>
   Many cyberstores are also offering deep discounts, with Amazon
slashing 40 percent off the $25.95 price and Barnes &AMP; Noble.com
cutting 30 percent. That's something that most smaller stores can't
afford to do.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon is also working with FedEx Corp. to get books quickly to
customers. The first 250,000 who buy the book on its Web site --
more than 168,000 have already pre-ordered -- will get their
standard shipping upgraded for free to overnight delivery, meaning
the book will arrive on the release date of July 8.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Anderson, a Lake Tahoe resident shopping in San Francisco,
says she bought her 8-year-old grandson his first Harry Potter
book.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he finished it, he asked, '' 'Nana, when is the next
one coming out,' '' Anderson said. ''It's great to see kids excited
about a book coming out.''

<HEADLINE> Aristide Partisans Paralyze Cities  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Militant supporters of former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide paralyzed Haiti's three biggest
cities Monday, blocking streets and setting a fire outside the U.S.
Embassy to demand the release of last month's election results.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Elections Council announced the official
results -- giving Aristide's party control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Those results were challenged by the international community and
the council president, who fled the country in fear of his life
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came hours after the United States demanded an
honest count of ballots cast in legislative and municipal elections
that are crucial to restoring some $500 million in suspended
international aid.
</P>
<P>
   The council said Aristide candidates won 16 of 17 Senate seats
contested May 21.
</P>
<P>
   But Haiti's Radio Galaxie quoted Leon Manus, the council
president, as saying earlier Monday that he refused to give in to
pressure from President Rene Preval to sign off on incorrect
results giving Aristide candidates 16 seats. Manus said Aristide
candidates won only seven seats, the radio said in a report from
its correspondent in the United States, where Manus fled.
</P>
<P>
   Still to be announced are results for 83 seats in Parliament's
House of Deputies. Preliminary results gave Aristide candidates 23
seats.
</P>
<P>
   The council also said it was postponing the second round of
elections scheduled for Sunday but gave no date. The elections are
being held for the top two contenders in races where no candidate
won a majority.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in Port-au-Prince, protesters stoned vehicles and set
tire barricades ablaze. They blocked Port-au-Prince's main arteries
with hulks of vehicles, junked refrigerators and large rocks. Shops
and schools stayed shut.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters also reportedly paralyzed Cap-Haitien, the second
city in the north, and Gonaives, Haiti's third-largest city on the
west coast.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince, demonstrators set a
large pile of debris on fire and chanted anti-American slogans.
Haitian police watched but did not intervene. The protesters then
moved to the nearby United Nations Plaza, where they lowered an
American flag and tried to set it ablaze before police grabbed the
flag.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Aristide supporters also shut down the capital,
stoning cars and threatening more violence if election results were
not published.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's results were signed by six remaining council members --
minus their president and two members who resigned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the six council members published mayoral results
from eight of Haiti's nine electoral districts, giving Aristide
candidates control of all the biggest towns and metropolitan
Port-au-Prince, where a third of the country's 8 million people
live.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders have threatened to boycott the second round,
charging the count was fixed to give Aristide a victory that would
set Haiti on the road to a virtual one-party state.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, United Nations and Organization of American
States also have challenged the vote-counting process.
</P>
<P>
   Under Haitian law, candidates must win a majority to avoid a
second round of voting. But officials counted the votes of only the
top four contenders and not the others who ran and may have gotten
a few votes.
</P>
<P>
   Those missing votes created an erroneous winning percentage
count, observers say, giving at least eight of 16 Senate seats to
Aristide candidates who otherwise would have to face a second
round.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington D.C., State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
said the United States wants the Haitian government and the
country's electoral authorities to complete the vote count ''in
accordance with the precepts of the Haitian constitution and the

<HEADLINE> Town Stunned by H.S. Hazing Arrests  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE RUSHLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSLOW, Ariz. (AP) -- The pecking order on the Winslow High
School basketball team's bus was obvious -- freshmen in front, next
to the coach, junior varsity in the middle, varsity in back.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, on road trips that could last more than an hour
between this rural town and schools one or two towns away, younger
players were called or dragged to the back of the school bus.
</P>
<P>
   There, witnesses say, some athletes held down the younger
students and covered their mouths before sticking fingers in their
rectums. Sometimes, the athletes threw blankets over the victims'
heads and allegedly used a pencil or green Dry Erase marker to
sodomize them.
</P>
<P>
   A parent's complaint in March set off a school investigation,
which was then handed over to local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In April, two star athletes -- one of them a police detective's
son -- and another player were suspended for the alleged sexual
assault, stunning this town of 11,000 where most everyone knows one
another by name. And last month, eight athletes were charged with
either sexually assaulting or helping other students assault about
a dozen basketball and track athletes over several months. The
basketball coach has also been indicted, accused of knowing about
some of the abuse and failing to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We decided it wasn't horseplay. It crossed the line into
criminal conduct,'' said Navajo County Attorney Melvin Bowers Jr.
</P>
<P>
   All the defendants have denied the allegations, in some cases
saying the incidents were pranks. However, Bowers said ''it was
more of a power and control or dominance thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, few statistics are available on high school hazing.
An Alfred University study of NCAA athletes last year found that 42
percent of those who said they were hazed in college had been hazed
in high school. Five percent reported being hazed in middle school,
''which set off alarms for us,'' said Norman Pollard, director of
counseling at the Alfred, N.Y., university.
</P>
<P>
   The same researchers have begun a study of high school hazing,
but no data is yet available, Pollard said. He did say, however,
that reported hazing cases probably represent a very small
percentage of what actually takes place.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of this type of behavior is done secretly,'' he said.
''It never comes out unless someone is courageous enough to say
something or there is some tragic consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Winslow case, interview transcripts and summaries
compiled by sheriff's investigators depict a pattern of alleged
abuse in which some varsity basketball and track athletes targeted
younger athletes. Many attacks occurred in the back of the bus on
the way home from basketball games, witnesses and victims told
investigators. Others occurred in the locker room and even in the
school's high jump pit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sad. It's terrible. You think you're in a small town.
It's like, Wow. ... It's a shock,'' said Bob Hall, who runs a salon
in Winslow, immortalized by the Eagles in ''Take It Easy,'' a song
for which it erected a commemorative park.
</P>
<P>
   These days in Winslow, the paint on the downtown storefronts
fades and peels, as most traffic whizzes past along Interstate 40,
bypassing the old Route 66 town 180 miles northeast of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Residents pack the stands at Winslow High games even if they
don't have school-age children. They say they are stunned about the
abuse allegations -- and they are increasingly defensive over the
scrutiny the case has brought Winslow, which lives off the
Burlington-Northern Santa Fe rail line, a state prison and
nostalgic tourists who want to cruise the famed Mother Road.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good town to raise kids in,'' said George Stegmeier,
president of the Chamber of Commerce and a lifelong Winslow
resident. ''We're not the sleepy hollow we were in the 1950s, but
we try to handle our problems discreetly. We try to be
supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Of the students charged, Stephen Garnett Jr., 18, and Martin
Woods, 19, face the most counts. Garnett, a former student body
president and a basketball standout with a scholarship to Northern
Arizona University, faces 11 counts of kidnapping and five counts
each of sexual assault and attempted sexual assault. Woods, who had
been living with Garnett's family, faces 10 counts of kidnapping,
four counts of sexual assault and five of attempted sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   The others charged in the case were Garnett's brother, Shane
Garnett, 16; Timothy Lewis, 16; William Shoupe, 16; Jason Black,
16; Brian Marquez, 17; and Logan Payne, 15.
</P>
<P>
   All declined to comment on the case, either personally or
through their attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter to the school's principal before his indictment,
Stephen Garnett Jr. wrote, ''I never in my imagination in any way,
shape or form thought that the horsing around that we were doing
was a 'gang attack' on somebody. There were no intentions on
hurting, damaging or humiliating anybody. It was just supposed to
be horsing around.''
</P>
<P>
   During an interview with investigators, Garnett's father,
Winslow police detective Stephen Garnett Sr., told authorities he
thought people were trying to destroy his son because they were
jealous of him. The elder Garnett did not return a call placed to
his office.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball coach Daniel Gonzales, 36, faces three counts of
child abuse. Gonzales, who has denied knowing anything improper was
going on, declined to comment when contacted by phone and hung up
when asked for his attorney's name.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to school and district officials were all referred to the
district's attorney, Dale Patton, who didn't return messages.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Nuwer, an author of three books on hazing, said cases of
forced sodomy or alleged sodomy in high school hazing are rare -- he
tracked 16 since 1983 -- but that more surface each year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mentality in athletics, there's this myth that (hazing)
builds unity,'' Nuwer said. ''But in sodomy cases, we don't what
the long-term consequences are.''
</P>
<P>
   One immediate consequence for the athletes charged at Winslow
High could be a loss of their peers' respect.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were cool,'' said sophomore Melissa Kabinto, ''and now
they're gross.''

<HEADLINE> Laker Fans Turn Violent After Win  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HARRIGAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Thousands of people celebrating the Los
Angeles Lakers' first NBA championship in 12 years turned violent
Monday night when revelers set a police car on fire and destroyed
two other vehicles, including a TV news van. Four bonfires also
were set. No injuries were immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10,000 people had gathered outside Staples Center by the
end of the Lakers' 116-111 victory over the Indiana Pacers, with
nearly 20,000 more still inside.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was mostly peaceful until about an hour after the game
when several fans began jumping on top of a limousine trying to
leave the area, then began smashing the windows of a sport utility
vehicle and a television news van parked outside the arena.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't known who was inside the limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of men were striking the SUV and news van with boards and
broken tree limbs while others looted fire extinguishers and other
items from the van.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before, nearly a dozen police officers on motorcycles
forced the crowd away as several limousines tried to exit the
arena. Groups of men charged one limo, then another, hurling
traffic cones and other debris as they passed.
</P>
<P>
   City fire spokesman Brian Humphrey said a woman inside the arena
bumped her head and a man dislocated his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   He said the small bonfires some revelers built were in the
middle of the street and did not pose any threat to people or
property.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fires were fueled mostly by paper, trash and T-shirts from
the opposing team,'' Humphrey said. ''They quickly extinguished
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Groups of men formed conga lines around the fires and danced in
a circle, while some occasionally broke free and leaped over the
flames.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Organizers of the Sydney Olympics have
received an $84.8 million bail out package from the New South Wales
state government as the cost of staging the Games continues to
balloon.
</P>
<P>
   State treasurer Michael Egan revealed Tuesday that SOCOG
president and Olympics Minister Michael Knight had approached him
after it became clear organizers could not play host to the Games
within its current budget.
</P>
<P>
   Egan said the additional revenue would be allocated from the
state's budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $84.8 million, half would be reserved for contingencies
and would replace the $30.3 million in contingency funds SOCOG had
already spent.
</P>
<P>
   The rest would be allocated for immediate use to cover blowouts
in sponsorship revenue and the increased cost of selling and
distributing tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Coordination Authority would receive $10.9 million
for venue services which SOCOG has already contracted to it,
including waste collection.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 3, Padres 2  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Steve Finley walked with the bases loaded in the
ninth inning as the Arizona Diamondbacks snapped a three-game skid
with a 3-2 win over the San Diego Padres on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who hadn't driven in a run since June 4, also had an RBI
single in the eighth inning as Arizona rallied from a 2-0 deficit
after their ace, Randy Johnson, left the game.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Danny Bautista led off the ninth with an infield
single and advanced to second one out later on a groundout by Jay
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Kolb (0-1) threw a wild pitch while intentionally
walking Luis Gonzalez. Matt Williams walked to load the bases
before Finley walked on a 3-1 pitch to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Padilla (2-0) pitched two perfect innings for the
victory, taking over after Johnson was pulled for a pinch-hitter in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, who lost three straight at Colorado over the
weekend to fall percentage points behind the Rockies in the NL
West, moved back into first place.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Nevin drove in two runs with a homer and double off a woozy
Johnson, but couldn't keep the Padres' three-game winning streak
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson struck out eight in seven innings despite an early dizzy
spell.
</P>
<P>
   He threw one pitch to Nevin to lead off the second inning before
stumbling off the mound and taking a knee behind it. After
consulting with manager Buck Showalter, pitching coach Mark Connor
and trainers, Johnson got Nevin to fly out and retired the next two
batters.
</P>
<P>
   But Nevin hit a solo homer -- his team-high 15th -- in the fourth
inning, and made it 2-0 with a double in the sixth, scoring Ruben
Rivera. Ed Sprague tried to score from second on the play and Bell
threw him out from second.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague crashed into catcher Damian Miller so hard Miller's
helmet flew off, but the Arizona catcher held onto the ball to end
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona tied it in the eighth. Bell walked to lead off the
inning against Matt Whiteside and advanced to second on a single by
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Finley followed with an RBI single and Arizona loaded the bases
with a walk by Greg Colbrunn. Travis Lee tied the game with an RBI
groundout.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Stan Spencer pitched five scoreless innings,
allowing three hits and three walks before leaving the game with a
right elbow strain.

   Johnson finished has a major league-leading 158 strikeouts this
year and 2,851 in his career -- four short of Jim Bunning for 12th
all-time.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the fourth time in 15 starts he has failed to strike
out at least 10.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Johnson is 18-2 in his last 27 regular-season starts. ...
Spencer has struck out just nine in his last four starts (24 1-3
innings) after 32 strikeouts in 25 1-3 innings in his first four.
... The game was the first of a franchise-record, 14-game homestand
by the Diamondbacks. ... Arizona 1B Erubiel Durazo, on the DL after
ligament surgery on his right wrist, took early batting practice
and might play Tuesday with Triple-A Tucson, then take two days of
extended spring training. He could rejoin the parent club as soon
as Friday.

<HEADLINE> LA's Shaq: The Big Champion  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Big Champion.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, who once made the rather curious boast that he
had won a championship on every level but college and the pros,
can't make that claim any more.
</P>
<P>
   Capping a season in which he won the scoring title, MVP of the
All-Star game and the regular season, O'Neal finally won the Big
One, the NBA championship, and earned the Finals MVP honor in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   After eight seasons, he also shed the stigma of being one of the
game's most dominant players, but one who could not take a team to
the title.
</P>
<P>
   As confetti rained down on the Staples Center court Monday night
after Los Angeles' 116-111 victory over Indiana in Game 6, tears
rolled down his face as the 7-foot-1, 315-pound O'Neal hugged his
mother and his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've held the emotion for about 11 years now, three years of
college and eight years here; I wanted to win,'' he said. ''It (the
emotion) just came up.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaq was simply Shaq in Los Angeles' clinching victory over the
Pacers that gave the Lakers their first NBA title since Magic
Johnson and ''Showtime'' in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Pounding the ball into the basket over the Pacers' Rik Smits and
any other Indiana defender trying to stop him, O'Neal mixed in a
few of his soft-touch, turnaround jumpers from 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Playing all but one minute of the game, O'Neal finished with 41
points and 12 rebounds. Also typically for him, he went just
3-of-12 from the free throw line.
</P>
<P>
   ''This year, Shaq's been attacking and he's just been great for
us all year long,'' teammate Kobe Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers' Reggie Miller said O'Neal's all-around game has
improved.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a lot of it has to do with (coach) Phil Jackson coming
in and giving Shaq and the others confidence,'' Miller said. ''I
know Phil told everybody right at first that this was Shaq's team
and the ball goes through Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakers owner Jerry Buss said O'Neal was confident -- and
determined -- this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just feels like he is the best player and he set out to
prove it,'' Buss said. ''I think he did it to everyone's
satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal gleefully gave himself many nicknames in the past,
including ''The Big Aristotle'' when he won the 1999-2000
regular-season MVP and quoted the philosopher: ''Excellence is not
a singular act, it's a habit.''
</P>
<P>
   Others nicknames he came up with: ''The Big Maravich'' after he
made nine free throws in a row against Portland in the playoffs;
''The Big Felon,'' after he made a game-saving steal against
Orlando; and ''The Big Cordially,'' because, he said, ''I'm nice.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was the unanimous choice in the NBA Finals MVP voting. He
was just one short of getting all the votes in the regular-season
MVP balloting.
</P>
<P>
   He becomes only the third player in NBA history to win all three
MVP awards in the same year, joining Michael Jordan, who did it
twice, and Willis Reed.

<HEADLINE> Lakers' Supporting Cast Helps Shaq  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As great as he is, Shaquille O'Neal cannot
win an NBA championship by himself. Almost, but not quite.
</P>
<P>
   On O'Neal's magnificent 41-point night of thunderous dunks and
off-balance bank shots in Los Angeles' clinching 116-111 victory
over Indiana, those ''other'' Lakers came through.
</P>
<P>
   With Kobe Bryant an erratic 8-for-27 from the field, O'Neal
needed help elsewhere. The Lakers took turns providing it.
</P>
<P>
   At the head of the supporting cast was Glen Rice, who may have
played his last game in Lakers gold.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, the one-time all-star who has made the triangle offense
look like the Bermuda Triangle by disappearing frequently, was
5-for-7, including 3-of-3 on 3-pointers, and scored 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, a free agent after this game who supported his wife when
she complained loudly and at length about his limited role in coach
Phil Jackson's system, missed 3 of 4 free throws through three
quarters. But he made the two biggest of his career with 1:16 to
play to put Los Angeles ahead 112-109.
</P>
<P>
   When Reggie Miller missed a 3-pointer with 15 seconds to go,
Rice grabbed the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   As it ended, Rice's smile lit up the night as he hugged a
tearful O'Neal. For once, Rice was very much a part of everything.
</P>
<P>
   In the champagne-drenched locker room, Rice held his son G'mitri
in one arm as he talked about whether he will be back next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had to endure all the trade rumors, the ups and downs and
the struggles that I've had,'' Rice said. ''To win the NBA
championship, it's really all worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said he wants to come back to the Lakers because he feels
they will win more championships. But when a reporter asked G'mitri
where he wanted his dad to play, the youngster thought for a moment
and said, ''Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice's smile grew bigger. ''You've got to edit that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Robert Horry, who won a championship with the
Houston Rockets. All eight of his points came in the fourth
quarter. He came off the bench to sink two 3-pointers as Los
Angeles outscored Indiana 20-8 to start the fourth and take a 99-92
lead. Rick Fox also had a 3-pointer in the run.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana clawed back to a 103-103 tie, but there was Horry
sinking a jumper to put the Lakers up for good. Ron Harper, who
brought his NBA title experience to the team this season, knocked a
pass away for a turnover that set up one of O'Neal's big baskets in
his fourth quarter of 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   A.C. Green, who was a bit player on this team but a member of
the last Laker team to win a championship in 1988, had a critical
baseline jumper and steal in the third quarter when Indiana seemed
poised to pull away.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Green, a devout Christian non-drinker, was on the run
in the locker room as Horry chased him with champagne.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've stayed dry through all my championships,'' he said, ''and
I want to keep my streak alive.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Lakers wore their championship hats and smoked big
cigars in the crowded locker room. Plastic covered their lockers to
keep the champagne off.
</P>
<P>
   In a room next door, Magic Johnson held court.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first one is always the toughest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Jackson, it was seven championships in nine years, but his
first without Michael Jordan. Only Red Auerbach coached a team to
more titles.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always sweet,'' Jackson said. ''This is for you L.A. What
a way to start a millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the night, it looked like another Lakers
disappointment. Six times the team failed to close out a series
when it had a chance. Los Angeles had just lost by 33 in
Indianapolis in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal's relentless effort eventually became contagious.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very proud of our team and how they held on under a lot
of criticism, a lot of pressure,'' Jackson said. ''Their confidence
just kind of oozed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who came to Los Angeles and inherited a team with
big-time talent but a reputation for underachieving, said he
stopped his players 15 minutes into their first practice. He said
doubted if they could play with the kind of energy he demanded.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, they met his demands.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very proud of that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, the often-placid crowd stormed the court and
erupted in cheers. So did thousands who crowded the streets outside
the downtown Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   It was the seventh championship for the Lakers, but with O'Neal
and the 21-year-old Bryant, who clinched the victory with four
straight free throws, it probably won't be the last.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to thank the real coach of the year, Phil Jackson,''
O'Neal told the crowd at center court after the trophy
presentation. ''And we're going to win one next year, too.''

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 10, Mariners 3  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Fred McGriff drove in four runs and hit his 13th
homer, and reliever-turned-starter Albie Lopez pitched six strong
innings as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays beat the Seattle Mariners 10-3
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Guillen and Bobby Smith also homered for the Devil Rays,
who won for the fifth time in six games.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff, who went 3-for-5, homered off Rob Ramsay in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners lost the opener of a 10-game homestand after
returning from a season-best 7-3 road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen tied it at 2 in the fourth when he hit his third homer
in seven games off John Halama (6-3). After singles by Felix
Martinez and Randy Winn, Gerald Williams put Tampa Bay ahead to
stay with a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Smith hit his first homer of the season for the Devil Rays in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez (4-4) made his fifth start after 151 relief appearances
and got his second straight victory. In six innings, Lopez allowed
two runs, one earned, on six hits and four walks. He struck out
six.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McLemore had an RBI single in Seattle's second and Alex
Rodriguez gave the Mariners a 2-1 lead in the third with his 20th
homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays got a run-scoring single from McGriff in the
first and increased their lead to 6-2 with two runs in the fifth.
Russ Johnson singled in a run and Felix Martinez had a sacrifice
fly. In the sixth, Williams scored from second on McGriff's infield
single.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Stan Javier was walked by Mark Guthrie with the
bases loaded in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Halama, losing his third consecutive decision, went four innings
and gave up five runs on seven hits and three walks.
</P>
<P>
Notes: McLemore had a hearing at Safeco Field Monday on his appeal
of a five-game suspension for charging the mound against Tampa
Bay's Esteban Yan on May 20. Paul Beeston of the commissioner's
office is expected to render a verdict. ''I said what I needed to
say,'' McLemore said before Monday night's game. ''I think he'll
start his suspension tomorrow,'' said manager Lou Piniella, who
attended the hearing. ... Halama is 0-3 with a 7.71 ERA in four
starts in June after going 6-0 with a 4.01 ERA in nine starts in
April and May. ... The Devil Rays are 12-6 with Jose Canseco
(strained left heel) on the disabled list ... Tampa Bay's bullpen
gave up its second run in 19 1-3 innings. ... Devil Rays pitcher
Jim Mecir surrendered his first run in 10 appearances and 14 1-3
innings.

<HEADLINE> Bush Campaign Holds Hope in Calif.  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- See George W. Bush shake hands with
Hispanics in the streets of Santa Ana. Hear Bush describe himself
as a ''new kind of Republican'' who rejects using immigration as a
divisive issue. Watch Bush run hard to catch Al Gore in a state
that leans heavily Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candidate is going back to basics in
his bid to win California, spending time walking the streets of
Democratic strongholds and focusing on key groups, including the 13
percent of voters who are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Bush returned to the state Monday on a three-day swing focused
on education. Like Gore, he will speak at the National Council of
La Raza conference in San Diego next month.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his major targets: Hispanics alienated by
Republican-sponsored immigration laws and conservative voters in
southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to energize these people to come back,'' Bush said
aboard his campaign plane Monday. ''If I do, I think I can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's state chairman, Gerry Parsky, is pushing frequent visits,
appeals to Hispanics and women and unifying Republicans as the only
way to capture the nation's biggest electoral prize.
</P>
<P>
   This latest swing marks Bush's ninth appearance since winning
the state's primary in March, and he has said he will not cede the
state to his opponent the way his father did in 1992. Gore also
makes frequent visits to California.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was told when we started that the only way to win California
is to raise money and buy media'' ads, Parsky said. ''We said that
hasn't worked in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Republican Party spent some $4 million on ads to
help nominee Bob Dole in California in 1996, yet President Clinton
carried 51 percent of the vote to Dole's 38.
</P>
<P>
   The political landscape got even darker for the GOP two years
later, when California voters swept Republicans from every
statewide office. Hispanic voters deserted the GOP for its support
of Proposition 187 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would have cut off education, health care and other
services for most illegal immigrants. Federal courts blocked the
law, and last year it was scuttled in a mediation process overseen
by Democratic Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say Republicans remain mortally wounded in the state,
and that Gore's solid lead -- double-digits in polls during the
spring -- will only widen as voters are reminded of the candidates'
stances on social issues like immigration, abortion and gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush could benefit from the Green Party campaign of Ralph
Nader, who appears to be attracting Democratic support by attacking
Gore on the environment and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Former Republican Pat Buchanan, seeking the Reform Party
nomination, poses no comparable threat to Bush's base in the state,
polls show.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush painting himself as a Republican who would lead a more
inclusive party and who opposes the ''spirit'' of Proposition 187,
the election will serve as a test of whether the ghosts of that
immigration measure have been exorcised.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say they won't let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he was governor, Bush never said a word about Prop 187,''
said Bob Mulholland, spokesman for the California Democratic Party.
''If he gets up there in September and says he's against it, that
TV ad's going right up on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides will spend millions on California's pricey air waves.
But Parsky says the Texas governor will need a more personal
approach to hold onto Democrats who voted for Republican John
McCain in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Later this summer, Bush will open a campaign office east of Los
Angeles dedicated solely to mobilizing Hispanic voters in hopes of
winning at least 30 percent of their vote.
</P>
<P>
   He'll highlight his interest in seeking common ground on the
abortion issue and his refusal to impose an anti-abortion litmus
test on any vice presidential pick or prospective judge.
</P>
<P>
   And he'll keep battling for the dollars and loyalties of Silicon
Valley entrepreneurs. So far, Bush is trouncing Gore in the race to
collect computer-industry donations, receiving about $815,000 from
industry workers to Gore's $363,000, according to a study by the
Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan Washington-based
group that studies money and campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Parsky and other Bush officials say the campaign's internal
polls show Gore's lead among registered voters is weak and give
Bush the edge among likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats cite their own polls showing good news for the
vice president: He isn't dragged down by Clinton in California, and
even a majority of Republicans favor legal abortion.
</P>
<P>
   And California Hispanics are still fuming at Republicans over
Proposition 187, according to a political adviser to Gov. Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter how many sombreros he puts on, no matter how many
'Oles!' he says, the Latino vote in California is just not
available to any Republican candidate for president,'' said Garry
South, who ran Davis' successful 1998 campaign against GOP
candidate Dan Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't live here and you didn't go through the 1994
period with (former Gov.) Pete Wilson you have no concept of the
kind of hostility and antagonism that exists between Latinos and
Republicans in California,'' South says.

<HEADLINE> GOP Not Promising Abortion Peace  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- A Republican hearing on what should be in
the party's platform was a decidedly pro-choice affair -- consumed
with offering choice on education, Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Not abortion.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't come up at a meeting held Monday to hear policy
advice from invited experts on topics that form broad agreement in
the party.
</P>
<P>
   The prickliest internal policy issue is being left to private
meetings that Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, platform committee
chairman, hopes will head off a divisive struggle at the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hoping to mitigate any strong opposition,'' said
Thompson, himself an abortion opponent. ''It's just not going to be
that the abortion issue is going to define the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Can he succeed? ''I'm not willing to make that statement at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican state officials and like-minded analysts and
advocates voiced support for GOP presidential candidate George W.
Bush's plans to help parents pick from among schools, offer more
health plan alternatives to the elderly and let workers invest a
portion of their payroll taxes in personal retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Choice and the freedom to choose -- that concept permeated each
discussion,'' said Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee, a member of the
hearing panel and a senior official on the platform committee.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why choice was not discussed in the context of abortion
rights, he said: ''The issues that we brought up are issues that
touch every single American. Not one person in this room is not
going to be affected by education, Social Security and Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   While expressing doubt that the party's uncompromising position
against abortion will be amended, Thompson said he wants a
''fresh'' platform that is like none before it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to do everything I possibly can to bring as many
disparate groups in and broaden the base of the Republican Party,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has been meeting Republicans on both sides of the
abortion issue, as well as others wanting a say in the platform. He
says he will continue to do so up to the July 31-Aug. 3 gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Several abortion-rights Republicans pulled him aside after the
hearing to emphasize the party will be hurt if it does not change
its plank calling for a no-exceptions abortion ban. A small group
of activists on both sides put on brief, orderly demonstrations
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he would not seek changes in the plank despite his
belief that abortion should be allowed in cases of rape, incest and
to save the life of the woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I doubt very much if it's going to be changed,'' Thompson
said. Abortion-rights Republicans have been hoping at least for a
platform that welcomes their point of view, a goal they failed to
achieve in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the platform will address other issues he contends
are more important to women than abortion policy, such as
education, family values and health matters.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, he said, ''I would be very shocked if this is a
platform like previous platforms. I want this one to be very fresh,
very visionary, very exciting and very inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he said:
</P>
<P>
   --The plank of the 1996 platform that called for shutting the
Education Department will be removed -- an explicit goal of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   --The position on immigration will be changed. The existing
platform opposes taxpayer support of legal and illegal immigrants
and says U.S.-born children of illegal aliens should not be granted
automatic American citizenship; Bush takes a more welcoming view of
legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   --The platform will contain a new plank on women's health.
</P>
<P>
   --Although the platform will embrace the goal of letting parents
choose from among schools, Thompson said ''I don't know if it'll
ever go as far as I think it should go'' on that point.
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposes limited circumstances under which parents could
use federal education money to help pay for private school.
Thompson has pioneered a more comprehensive choice program in his
state.
</P>
<P>
   Some religious conservatives, while pleased with Bush's stance
on the abortion plank, are worried he might pick a running mate who
supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said Bush is right to avoid ruling someone out based on
that issue. ''I don't think there should be a litmus test and he
certainly doesn't, either.''

<HEADLINE> Accusations Fly Over Fuel Costs  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With gasoline prices soaring, there's been no
shortage of blame -- rising oil prices, pipeline problems, short
supplies, cleaner gasoline requirements and even an esoteric patent
dispute, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   But an examination of these explanations provides no clear
picture of why gasoline in a matter of a few weeks jumped as much
as 50 cents a gallon in some areas of the Midwest -- nearly five
times as much as increases nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The summer price surge has politicians worried in this election
year. The Clinton administration has asked the Federal Trade
Commission to investigate possible illegal price gouging in the
Midwest, and Vice President Al Gore said Monday that a broader
probe was needed since oil companies have been making huge profits
this year.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's GOP presidential campaign, meanwhile, blamed
Gore and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounds like Al Gore is now trying to divert attention away
from the Clinton-Gore administration's failed leadership when it
comes to addressing high gas prices and developing a national
energy policy,'' Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a number of economic and regulatory explanations are
being offered for the run-up in gasoline prices. Here are a few.
</P>
<P>
   RISING OIL PRICES
</P>
<P>
   After hitting a peak of $34 a barrel, oil prices declined in
April after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
agreed on production increases. But, in a surprise to some
analysts, oil prices rebounded and were back up to about $30 a
barrel by mid-May and June. That prompted gasoline prices to edge
up nationally, but only by about 4 cents a gallon in the last two
weeks of May. The crude oil price increases, however, do not
explain the much steeper increases in parts of the Midwest,
especially in the weeks after Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   LOW GASOLINE STOCKS
</P>
<P>
   During most of May and into June, stocks of gasoline have been
nearly 10 percent lower than during the same period a year ago and
on the low edge of a range considered adequate. It is a precarious
situation with the start of the heavy summer driving season. But
low stocks have meant profits for refineries. Refinery margins in
May were on average 20 cents a gallon, three times what they were a
year ago when stocks were high, according to government figures.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said some refiners were slow in revving up
production this spring, waiting for lower oil prices -- which never
came -- to build up inventories, meaning more of a profit margin. In
early May, federal officials raised concern that refineries were
not producing fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   PIPELINE PROBLEMS
</P>
<P>
   In March, the 1,400-mile Explorer pipeline, which carries
gasoline into St. Louis and the Chicago area, sprang a leak and was
shut down for five days. Oil companies have cited the break
repeatedly as a reason for supply problems and price increases in
the upper Midwest. It's a claim disputed by the pipeline company.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market should have adjusted to that months ago,'' insists
Rod Sands, vice president of operations at Explorer Pipeline Co. He
said while five days of shipments were lost, the line has been
sending at full capacity since March. The pipeline is only one of a
number serving the upper Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago a pipeline in Michigan had a break and was out of
commission for nine days. Gasoline prices in the Detroit area
soared to $2 a gallon afterward. Industry critics say the
''just-on-time inventory'' practices, a policy adopted by the oil
industry years ago to save storage costs, has eliminated
traditional supply cushions that in the past eased the price
impacts from temporary transportation problems.
</P>
<P>
   REFORMULATED GASOLINE
</P>
<P>
   The oil industry blames much of the price spikes this summer on
a requirement for a cleaner-burning blend of reformulated gasoline
in areas with severe summer smog. They say the costs of making the
gasoline -- about a third of all gasoline sold -- is higher than
anticipated because of blending problems, especially where
corn-based ethanol is used as an additive. While it allows fuel to
burn cleaner, ethanol releases more evaporative emissions,
requiring other components of the gasoline to compensate to meet
the new requirements. This makes gas blending more difficult and
expensive, although how much is a matter of great dispute.
</P>
<P>
   And some refineries have not retooled to make the new blend,
adding to the supply problems, industry officials say. This has
left Environmental Protection Agency officials and some state
regulators frustrated because, they maintain, oil companies have
been planning for the new gasoline for more than a year but made no
mention of problems that would cause prices to skyrocket or lead to
a supply crunch.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no reason that this should be a surprise,'' said
William Becker, executive director of a group representing state
air pollution control officials.
</P>
<P>
   The cleaner burning gasoline is costing consumers 5 cents a
gallon more on average than conventional gasoline, although the gap
is four times that much in the Midwest, mostly Chicago, Milwaukee
and St. Louis, where prices have jumped 30 cents to 50 cents a
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the AAA, many other cities that require the
cleaner blend gasoline (though not ethanol) showed only modest
price increases over the past month. For example: Houston, the
average price of a gallon of regular unleaded was $1.54, compared
with $1.48 a month ago; Boston, $1.64 versus $1.53 a month ago; New
York City $1.72 and $1.54; and Philadelphia, $1.58 versus $1.47 a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   PATENT DISPUTE
</P>
<P>
   Although not generally known, motorists also are paying a
premium because of a little-known patent dispute involving the
blending of the cleaner gasoline. In March, a federal judge upheld
the validity of a patent for a particular blending process held by
Unocal Corp. Six California refineries are under orders to pay
Unocal a nickel for every gallon of gasoline made by Unocal's
process. Refiners across the country are worried the same could
apply to them, so they are either using more expensive
alternatives, or -- some industry critics surmise -- may be passing
some cost on to customers in anticipation of having to settle with
Unocal in the future.

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Magic Johnson reveled in the Los Angeles
Lakers' title. He also spared a sympathetic thought for Larry Bird,
his longtime rival.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the former Lakers great who is now a team vice
president and minority owner, was among the first to hit the floor
in the moments after the Lakers' 116-111 victory on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   He hugged Shaq, he hugged Kobe and he joined the Lakers on the
victory podium, screaming his joy. As he pointed out to anyone who
would listen, it was his sixth championship as a member of the
Lakers organization, giving him the same number of titles as
Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're not a player, this is the ultimate,'' Johnson said.
''I tied you, Michael!''
</P>
<P>
   But later, as Johnson stood in a corridor at Staples Center
holding an unopened bottle of champagne and a championship T-shirt,
he considered the disappointment felt by Bird, the coach of the
Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's my man. He means a lot to me,'' Johnson said. ''It
wasn't like I'm going crazy that I beat him. It's bittersweet.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Bird were interlocked in basketball lore when
Magic's Michigan State team beat Bird's Indiana State squad for the
1979 NCAA title. Their friendly rivalry continued in the pros,
where Magic's Lakers won five championships and Bird's Boston
Celtics won three.
</P>
<P>
   They also shared a hug at midcourt after the Lakers' win.
Johnson had a message for Bird, who is retiring from coaching:
''Please, Larry. Stay in basketball. We need you.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to be back in some kind of capacity. Now he won't
have to agonize quite as much.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson still agonizes every game, from his baseline seat
near actress Dyan Cannon. He said the Lakers have all the makings
of a dynasty similar to the ''Showtime'' teams he led with Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have owners who are going to make it happen,'' he said with
his famous grin.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   REMEDIAL LESSONS: After the Pacers handed them a 33-point
thrashing in Game 5, the Lakers went back to basics.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers held an instructive practice Sunday at their training
gym in El Segundo. Instead of taking it easy with Game 6 the next
day, Los Angeles tried to return to its defensive roots to stop the
Pacers' offense, which averaged 119 points over the previous two
games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had to go back over some defensive things,'' coach Phil
Jackson said. ''(We had to) talk about individual moves, talk about
our philosophy and get it back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson didn't agree with the theory that the Lakers didn't put
up much of a fight in Game 5 because they knew they could return
home and finish off the series at Staples Center. The Lakers were
4-6 in potential series-clinching games this season, with all four
victories coming at home.
</P>
<P>
   When told the Lakers had set an NBA record by losing six
possible series-clinchers, Jackson grinned and sarcastically gave
two thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's great,'' he said. ''It says something about this team a
little bit, but it's not the story.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' defensive cramming didn't seem to have much effect
until the fourth quarter of Game 6, when Los Angeles made several
big stops while going ahead to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ET TU, BILL? Jackson turned the tables on NBC commentator Bill
Walton when he quizzed the coach over Kobe Bryant's decision on
whether to play in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In Jackson's pregame meeting with reporters, Walton asked
Jackson what he thought Bryant should do. Bryant said Sunday he
likely won't play for the U.S. team in Sydney if asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's his choice. It's not my choice,'' Jackson said. ''He's
being cornered or pushed into a corner. You played, Bill. You know
what it's like when you get approached. ... How did you feel when
they asked you?''
</P>
<P>
   Walton said he also turned down a chance to play in the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''You felt cornered,'' Jackson said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   LOOSE BALLS: Bryant shot just two free throws over the series'
first five games. Both of them came in Game 1. He missed most of
Game 2 and all of Game 3 with a sprained ankle, and he didn't shoot
a free throw during his standout 28-point performance in Game 4. He
was 8-for-9 from the line in Game 6. ... O'Neal averaged 16.7
rebounds per game in the playoffs. The Lakers' next three best
rebounders didn't average 15 rebounds combined. ... This was the
first time since the playoffs expanded in 1986 that the champion
won the clinching game in all four series at home. Last year, San
Antonio clinched all four of its series on the road. ... The
Lakers' 33-point loss in Game 5 wasn't without precedent for Los
Angeles' championship team. In the 1985 playoffs, the Lakers lost
to the Boston Celtics by 34 in Game 1 but came back to win the
series in six games.

<HEADLINE> Phil Jackson Knew the Drill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- He knew the drill. Knew just where to stand,
off to the side, so that the boss and the kids got to hold the
trophy first.
</P>
<P>
   You don't come to a new town with six championship rings, like
Phil Jackson did, without knowing a thing or two about
celebrations. And so Jackson hung at the edge of the frame for as
long as he could Monday night, savoring his seventh trophy while
they clamored to touch their first, letting the same bunch of
Lakers he spent a year controlling run wild.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a way,'' Jackson said, ''to start the millennium''
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to look at the snapshot of Kobe Bryant jumping into
Shaquille O'Neal's arms the second the 116-111 decision over
Indiana was complete, and wonder why it took a new coach to end the
Lakers' title drought at a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson never wondered. When he decided to come back to
basketball after a year off, he looked at those two and knew he
already owned the biggest piece of any championship puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson learned to respect talent by respecting the best --
Michael Jordan. That was what enabled him to patch up the rift
between Bryant and O'Neal. Because he could watch both of them play
their best and honestly say he'd seen better. And because he had
the rings to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   And so it wasn't a coincidence that Jackson walked in the door
and stories of the Shaq-Kobe feuds dried up.
</P>
<P>
   ''He found out exactly how to talk to each of them and he let
them go out and work on one another,'' said John Salley, another
former member of the Chicago Bulls crew that Jackson brought out
West. ''And when he did that, these guys went out and realized what
they had to with one another.
</P>
<P>
   ''They realized they weren't at odds. Just on a losing team and
in a losing situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers weren't that bad, though in retrospect it might have
seemed that way. For the last half of the decade, under Del Harris,
they were a great regular-season team that faded in the playoffs
faster than a cheap Hawaiian shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is a master at building a team's confidence, at all
those little ploys and gimmicks that make it look like he is
sharing power and responsibility. That's because it lets streak
players like Bryant play unafraid, and role players like Robert
Horry step up at the biggest moments.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just O'Neal's 41 points or Bryant's 26 that finally
convinced the Pacers to let go of their own championship
aspirations. It was the 3-pointer that Derek Fisher dropped to open
the fourth quarter, the 3-pointer by Horry sandwiched between
baskets by O'Neal a few minutes, the 3-pointer by Rick Fox that
gave Los Angeles its first breathing room and a 94-90 lead.
</P>
<P>
   What Jackson brought to the Lakers was a calm facade while all
those points were dropping from all those unlikely places. He'd
seen that before, too, from guys named John Paxson, Steve Kerr and
Jud Buechler, reserves who'd make contributions when the front-line
talent needed a break or searched for a shooting touch that
suddenly disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson learned to rely on them in tough stretches, laid down
the law in some instances, and it made everybody understand how
much they would have to rely on one another before any championship
celebrations could be held.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what I like about Phil,'' O'Neal said, ''not what he
did with Michael and Scottie, but how he got the other guys to
play.''

<HEADLINE> Miller Falls Short in 4th Quarter  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The script was laid out for Reggie Miller.
Yet for the fourth time in the NBA Finals, he inexplicably seemed
to forget his lines at the most dramatic moment.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was held to one field goal in the final quarter as Los
Angeles beat the Indiana Pacers 116-111 in Game 6 Monday night,
giving the Lakers the NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were measuring it like a heavyweight fight,'' Miller said.
''We wanted to win each quarter, and count those as rounds. We won
the first three rounds but lost the most important one, and that
was the fourth round.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller made himself famous during his career by seizing control
in the fourth quarter, but he couldn't produce during the final
period of four critical games in his first trip to the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, he finished with 25 points but only four came
in the fourth quarter. And with that, Indiana's chances of forcing
a decisive seventh game evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his teammates refused to single him out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reggie has been our go-to guy all year,'' forward Austin
Croshere said. ''Win or lose, we're all going to go with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a long jumper with 2:41 on the clock that pulled the Pacers
within 110-105 ended Miller's drought. He also heaved a desperation
3-pointer that missed at the buzzer, making him 8-of-19 from the
field for the game and 1-of-4 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reggie played hard,'' coach Larry Bird said. ''He played
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller shared a few congratulatory hugs with some of the Lakers,
then walked wistfully off the court and to the Pacers' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three games of the series, Miller failed to produce
a fourth-quarter field goal. Two of those games were at the Staples
Center, and that must have made it a difficult performance for
Miller to digest.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Riverside, a one-hour drive from downtown Los
Angeles, and he was a college star at UCLA. And he was playing in
his first NBA Finals in front of several family members and close
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anytime you get a chance to play in your hometown, you really
want to show up and play well,'' forward Jalen Rose said. ''We're
all disappointed for Reggie, but we're also disappointed that we
didn't find a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit Ron Harper's defense for blanketing Miller, who shot a
dismal 1-of-16 in Game 1. Still, his teammates weren't about to
complain about Miller's effort in the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers had a good game plan and executed it well for 3&AMP;frac12;
quarters. And it wasn't just Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Lakers really stepped up their defense,'' Croshere said.
''They got some loose balls and some offensive rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning Game 5 back home in Indiana by 33 points, the
Pacers knew they needed to carry the momentum back to Los Angeles.
They also knew they had to shoot well at the cavernous Staples
Center to keep the game close early.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we wanted to do was get into the game quickly, which we
did,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   When Mark Jackson swished an over-the-shoulder shot from near
halfcourt at the first-quarter horn, the Pacers had the early lead
they needed and it seemed it could be a magical night for Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, for his part, scored 11 points by halftime and padded it
with 10 in the third quarter as Indiana took an 84-79 lead in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers patiently chipped at the deficit, taking their
first lead since the first quarter at 91-90 with 9:02 remaining.
After that, Miller and the Pacers were on their heels.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Miller called it a great season and said he leaves
feeling a sense of accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always watched the Finals in years past,'' he said. ''The
teams that win it, they make the plays and make things happen. We
were a couple bounces away here and there from making those
plays.''

<HEADLINE> North Korea's Economy Growing  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea's economy expanded 6.2
percent in 1999, the first growth in nine years and a rate that
officials said was sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Seoul's central Bank of Korea said this week's
easing of U.S. economic sanctions against Pyongyang and the
expected increase in South Korean investment would positively
affect the North's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's reasonable to predict that the worst is over for the
North Korean economy,'' said Park Suk-sam, a senior Bank of Korea
analyst. ''We believe that plus economic growth will continue in
the North.''
</P>
<P>
   In its preliminary report, the South Korean bank said that the
North's economy turned around in 1999 for the first time since
1990, helped by growth in almost all sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the turnaround, the size of North Korea's economy in
1999 still remained at 75 percent of that 10 years ago in 1989, it
said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea does not release any economic statistics. South
Korean officials said they calculated the figures with data
collected from North Korea's trading partners and U.N. and other
international groups helping the communist country.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in the North's construction sector was strongest at 24.3
percent, farming at 9.2 percent and mining and manufacturing at 9.9
percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe
deprived North Korea of its traditional barter trading partners and
aid providers. That caused the North's economy to shrink 3.7
percent in 1990 and from between 1.1 percent to 6.3 percent through
1998, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report estimated the North's 1999 gross national product at
$15.8 billion, less than 4 percent that of South Korea. The North's
per capita income of $714 was about 8 percent that of its southern
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's 1999 trade totaled $1.48 billion, compared with
$263.4 billion in South Korea, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Food and energy shortages were blamed for the North's economic
difficulty, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Famine hit North Korea in the early 1990s, forcing the reclusive
communist country to appeal for outside aid in 1995 to feed its 22
million people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, food production increased with foreign fertilizer aid,
bank officials said. South Korea is currently shipping 200,000 tons
of free fertilizer to the North.
</P>
<P>
   Lifting a half-century economic embargo, the United States on
Monday allowed trade with North Korea in nonmilitary goods and
opened air travel and shipping routes between the two countries.
Washington also eased restrictions on investment by U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the action was heavy in symbolism and would
not spur large trade with North Korea in the immediate future,
given that the communist country is just trying to come out of long
and extreme isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul officials said North Korea can expect quicker benefit from
economic aid and investment from South Korea, following a
successful inter-Korea summit last week.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal signed during the first-ever summit, South Korea
promised to help rebuild the North's shattered economy.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of footwear and other labor-intensive South Korean
companies hope to relocate their plants to North Korea where labor
costs are low.

<HEADLINE> New York's corporations close ranks with GE on PCBs  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York's corporate community closed ranks
Monday around General Electric Co. in its opposition to dredging
PCB-contaminated sediments from the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Business Council, the most powerful business
lobbying group in New York, argued that ''vengefulness'' on the
part of GE's critics must not be allowed to guide policy at the
federal Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''To them (GE critics), big corporations like GE are evil
polluters, who must be punished,'' Business Council President
Daniel Walsh said in a letter to EPA Administrator Carol Browner.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh added, ''We do not believe that EPA will make a decision
based on vengefulness. We believe that EPA will make the decision
that is driven by sound science, and by the facts at hand - and
reject dredging.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA plans to announce in December its decision on how best
to deal with PCB ''hot spots'' in the Hudson River north of Albany.
GE discharged the chemicals legally into the Hudson until 1977,
when the substance was banned by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   GE, with its own scientific studies and a television public
relations campaign, is trying to convince the EPA that dredging is
not the best solution to Hudson River PCBs. The company says the
river is getting cleaner, and that PCBs are not a cancer-causing
agent in humans, despite Browner's statements that it probably is.
</P>
<P>
   Dredging for contaminated sediments would only stir up chemicals
and cause them to be distributed more widely in the river, GE
argues.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems clear that a dredging operation big enough to remove
the PCBs under the riverbed would take 10 years or more,'' Walsh
told Browner. ''For all that time, the scenic beauty, water quality
and recreational use of a 40-mile stretch along the upper river
would be severely disrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   General Electric is a member of the Business Council. The head
of one of its divisions, Robert Nardelli of GE Power Systems, sits
on the council's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   The Business Council's letter is in keeping with the message of
GE's ad campaign, said Jeff Jones of the Albany-based Environmental
Advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sedimentation strategy - just leaving the PCBs in the
river - is not a long-term strategy because there are any number of
natural occurrences that could take place over time to stir them up
- flood, droughts, ice floes, tornadoes,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Walsh is overstating the extent of the dredging the EPA
may order. It is likely any dredging would be limited to the PCB
''hot spots'' where the most-contaminated sediments have
accumulated, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Rychlenski, a spokeswoman for the EPA, disputed Walsh's
estimate that it would take a decade to dredge the river.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not know what our decision is going to be,'' she said.
''However, we certainly do not anticipate that a remedy, should we
go to a remedy would take 10 years or shut down the river for 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   She said scientists who have looked at the river for the EPA
agreed that contaminated sediments are not being covered over at
the rate GE says they are and that, in some cases, PCBs are
continuing to migrate southward in the river.
</P>
<P>
   PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, were used as insulating
material in transformers and other electrical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   They have been linked to cancer in laboratory animals.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSBURG, N.Y. (AP) - It's been 12 years now, and Susan M. Dean
is seriously considering getting a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   She's pretty sure a cellular phone would work at her home, which
sits on top of an unnamed Adirondack mountain in this
200-square-mile town, far from pavement and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Her two oldest children are out of the house, and she thinks a
phone would allow her 14-year-old to keep in closer touch with
friends. It can get lonely on a mountaintop.
</P>
<P>
   But Dean wouldn't have it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, James, spent four years building their
substantial but simple home. They overcame the daunting task of
hauling materials up the mountainside by employing whichever of
their ancient cars, trucks and tractors was working at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The outside of the home is clad in rough-edged boards.
Old-timers call it hogpen siding, but now it's generally called
Adirondack wavy coat. Their water is pumped to a storage tank in a
second-floor closet by a gasoline-powered pump.
</P>
<P>
   As with most people, doing dishes is a chore Dean doesn't
relish. But the chore at her home includes the additional task of
heating up water on the propane stove. The same procedure is
required for a bath, but it's amazing how few pots of boiling water
it takes to heat up a tubful, she said.
</P>
<P>
   There are six propane lantern lights, mounted on walls
throughout the house, that provide plenty of light, she said. The
Deans also made sure when they built the house that the numerous
windows let in plenty of sunlight during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Their flat spot on the mountain offers sweeping views that can
be enjoyed almost in a full circle -- particularly in winter, when
the trees are bare.
</P>
<P>
   Dean chose this remote location because she wanted to be
surrounded by natural beauty on the outside and wanted her inner
life to reflect that peacefulness.
</P>
<P>
   She says it's working.
</P>
<P>
   The family bought their land in 1984, and it took four years to
build their home. They moved in 1988 and haven't regretted a
moment, she said. It's sometimes a pain having to run into town to
do laundry and make phone calls, she said, and she's left out of
conversations that involve the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But Dean also doesn't participate in conversations when people
are complaining about the stress in their lives, the hectic pace,
the never-ending demands on their time.
</P>
<P>
   Dean says her lifestyle has pushed her stress level so far down
that it almost can't be felt.
</P>
<P>
   She's also found that being so isolated has actually made her
feel more sociable.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not surrounded by it all the time, and I can choose who I
want to be involved with,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dean grew up in Amsterdam, N.Y., an old industrial city on the
Mohawk River 25 miles northwest of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   She'd never even been camping until she went to college. And she
never considered living ''off the grid'' until she met her husband
James.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been a woodsman at heart his whole life, she said. He
was inspired in junior high by a book he read by a woman who moved
to the backwoods of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Dean said she concentrated on raising good children,
which she believes she's accomplished to the best of her ability.
</P>
<P>
   James provides the family's modest income by working on
construction projects during the building season.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter how much money you have, there could always be a
little more,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dean said her only complaint is not being able to afford better
and more reliable vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, as her children became independent, Dean
turned to writing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole thing of my life is just a peace message, I guess,''
she said. ''And I wanted to put that out. I had to get peace myself
first; then I could write about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first book, printed in 1996, is ''Unplugged in the
Adirondacks,'' which she subtitled ''Book One of a Violet
Tapestry.'' She decided to make it the first part of a trilogy to
force herself to keep producing, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The second book, out two years later, is ''Plugged in to the
Mountain Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   After paying for the printing herself, she traveled in widening
circles to shops in the Adirondacks to distribute the books. Even
then, she said she only tried to sell them at stores where she got
''good vibes,'' because she didn't want to create stress with books
promoting personal peace.
</P>
<P>
   The books have sold fairly well and have paid for themselves,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the final book of the trilogy, Dean hopes to includes color
pictures of some of her artwork, such as drawings of traditional
quilt patterns. She also wants to include some of the more
interesting letters she's gotten from readers all over the country,
which have been a motivation to keep writing, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Serious writing, however, has been put on hold for the summer
while Dean leads a local effort to plan a series of events
celebrating women and Adirondack traditions. The series will
conclude in October with a major festival called Adirondack Women
2000.

<HEADLINE> Legislators reach agreement on pesticide notification  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Senate and Assembly on Monday
reached agreement to give counties and New York City the option of
governing how neighbors are to be notified when pesticides are in
use.
</P>
<P>
   In areas which opt to get into the program, neighbors must
receive two-day advance notice of commercial application of
pesticides. All properties within 150 feet of the application site
must be notified, the agreed-to bill stipulates.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners who apply pesticides on their lawns would not have to
notify neighboring properties in advance, but must post warning
flags when pesticide application is complete.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the measure mandates that schools statewide give
parents the choice of getting 48-hour advance notice of impending
pesticide applications. Schools would also need to send out three
notices a year to parents, listing dates, locations and products
used in such applications.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day prior notification requirement would also apply to
daycare facilities, which must provide postings indicating prior
notice.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of schools and daycare centers, the measure would
apply to both indoor and outdoor application of pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   The state Assembly has passed a bill mandating municipalities
statewide adhere to notification laws, but that version has not
made it through the Senate. Earlier this month, the Senate passed a
measure allowing local governments to ''opt-in'' to a neighbor
notification program, but it did not include schools and daycare
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli said his chamber would have
preferred a statewide mandate, but added that it was ''certainly
better to have opt-in than not having a bill at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be nice to have everyone starting on the same time,
but I think citizens would put pressure on counties that don't
opt-in immediately,'' the Nassau County Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's chief sponsor of the bill Carl Marcellino, R-
Nassau County, said he favored giving municipalities the choice
because some rural counties had said pesticide notification wasn't
necessary. Nevertheless, Marcellino was optimistic that most
counties would join in.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not be surprised if well over 90 percent of the
counties would opt in immediately,'' he said. ''This bill is now
quite comprehensive ... to include both schools and daycare.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental advocates, who had also pushed for a statewide
mandate, applauded the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Haight of the New York Public Interest Research Group,
said if the bill is passed, it would be the first of its kind in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good first step even though we're disappointed about
the opt-in,'' Haight said. ''We're going to work in every county in
the state to make sure that everyone will opt in.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Audrey Thier, pesticide project director of Environmental
Advocates: ''This is a giant step forward. We consider this a
breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Properties using integrated pest management techniques -
alternative pest management techniques that require little or no
pesticides - would not have to follow notification requirements.
Granular pesticides are also exempt from the advance notification
mandate because they are applied directly are don't drift,
lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was announced at a news conference in Mineola on
Long Island Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators are expected to vote on the measure when they return
to Albany Thursday to resolve unfinished businesses in their
regular 2000 session.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Gov. George Pataki, said:
''We're encouraged that there seems to be progress made but we need
to see the final language'' before deciding if the governor would
sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   If enacted, the bill would go into effect March 1, 2001.

Taiwan Leader Offers Summit With China

   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- President Chen Shui-bian offered Tuesday to hold
Taiwan's first-ever summit with China, saying he believed the two leaders could
''create history'' like their Korean counterparts. At his first news conference
since taking office one month ago, Chen said he hopes to shake hands with
President Jiang Zemin of China and to seek reconciliation during a summit held
in any location and under any format that Jiang chooses. China has long
considered Taiwan a renegade state and demanded that it be rejoined to the

   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea's economy expanded 6.2 percent in
1999, the first growth in nine years and a rate that officials said was
sustainable. Officials at Seoul's central Bank of Korea said this week's easing
of U.S. economic sanctions against Pyongyang and the expected increase in South
Korean investment would positively affect the North's economy. In its
preliminary report, the South Korean bank said that the North's economy turned
around in 1999 for the first time since 1990, helped by growth in almost all

Report Criticizes Child Farmworking
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of children are laboring under
dangerous conditions in U.S. agriculture, Human Rights Watch charged in a report
issued Tuesday. The report, ''Fingers to the Bone: United States Failure to
Protect Child Farmworkers,'' charges that many young people ages 13 to 16 work
70 to 80 hours a week and risk pesticide poisoning, heat illness, injuries and
lifelong disabilities. The report said these abuses are possible because the
laws governing child labor in agriculture are much less stringent than those for
other types of work.

House Votes To Bar Tobacco Suit Aid
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Monday to bar the Justice Department from
accepting funds from another agency to help pay for the federal lawsuit against
the tobacco industry, even as Attorney General Janet Reno warned that such steps
would force her to drop the multibillion-dollar litigation. By a 207-197 vote,
the House stood behind language in a spending bill that would force the
Department of Veterans Affairs to abandon its plans to give the Justice
Department $4 million to help it pay for the huge lawsuit. The legal action
seeks to recover billions spent by Medicare and other federal programs to treat
illnesses caused by smoking.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Fans Turn Violent After Win  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HARRIGAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The celebration of the Los Angeles Lakers'
first championship in 12 years turned violent Monday night as
revelers burned two police cars and destroyed at least two other
vehicles, including a TV news van.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10,000 people had gathered around the Staples Center by
the time the game ended in a 116-111 Lakers' victory over the
Indiana Pacers, with nearly 20,000 more still inside. As violence
erupted outside the arena, fans were kept inside as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were immediately reported in the melee outside.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers also remained inside the arena 90 minutes after the
game, as authorities barred their bus from leaving. On the
sidewalks outside, police wielding batons cleared away fans and
guarded firefighters dousing a flaming police car.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was mostly peaceful until nearly an hour after the
game when fans began throwing debris at limousines. The crowd then
smashed the windows on a white sport utility vehicle and the
television news van.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of men used boards and tree limbs to strike the vehicles,
while others looted fire extinguishers and other items from the
van.
</P>
<P>
   Lines of baton-carrying police, on foot and on horseback, moved
through the area in an effort to disperse the crowd. Thousands of
fans began running from the area, jamming downtown streets with
traffic and pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   Several bonfires also were set in the area, including one at an
intersection two blocks from the arena that backed up traffic
before it was extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   City fire spokesman Brian Humphrey said the fires did not pose
any threat to people or property.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fires were fueled mostly by paper, trash and T-shirts from
the opposing team,'' Humphrey said.

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Bar Tobacco Suit Aid  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House vowed to ''very aggressively''
battle congressional efforts to block funds for the huge federal
lawsuit against the tobacco industry after the House voted to bar
the Justice Department from asking another agency to help pick up
the tab.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 207-197 Monday to affirm language in a spending
bill that would block the Department of Veterans Affairs from
contributing $4 million toward the cost of prosecuting the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno had said hours earlier that without
financial help from other agencies, the Justice Department could
not afford next year's projected $26.2 million cost of the legal
action. That would leave her ''no choice but to seek to dismiss
this litigation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to heap election-year pressure on lawmakers, President
Clinton said in a written statement that ''Congress will be
capitulating to the tobacco industry once again at the expense of
taxpayers and their children.''
</P>
<P>
   And Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the White House budget office,
said after the vote that there was a long way to go in the battle.
She noted that the administration has threatened to veto the bill
containing the lawsuit language, and that similar provisions exist
in other House and Senate bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of fights to come, and we are going to wage
them very aggressively,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Such words did not deter most lawmakers, who heeded warnings
from proponents of blocking the funds transfer. The $4 million was
to come from $20.3 billion in the spending bill covering the
Veterans Affairs Department's medical care account, which includes
money for some of the agency's legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you support this amendment, you're going to take millions
of dollars out of veterans' health care,'' said Rep. James Walsh,
R-N.Y., author of the bill containing the provision.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter distributed at Reno's news conference before the
vote, four veterans groups urged lawmakers to ''resist efforts to
attempt to restrict funding'' for the Justice Department suit. The
groups were AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans
of America and Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Under current plans, the Justice Department would pay for $14.2
million of the suit's $26.2 million cost next year. The remaining
$12 million would be divided evenly among the departments of
Veterans Affairs, Defense, and Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   The government is spending $13.8 million this year, $5.8 million
from Justice and the rest from the same three agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robin Hayes, R-N.C., said the suit was ''an improper use of
the Department of Justice to try and do things driven by personal
political agendas ... that continue to attack tobacco farmers and
people who make a living in the tobacco industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three Democrats and 34 Republicans defected in the mostly
party-line roll call, mainly Democrats from tobacco-growing states
and GOP moderates.
</P>
<P>
   William Corr, executive vice president of the Campaign for
Tobacco-Free Kids, an anti-tobacco lobby, said the vote
''demonstrates the House leadership lacks the votes to override'' a
Clinton veto of the bill. With all House members voting, it would
take 290 votes, a two-thirds majority, to override a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the vote represented at least a temporary victory for
the major cigarette companies, which have billions of dollars at
stake in the federal lawsuit and are contesting it. Tobacco
companies have reached a $246 billion settlement with the states in
a similar lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday's vote, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chief sponsor
of the unsuccessful effort to kill the provision, said he would
have to ''regroup'' if his attempt failed. He was hoping to build
momentum to delete similar provisions from other bills.
</P>
<P>
   The language was included in a $101.1 billion measure financing
veterans, housing, environment and space programs for fiscal 2001,
which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department filed its lawsuit in September. At the
time, Reno said federal health plans pay more than $20 billion
annually treating smoking-related diseases, which kill 400,000
Americans a year.
</P>
<P>
   The government says that for 45 years, tobacco companies
conspired to mislead the public about the health perils of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Industry lawyers have called the lawsuit ''blatantly political''
and ''the height of hypocrisy'' because the government warned the
public of smoking dangers in the 1960s. Tobacco companies have also
challenged the government's right to recover payments it has made
under Medicare.

<HEADLINE> Senate To Vote on Hate-Crimes Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With fresh prodding from President Clinton,
the Senate is having another go at expanding the list of hate
crimes and giving federal prosecutors more leeway in bringing hate
crime charges.
</P>
<P>
   But while an almost identical bill was passed overwhelmingly by
the Senate last year, this time it has touched off heated debate
over whether the measure infringes on state and local powers of law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters cited the 1998 death in Jasper, Texas, of James Byrd,
a 49-year-old black man, who was dragged behind a pickup truck; and
the death, also in 1998, of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old
homosexual University of Wyoming student, who died after being
beaten into a coma and tied to a fence.
</P>
<P>
   Neither state had a hate-crimes statute.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hate crimes are modern day lynchings,'' said Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., the principal sponsor. ''They tear at the heart
and soul of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's legislation was headed for a vote Tuesday as an
amendment to an unrelated defense bill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Byrd's family Monday in Houston and renewed his
appeal for Senate passage. He also put in a few calls to wavering
senators.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd was dragged to death on a country road by a trio of white
men.
</P>
<P>
   ''Crimes motivated by hate are really fundamentally different
and I think should be treated differently under the law,'' Clinton
said. ''I ask all of you to stand up with this fine family. We have
to pass this legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The president cited FBI statistics that showed almost 8,000 hate
crimes were reported in 1998, the latest year available.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would add offenses motivated by sexual
orientation, sex or disability to the list of hate crimes already
covered under a 1968 federal law.
</P>
<P>
   It also would give federal prosecutors the option of pursuing a
hate-crime case if local authorities refused to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the Judiciary Committee chairman, was
pressing a rival approach that would set up a $5 million-a-year
fund at the Justice Department to help state and local authorities
investigate and prosecute hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal also would authorize a federal study to see whether
hate crimes were not being prosecuted by state and local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said the Kennedy measure was overly broad. For instance,
he suggested that under it every rape prosecution could be deemed a
hate crime and prosecuted in federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is little evidence that a broad federalization of hate
crimes is warranted,'' Hatch said. ''Serious constitutional
questions remain.''
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem facing the Kennedy measure: Senate
Republican leaders are wary of further weighing down the defense
bill with irrelevant amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are seeking to use the legislation to press a range of
high profile issues in this election year.
</P>
<P>
   A Kennedy spokesman, Will Keyser, said Kennedy was optimistic
the measure would be approved, although he suggested the vote could
be close.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate adopted the hate-crimes legislation last year as part
of a spending bill for the Commerce, Justice and State departments,
but it stalled in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's measure would expand a 1968 federal law that defines
hate crimes as assaults motivated by the victim's race, color,
religion or national origin as the victim attempts to exercise
certain specified federally protected activities -- including voting
or attending school.
</P>
<P>
   His measure has 42 co-sponsors, including six Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The underlying defense bill is S. 2549

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks More Medicare Spending  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hospitals and other health care providers
would get $21 billion more from Medicare over the next five years,
under a proposal President Clinton is planning to send to Congress
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is likely to borrow from a range of legislation
that has been introduced by lawmakers from both political parties,
who have come under increasing pressure from hometown caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore also is calling for a boost in Medicare
payments as part of his presidential campaign platform.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has a tremendous level of support on a bipartisan
basis,'' said Joel Johnson, a senior adviser to the president.
</P>
<P>
   The request is expected to be among several items on a wish-list
the Clinton administration is expected to send Capitol Hill later
this month, along with new estimates that government surpluses
accumulating during the next decade will be more than twice as
large as previously predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been analyzing the effects of the balanced budget act
and a lot of other things that are happening, and our priority is
to ensure that there is high quality access to care for Medicare
beneficiaries,'' said Medicare Administrator Nancy-Ann DeParle.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals, home health care agencies and nursing homes would
likely get much of the money under the administration proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Medicare legislation being developed by House
Republicans would give around $2 billion to HMOs, many of which
have pulled out of Medicare in recent years complaining payments
don't keep up with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Curbs on fees from Medicare, the nation's health insurance
program for the elderly and disabled, were part of 1997 legislation
to balance the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when private health plans have been imposing lower
prices as well, health care providers say Medicare is squeezing
them too tight. Many hospitals say they have cut back community
service work, for example, such as transportation programs or
satellite clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Overall Medicare spending declined for the first time in the
program's 35-year history in 1999, by about 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Congress voted to restore $16 billion to health care
providers, but there is broad agreement that was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is expected to upgrade its prediction for
federal budget surpluses to up to $1.9 trillion over the next 10
years, well above past estimates of $746 billion.

<HEADLINE> Senator Helps Staffer Without Legs  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Modern medicine and a pair of pants conceal
Daniel Johnson's life-altering injuries, but his optimism and the
example of Sen. Max Cleland help him live with them.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, an athletic-looking 24-year-old who was a junior
officer in the Navy, lost both legs below the knees and nearly died
last year while rescuing a sailor.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland, a Georgia Democrat who lost both legs and much of his
right arm in a grenade blast during the Vietnam War, heard about
Johnson's heroism and offered him a job on his defense policy team.
Johnson started work about a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''However bad you feel today, you're still alive, and that's a
good thing,'' Cleland said. ''That's a pretty sobering thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was injured last August. An ensign, he was standing
watch aboard the amphibious command ship USS Blue Ridge off Pusan,
South Korea, when seaman Steve Wright became tangled in a tugboat
line and was pulled across the deck. Johnson rushed to help and was
caught in the line, too. Wright, from Pine Bluff, Ark., lost a leg
and three fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who received the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his
heroism, said he quickly realized there were two ways to approach
his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could either be positive about it and try to go through it
quickly, or go negative and the route of self-pity,'' said Johnson,
from Hickory, N.C. ''To me, it's a lot easier to look at what
options I do have rather than what ones I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   To lift his spirits, someone gave Johnson an article about
Cleland's experience in Vietnam. Days later, he got a call from the
senator, who had read an article about Johnson. They quickly
developed a friendship, and Cleland asked Johnson if he would like
to work in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland, who formerly headed the Department of Veterans Affairs,
said Johnson illustrates the kind of commitment military personnel
exhibit every day.
</P>
<P>
   ''While others were standing around, Daniel in effect went to
the fray, and it cost him,'' Cleland said. ''That's one of the
things about military work: It costs time, energy, blood, sweat and
toil, and sometimes life and limb.''
</P>
<P>
   Undergoing treatment at Washington's Walter Reed Hospital,
Johnson joined an informal network of amputees who helped each
other cope with the injuries. They went on outings, and now Johnson
sometimes calls other amputees to chat.
</P>
<P>
   Among the others was Dean Johnson, who was helping a motorist
start a car when a tractor-trailer hit him. Both legs had to be
amputated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody said our cases were similar,'' said Dean Johnson,
who isn't related to Daniel. ''My spirits were always kind of high,
but it showed me what I could aspire for. Daniel and the senator
lead normal lives, so I guess I can, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleland marvels at Johnson's prostheses, which allow him to ski,
play softball and participate in other activities that were
unthinkable for amputees not too long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland's legs were blown off above the knees in 1968, and he
needed to use a heavy waist harness and crutch to walk with
prosthetic limbs. He eventually decided a wheelchair was easier and
has been using it ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was more fortunate. His legs were amputated below the
knee.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you've gotta be a leg amputee, that's the way to do it,''
Cleland said. ''What Daniel has that I don't is that when he stands
up, he has balance.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 23, Johnson will celebrate his first ''Alive Day'' -- the
anniversary of the day he almost died. Cleland, who celebrates his
birthday the next day, will be visiting troops in South Korea, but
has promised to call Johnson.

<HEADLINE> EU: Austria Sanctions Will Stay Put  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WIELAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MARIA DA FEIRA, Portugal (AP) -- Austria's 14 colleagues in
the European Union once again said sanctions would remain in place
to punish Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel for forming a government
with the far right Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres told Schuessel on
Monday there is no enthusiasm among the other 14 EU nations to end
the sanctions. Portugal now holds the EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no reason to change the rules,'' Belgian Prime
Minister Guy Verhofstadt told reporters late Monday, the summit's
opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Austria also figured in another dispute: It opposed a 20 percent
tax on interest income Europeans earn on savings in other
countries. EU leaders, who will revisit the issue Tuesday, said a
deal was at hand to end years of stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the setbacks of bringing stability to Kosovo, the EU
leaders agreed to put together a police force of 5,000 specially
trained policemen to go to hot spots on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Solana, the EU's foreign and security policy chief,
reported to the 15 EU leaders Monday that efforts to create an EU
military force of 60,000 troops, separate from NATO for
peacekeeping and humanitarian crises, was proceeding well but that
more must be done for the civilian side of crisis management.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the NATO-led military intervention went smoothly last
summer but the U.N. civilian administration suffered for months for
lack of well-trained police officers to maintain order.
</P>
<P>
   ''The shortage of high quality police officers, of judges and
prosecutors as well as the overall shortfall in staffing continue
to undermine the work of (the United Nations) in key areas,''
Solana said in his report.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium, France, Portugal and Luxembourg are the harshest
critics of Schuessel, a mainstream conservative who invited the far
right Freedom Party -- widely seen as opposing a multicultural
society -- to form a government last February.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the formation of the Austrian government that led to
the sanctions,'' Verhofstadt said. ''We need to see a change from
the Austrian government'' before the sanctions are dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions are minor measures, such as bans on cultural and
sports events or secondary military cooperation accords, but they
have served to spoil the atmosphere at EU meetings and summits.
</P>
<P>
   Austria warned its partners are driving it to veto the EU's
eastward expansion. ''Enlargement cannot be debated when inside the
EU there is no constructive cooperation,'' Finance Minister
Karl-Heinz Grasser said
</P>
<P>
   He added the same was true for the difficult debate about
reforming EU institutions ahead of enlargement that is expected to
happen by 2005 or 2006.
</P>
<P>
   EU leaders spent much time Monday trying to reach a deal means
to tax interest income Europeans earn on savings in other
countries, eradicating a cross-border tax dodge that costs EU
countries billions in lost revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Germany initially led calls for a common 20 percent withholding
tax on interest from savings accounts held in banks anywhere in the
EU.
</P>
<P>
   After long debate, 14 EU nations now prefer countries to send
information about accountholders' interest to their home countries
so they can be taxed there. Austria remained a holdout, but was
expected to give in.

<HEADLINE> FDR's Arabian treasures from historic meeting displayed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HYDE PARK, N.Y. (AP) - A jeweled sword, a dagger, and silk
clothing embroidered in gold are among the treasures from a
historic meeting now displayed publicly for the first time in 55
years.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit of Saudi Arabian gifts is displayed through Oct. 31
at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in
Hyde Park, 67 miles north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The priceless presents were given to President Roosevelt by King
Abdulaziz Al-Saud of Saudi Arabia during their meeting aboard the
USS Quincy on Feb. 14, 1945. The leaders met to discuss the major
political issues that would affect their countries in the
approaching post-war era.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was a key foundation to the countries' strong
relationship that survives today.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition was conceived by officials of the U.S. Embassy in
Riyadh last year as part of the centennial celebration of Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a moving reminder of the role of their leadership,''
said Anna Roosevelt, president of the Franklin and Eleanor
Roosevelt Institute and granddaughter of the president.
</P>
<P>
   A ceremony to open the exhibit on Sunday included former crewmen
of the USS Quincy.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 116, Pacers 111  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The big fella cried, spilling tears that had
been welling up inside his massive 7-foot-1, 330-pound body for
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   He hugged his family, lifting several of them off the floor, and
walked to center court where the championship and MVP trophies
awaited and the purple and gold confetti streamed down from the
rafters.
</P>
<P>
   This was the moment that had eluded Shaquille O'Neal. Bad
free-throw shooter, one-dimensional player, bad actor, a rapper
without a ring -- all those titles had dogged him throughout his NBA
career.
</P>
<P>
   Not any more.
</P>
<P>
   Like Magic, Wilt and Kareem before him, Shaq and his sidekick
Kobe can now be described with just one word: champion.
</P>
<P>
   Taking over in an exciting fourth quarter that ended Larry
Bird's coaching career, O'Neal and Bryant led the Los Angeles
Lakers to a 116-111 victory over the Indiana Pacers in Game 6 of
the NBA Finals for the franchise's first title since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've waited eight years of my life for this to happen, and it
finally happened,'' said O'Neal, who broke down at center court
after achieving the goal that had eluded him for so long.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave Lakers coach Phil Jackson his seventh title --
his first without Michael Jordan -- in just his first season
coaching a team that had been ousted from the playoffs in each of
the first three seasons since O'Neal and Bryant arrived.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal scored 41 points, marking the third time he scored 40 or
more in this series. ''Ugliest 41 I ever had,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant had 26 including four free throws that clinched it in the
final 13 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm numb. I'm just numb right now,'' the 21-year-old Bryant
said. ''I didn't know champagne burned this much when it gets in
your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, 28, was the unanimous choice for MVP of the series,
adding to his MVP awards from the regular season and All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and Bryant hugged on the court after the final buzzer,
and O'Neal was mobbed by his family as he tried to leave the court.
With his exit blocked, he turned around and headed to midcourt to
receive the championship trophy.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 12th title in franchise history for the Lakers, the
seventh since they moved to Los Angeles in 1960. Magic Johnson,
Kareem-Abdul Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain had earned Los Angeles'
previous titles, and this starstruck city had been anxiously
awaiting the next one -- especially since O'Neal arrived from
Orlando in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they trailed for most of the first three quarters
against a better shooting, more experienced opponent, the Lakers
were the superior team down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana tied the game at 103-103 on a 3-pointer by Jalen Rose
with 5:04 left, but that was the beginning of the end.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry, who won his third career title, hit a leaner from
the lane, and Ron Harper, who won his fourth, stole the ball on the
Pacers' next possession.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal hit a soft 10-footer from the baseline, Rose missed on a
drive and Bryant calmly sank a 20-footer, bobbing and weaving and
whistling ever so slightly as he sauntered back to the bench and
Indiana called timeout with 3:28 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers then went to the Hack-a-Shaq defensive strategy,
sending O'Neal to the line four times in a span of 21 seconds. He
missed three of them before Jackson took him out with 2:27 left.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Neal returned with 1:56 left, the Lakers' lead was down
to 110-107 and Indiana had the ball. Austin Croshere was fouled
with 1 second left on the shot clock and made both to make it a
one-point game.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice answered with two free throws, Croshere airballed a
turnaround jumper, Bryant missed a drive and Miller rushed a long
3-pointer and missed.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant then was isolated at the top of the key and was hacked on
a drive. He calmly made both free throws with 13 seconds left for a
114-109 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Davis dunked for Indiana to make it a three-point game with
5.4 seconds left, but Bryant again went to the line and calmly sank
two more to clinch it.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked to the bench, he pointed to his ring finger, the
one that will soon be adorned with a championship ring.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, owner Jerry Buss addressed the fans and
commissioner David Stern presented O'Neal with his trophy. O'Neal
held it aloft in his massive left arm and waved it to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to thank Phil Jackson, the real coach of the year,''
O'Neal said, referring to the media's selection of Doc Rivers of
Orlando for that award. ''I want to thank you all for believing in
us. We're going to get one next year, too.''
</P>
<P>
   That'll be the next test for the Lakers, to see if they can
build a dynasty to replace Jordan and the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, it's one title -- the one O'Neal and Bryant had
been waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal shot 19-for-32 from the field and grabbed 12 rebounds,
while Bryant had 10 rebounds and four assists to buffer an 8-for-27
shooting performance.
</P>
<P>
   Rice added 16 for the Lakers, who outscored Indiana 37-27 in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what I like about Phil, not what he did with Michael
and Scottie, but how he got the other guys to play,'' O'Neal said.
''He just put it down on paper and said this is what you're going
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose had 29, Miller 25 and Davis 20 for the Pacers, whose quest
for the franchise's first NBA title came up short. In the end, they
simply couldn't keep up with the energy the Lakers got from a crowd
that waited 12 years for this moment.
</P>
<P>
   The fans got out of control outside Staples Center. They set
fire to four vehicles, including two police cars and a TV news van,
and lighted several bonfires.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 10,000 fans gathered to celebrate outside the arena,
and the Pacers' bus was prevented from leaving for almost 2&AMP;frac12; hours
because of the crowd. Fans mobbed O'Neal's SUV as it left the
arena.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the game, it looked like that party wouldn't happen
until Game 7 Wednesday night -- or maybe not at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers repeatedly whittled down deficits and got within one,
only to watch the Pacers surge back ahead. But when Los Angeles
made yet another charge early in the fourth and finally took the
lead, it was the Pacers who had to play from behind.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Shaw stole the ball from Rose three minutes into the
fourth quarter and O'Neal scored on a fast break while being fouled
to give the Lakers their first lead since late in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who stayed down for a minute clutching his left knee,
missed a chance for a three-point play. But Rose then missed a
reverse layup with O'Neal in his way and Rick Fox nailed a long
3-pointer for a 94-90 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It would be another 3&AMP;frac12; minutes before Indiana tied it, and
Horry's leaner with 4:48 left gave the Lakers the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Their title capped a season in which they had winning streaks of
19, 16 and 11 games and were all but anointed champions before the
playoffs even started. Their postseason run included a stunning
comeback from a late 16-point deficit to defeat the Portland Trail
Blazers in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Perkins gave Indiana its first double-digit lead on a
3-pointer with 7:44 left that made it 42-32. Perkins hit another 3,
the Pacers' seventh of the game, for a 47-35 lead midway though the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers finally took back the momentum late in the quarter,
getting a steal from Bryant, a dunk from O'Neal, a steal from
Harper and a 3-pointer by Bryant -- all in the final 47 seconds -- to
close to 56-53 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant started the third quarter with a short jumper to make it
a one-point game, but the Pacers scored nine of the next 11 points,
including a 3-pointer by Miller, for a 67-59 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Miller shot a glance at actor Jack Nicholson after hitting his
next jumper, and the Pacers maintained control for the next few
minutes. But Bryant hit a short pull-up jumper, A.C. Green made a
12-footer and Rice hit a 3-pointer from the corner to cut Indiana's
lead to 71-70.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles had two chances to take the lead but failed both
times as Bryant missed a jumper and Rice misfired on two free
throws. Indiana got its lead back up to seven as Jackson had a
3-pointer and Miller had a three-point play.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers again closed within one, but Indiana scored the final
four points of the quarter to take an 84-79 lead into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Lakers reserve center John Salley became the first NBA
player to win titles with three different teams. He also won with
Detroit and Chicago. ... Lakers forward A.C. Green also was a
member of the Lakers when they won in 1988. ... O'Neal picked up a
technical foul in the second quarter for shoving Croshere in the
back. Croshere also got kneed in the ribs while drawing an
offensive foul on Horry late in the second quarter. Croshere
finished with 16 points and an enormous amount of respect gained.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 13, Orioles 12, 10 Inn  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Jeremy Giambi's RBI single in the bottom
of the 10th inning capped Oakland's seven-run comeback and gave the
Athletics their sixth straight win, 13-12 over the Baltimore
Orioles on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi singled off Mike Timlin (2-2) with one out in the
10th. One out later, John Jaha walked. Jeremy Giambi then
pinch-hit, singling to left to drive in his older brother.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the 21 runs they scored Sunday at Kansas City, the
A's tied an Oakland record with 34 runs in a two-game span.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Tam (2-2) pitched the final three innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams threatened in the ninth. The Orioles had runners on
second and third with no outs, but Tam got Luis Matos, Mike Bordick
and Delino DeShields to ground out without a run scoring.
</P>
<P>
   The A's loaded the bases with one out in the bottom of the
ninth, but Timlin got Terrence Long to hit into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland, which trailed 8-1 in the top of the third, scored six
runs in the bottom of that inning. Jaha and Matt Stairs walked with
the bases loaded to force in runs, and Miguel Tejada had a two-run
double.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi, who came into the game second in the AL with 67
RBIs, added a two-run double and Ben Grieve hit a two-run homer as
the A's scored four in the sixth. Giambi has 17 RBIs in his last 11
games.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle hit a three-run homer and Mike Bordick, leading off
for the first time in five years, had a three-run triple for
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Belle, who has 12 homers and 30 RBIs in his last 20 games, hit
his 17th homer of the season in the fifth as the Orioles -- the
worst road team in the majors -- fell to 10-25 away from home this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Bordick's three-run double capped a five-run Baltimore third in
which Cal Ripken had an RBI double and Charles Johnson added a
run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also hit a solo homer, B.J. Surhoff had two RBI singles
and Delino DeShields had an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's Mark Mulder gave up six runs and seven hits in just 2
1-3 innings, by far the shortest start of his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles starter Pat Rapp failed to take advantage of a big early
lead for the second straight game. He was given an 8-1 lead in the
third, but was not able to get an out in the bottom of the third
before being pulled.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp, who allowed five runs on five hits, had been staked to a
5-0 lead last Wednesday against Texas but was unable to complete
the fourth inning of that game.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Belle's homer was his 375th, moving him past Rocky Colavito
into sole possession of 44th place on the career list. ... Bordick
led off for the first time since Aug. 13, 1995, when he was playing
for the A's. ... Surhoff, who had four singles and went 4-for-6,
extended his hitting streak to 13 games. ... Ripken's second at-bat
of the evening was the 10,973rd of his career, moving him past Stan
Musial into eighth place on the career list. ... Luis Matos made
his major league debut for the Orioles, playing center field and
going 0-for-4 with a walk. ... Baltimore manager Mike Hargrove was
ejected in the sixth by home plate umpire Scott Higgins. ... The
A's have scored 61 runs in their last five games. ... Eric Chavez
went 0-for-4 for the A's, snapping his 15-game hitting streak. ...
All 12 of Grieve's homers have come at night. ... The A's are 13-3
in June.

<HEADLINE> Town May Rethink School Prayer  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, Texas (AP) -- In a state where football and religion
are all-consuming, Santa Fe's school district can no longer allow
the two to mix under a landmark ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides of the debate will be watching this fall to see what,
if anything, the Santa Fe Independent School District does to
replace the school-prayer policy struck down Monday by the nation's
highest court.
</P>
<P>
   ''My initial reaction would be, at this point, to eliminate an
invocation or message as crafted,'' Superintendent Richard Ownby
said, adding that the school board will consult attorneys before
considering a response to the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 majority opinion bars students from leading stadium
crowds in meditation but could go much further to restrict prayer
in public schools, casting doubt on prayer at graduation ceremonies
or even moments of silence.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a complete and total victory for the freedom of
religion in this country,'' said William Harrell, executive
director of the Texas chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union. ''While some will see it as religion being prohibited in
schools, students can voluntarily pray any time they want.''
</P>
<P>
   School-prayer advocates say they're alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're clearly disappointed,'' said Kelly Shackleford, an
attorney for the school district and chief counsel for the
Texas-based Liberty Legal Institute. ''This is the first case in
the history of the country that the courts will censor or gag
religious expression of a private citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that a school that gives students the public
forum for prayer is effectively sponsoring the message.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing in the Constitution ... prohibits any public school
student from voluntarily praying at any time before, during or
after the school day. But the religious liberty protected by the
Constitution is abridged when the state affirmatively sponsors the
particular religious practice of prayer,'' Justice John Paul
Stevens wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling affirmed the 1962 ban on organized prayer in public
schools. Some school board members say the court will chill First
Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''This district would like to afford free-speech rights to all
students, and we feel like students' free-speech rights are being
stepped on,'' school board president Denise Cowart said.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic and Mormon mothers who initially sued the school
district in this predominantly Baptist town of 10,000 have remained
in the background, their identities sealed by the court. A friend
said the women, who still have children in Santa Fe schools, were
elated.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The board) has made religion almost like back when race was
an issue for the schools,'' Debbie Mason said. ''We all should just
thank whomever we believe in. They came out with a strong ruling,
so all schools across America would understand that you cannot do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the opinion's broad wording, school district attorney
Jay Sekulow said some student-led prayer remains possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still think issues of valedictorian prayer (and others) are
open,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue born in a football stadium about 40 miles south of
Houston made its way to Washington not only through the courts, but
also through presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I support the constitutionally guaranteed right of all
students to express their faith freely and participate in voluntary
student-led prayer,'' said Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
presumptive GOP candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas' Republican primary election last March, 94 percent of
voters approved a nonbinding resolution backing student-initiated
prayer at school sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, Bush's presumptive Democratic opponent,
said through an aide that he supported the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''He feels ... in this case that the prayer was found to be
government-sponsored and participation was not truly voluntary,''
Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway said. ''He does support private
prayer in school and at school-related events as long as
participation is truly voluntary and ... is suitable within the
school environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 Santa Fe lawsuit initially focused on both football
games and graduations. While the Supreme Court did not address
prayer at commencement ceremonies, Stevens frequently cited the
court's 1992 ban on clergy-led prayers at such events.
</P>
<P>
   After the lawsuit was filed, the policy was changed to let
student-elected representatives -- no longer called chaplains -- give
a ''message or invocation.''
</P>
<P>
   Marian Ward, a minister's daughter chosen to deliver the
invocation at her class's May 26 graduation, said the Supreme
Court's interpretation of the Constitution is too strict.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has gone from the word 'establishment' to the word
'allow,''' said Ward, who won an injunction against the district
last year to allow pregame prayers before football home games.
</P>
<P>
   School board members are unsure how much freedom they can give
to students appointed to speak in public.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've blurred (the line between) government speech and a
student's free-speech rights,'' board member John Couch II said.

<HEADLINE> Court Backs AIDS Disability Claim  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT ANDREWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The state Supreme Court has unanimously
upheld a man's claim for AIDS-related disability insurance despite
his decision not to disclose testing positive for HIV in his policy
application.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision Monday strongly encourages insurers to ask
about medical conditions before a disability policy is issued or to
ferret them out within two years.
</P>
<P>
   But after two years, the court ruled, consumers can make
disability claims based on illnesses that were not specifically
excluded from the policy -- even if those illnesses existed before
the policy was purchased.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Mark Galanty, the man with AIDS, said the ruling
has broad implications.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who become disabled -- regardless of the cause -- need no
longer worry that an insurance company will dig through their
medical files in an attempt to find a previous lab result, genetic
test or medical condition to use as an excuse for refusing
payment,'' said Jon Davidson of the Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, which handles civil rights case for gays, lesbians
and people with AIDS or HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Larry M. Golub, a lawyer for Paul Revere Life Insurance Co.,
which denied benefits to Galanty, said he had not read the ruling
and declined comment. Lawyers for the American Council of Life
Insurers, which supported the company in court, did not respond to
requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Galanty, 52, of Studio City, was working as a free-lance court
transcriber when he tested positive for HIV in 1987. He was told
the result was unreliable unless confirmed by a second test, but
chose not to get a follow-up test.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1989, Galanty bought his Paul Revere disability policy.
The company didn't ask whether he had AIDS or whether he had tested
positive for HIV. The policy did not exclude people with either of
those conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1994, Galanty claimed disability based on AIDS and
on an AIDS-related condition that causes numbness and pain in the
hands and feet.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Revere initially paid benefits, but denied coverage for
about two years once it discovered the positive HIV test -- which
the company said amounted to a pre-existing condition.
</P>
<P>
   About two years after Paul Revere cut off Galanty's AIDS-related
benefits, he began collecting for a different, non-AIDS disability:
tremors in his hands. Monday's ruling, which overturns two lower
court rulings, means he will get about $72,000 in compensation.

<HEADLINE> Texas Town Rethinking School Prayer  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, Texas (AP) -- In a state where football and religion
are passions, Santa Fe's school district can no longer allow the
two to mix under a landmark ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides of the debate will be watching this fall to see what,
if anything, the Santa Fe Independent School District does to
replace the school-prayer policy struck down Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''My initial reaction would be, at this point, to eliminate an

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Chicken Run'  </HEADLINE>
By MALCOLM RITTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a tale of danger, courage, resourcefulness, faith,
redemption and thrilling escape from certain death.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine it's about chickens.
</P>
<P>
   That's the scoop with ''Chicken Run,'' a delightful story told
with ingenious clay animation by the makers of the popular Wallace
&AMP; Gromit shorts.
</P>
<P>
   The movie makes plenty of fun of the contrast between its
dramatic themes and the largely hapless hens that act them out. But
before long, you begin to know and like these chickens. You start
rooting for them to succeed -- even as you enjoy the essentially
loony scenes they create.
</P>
<P>
   The story is set in England at Tweedy's Egg Farm, which looks
like a World War II-style POW camp for fowl. The chickens line up
for roll call each morning, and any hen whose egg production is
failing is plucked up and decapitated by the evil Mrs. Tweedy
(voiced by Miranda Richardson).
</P>
<P>
   It gets even grimmer when Mrs. Tweedy, tired of the farm's tiny
profits, decides to go into another business. She buys a huge
machine that swallows chickens and spits out pies. Now even good
egg-laying won't save a hen from death.
</P>
<P>
   The hens have a ringleader, Ginger (voiced by Julia Sawalha,
best known as Saffron in the BBC series ''Absolutely Fabulous.'')
Her escape plans fail time after time. But she finds hope when an
American rooster named Rocky (voiced by Mel Gibson) quite literally
lands in the farmyard one day. Teach us to fly out of here, she
begs.
</P>
<P>
   He's a cocky ''lone free ranger'' who enjoys the attention of
all these hens. He agrees to Ginger's request, without admitting
that he flies only when shot out of a cannon in a circus act.
</P>
<P>
   His flight training program is doomed, of course, though it's
plenty of fun to watch. In the end, it is Ginger who conceives of
her grandest, most preposterous escape plan yet. It works, but with
plenty of tension to the very end. Her final confrontation with
Mrs. Tweedy is riveting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chicken Run,'' from DreamWorks Pictures, is rated G. It
includes cartoonish violence, and Mrs. Tweedy quite clearly kills
one hen offscreen. The 90-minute film is produced by Peter Lord,
David Sproxton and Nick Park, and directed by Lord and Park.

<HEADLINE> U.N.: Traces Left of Cattle Disease  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- The United Nations expressed confidence Tuesday that
one of the world's deadliest cattle diseases can be eradicated in
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The last traces of the rinderpest virus, which has destroyed
entire populations of cattle and buffalo, were detected in
southeastern Sudan, southern Somalia, Yemen, Pakistan and Iraq, the
Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization reported.
</P>
<P>
   After cleaning up the remaining pockets of infection, the
agency's 10-year program includes ending the vaccination worldwide
by the year 2002 -- a move expected to save money and provide
evidence that the virus has been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   A five-year verification process is scheduled to start in 2003,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years rinderpest has caused widespread famine in
regions that depend on cattle for meat and milk products. In
Nigeria in the early 1980s, it caused losses estimated at $2
billion.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'  </HEADLINE>
By BOB THOMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   The newfound Kings of Raunch, Bobby and Peter Farrelly, return
with another Jim Carrey movie that makes their ''Dumb and Dumber''
seem like ''Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Me, Myself and Irene'' allows Carrey to exercise his limitless
talent with material that would get boys expelled from grammar
school. The movie is crude, outrageous and often uproarious,
especially if you leave your inhibitions at home.
</P>
<P>
   A prologue is narrated by Rex Allen Jr., who sounds just like
his daddy, narrator of those folksy Disney movies of a generation
ago. Allen tells of good-natured Charlie Baileygates (Carrey), a
Rhode Island state trooper who rarely hands out a ticket. Charlie
finds the love of his life (Traylor Howard), but on the way home
from the wedding, she falls for the diminutive black limo driver
(Tony Cox). After giving birth to black triplets, she runs off with
their father, leaving Charlie to raise the three boys.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, the boys are huge, foul-mouthed but loving sons who
are also geniuses -- the top three in their high school class.
Charlie is the same mild fellow who is considered a pushover by the
townspeople. He starts getting twinges, and suddenly his alter ego,
Hank Baileygates, emerges, a rampaging ruffian who wreaks vengeance
on those who have scoffed at Charlie.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie is diagnosed as a schizophrenic, and medicine keeps Hank
out of sight. But Charlie's life changes when he is sent to escort
Irene (Renee Zellweger) to New York, where she is sought by agents
of the EPA (the EPA?) as witness in a swindle by a golf course
owner. And, of course, the owner wants Irene dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Farrellys love road pictures, as evidenced by ''Dumb and
Dumber,'' ''Kingpin'' and ''There's Something About Mary.'' The
same with ''Me, Myself and Irene,'' as Charlie and Irene (and often
Hank) are chased across two states by cops, fake cops and others.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Charlie/Hank is a perfect fit for the protean
Carrey, who smoothly shifts between the characters without benefit
of makeup or special effects. Zellweger, impressive as Tom Cruise's
love interest in ''Jerry Maguire,'' confirms her emergence as a
first-rank star as the shrewd but vulnerable Irene.
</P>
<P>
   The Farrelly brothers directed the film and wrote it with a
Rhode Island schoolmate, Mike Cerrone. They have created a
franchise with comedies that push the envelope of taste and
propriety, especially with bathroom and sex humor (a running joke
involves a plastic phallus).
</P>
<P>
   One discordant note: The three sons speak street language,
supposedly because their father sought to prepare them for the
black world. Their constant use of vulgarities is both jarring and
stereotypical.
</P>
<P>
   ''Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' is a 20th Century Fox release, produced
by Bobby and Peter Farrelly and Bradley Thomas. Rated R for
language and crudeness. Running time: 2 hours.

<HEADLINE> Resurrection: Rare Hispanic Drama  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Part of the action in ''Resurrection Blvd.''
takes place in the boxing ring, but the real fight was getting the
drama on television.
</P>
<P>
   The new Showtime series about a close-knit Mexican-American
family runs counter to TV's tired habit of either snubbing Hispanic
characters or relegating them to supporting roles as hoodlums or
maids.
</P>
<P>
   It's about time, say the cast and creator of ''Resurrection
Blvd.,'' which debuts 10 p.m. EDT Monday (June 26) on the cable
channel.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's bittersweet that we're in the year 2000 and this is what
we're talking about for the first time,'' said series star Michael
DeLorenzo (''New York Undercover''). ''It doesn't make me spring
with joy because you think, 'Why has it taken so long for something
very simple, a family drama portraying Latinos?'''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't for lack of effort, said series creator and executive
producer Dennis E. Leoni. He had an established TV track record,
writing for series including ''Raven'' and ''The Commish,'' when he
first pitched a Hispanic family series to Hollywood studios.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had written a spec (speculative) pilot, 'La Reforma,' sort
of my 'Wonder Years,''' he said. The response: ''There's no way
you're going to get it done with an all-Latino cast,'' Leoni
recalled. ''I got laughed at.''
</P>
<P>
   Some five years later, he heard Showtime was interested in
developing Hispanic programming. His original idea was ''a soft,
sweet story,'' not quite right for the channel, which favors edgier
fare, but Showtime encouraged him to try a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   When Leoni flipped on the channel one night and saw boxers
slugging it out, the idea of combining family drama with the
intensity of competition in the ring ''just sort of clicked,'' he
said. Showtime has ordered a full season, 22 episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Resurrection Blvd.'' focuses on the Santiago family of East
Los Angeles, including patriarch and widower Roberto (Tony Plana),
his sister-in-law Bibi (Elizabeth Pena) and Roberto's five
children, including Carlos (DeLorenzo) and Miguel (Maurico
Mendoza).
</P>
<P>
   Boxing is part of the family's heritage, although the Santiago
hope of fielding a champion has been repeatedly dashed. Now it is
Carlos' turn for a shot at glory with the help of his driven
father, a Vietnam War veteran forced to settle for less in his own
life.
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes such proven standouts as Plana, whose film
credits include ''JFK,'' ''Salvador'' and ''Primal Fear,'' and Pena
(''Lone Star,'' ''Rush Hour''). The series also represents a chance
for newcomers like Nicholas Gonzalez, who makes his TV series debut
as the youngest Santiago son, Alex, a pre-med student at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Behind-the-camera roles are largely filled by Hispanics,
including writers, directors, costume designers and crew members.
</P>
<P>
   There was no shortage of actors eager to be part of the landmark
series, said casting director Bob Morones, a 28-year industry
veteran. Some even left photos and resumes on the windshield of
Morones' car.
</P>
<P>
   In the series' production office on the Paramount lot, he points
to the thousands of actors' ''head shots'' filling shelf after
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we have a talent pool,'' he said. ''Before, we were
scraping corners, trying to find talent. But in the last five years
there's been a major influx of (Latino) actors coming out of
universities and acting schools in the United States and South
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Their dreams are fueled, he said, by the success of music stars
like Gloria Estefan, Ricky Martin and the late Selena, and
actresses like Jennifer Lopez, Morones said.
</P>
<P>
   But the increasing prominence of Hispanic artists has not
translated into changes in television, especially at the broadcast
networks. The one Hispanic pilot under consideration for the fall
season, ''American Family,'' was rejected by CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Very few series about Hispanics have ever made it to air or
gained longevity. ''A.K.A. Pablo,'' about a young Hispanic comedian
and his extended family, ran briefly in 1984. ''Trial and Error,''
a comedy about two buddies from the East Los Angeles barrio, was a
blip on the screen in March 1988. Most successful was NBC's ''Chico
and the Man,'' which ran four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   (Cable TV is proving more responsive: Among upcoming series are
Nickelodeon's ''The Brothers Garcia,'' about a Mexican-American
family in San Antonio, ''Taina,'' focusing on a Hispanic girl in
New York, and an animated series with a Hispanic lead figure.)
</P>
<P>
   But there's no broadcast bandwagon for Latino shows, said Leoni:
''Hopefully, 'Resurrection Blvd.' will get the car rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Key to its success will be proving that the series has broad
appeal -- to the diverse Hispanic American community, which includes
those of Puerto Rican, Cuban and Mexican descent, and to
non-Hispanics, Leoni said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really grateful for all the attention the Latino thing
brings. I understand this is important and there's a lot of people
depending on me and the show to prove we can do something like
this.
</P>
<P>
   ''But at some point I want to stop focusing on the Latino thing
and start focusing on the quality of the show,'' he said. ''I'm
hoping people will look beyond (ethnicity) and say it's about
family, it's about an American family.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Composite Index Breaks 4,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index rose past 4,000
Tuesday for the first time since April, continuing a gradual
recovery from the steep selloff that knocked it as much as 37
percent below its record high.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the technology-focused Nasdaq
composite was up 46.06 at 4,035.89. The index hasn't traded above
4,000 since April 12, when it ultimately plunged 286.27 points.
Even though it has recovered lost ground since then, it still is
20.5 percent below the all-time high of 5,048.62 set March 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 48.43 at 10,509.41 and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 3.51 at 1,482.49.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who had grown leery of technology stocks are now
seeking out some of the biggest names in the sector on the
expectation that those companies will show the strongest profit
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Many technology stocks remain very highly priced relative to
their earnings. But now that rising interest rates have begun
forcing a modest economic slowdown, threatening corporate profits,
investors are focusing on companies whose earnings are growing
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq has been stuck in a very tight range while
investors have debated whether a slowdown was positive or whether
it would weigh on earnings,'' said William Meehan, chief market
analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. ''Once people decided that tech
companies will continue to do very well, they broke out of that
trading range and have been gathering some nice momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Intel rose $2.625 to $139.125 and PMC-Sierra, a
semiconductor component maker, rose $9.75 to $202.75. Yahoo! rose
$7.438 to $146.50.
</P>
<P>
   Dow component Honeywell International continued paying a price
for its announcement Monday that second-quarter earnings will miss
analysts' expectations. Honeywell said it is struggling with high
interest rates and higher-than-expected raw material prices in its
performance materials unit.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, its shares fell $3.375 to $36.875.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram fell $4.375 to $59.375 after French utilities and media
conglomerate Vivendi said it will buy the company for $34 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 310.40 million shares
in late morning, ahead of Monday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.23 to 526.02.

<HEADLINE> France Inaugurates Opera House  </HEADLINE>
By MARILYN AUGUST
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- France on Tuesday inaugurated the gleaming facade
of the Paris Opera, returned to its 19th-century splendor by a bold
renovation project that had experts tracking down precious
materials across two continents.
</P>
<P>
   Workers using state-of-the-art technology labored for more than
a year to remove grime that had accumulated since 1867, when the
opera house was built to the greater glory of Emperor Napoleon III.
</P>
<P>
   ''After years of grayness, the Palais Garnier has come to life,
its exterior in full harmony with the passion and light of its
interior,'' Culture Minister Catherine Tasca.
</P>
<P>
   Today the landmark is home to the Paris Opera Ballet company,
while opera performances are held at the Opera-Bastille in eastern
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ''The French have a saying that an architect creates a work, and
time perfects it,'' chief architect Alain-Charles Perrot said.
''But this is not the case of the Palais Garnier.''
</P>
<P>
   Air pollution and acid rain had darkened the chiseled limestone,
dimmed the luster of rooftop sculpture and corroded the colorful
mosaics and marbled floors of the elegant balcony overlooking the
square below.
</P>
<P>
   Once a fashionable perch to see and be seen during intermission,
a rooftop gallery had been off-limits to audiences since the late
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Heads, arms and legs had fallen off statues, pieces of mosaic
were falling on people's heads, and the floor was ripped up,''
Perrot said.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration, which cost $7.7 million, marks the second phase
of renovations that are scheduled to end in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest challenges was remaining true to the spirit
of architect Charles Garnier, Perrot said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to remain faithful to the original design, and that
meant repairing or recreating pieces using the same or similar
materials to the ones Garnier chose a century ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't easy. The extravagant Garnier had crisscrossed
Europe and North Africa seeking the finest building materials. The
facade itself required six types of stone cut from different
quarries, while 10 kinds of marble were used for decorative columns
and elaborate flooring.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some mosaics had pieces missing, and we were able to fill them
in after we located the company in Italy that had furnished them
133 years ago,'' Perrot said.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Plans Missile Defense Test  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has set a July 7 target date for
a decisive test of a national missile defense system. A missile
interceptor will try to collide in space with a mock warhead over
the central Pacific Ocean, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The last such intercept attempt failed in January, although the
first try, last October, succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement of the date for the twice-delayed flight test
was to be made Tuesday by Jacques Gansler, the Pentagon's
technology chief, and Air Force Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish, director of
the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, which is running the
missile defense project. Other officials disclosed the date and
said Kadish and Gansler would provide details on test preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Although July 7 is the target date, the Pentagon might wait
until the early hours of July 8 if weather conditions require. The
test originally was planned for May, then was pushed back to late
June to correct problems related to the failure of the January
attempted intercept. A wiring problem caused the latest delay.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has come under fire recently by critics who believe
the concept of intercepting long-range missiles outside the Earth's
atmosphere is flawed because an attacking nation could fool the
U.S. interceptor with decoys. The Pentagon acknowledges that decoys
are a long-term challenge but says the interceptors will be able to
overcome the kind of crude decoys likely to be encountered in the
short run.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of independent experts raised a variety of concerns
about the program in a report to the Pentagon this month. The
panel, headed by retired Air Force Gen. Larry Welch, said it
believed the Pentagon might have to slow down the project but that
the system eventually could be made to work as envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to use a combination of powerful radars,
ground-launched missile interceptors based in Alaska, and
high-speed computers to protect all 50 U.S. states against an
attack by 30 or fewer long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the July test will be closely watched on both
sides of the intensifying debate over national missile defense. It
likely will determine whether Defense Secretary William Cohen
recommends to President Clinton that he give the go-ahead this fall
to begin constructing the main radar in the Aleutian Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors to be weighed by Clinton are the project's cost,
the impact on arms control and an assessment of the threat facing
the United States of potential missile attacks by North Korea and
other hostile nations.
</P>
<P>
   If the start of construction is delayed beyond 2001, the Defense
Department likely will not meet its goal of having the missile
defense network ready for use by the end of 2005. By that date,
North Korea may have a long-range missile capable of striking U.S.
territory, according to U.S. intelligence estimates.

<HEADLINE> Survey Finds Poor Kids Lack Basics  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conditions for U.S. children have improved
somewhat in the last several years, a charitable group said
Tuesday. But far too many poor kids live in families lacking what
most Americans take for granted -- parents, computers, telephones,
cars and health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Six of 10 indicators used to measure child well-being showed
children were better off in 1997 than in 1990, said the annual Kids
Count survey sponsored by the private Annie E. Casey Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Infant mortality and child death rates dropped and teen birth
rates are down, the survey showed. Other improvements included an
18 percent drop in the rate of teen deaths by accident, homicide
and suicide and a 10 percent decline in the percentage of children
living with parents who lacked full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But other factors affecting well being -- low birth rates,
poverty and missing a parent -- worsened over the last several
years. Children in the poorest urban neighborhoods face a myriad of
barriers to succeed in a competitive world:
</P>
<P>
   --17 percent live in homes without phones.
</P>
<P>
   --84 percent of households with children don't have computers.
</P>
<P>
   --Half of all children live in families that don't have cars.
</P>
<P>
   --17 percent of children lack health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   --8 percent don't live with either parent.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a time when media experts, economists and social observers
stress that the future belongs to those on the Internet and to
those who can compete in a global economy, many inner-city families
don't have cars to get to work, phones to remain linked with family
and neighbors or computers that would allow them to navigate the
information superhighway,'' the survey reported.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, an amalgamation of data from federal and state
government studies, showed that despite the economic boom of the
1990s, the number of children living in working poor families
increased from 4.3 million in 1989 to 5.8 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This increase comes as millions of former welfare recipients
have left the rolls and entered low-wage jobs, causing the ranks of
the working poor to swell, the survey said. Most children living in
poverty do not receive government assistance, but instead live in
families where at least one parent is working.
</P>
<P>
   States where conditions were worst for children included
Arizona, New Mexico, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee,
Alabama, Kentucky, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and West
Virginia, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
   States with the best conditions included Maine, New Hampshire,
Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Iowa,
Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and Utah.

<HEADLINE> States, Towns Return FEMA Aid  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Years after coming to the rescue of victims
from California earthquakes to Pennsylvania blizzards, the
government demanded nearly a half-billion dollars back from states
and local communities, federal records show.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency insisted on the refunds
after auditors found the aid wasn't deserved. In some cases, the
work was not completed as promised or the recipients got paid twice
-- by the government and insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's office in New Orleans had to return $56,000 it
charged for flood cleanup work performed by prisoners working for
free, an Associated Press review of more than 100 recent audits
found.
</P>
<P>
   California was required to repay $1.4 million from a wildfire
that duplicated money recovered in a civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   And a former Florida parks official was indicted after
authorities couldn't locate the federally purchased palm trees his
agency was supposed to replant after a hurricane. The investigation
continues.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's disaster relief agency has recouped $442 million
over the last decade, according to FEMA. That total likely will
rise as more audits are completed. Examples were gleaned from the
most recent audits in 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The effort has alienated some local officials.
</P>
<P>
   In California, auditors in 1999 began questioning National Guard
aircraft costs from the 1994 Northridge earthquake, but the
aircraft logs had already been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were questioning something that doesn't even exist. We
had some concerns that maybe this is a little overkill,'' said Paul
Jacks, the state's deputy director of disaster assistance.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA officials say the effort is needed to improve accounting
for money that is distributed quickly in the aftermath of
catastrophes to ensure that victimized communities get the help
they need.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think a very high percentage of local governments and
states knowingly try to rip off the disaster program,'' said FEMA
Director James Lee Witt. ''I think there are mistakes made at
different times.''
</P>
<P>
   FEMA's public assistance funds are provided to state and local
government agencies and nonprofit organizations to help rebuild
communities after disasters.
</P>
<P>
   If auditors find money was paid contrary to federal law or FEMA
regulations, the agency demands refunds from the state emergency
agencies that distributed the aid. Sometimes, repayment amounts can
be drastically reduced during negotiations and states can cover
debts owed by local communities.
</P>
<P>
   After taking years to recover from 1989's Hurricane Hugo,
Sullivans Island, S.C., Town Administrator Linda Tucker called the
FEMA audit nearly a decade later ''the disaster after the disaster
after the disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The records had all been put away in the attic,'' she
recalled. The town eventually returned about $7,000 of $103,000
that auditors had challenged.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, the state repaid $3.9 million due to ineligible
claims by the state Transportation Department following blizzards
in 1994. One invoice totaling more than $234,000 covered just one
24-hour day but charged 39 hours of labor for one supervisor and
201 hours of equipment usage for a single truck, records showed.
</P>
<P>
   The Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority was cited for $8.9
million in improper expenditures after Hurricane Marilyn in 1995.
Auditors found the utility paid workers double time for all hours
after the first day, and in some instances billed two and three
times for the same work.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors challenged $15 million in claims submitted by Albany
State University in Georgia, primarily because the college used aid
after a 1994 flood to upgrade its facilities. FEMA rules limit
funding to the cost of repairing or replacing facilities to
pre-disaster conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In all, FEMA has been able to return to the U.S. treasury some
$1.3 billion in federal disaster aid since April 1996. That
includes some of the $442 million reimbursements recovered by
auditors, as well as funds set aside for particular disasters but
never spent.
</P>
<P>
   While cleaning up the books from the prior decade, Witt is
taking steps to avoid future problems. FEMA now sends insurance
experts and auditors with initial disaster teams to screen for
ineligible claims.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, it was the news media, not FEMA auditors, that
uncovered an apparent misuse of funds: In Dade County, Fla., FEMA
was unable to account for 4,200 coconut palm trees it had paid for
after Hurricane Andrew eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal investigation ensued, and former Miami-Dade County
parks director Guillermo ''Bill'' Cutie was indicted for signing
invoices that ''falsely attested'' to receipt of the trees. Cutie
has denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA no longer pays for communities to replant trees and
shrubbery destroyed by disasters. ''We're not a resource to replace
everything everyone's lost,'' Witt said.
</P>
<P>
   After the North Carolina National Guard claimed $216,471 for use
of aircraft after Hurricane Fran in 1996, FEMA auditors found only
21 percent of the missions claimed for reimbursement were related
to disaster projects.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA also secured nearly $19,500 in reimbursement after the City
of Grafton, Ill., took flood aid for work that also was covered by
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials blame most of the problems on poor oversight,
not corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do believe some of these communities do not have a
sophisticated accounting system,'' said Nancy Hendricks, FEMA's
assistant inspector general for audit. She added many small
communities receiving FEMA grants ''never had that much money in
the coffer before.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the audits, money likely is being lost, according to
Leonard E. Wheeler Jr., a former Florida disaster inspector. That's
because FEMA only checks a small sampling of projects before
closing out a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ''For those who dragged their feet and didn't keep good records,
FEMA waved a magic wand and said, 'Keep it,''' Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
   In Oakland, Calif., where auditors questioned $1.3 million after
a massive 1991 fire, city emergency services director Henry
Renteria said officials often don't have time in the midst of
catastrophe to document every expenditure.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're responding to a disaster, we don't have time to
dot all our I's and cross all our T's,'' he said. ''It's not
necessarily a screw-up. Sometimes you're responding to a
life-and-death situation and you don't have time to do all the
paperwork.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Have Part in FEMA Fights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The El Dorado Irrigation District in
Placerville, Calif., had already lost two appeals in its quest for
more federal disaster aid, so for its third attempt, the agency
enlisted the help of two members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The irrigation district still didn't get the assistance, but the
case shows the willingness of lawmakers to intervene with the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of lawmakers' letters, provided by FEMA, shows
different approaches -- ranging from passing on a constituent's
letter to urging the federal officials to reverse an earlier
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We understand that because FEMA has denied (the irrigation
district's) second appeal, FEMA considers this matter closed,''
said a Nov. 17, 1999 letter from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif and
Rep. John Doolittle, R-Calif. to FEMA Director James Lee Witt.
</P>
<P>
   The letter nonetheless argued that agency ''inaccuracies'' in
the appeal ''should serve as a basis for FEMA to reconsider.'' The
agency refused.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples of congressional intervention:
</P>
<P>
   --Sen. John Breaux, D-La., on behalf of the Beau Chene Homeowners
Association in Mandeville, La., sought funds for debris removal
from privately owned roads after Hurricane Georges in 1998. FEMA
rejected the request.
</P>
<P>
   --Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., wrote to President Clinton last
September, asking ''that you direct federal agencies to do all
within their power to expedite the rebuilding of N.C. Highway 12''
after Hurricane Dennis in August-September, 1999. FEMA responded
that it was a matter for the U.S. Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   --Rep. Steven R. Rothman, D-N.J., wrote Witt last March in a
successful request to accelerate assistance grants to northern New
Jersey municipalities ravaged by Hurricane Floyd last September.
</P>
<P>
   --Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, passed on a request last year from
Galveston County Judge James D. Yarborough to divert funds from
Hurricane Floyd to repair beach erosion caused by Tropical Storm
Frances in 1998. FEMA funds cannot be diverted from one disaster to
another.

<HEADLINE> Examples of FEMA Audit Results  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   Examples of disaster relief payments questioned by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency over the last decade during inspector
general's audits:
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Auditors questioned nearly $900,000 claimed by the California
Highway Patrol during the Los Angeles riots in April 1992 sparked
by the acquittal of four white officers in the beating of black
motorist Rodney King.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors said personnel and vehicle mileage costs were
claimed for work outside the riot area.
</P>
<P>
   The issue remains unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they want to pursue the matter, we want to appeal it,''
said CHP Commissioner Dwight Helmick. ''At that point, it was
completely legitimate; we still think it is.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, after snow
removal from a January 1996 blizzard, claimed $34,757 for ''standby
equipment and labor,'' an audit showed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We question these charges because they did not contribute to
the removal of snow and represent idle time that is unallowable,''
the audit said.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania officials argued FEMA seemed to change rules in
midstream.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like shooting at a moving target,'' said Gary L. Hoffman,
chief engineer for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
''You have your field people and it gets up to division and
division will change, and it gets up to headquarters and they'll
change opinions that were handed down at the division office.''
</P>
<P>
   The case remains open.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The Municipality of San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico, was cited for two
instances of receiving double payment in disaster aid.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the city got more than $75,000 in insurance
proceeds for damages to the Municipal Cemetery and sports
recreational facilities after Hurricane Hortense in 1996. FEMA
funded the same projects.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors also found federal and state agencies covered more than
$42,000 of the cost to repair sidewalks, curbs, gutters and asphalt
while FEMA paid nearly $59,000 for the same work
</P>
<P>
   While no money has been recovered, auditors said municipal
officials concurred with the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb County, Ga. claimed $51,000 in FEMA aid for use of its
landfill to dispose of debris from Hurricane Opal in 1995. The
county did not have records to support the claim, and a county
official acknowledged the hurricane debris ''may have been mulched
rather than disposed of at the landfill.'' FEMA reclaimed more than
$40,000.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The City of Monroe, Ga. claimed more than $6,500 in federal aid
for replacing the contents of its fire station after a February
1993 tornado but actually incurred costs of only $425, auditors
said. For this and other ineligible claims, FEMA recovered more
than $32,000.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   After Hurricane Fran in 1996, the North Carolina Department of
Transportation claimed more than $770,000 in payments for debris
removal work by employees termed temporary. Auditors found
employees hired under temporary appointments often were
continuously employed for 11 months, released for a short period
and then rehired.
</P>
<P>
   Regular pay for permanent workers is not eligible for FEMA
funding.
</P>
<P>
   No funds have been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA is still negotiating a settlement with the state. North
Carolina officials admitted the temporary workers were hired before
the storm, but said releasing and rehiring them would have resulted
in unnecessary costs and work delays.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The South Dakota Department of Transportation, in a similar
case, claimed $304,228 in salaries and fringe benefits for workers
who removed snow after blizzards in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While state officials said these were not permanent employees,
FEMA concluded they worked for the department every year during the
winter months and already were on the payroll when the initial
disaster was declared.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no recovery yet from the audit, just completed
April 25.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mercer, press secretary for Gov. Bill Janklow, said the
state is providing additional information to FEMA and believes
''the costs will be allowed.''

<HEADLINE> Treasury Records Deficit in May  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury recorded a deficit of $3.6
billion in May but is still on track to produce a record surplus
for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
   The government's deficit last month, announced by the Treasury
Department on Tuesday, was dramatically smaller than the nearly $24
billion shortfall recorded in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   May's deficit was smaller this year because, among other things,
two extra business days and an earlier Memorial Day holiday this
year boosted revenues considerably higher.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's deficit was bigger than the $2 billion shortfall
many analysts were expecting, but was in line with the $4 billion
deficit projected by the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for May totaled $146 billion, while expenditures came to
$149.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the first eight months of fiscal 2000, which began Oct. 1,
the government is running a surplus of $120.3 billion -- close to
the record $124.4 billion bounty for all of fiscal year 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the first eight months came to $1.3 trillion, while
spending totaled $1.2 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   With the expected surplus for fiscal year 2000, which ends Sept.
30, it would be the first time the government has reported three
consecutive years of surplus since 1947, 1948 and 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is predicting a $166.7 billion
surplus for fiscal 2000, while the CBO believes the surplus will
exceed $200 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the biggest spending categories were Social Security,
$38.1 billion; programs of the Health and Human Services
Department, $32.3 billion; interest on the public debt, $26.8
billion; and military spending, $22.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from individual income tax payments totaled $63.7
billion in May, compared with $30.6 billion for the same month last
year. Payments from corporate taxes came to $5.8 billion, up from
$3.9 billion in May 1999.

<HEADLINE> Jane Fonda Regrets N. Vietnam Photo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jane Fonda says she feels awful about posing for
the famous photo with North Vietnamese soldiers in 1972 that sealed
her reputation as ''Hanoi Jane.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an
anti-aircraft carrier, which looks like I was trying to shoot at
American planes,'' Fonda told O, The Oprah Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was
the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just
thoughtless.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonda, 62, in an interview with Oprah Winfrey in the magazine's
July-August issue, also reflects on her separation from media mogul
Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ted is a soul mate,'' she said. ''I care about him. ... He
means the world to me. He taught me to be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   They separated, she said, ''because we changed. I changed. ...
Are we happier by ourselves than we were together? It's not
clear.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Al Pacino, Ellen Burstyn and Harvey Keitel have
been chosen to lead the legendary Actors Studio.
</P>
<P>
   The three, all members of the theater's board, will replace
Arthur Penn, who is leaving to become executive producer of the
television series ''Law and Order.'' Penn will continue as
president emeritus of the workshop.
</P>
<P>
   The workshop was founded in 1947 by actors Robert Lewis and
Cheryl Crawford and by director Elia Kazan, whose lifetime
achievement Oscar last year polarized public opinion over his role
as an alleged finger-pointer during the McCarthy era.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan was a proponent of the Stanislavski ''system'' of acting,
later refined into the ''Method'' by Lee Strasberg, artistic
director of the studio from 1948 until his death in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni include Marlon Brando, Paul Newman, Marilyn Monroe, Alec
Baldwin and Jack Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   The studio has about 900 members in New York and Los Angeles,

<HEADLINE> Danza To Join Cast of 'Family Law'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A year after earning an Emmy nomination for a
guest stint on ABC's courtroom drama ''The Practice,'' sitcom
stalwart Tony Danza is joining the regular cast of the hourlong CBS
series ''Family Law.''
</P>
<P>
   Danza, 49, spent five years in the ensemble cast of ''Taxi''
before fronting his own successful eight-year sitcom, ABC's ''Who's
the Boss?''
</P>
<P>
   Danza called the ''Family Law'' role ''a tremendous
opportunity'' and added, ''I am looking forward to getting to do
things I have never done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the part marks Danza's first foray as a regular in a
drama series, he has branched out of sitcoms before, starring in a
Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's ''A View from the Bridge'' in
1998 and with Kevin Spacey in Eugene O'Neill's ''The Iceman
Cometh'' in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Family Law'' stars Kathleen Quinlan, Dixie Carter and Julie
Warner and airs Mondays at 10 p.m on CBS.

mind.
</P>
<P>
   In the upcoming issue of George magazine, the British actor best
known as Capt. Jean-Luc Picard on ''Star Trek: The Next

   Last month, Stewart was forced by Actor's Equity to apologize to

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Protect Religious TV  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Tuesday to protect religious
broadcasters by prohibiting the Federal Communications Commission
from regulating the content of speech aired by noncommercial
educational radio and television stations.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, passed 264-159, was in reaction to an FCC statement,
made last December and rescinded in January, that broadcasters
seeking licenses for free, specially reserved educational TV
channels should devote half their air time to educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC statement, which drew the ire of some religious groups
and members of Congress, also disqualified religious proselytizing
and church services as general educational programming.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are simply trying to prevent and prohibit the FCC from
going down a dangerous path of regulating religious speech,'' said
Rep. Charles ''Chip'' Pickering, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., said the bill confirmed the House's
commitment to religious rights a day after the Supreme Court's
decision limiting school prayer. ''The court may have banned prayer
yet again, but the House has defended religion on the airwaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argued that the bill undermined the purpose of
educational broadcasting by opening the way for religious groups to
use the public airwaves for the sole purpose of promoting their
beliefs. ''There will no longer ever again be a requirement that a
public TV station must serve the educational needs of a
community,'' said Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation states a nonprofit organization is eligible for
a noncommercial educational license if it broadcasts material that
the organization determines serves an educational, instructional,
cultural or religious purpose. The FCC is barred from imposing any
requirement linking licenses to, for example, the number of hours
of educational programming.
</P>
<P>
   Markey offered an amendment to clarify that a holder of a
noncommercial educational license must provide educational
programming. It was defeated, 250-174.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC since 1952 has reserved television channels and radio
bands for noncommercial educational programming. While most
religious broadcasters operate with commercial licenses, some have
obtained noncommercial permits.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., head of the House Commerce
telecommunications panel, said religious broadcasters now have
800-1,000 noncommercial radio licenses and will soon have 23
television licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which requires Senate action, is backed by the
National Religious Broadcasters and the Christian Coalition. Markey
said it was opposed by several major church groups and the national
PTA.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 4201.

<HEADLINE> Canada Conservatives To Pick Leader  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- An attempt to unify Canadian conservatives into a
movement capable of winning the next federal election faces a
crucial decision Saturday -- the election of its leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Alliance, which seeks to combine the former Reform
Party based in western Canada with disgruntled Conservative Party
supporters elsewhere, will hold a nationwide vote of its members to
choose among four major contenders. If no candidate wins more than
50 percent, a runoff would take place July 8.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins will become the opposition leader in Canada's
parliament, and in all likelihood the main challenger for Prime
Minister Jean Chretien's job in national elections expected next
year.
</P>
<P>
   After starting three months ago with a core support of just over
70,000 members when the Reform Party joined, the Alliance now says
200,000 people have paid the $6.50 fee to be eligible to vote
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If accurate, that would make the Alliance the largest party in
Canada. But questions persist about the potential cohesiveness of
Canada's political right, which appears split on abortion, gay
rights and capital punishment -- divisions that reflect the
diversity of Canada, with a population of 30 million spread across
the world's second-largest country.
</P>
<P>
   Little common ideological ground exists among farmers in the
plains, urban dwellers who are part of the high-tech economy and
large immigrant communities that benefit from liberal social
policies.
</P>
<P>
   The backbone of the Canadian Alliance is the old Reform Party,
which began in the 1980s to challenge the domination and perceived
ideological betrayal by the Conservative Party government under
Brian Mulroney.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party growth cost the Conservative Party the 1993
election, with Chretien's Liberal Party taking over. Reform
continued to grow, becoming the official opposition party in
parliament four years later despite failing to win a seat east of
Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing he needed support in Ontario and points east to win a
national election, Reform leader Preston Manning then fostered the
creation of the Canadian Alliance as a way to embrace the
Conservative Party he had battled and undermined.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance was formally created in March, setting off a
leadership campaign by Manning, former Alberta Treasurer Stockwell
Day, Ontario political strategist Tom Long and British Columbia
politician Keith Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Manning, 57, is the son of longtime Alberta Premier Ernest
Manning, and doubled as a politician and preacher like his father.
He has worked in recent years to soften his nasal twang and dress
more stylishly. But opponents and even some supporters fear Manning
can never break away from the Reform reputation as a Western party
with anti-gay, anti-immigrant tendencies, and a Manning victory
would bolster a perception that the Alliance is just the Reform
Party under a different name.
</P>
<P>
   Day, a 49-year-old former preacher known for blunt
pronouncements of conservative views, is a charismatic speaker who
did the best job of distinguishing himself from the other
candidates. He declared himself strongly anti-abortion and
campaigned hard to emphasize his ties to different regions,
especially his ability to speak French in Francophone Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Day is considered Manning's closest challenger, with a runoff
between the two likely.
</P>
<P>
   Long, 42, was a back-room strategist in Ontario's Conservative
Party. An architect of the 1995 Conservative victory in Ontario's
provincial election, he has employed U.S.-style campaign tactics
such as phone banks to seek new Alliance members.
</P>
<P>
   His speeches hammered home the theme that he is the only
candidate who can draw support in Ontario that the Alliance needs
to defeat the Liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a 39-year-old physician, made health care reform his
main message. But he lacks the name recognition of Manning and the
financial backing of Day or Long.

<HEADLINE> French Halt Auschwitz Doctor Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A French court Tuesday dismissed criminal charges
against a former German doctor at the Auschwitz death camp, ruling
that at age 89, he was too old for a trial on inciting racial
hatred.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor had asked for a conviction on principle against
Hans Muench.
</P>
<P>
   Several organizations representing French Resistance members and
Holocaust survivors filed suit against Muench for an interview he
gave to France-Inter Radio on Oct. 26 and Nov. 3, 1998, in which he
spoke ill of Gypsies. He also praised the work conditions at the
camp as well as his boss, Josef Mengele, the so-called ''Angel of
Death.''
</P>
<P>
   Three German doctors said that Muench was demented and unable to
stand trial. Although the French court found the German report
incoherent, it accepted its judgment that Muench was not fit to
appear in court. Muench suffers from Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Muench served as a doctor in Auschwitz from 1943 to 1945. He was
acquitted of war crimes in 1947 after former inmates he had worked
with in the Auschwitz lab testified he had helped save their lives.
He lives in Bavaria where he practiced medicine after the war.
</P>
<P>
   From 1940 to 1945, about 1.5 million people, mostly Jews, died
at Auschwitz in German-occupied Poland from starvation, disease and
forced labor.

<HEADLINE> Pro-UK Group: We'll End Cease-Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- In a new threat to Northern
Ireland's tenuous peace, the province's largest pro-British
paramilitary group threatened Tuesday to break its cease-fire,
accusing Catholic groups of attacking Protestant homes.
</P>
<P>
   The outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters, whose October 1994
cease-fire was vital to the negotiation of the province's peace
accord two years ago, said Roman Catholic nationalist groups are
conducting a campaign of intimidation against Protestants in two
areas of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   ''This ethnic cleansing of north and west Belfast cannot and
will not be allowed to happen,'' the Ulster Freedom Fighters
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   It threatened to break the cease-fire as of midnight (7 p.m.
EDT). From that time, it said, the Ulster Freedom Fighters
''reserves the right to shoot any person seen to be attacking
Protestant homes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This will be in direct contradiction to our cease-fire, which
we have steadfastly adhered to despite intense provocation, but
enough is enough,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Freedom Fighters has more than 2,000 members in
working-class Protestant neighborhoods. Its threat comes more than
six weeks after the Irish Republican Army -- the largest
pro-Catholic outlawed paramilitary group -- made a historic
commitment to begin disarming.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's move allowed the British government to return some
self-governing powers to Northern Ireland's Protestant-Catholic
administration, which is trying to establish itself as a viable
local government after 28 years of direct rule from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The British government, the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party and the
Ulster Freedom Fighters' own political ally, the Ulster Democratic
Party, quickly criticized the group for its threat.
</P>
<P>
   Ulster Democrat leader Gary McMichael said he understands ''the
concerns and frustration that have been building because of
anti-Protestant intimidation'' in some areas. But, he said, ''I
feel that this course of action would be a major mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   McMichael also called on police to control the alleged attacks
on Protestant homes.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein said the threat was a matter of ''grave concern.''
Party chairman Mitchel McLaughlin said the threat was part of an
internal, territorial struggle among the pro-British groups.
</P>
<P>
   But he also claimed it was an attempt to heighten tensions
during the summer season of marches by the Orange Order, the
province's largest Protestant fraternal group. The march routes
often go through Catholic nationalist neighborhoods, where they are
seen as inflammatory and offensive. Over the weekend, dozens of
protesters trying to stop an Orange Order parade in the town of
Lurgan attacked security officers with firebombs.
</P>
<P>
   In London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said the
people of Northern Ireland do not want a return to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one is pretending every problem has been solved, but the
place for these to be sorted out is through the political
process,'' an official in the president's office said.
</P>
<P>
   A Downing Street spokesman also played down the discovery Monday
night of a small explosive device in the grounds of Hillsborough
Castle, the residence of the British government's top official in
the province.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson, was in
London when the device was found. He was due back at the castle, 12
miles outside Belfast, later this week.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but suspicion
fell on IRA dissidents opposed to the new Protestant-Catholic
administration in Belfast.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks More Medicare Spending  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed a $21 billion boost
in Medicare payments over five years for hospitals and other health
care providers Tuesday, saying, ''Medicare patients are at risk''
because of insufficient spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to face the challenge of making sure we pay the
Medicare providers enough so they can give our seniors the
high-quality care they deserve,'' the president said. ''Payments
are too low in important areas.''
</P>
<P>
   He also embraced Vice President Al Gore's proposal to put aside
the money in the Medicare trust fund so that it could not be used
for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Over 10 years, the president's plan for higher Medicare spending
would cost $40 billion. He said the nation could afford to increase
Medicare payments and, at the same time, add a prescription drug
benefit. ''Because of our prosperity I believe we can do both.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton's proposal failed to satisfy some groups. ''I
think that the proposal that's being announced today falls far
short of what's needed,'' said Karen Ignagni, president of the
American Association of Health Plans, an HMO industry group.
</P>
<P>
   But Joel Johnson, a senior adviser to the president, said,
''This has a tremendous level of support on a bipartisan basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The request is expected to be among several items on a wish-list
the Clinton administration is expected to send Capitol Hill later
this month, along with new estimates that government surpluses
accumulating during the next decade will be more than twice as
large as previously predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been analyzing the effects of the balanced budget act
and a lot of other things that are happening, and our priority is
to ensure that there is high-quality access to care for Medicare
beneficiaries,'' said Medicare Administrator Nancy-Ann DeParle.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals, home health care agencies and nursing homes would
likely get much of the money under the administration proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Medicare legislation being developed by House
Republicans would give around $2 billion to HMOs, many of which
have pulled out of Medicare in recent years complaining payments
don't keep up with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Curbs on fees from Medicare, the nation's health insurance
program for the elderly and disabled, were part of 1997 legislation
to balance the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when private health plans have been imposing lower
prices as well, health care providers say Medicare is squeezing
them too tight. Many hospitals say they have cut back community
service work, for example, such as transportation programs or
satellite clinics.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Flirts With 4,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index was flirting with the
4,000 mark Tuesday, a level it has not breached in more than two
months, as investors balanced hopes for strong profit growth with
some scattered warnings about technology companies' earnings.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
technology-focused Nasdaq composite was up 16.74 at 4,006.57. The
index was trading above 4,000 for the first time since April,
continuing its gradual recovery from the steep selloff that knocked
it as much as 37 percent below its record high.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the session, the index had risen as much as 60
points. The Nasdaq remains 21 percent below the all-time high of
5,048.62 set March 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 124.80 at 10,433.04
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 13.58 at 1,472.42.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who had grown leery of technology stocks are now
seeking out some of the biggest names in the sector on the
expectation that those companies will show the strongest profit
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Many technology stocks remain very highly priced relative to
their earnings. But now that rising interest rates have begun
forcing a modest economic slowdown, threatening corporate profits,
investors are focusing on companies whose earnings are growing
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Intel rose $2.313 to $138.813 and PMC-Sierra, a
semiconductor component maker, rose $8.125 to $201.125. Yahoo! rose
$9.813 to $148.875.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a handful of Nasdaq components sustained sharp losses after
warning that their earnings in the current quarter will miss
analysts' expectations. Gadzoox Networks Inc., a maker of hardware
and software for storage area networks, fell $7.063 to $13.25, a 35
percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're settling into a two-tiered market,'' said William
Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. ''Technology
will do very well, but look out for any disappointments.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan added that many of the younger, less-proven companies on
the Nasdaq have not recovered from the springtime selloff, and
aren't likely to do so as investors apply tougher standards to the
technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   ''The selloff showed us that there are some junk companies, and
they are pretty much remaining junk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dow component Honeywell International continued paying a price
for its announcement Monday that second-quarter earnings will miss
analysts' expectations. Honeywell said it is struggling with high
interest rates and higher-than-expected raw material prices in its
performance materials unit.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, its shares fell $4.375 to $35.875.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors fell $2.25 to $62.625, adding to the Dow's
declines. North American chief Ronald Zarrella told journalists and
financial analysts Tuesday that profit margins this year will not
reach GM's goal of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram fell $6.375 to $57.375 after French utilities and media
conglomerate Vivendi said it will buy the company in an all-stock
transaction that initially valued Seagram at $77.35 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Shoe company Steve Madden Ltd. fell $1.938 to $11.188 on the
Nasdaq. Owner Steven Madden was arrested Tuesday on charges that he
conspired to manipulate the value of his company during its initial
public offering in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 783.01 million shares
in late afternoon, ahead of Monday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.24 from
Monday's revised close to 524.03.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unsure of Mideast Summit Date  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States said Tuesday it will not
decide the timing of an Israeli-Palestinian summit until after
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visits the Middle East next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Yatom, chief policy adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, said Monday ''the situation is ripe for a summit,'' and one
should be held in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years of talks, Yatom said, each side knows the
other's positions, and now decisions must be made by the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Albright will
try to figure out next week whether more work needs to be done
first.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president, two or three days ago, said that at this
juncture we would say that a basis does not exist'' for a summit,
Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the point is to see next week, when the secretary goes
out, if there is such a basis, or if we need to continue,'' he
said. ''The president's made quite clear that we're prepared to go
forward with a summit at the appropriate time, and (when) we think
the necessary basis exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Yatom said the summit must take place in the next few weeks to
avoid conflicting with the political calendar in the United States,
where party conventions are set for the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians assumed the summit would be the last stage of
negotiating an accord. The Israelis have said the results could be
more modest.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Economics and Planning Minister Nabil Shaath says
the Palestinians do not want a summit unless it is properly
prepared, meaning that an accord is all but ready for signature.
There are few signs that the two sides were close to agreement on
any of the main issues.

<HEADLINE> 6 Charged in Serb Opposition Attack  </HEADLINE>
By ALEN MLATISUMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Four Serbs and two other people
were charged Tuesday with terrorism and attempted murder in an
attack on Vuk Draskovic, Serbia's top opposition leader,
Montenegrin police said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Serb men were in custody in Montenegro, Serbia's
junior partner in the Yugoslav federation. Montenegrin authorities
were demanding that their counterparts in Serbia arrest the two
other Serbs and search for the remaining pair of unidentified
suspects, police said in a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, the head of the Serbian Renewal Movement, was shot
Thursday at his summer home in the Montenegrin coastal town of
Budva.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the suspects were identified as cousins Milan and Ivan
Lovric, 26 and 19; Vladimir Jovanovic, 32; and Dusan Spasojevic,
32, all from Belgrade. They and the two unidentified accomplices
are accused of sneaking up to the verandah of Draskovic's summer
home and firing eight .32 caliber bullets as he sat on a sofa
watching television, the report said. Draskovic was grazed by two
shots.
</P>
<P>
   After opening fire, the six allegedly escaped to an apartment
about 100 yards from Draskovic's home, the report said. Police
discovered an unlicensed gun during a search of the apartment and
immediate vicinity, which ballistics later proved was used in the
shooting, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, police accuse the suspects of carrying out a
carefully premeditated attack. It was not immediately clear whether
they allegedly devised the plan on their own or were working for
someone else. Draskovic has accused Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's regime of being behind the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, suspects Milan and Ivan Lovric were brought to a
courthouse in the Montenegrin capital, Podgorica, for a 45-minute
appearance amid heavy security. Reporters were not allowed in and
no information about the hearing was released. Lawyers said the two
were due back in court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's police have been tightlipped about the case,
claiming its political sensitivity requires secrecy. They announced
Friday they had arrested some of the alleged attackers but failed
to say more until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since the incident, Draskovic has remained in Budva under heavy
police protection.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Brit Group May End Cease-Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- In a new threat to Northern
Ireland's tenuous peace, the province's largest pro-British
paramilitary group threatened Tuesday to break its cease-fire,
accusing Catholic groups of attacking Protestant homes.
</P>
<P>
   The outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters, whose October 1994
cease-fire was vital to the negotiation of the province's peace
accord two years ago, said Roman Catholic nationalist groups are
conducting a campaign of intimidation against Protestants in two
areas of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   ''This ethnic cleansing of north and west Belfast cannot and
will not be allowed to happen,'' the Ulster Freedom Fighters
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   It threatened to break the cease-fire as of midnight (7 p.m.
EDT). From that time, it said, the Ulster Freedom Fighters
''reserves the right to shoot any person seen to be attacking
Protestant homes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This will be in direct contradiction to our cease-fire, which
we have steadfastly adhered to despite intense provocation, but
enough is enough,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Freedom Fighters has more than 2,000 members in
working-class Protestant neighborhoods. Its threat comes more than
six weeks after the Irish Republican Army -- the largest
pro-Catholic outlawed paramilitary group -- made a historic
commitment to begin disarming.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's move allowed the British government to return some
self-governing powers to Northern Ireland's Protestant-Catholic
administration, which is trying to establish itself as a viable
local government after 28 years of direct rule from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The British government, the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party and the
Ulster Freedom Fighters' own political ally, the Ulster Democratic
Party, quickly criticized the group for its threat.
</P>
<P>
   Ulster Democrat leader Gary McMichael said he understands ''the
concerns and frustration that have been building because of
anti-Protestant intimidation'' in some areas. But, he said, ''I
feel that this course of action would be a major mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   McMichael also called on police to control the alleged attacks
on Protestant homes.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein said the threat was a matter of ''grave concern.''
Party chairman Mitchel McLaughlin said the threat was part of an
internal, territorial struggle among the pro-British groups.
</P>
<P>
   But he also claimed it was an attempt to heighten tensions
during the summer season of marches by the Orange Order, the
province's largest Protestant fraternal group. The march routes
often go through Catholic nationalist neighborhoods, where they are
seen as inflammatory and offensive. Over the weekend, dozens of
protesters trying to stop an Orange Order parade in the town of
Lurgan attacked security officers with firebombs.
</P>
<P>
   In London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said the
people of Northern Ireland do not want a return to violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one is pretending every problem has been solved, but the
place for these to be sorted out is through the political
process,'' an official in the prime minister's office said.
</P>
<P>
   A Downing Street spokesman also played down the discovery Monday
night of a small explosive device in the grounds of Hillsborough
Castle, the residence of the British government's top official in
the province.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson, was in
London when the device was found. He was due back at the castle, 12
miles outside Belfast, later this week.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but suspicion
fell on IRA dissidents opposed to the new Protestant-Catholic
administration in Belfast.

<HEADLINE> Israel Aide Criticizes Helms' Tone  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- In a rare shouting match between the closest of
allies, a top deputy to Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Tuesday
accused Jesse Helms of taking a ''patronizing tone'' with Israel
when the powerful U.S. senator suggested Barak fire the deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh was reacting to the latest
congressional broadside against his suggestion last week that any
cut in U.S. military aid to Israel should be matched by a
comparable reduction in Israeli defense procurements from U.S.
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is worrisome is the harsh, patronizing tone of an
important senator like Jesse Helms,'' Sneh told Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative lawmakers in both U.S. houses are considering a
$250 million cut to Israel to match the sale price of an
Israeli-made advanced airborne early warning system to China. The
concern is that the PHALCON system would increase the Chinese
threat to U.S.-backed Taiwan, and could one day be used to track
U.S. planes.
</P>
<P>
   Sneh suggested to parliament last week that if the cut goes
through, the Israeli army would do well to spend an equivalent
amount on ''low tech'' army supplies -- boots, automatic rifles, and
other items -- in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that Israel had only purchased the items as a favor
to the United States, and had deprived some of the poorest sectors
of Israeli society employment in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Israel plows most of the $1.9 billion a year it receives in U.S.
military aid back into the U.S. economy in defense purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Sneh's comments angered Helms, the chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sneh would ''do well to bear in mind that the American
businesses he intends to punish pay the taxes that make possible
the foreign aid that his country receives from the U.S.
taxpayers,'' Helms said in a statement published Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sneh's threat is an insult to all Americans, including this
senator who has been a longtime friend of Israel,'' said the North
Carolina Republican. ''Frankly, I feel that Prime Minister Barak
may want to dismiss Mr. Sneh.''
</P>
<P>
   Sneh told The Associated Press that the outrage voiced by Helms
and by Rep. Sonny Callahan, an Alabama Republican who heads the
House Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee, were based on
a distorted understanding of his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I said was that if military aid to Israel is cut by $250
million, we would have no choice but to give up the procurement of
low-tech items in order to keep the procurement of (U.S.-made)
high-tech systems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sneh said he believed that his remarks were distorted by people
with ''evil intentions.'' He would not specify whom, but Israel
radio and the daily Yediot Ahronot both quoted unidentified Israeli
defense officials as saying that leading U.S. defense manufacturers
were seeking ways of limiting Israel's expanding defense sales --
reportedly now reaching $2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Israeli defense products that contain U.S. components
are subject to U.S. review. In the wake of the PHALCON controversy,
the Pentagon recently pressed Israel to extend U.S. review to all
Israeli military sales. Israel has resisted the request, and
Israeli defense industry officials are reportedly concerned that
such reviews would facilitate industrial espionage by their U.S.
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Sneh said a threat to Israel's defense exports was a threat to
Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thanks to the defense exports, we can also conduct research
and development for Israel security, and this is the secret of our
qualitative superiority,'' he told Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is negotiating quietly with Israel to
limit its exports to China, and administration officials have asked
Congress to back off the threats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Helms' letter significantly contradicts the friendly,
constructive spirit in which Israel and the United States are
trying to resolve the issue of the sale of the PHALCON to China,''
Sneh said.

<HEADLINE> Vote Intimidation Cited in Zimbabwe  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) -- With ruling party militants
threatening to firebomb his house, opposition candidate David
Coltart has been traveling with bodyguards these days.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Mugabe's party faces its first real electoral
threat this weekend since it led Zimbabwe to independence in 1980,
and ruling party militants have been rampaging through the
countryside. Other candidates of the opposition Movement for
Democratic Change have been threatened, had their houses attacked,
and in at least one case, been forced to flee the very districts in
which they are supposed to be campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists say the climate of intimidation will make
it impossible for the parliamentary vote Saturday and Sunday to be
fair.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a very sad reflection of where our country is at,
that people like myself and Gibson Sibanda, for simply promoting
democracy, are threatened,'' Coltart said of the Movement's vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several months, more than 30 people have been killed
in political violence, most of them opposition supporters, and more
than 2,000 injured, according to the Amani Trust, an independent
group that monitors political violence.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front party
and the police are responsible for more than 90 percent of the
violence, according to Amani figures.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling party adviser Jonathan Moyo dismissed the claims of
violence and intimidation as the opposition's ''sickening excuse''
for the ruling party's strength.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no violence here. There's no intimidation here,'' Moyo
said. ''The time has come to say enough is enough. People have been
visiting this country, and they have not found the violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The human rights group Amnesty International issued a report
June 8 accusing the government of planning a deliberate campaign of
violence as part of its election strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, ruling party militants have begun seizing
identity cards and voting papers from suspected opposition
supporters, making it impossible for them to vote, human rights
groups said.
</P>
<P>
   Violence has forced many other voters to flee their districts,
where they would have to cast their ballots, according to human
rights workers.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers and human rights workers say the constant
violence and threats have made a fair election nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not going to be free and fair. The atmosphere, with
people dying and the intimidation that's going on, no way,'' said
Jim Mackinnon, Oxfam Canada's representative in Zimbabwe, who is
helping coordinate some foreign election observers.
</P>
<P>
   Some candidates themselves have been threatened or attacked.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 minutes Sunday, Margaret Dongo, leader of the small
Zimbabwe Union of Democrats party, was forced to hide under a table
as about 70 people wearing ruling party T-shirts pelted her house
with stones and bricks, she said. Five of her supporters were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Blesse Chapundo, an opposition candidate in the central town of
Kwekwe, has not visited his district in over a month for fear of
attacks by militants.
</P>
<P>
   ''The opposition cannot go on to campaign in the area,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The violence began in February after the ruling party was
stunned when a new constitution that would have further
strengthened Mugabe's power was soundly defeated in a referendum,
signaling Zimbabweans' disaffection with his party.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, mobs of Mugabe supporters began occupying
white-owned farms, whose owners and laborers alike were seen as key
supporters of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The invaders said they were protesting inequality in land
distribution in a country where 4,000 whites own one-third of the
productive farmland.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,600 occupied farms quickly became ruling party power bases
from which bands of armed men would roam the area attacking people
suspected of supporting the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Though the intimidation will affect the election, it is unclear
whether it will drive many voters away from the opposition,
Mackinnon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are mad right now. They are afraid, and they are mad,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Neb. To Get Visit From Clinton  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Keep holding your breath, Nebraskans!
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will visit you before the end of his term --
really, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska is the only state Clinton has not visited during his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said he wasn't sure if the president would accept an
invitation from retired Sen. James Exon, R-Neb., to a July 15
dedication ceremony of a museum to celebrate Nebraska's pioneer
history that just opened in Kearney, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that we'll be able to make that particular event,
but as the president has long indicated to most of us, he wants to
go to Nebraska,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, apparently to further soothe sensibilities in the heavily
Republican Midwestern state, Lockhart kept pouring it on: ''In the
greatest American spirit of saving the best for last, he intends to
go to Nebraska before his term ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart dodged the next two questions -- Why has it taken him so
long? Does Clinton have something against Nebraska?
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sticking with 'saving the best for last,''' Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Meets Hezbollah Leader  </HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan shook
hands Tuesday with the leader of Hezbollah, treating the group
Washington views as a sponsor of international terrorism as a
partner for peace on the Israeli-Lebanese border.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first meeting between Sheik Hassan Nasrallah and a
senior international official, and highlighted the fast-changing
politics of the Middle East. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah spent
nearly two decades locked in battle to drive Israeli troops from
southern Lebanon, and now controls the territory Israel abandoned
last month.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Nasrallah issued a warning that Hezbollah
will renew attacks against Israel if it continues to occupy
Lebanese soil.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations said Saturday that Israel had completely
withdrawn from southern Lebanon under U.N. resolutions, which also
call for the deployment of peacekeepers along the border. But
Lebanon has accused Israel of continuing to occupy its territory.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas ''will not wait for long for political efforts to
resolve the violations and, as they have done in the past, will
definitely work toward liberating every inch of occupied land,''
Nasrallah said in a statement after meeting Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Annan promised to take up the issue when he meets with officials
in Israel on Wednesday, and said he had instructed his peacekeepers
to investigate alleged Israeli violations of the U.N.-drawn border.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take any violation very seriously and we will be vigilant
in investigating each and every violation and ensure that they are
corrected,'' Annan told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, Foreign Ministry spokesman Aviv Shiron declined to
comment on the allegations of border violations, but said Israel
hopes the U.N. chief ''will treat with the same seriousness'' the
requirement that Lebanon deploy its armed forces in the south to
ensure peace in line with U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Israeli Likud party official Yuval Steinitz said the
meeting between Annan and Nasrallah lent legitimacy to a group that
should be considered a terrorist organization. Uri Savir of the
moderate Center party, however, said the encounter could help ''to
convince Hezbollah that they have to advance their goals by
political means.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh declined to comment on the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. chief said he had a ''very good discussion'' with
Nasrallah about the role of U.N. peacekeepers as well as the need
for economic and social aid for south Lebanon. He said he and
Nasrallah discussed cooperation between the government and
''non-state parties'' but did not refer to Hezbollah by name.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon is reluctant to send the army to the south before the
U.N. peacekeepers deploy. Beirut has repeatedly said it does not
want its soldiers to be Israel's border guards in the absence of a
comprehensive peace settlement with Israel involving Lebanon and
Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Israeli withdrawal, Hezbollah guerrillas have been
treated like heroes in many parts of Lebanon and the Arab world.
The casualties inflicted by Hezbollah on Israeli forces in southern
Lebanon weakened Israel's resolve to sustain the 18-year
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah draws its support from the 1.2 million-member Shiite
Muslim community, Lebanon's largest sect, and enjoys the financial
backing of Iran and the crucial political endorsement of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   But Hezbollah remains shunned by Western governments. In the
1980s, it was believed to be the umbrella group for militants who
kidnapped Westerners and destroyed two U.S. Embassy compounds, the
U.S. Marine headquarters at Beirut and a French military base. A
total of about 290 Americans and about 60 French soldiers were
killed. Hezbollah is on the U.S. list of terrorist organizations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Haitian Restraint  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP ) -- The United States urged Haitians on Tuesday
to exercise restraint and said results of last month's elections
should be carefully and accurately reported.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said special U.S.
Haiti coordinator Donald Steinberg and National Security Council
senior director Arturo Valenzuela currently are in Port-au-Prince,
the capital, for meetings related to the election results.
</P>
<P>
   ''The manner in which they're counted and finalized is very
important to us, '' Boucher said. ''We believe the process needs to
be handled very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the United States believes ''everybody should be
exercising restraint and urging calm and trying to make this
process continue in a manner that does turn out to be free and
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The country's Elections Council released results Monday that
give former President Jean-Bertrand's Aristide's party control of
16 of the Senate's 17 seats. The council move came after hours of
unrest in three of Haiti's biggest cities by protesters demanding
release of the results of the May 21 balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the situation in Port-au-Prince Tuesday was calm
and the U.S. Embassy reopened Tuesday after closing Monday because
of demonstrations near the building. The protesters tried to burn
an American flag.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States was concerned that Leon Manus, who
supervised the election, felt it necessary to flee the country over
the weekend after receiving a death threat.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said Manus entered the United States on a valid visa but
could not say if he had requested asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's Radio Galaxie in a report from the United States quoted
Manus as saying he refused to give in to pressure from President
Rene Preval to sign off on incorrect election results.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast quoted Manus as saying Aristide candidates won
seven Senate seats while Preval had insisted they won 16.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Greets King of Morocco  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Chelsea Clinton standing in for her
mother, President Clinton welcomed King Mohammed VI of Morocco to
the White House on Tuesday, saying he has distinguished himself by
his courage and conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old leader of the North African nation was greeted
with drum rolls, trumpet fanfare and a 21-gun salute on a bright,
sunny day on the South Lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Morocco is a sterling example of Islamic tolerance, a force
for peace rooted in the common values of humanity,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The young king took power in July on the death of his father,
King Hassan II, who ruled Morocco for 38 years. Clinton and his
wife, Hillary, cut short a trip to fly to Morocco for the funeral,
a gesture that Mohammed VI said he would always remember.
</P>
<P>
   With the first lady on the campaign trail in New York, Chelsea
Clinton, home from college, took her mother's place at the formal
welcoming ceremony. It was the first time that Chelsea, 20, has
played the stand-in at a state arrival. She seemed poised and
confident as she shook hands with the king and touched cheeks with
his sister, Princess Lalla Meryem.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was to return to the White House in time for the
traditional state dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The president and the king celebrated the strong ties between
the United States and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   ''America will never forget that in 1777, the first nation in
the world to recognize the United States was the kingdom of
Morocco,'' Clinton said. ''Ten years later our two countries
approved a treaty of peace and friendship, which today remains the
longest unbroken treaty of its kind in all history.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that Mohammed VI first visited the White House as
crown prince with his father 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Providence called upon you to be one of the voices of a new
generation of Arab leaders,'' Clinton said. ''And you have
responded with courage and conviction, healing old wounds,
promoting democracy, lifting those left behind, touching the hearts
of your people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the ''king of the poor'' by the Moroccan media, Mohammed
VI has made social policy a priority in a country where more than
20 percent of the population is officially unemployed and about
half, mainly women, are illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   He has broken with his father by firing senior security
officials and showing more tolerance to Islamic opponents of the
late king.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in English, the young king said his country has been a
champion of human rights and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   He said Morocco is a nation ''fervently wishing to raise our
economic relations to the level of our political dialogue.'' He
also said his country is implementing economic reforms and offering
foreign investors ''the best guarantees of security and profit.''
</P>
<P>
   The king said there is ''an imperative need'' for wealthy
nations to help the struggling countries in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''The unbearable sufferings witnessed in many African countries
make it a moral obligation for us to put this stricken continent
back on the road to peace and progress,'' the king said.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, Mohammed VI had lunch at the State Department with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who praised him for
''honoring the legacy of his father by continuing to play a
positive role'' in support of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The king spoke on the need for U.S. investment in Morocco and of
the thorny issue of the Western Sahara, saying he favors efforts by
the U.N. mission and special envoy James Baker to resolve it.
</P>
<P>
   War broke out in 1976 after Spain abandoned the territory and
Morocco annexed it. Baker is planning to convene a second round of
face-to-face talks between Morocco and the Polisario Front rebels
next week to try to salvage plans for an independence referendum in
the Western Sahara -- or consider an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   While calling the area, Morocco's ''southern province,'' the
king said he seeks a ''just and lasting solution'' to the problem.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Make First Nebraska Trip  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Keep holding your breath, Nebraskans!
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will visit you before the end of his term --
really, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska is the only state Clinton has not visited during his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said he wasn't sure if the president would accept an
invitation from retired Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., to a July 15
dedication ceremony of a museum to celebrate Nebraska's pioneer
history that just opened in Kearney, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that we'll be able to make that particular event,
but as the president has long indicated to most of us, he wants to
go to Nebraska,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, apparently to further soothe sensibilities in the heavily
Republican Midwestern state, Lockhart kept pouring it on: ''In the
greatest American spirit of saving the best for last, he intends to
go to Nebraska before his term ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart dodged the next two questions -- Why has it taken him so
long? Does Clinton have something against Nebraska?
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sticking with 'saving the best for last,''' Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> Exercise May Benefit Heart Patients  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Even patients with chronic heart failure can
benefit from exercise, which may improve circulation and increase
the amount of blood pumped by the heart, a study found.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with heart failure -- a disorder caused by weak or
inadequate pumping action by the left chamber of the heart -- are
often warned against strenuous activity.
</P>
<P>
   But the German study of 73 men with the condition found that
carefully designed endurance training can improve heart function,
and lack of exercise may worsen the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The study was published in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The patients were randomly assigned to either an exercise
program or an inactive comparison group and were monitored for six
months. Patients underwent echocardiograms and heart
catheterization at the beginning and end of the study to measure
heart size and function.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise group used a bicycle with an instrument that helped
them maintain a specific, consistent exercise level, beginning with
two weeks of in-hospital exercise lasting 10 minutes, four to six
times a day. That was followed by six months of bicycle training at
home for 20 minutes a day.
</P>
<P>
   After six months, patients who exercised had improved
circulation and resting heart rate, increased pumping capacity and
a small but significant decrease in the size of the heart,
researchers reported.
</P>
<P>
   The study was limited because it involved only one medical
center, only men, and patients a relatively young average age of
55, researchers said.

<HEADLINE> Brain Patients' Recovery Studied  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Many brain injury patients can recover just as
well at home, on their own, as those who undergo intensive
rehabilitation in the hospital, and the cost is far lower,
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 120 members of the military who had suffered
traumatic brain injury. Hospital treatment worked better for the
more severely injured patients. But for the others, eight weeks of
rehabilitation at home was as effective as eight weeks in the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million Americans a year suffer traumatic brain
injury -- damage resulting from car crashes, falls, violence and
other physical causes.
</P>
<P>
   The annual costs of such injuries are estimated at more than $37
billion, the researchers reported in Wednesday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The study was led by Dr. Andres Salazar of Walter Reed Army
Medical Center in Washington. He said that while home
rehabilitation is cheaper, some insurance companies are reluctant
to pay for it ''perhaps because it's harder to monitor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe this will change their minds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Don Young, medical director for the Health Insurance
Association of America, which represents 294 health insurance
companies, called the results encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ''Overall we would prefer, where medical condition warrants, to
provide the care in the most cost-effective setting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The patients studied all received about five days of initial
treatment at Walter Reed, then were divided into two groups.
</P>
<P>
   One received comprehensive rehabilitation in the hospital,
including lessons in speech, thinking and movement, plus
psychotherapy, at a total cost per patient of $51,840.
</P>
<P>
   The second group was sent home after being told to get at least
30 minutes of physical exercise a day and at least 30 minutes of
mental exercise, such as playing board games. A nurse checked up on
them with a 30-minute phone call once a week. The approach cost
$504 per patient.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers thought hospital treatment would be superior --
and it was among the 75 patients who had been unconscious for more
than an hour. Eighty percent of those who underwent hospital
rehabilitation were fit for military duty after a year, compared
with 58 percent of those treated at home.
</P>
<P>
   For the 45 other patients, this was not the case. A year after
treatment, both groups returned to work at similar rates -- about 90
percent. About 70 percent in each group were deemed fit for duty a
year after treatment, and both groups scored equally well on
measures of thinking, mood, behavior and social adaptation.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, neurologist Dr. Barry Jordan,
director of the brain injury program at Burke Rehabilitation
Hospital in White Plains, N.Y., said that while hospital
rehabilitation may be best for the most severely injured patients,
the study shows ''that the properly selected patient may be treated
at home.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Psychologically that might be better for most patients,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> President Begins DC Student Program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton gave a District of Columbia
student the first check issued under a program that lets residents
of the nation's capital pay in-state tuition at colleges in
Maryland and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton presented an oversized check for $4,380 to Zack Gamble,
an incoming freshman at George Mason University in Virginia. Zack,
a graduate of the district's Gonzaga College High School, plans to
major in computer science.
</P>
<P>
   ''Zack, congratulations. And now, in the immortal words of that
great movie, we're going to show you the money,'' Clinton told the
teen-ager, who was about to stand behind the politicians assembling
around the large check until Clinton steered him toward the front.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our capital city's young people have been left behind, not
because they didn't have the ability, but because they didn't have
the resources to go on to college,'' Clinton said Tuesday. ''This
fall, things will be different.''
</P>
<P>
   The funds were distributed under the District of Columbia
College Access Act of 1999, which Clinton signed last November. The
law authorizes grants of up to $10,000 per year, or $50,000 over a
lifetime, to District high school graduates who enroll in public
colleges in the Washington area. Those who attend private colleges
would receive up to $2,500 per year, or $12,500 for life.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said this year, the program will assist at least 1,000
college-bound District residents, who only have one public college
option, the University of the District of Columbia. Clinton has
sought $17 million in his fiscal 2001 budget to continue the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is one of the best investments we could ever make,''
Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Museum Giants Sign Russia Deal  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS RYMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) -- Two titans in world art, the
Guggenheim and the Hermitage, signed a long-term agreement Tuesday
in St. Petersburg to develop an international network of museums
and share some of their vast collections.
</P>
<P>
   The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation operates art museums and
exhibition spaces in New York, Venice, Berlin and Bilbao, Spain,
and possesses a collection specializing in contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   Owning more than 3 million works of art, the Hermitage in St.
Petersburg is one of the world's largest museums, with a collection
heavy in more traditional works by artists such as Da Vinci,
Michelangelo and Rembrandt. But the state-funded Hermitage is
strapped for funds and has been seeking foreign sponsors and
collaboration deals like the one signed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you look at the match between what the Guggenheim has and
needs and what the Hermitage has and needs, it's an almost ideal
match,'' Guggenheim Foundation director Thomas Krens told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The Hermitage hopes to use the partnership to revitalize its
activities with the aid of the American museum's experience in
exhibiting modern art.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Guggenheim's expertise in the field of museum design and
development, and its collections and expertise in modern and
contemporary art will be valuable assets for us to draw upon,''
said Michael Piotrovski, director at the Hermitage Museum.
</P>
<P>
   They plan to develop new display space in St. Petersburg in the
General Staff Building, which is located across the enormous Palace
Square from the Hermitage.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported that the General Staff renovations
would cost $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine the Great began the Hermitage collection in the 18th
century, and the museum opened to the public in 1852.
</P>
<P>
   The Hermitage is planning, as one of the exhibits in the newly
developed space, a section for 20th-century art. Russia's modernist
art movement was one of the world's strongest leading up to and
just after the 1917 revolution, but it was squeezed out by more
traditionalist forms prescribed by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in
the late 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   For the Guggenheim, which was established in 1937, the
collaboration is an opportunity to expand its scope by allowing it
to display pieces from the Hermitage's collection of old master,
Impressionist and post-Impressionist works, antiquities and
decorative arts.
</P>
<P>
   The Hermitage would have a presence at the proposed new
Guggenheim museum at Wall Street on the East River in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some great opportunities for architecture over
here,'' Krens said. ''There are five big interior courtyards at the
General Staff Building. Let's just say -- pure hypothesis -- that you
decided to get the three greatest contemporary architects to build
three new buildings there. It would be like a Russian Easter egg.''

<HEADLINE> Hospitals Urged on Stroke Centers  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Not enough hospitals muster the proper
emergency response for stroke victims, say new recommendations that
urge creation of hospital ''stroke centers'' for rapid care, like
the trauma centers that have revolutionized care of accident
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Time is crucial: A clot-busting drug called TPA can stop a
stroke, helping patients recover with little disability, but only
if patients receive it within three hours of the first symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet only 2 percent to 3 percent of stroke patients get TPA,
something a group of stroke organizations called the Brain Attack
Coalition hopes to improve with the new recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Stroke centers, modeled after the trauma centers that treat
critically injured patients, can help, the coalition concluded.
</P>
<P>
   To establish them, hospitals need a specially trained ''stroke
team'' available 24 hours a day who can get to a patient's bedside
within minutes, say the recommendations, published in Wednesday's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sooner a patient with stroke receives proper care, the
better their chances of having a good recovery,'' said Dr. Mark
Alberts of Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   Alberts is a consultant to TPA manufacturer Genentech Inc. and
lead author of the JAMA article. But the Brain Attack Coalition,
which includes the American Heart Association and other health
groups, developed the recommendations, and joined the National
Institutes of Health in announcing them Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stroke strikes 700,000 Americans a year, and is the nation's
third leading cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   For years, doctors had little to offer. But in the mid-1990s,
with the advent of TPA, experts began pushing patients to seek
emergency care at the first symptom: Sudden numbness or weakness,
especially on one side; confusion or trouble speaking; sudden
trouble seeing or walking; a sudden severe headache.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some hospitals still don't triage and diagnose rapidly
enough, Alberts said. Careful diagnosis is important because not
all strokes are caused by clots -- some are burst blood vessels that
require different treatment, not TPA.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen U.S. hospitals, mostly large teaching hospitals
such as Duke, already have stroke centers. Studies show stroke
centers can significantly reduce patients' risk of death or winding
up in a nursing home, Dr. H.J.M. Barnett of Canada's University of
Western Ontario wrote in an accompanying JAMA editorial.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a 24-hour stroke team, the recommendations urge
that hospitals:
</P>
<P>
   --Be able to perform a CT scan or a brain MRI within 25 minutes
of a doctor's order.
</P>
<P>
   --Have written procedures for triaging suspected stroke patients,
and trained emergency room workers to recognize symptoms and start
the process. Also, a community's ambulance service should be
integrated with the stroke center to ensure patients are
transported rapidly and that paramedics notify hospitals a possible
stroke is coming in.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations could spark development of at least several
hundred stroke centers in smaller or rural hospitals, Alberts said.
Most hospitals already have CT scanners and just need to establish
procedures and line up workers, costing anywhere from $8,000 to
$200,000, he wrote.

<HEADLINE> Barak: Shas Has My Final Offer  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak shifted the spotlight
back to the religious Shas party Tuesday by saying he has made Shas
a final offer aimed at keeping the party from bolting his fractious
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's offer came just hours after four Shas members of the
Israeli Cabinet resigned in an effort to press Barak to release
more state funds for Shas schools and legalize pirate radio
stations affiliated with the party.
</P>
<P>
   The resignations do not take effect until Thursday, which gives
Shas time to press its case.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has seriously weakened Barak and undermined his
efforts to conclude a peace deal with the Palestinians by year's
end.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said Tuesday he had met ''90 percent'' of the demands of
the religious party, and that he has done all he can.
</P>
<P>
   ''My colleagues and I ... made a supreme effort to keep Shas in
the coalition,'' he told reporters. ''What stands before us at this
hour is the norms of governance in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They know our offers, and we are waiting for their answer,''
Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not sound optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do want to see Shas in government, but we will respect the
decision they make,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Barak to continue governing without Shas would likely
require a minority government supported from the outside by Arab
legislators. Barak's mentor, Yitzhak Rabin, governed under similar
circumstances, and made considerable peace strides -- but his narrow
government drew much rancor from the nationalist opposition and
ended when he was assassinated by an ultranationalist Jew in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute centers on Shas demands that their nemesis,
Education Minister Yossi Sarid, release $6 million in funds to
their ailing religious school system. Sarid, an ardent secularist,
refuses to do so until Shas demonstrates that the funds will not be
mismanaged. In 16 years of the party's existence, Shas-run
ministries have been plagued with reports of incompetence and
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said Tuesday that he offered Shas the money upfront, to be
supervised by a ministerial committee chaired by himself. Shas has
demanded total control of the funds' disbursement, saying that is a
matter of ''honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Shas also wants its five pirate radio stations legalized. Barak
offered to incorporate the stations into an existing commercially
run network that hews to government guidelines. Again, Shas, which
views the radio stations as a powerful election-time propaganda
tool, is loath to accept outside interference.
</P>
<P>
   Three deputy ministers from Shas did not hand in letters of
resignation, a signal that the party is leaving its options open.
Resignations of deputy ministers take effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Shas officials said the next two days could be used to salvage
the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything could happen, it's all on the table. They know what
we want,'' said Shas Infrastructures Minister Eli Suissa.
</P>
<P>
   In his terse letter of resignation, Labor Minister Eli Ishai,
the Shas chairman, said the decision to leave the government was
made by Shas' spiritual advisers, a group of rabbis. ''Those who
take advice from the elderly don't fail,'' Ishai wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had pushed hard to keep Shas in his 11-month-old
government. Barak's One Israel alignment has only 26 seats in
parliament. Shas, with 17 seats, holds the balance of power between
hawkish and dovish factions and can hold Barak hostage to its
demands.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, citing Central Park attacks, calls for protection  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOLTON LANDING, N.Y. (AP) - Senate candidate Hillary Rodham
Clinton criticized some members of the news media on Tuesday for
broadcasting pictures of women recently attacked in Central Park,
using that to call for a new push to provide Americans with more
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe it was wrong to show the faces of those women being
assaulted without getting their permission first,'' the first lady
told the annual conference of the New York State Broadcasters
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''The information age and the 24-hour news cycle should not turn
acts of abuse and disrespect into a spectator sport,'' she said at
the Sagamore Resort overlooking Lake George.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks against the women in Central Park came earlier this
month after the Puerto Rican Day parade that Clinton and her
Republican opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, had both marched in. While
pictures of the women were broadcast, many stations concealed their
identity by blurring the faces. Some did not.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the incident to tell the broadcasters that it was
time to mount a campaign to protect Americans' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you enter public life, you give up a lot of your privacy.
I know that all too well,'' Clinton said. ''But I don't believe you
should give up your privacy when you visit your doctor, take a trip
to the video store or buy a book on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   As things stand now, Clinton said, ''There is greater protection
for your video rental receipts than for your most intimate medical
information.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said that if elected to the Senate, she would
make protecting personal privacy a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   In a more than one-hour appearance before the broadcasters,
Clinton also said the Senate race has ''obviously changed to some
extent'' with Lazio replacing Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as the GOP
candidate. The New York City mayor withdrew on May 19 to deal with
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''On many issues, the mayor and I were much closer together than
I am with my new opponent,'' Clinton said. ''He agreed with me on
lots of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited she and the mayor's strong advocacy for gun
licensing laws and abortion rights as areas where they were more in
agreement than she is with Lazio. The contrast allowed Clinton,
without saying so to the broadcasters, to again suggest that Lazio
is more conservative than Giuliani. A main theme of her campaign is
that Lazio is too conservative for New York.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a lengthy explanation of why she ran for the Senate in
what was certain to be a tough race, the first lady said one of the
factors was an encounter she had with a young female athlete in
Chelsea in New York City last year as they promoted a television
documentary on women athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that at one point after the program, the young
woman leaned over to her and whispered in her ear, ''Dare to
compete, Mrs. Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The appearance before the broadcasters came as yet another poll
showed the race with Lazio to be a squeeker
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll, from Marist College's Institute for Public
Opinion, had each favored by 42 percent of voters and with the
congressman from Long Island leading her 2-1 among key suburban
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is a close race. As I've said for many weeks and
months now, it's a close race,'' Clinton said. ''There's a lot at
stake in the race and it's going to be a hard fought, close
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Tuesday, she toured an afterschool program in the Bronx
before heading back to Washington, D.C., to attend a state dinner
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio addressed the broadcasters conference by telephone on
Monday night from Washington where he was working on House
business. Clinton had criticized him last week for missing votes in
Congress to campaign.

<HEADLINE> Survey shows children better off, but poorest lack basics  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Conditions for U.S. children have improved
somewhat in the last several years, a charitable group said
Tuesday. But far too many poor kids live in families lacking what
most Americans take for granted - parents, computers, telephones,
cars and health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Six of 10 indicators used to measure child well-being showed
children were better off in 1997 than in 1990, said the annual Kids
Count survey sponsored by the private Annie E. Casey Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Infant mortality and child death rates dropped and teen birth
rates are down, the survey showed. Other improvements included an
18 percent drop in the rate of teen deaths by accident, homicide
and suicide and a 10 percent decline in the percentage of children
living with parents who lacked full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But other factors affecting well being - low birth rates,
poverty and missing a parent - worsened over the last several
years. Children in the poorest urban neighborhoods face a myriad of
barriers to succeed in a competitive world:
</P>
<P>
   -17 percent live in homes without phones.
</P>
<P>
   -84 percent of households with children don't have computers.
</P>
<P>
   -Half of all children live in families that don't have cars.
</P>
<P>
   -17 percent of children lack health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   -8 percent don't live with either parent.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a time when media experts, economists and social observers
stress that the future belongs to those on the Internet and to
those who can compete in a global economy, many inner-city families
don't have cars to get to work, phones to remain linked with family
and neighbors or computers that would allow them to navigate the
information superhighway,'' the survey reported.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, an amalgamation of data from federal and state
government studies, showed that despite the economic boom of the
1990s, the number of children living in working poor families
increased from 4.3 million in 1989 to 5.8 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This increase comes as millions of former welfare recipients
have left the rolls and entered low-wage jobs, causing the ranks of
the working poor to swell, the survey said. Most children living in
poverty do not receive government assistance, but instead live in
families where at least one parent is working.
</P>
<P>
   States where conditions were worst for children included
Arizona, New Mexico, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee,
Alabama, Kentucky, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and West
Virginia, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
   States with the best conditions included Maine, New Hampshire,
Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Iowa,
Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and Utah.

<HEADLINE> At almost $30 million, 42nd Street studios serve nonprofit artists  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - They have talent, some Tonys and no money - but
on Tuesday they arrived on 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   Some of America's best performing artists inaugurated a
10-story, $29.6 million building of rehearsal studios for nonprofit
arts companies - the first of its type in the country, said Cora
Cahan, president of The New 42nd Street Inc., which spearheaded the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled amid renovated commercial theaters that ousted porn
shops, The New 42nd Street Studios are ''a lagoon in the cacophony,
the Walden Pond on 42nd where people can work and think,'' said
Cahan. ''This is purely about creativity, about taking away the
anxiety by offering a place that's clean and affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   The studios, flooded with sunlight streaming through an
all-glass facade, are equipped with grand pianos and wooden dance
barres that stretch against the Manhattan skyline, overlookingTimes
Square.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidized space is a dream-come-true for Sheila Kay Davis,
founder of the New Professional Theatre, which premieres new plays
with a black perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The troupe rents rehearsal space for $40 an hour, or 25 percent
below market rates, and an office for only $407 a month, or about
half the commercial rate. The subsidy money comes from renting the
same studios for commercial use, at market rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't rent a closet for that,'' said Davis, whose actors
until recently used run-down rooms on the old 42nd Street,
surrounded by porn shops and boarding houses ''where Gypsy Rose Lee
did her burlesque.''
</P>
<P>
   About four years ago, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani harnessed a
private-public team of developers to start cleaning up Times
Square, bringing in shiny, neon-lighted hotels, theme stores and
restaurants that are the core of the area's renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   As workers put finishing touches on the studio building on
Tuesday, Davis watched her actors rehearsing ''The In-Gathering,''
about an emancipated slave in search of his wife after the Civil
War. In September, the musical is the first public performance
scheduled for the 199-seat Duke theater on the building's ground
floor ; its funding came from the estate of the late Doris Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ''My company has everything - talent and actors who have worked
in plays that won Tonys. We have everything but money,'' she said.
''This was a blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   The studios are across the street from a high-rent theater
currently offering the Broadway hit musical, ''The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a venue the Parsons Dance Company could never afford.
</P>
<P>
   But on the seventh floor of their new home, they're sweating
under the 13-foot ceilings - through steps that will cross the
ocean next week, for a performance at the Spoleto Festival in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit dance company is in the process of moving from a
cramped, windowless space at City Center on West 55th Street whose
700 square feet ''was like working in a bullpen'' to the new studio
with 1,400 square feet, said Frank Sonntag, the company's executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a new concept,'' Sonntag said. ''The space crunch is so
great in New York that the non-profits are constantly moving,
scrambling to find affordable space.''
</P>
<P>
   The New 42nd Street Inc. got a kick-start from the city and
state in 1990 as an independent, nonprofit organization charged
with revitalizing seven historic theaters, including The New
Victory. The organization now relies mostly on commercial tenants
and fundraisers.
</P>
<P>
   All but $1.7 million of the $29.6 million cost of the studio
building has been raised through a combination of public and
private funds, said Cahan.
</P>
<P>
   Construction costs were high, she explained, because the floors
were specially built to be resilient, the walls are soundproof, and
the large spaces have no columns. In addition, each mirrored room
has separate climate-control for varying needs, and there are
dressing rooms and lockers for performers.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by the firm of Platt Byard Dovell Architects, the
building is illuminated by multicolored computer-programmed lights
that play across its glass facade at night.
</P>
<P>
   As the first building to provide studio space for nonprofit
artists, ''we lend counterpoint to the rest of the street,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the block where Gypsy Rose Lee once entertained, 42nd Street
is swinging again.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a class act.

<HEADLINE> Panel: Cut Clinton's Land Proposals  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate panel considering President Clinton's
proposals to buy more park land, enhance services for American
Indians and expand arts funding attempted Tuesday to avoid a veto
showdown by endorsing more modest cuts than the House had made.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Appropriations Interior Subcommittee approved a $15.5
billion spending plan for the Interior Department, Forest Service,
arts and cultural programs, and several related agencies. The
package is nearly $1 billion less than Clinton requested but $628
million more than this year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats had warned of a possible veto last week when the
House approved a plan totaling only $14.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''My goal is to get a bill that is going to be signed with
relatively little controversy,'' said the subcommittee's chairman,
Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate measure includes increases in several areas sought by
Clinton, such as rebuilding Indian reservation schools, increasing
funding the National Endowment for the Arts and buying state and
federal park land.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan also is free of several controversial amendments
offered in the House, such as a rejected proposal to cut off
funding for the eight national monuments Clinton declared in the
West this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had asked for $470 million to buy new federal and state
park land. The Senate plan cut that by more than half to $221
million, but that still was more than the House plan included.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan also includes $105 million for the NEA, a $7.4
million increase over this year's budget but $45 million less than
Clinton's request. The House version would not give the NEA an
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan would increase spending on Indian school
construction by $143 million. That's enough to build the six
schools the Bureau of Indian Affairs deems most necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had asked for an increase of $167 million for Indian
school construction.

<HEADLINE> Close Vote Likely on Hate-Crime Law  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration waged a
down-to-the-wire battle on Tuesday for a bill to make it easier for
federal prosecutors to try hate crimes, sending Vice President Al
Gore to the Senate to cast a tie-breaking vote, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore poised to take the gavel, supporters believed they had
lined up enough votes to prevail, narrowly, without his help, said
Democratic officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ''It will be a very close vote,'' Senate Democratic
Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, as the presiding officer of the Senate, may
vote in cases of ties.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also worked the phones to try to solidify
support for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would expand the list of hate crimes and give federal
prosecutors more leeway in bringing hate crime charges.
</P>
<P>
   In final debate, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the prime
sponsor, called on colleagues to ''take a clear and unequivocal
stand'' for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   But while an almost identical bill was passed overwhelmingly by
the Senate last year, this time it has touched off heated debate
over whether the measure infringes on state and local powers of law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., opposed the
administration-supported bill, telling reporters, it would
''federalize'' many violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''State laws are working and doing a fine job,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters cited the 1998 death in Jasper, Texas, of James Byrd,
a 49-year-old black man, who was dragged behind a pickup truck; and
the death, also in 1998, of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old
homosexual University of Wyoming student, who died after being
beaten into a coma and tied to a fence.
</P>
<P>
   Neither state had a hate-crimes statute.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hate crimes are modern day lynchings,'' said Kennedy, the
principal sponsor. ''They tear at the heart and soul of our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's legislation was headed for a vote Tuesday as an
amendment to an unrelated defense bill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Byrd's family Monday in Houston and renewed his
appeal for Senate passage. He also put in a few calls to wavering
senators.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd was dragged to death on a country road by a trio of white
men.
</P>
<P>
   ''Crimes motivated by hate are really fundamentally different
and I think should be treated differently under the law,'' Clinton
said. ''I ask all of you to stand up with this fine family. We have
to pass this legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The president cited FBI statistics that showed almost 8,000 hate
crimes were reported in 1998, the latest year available.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would add offenses motivated by sexual
orientation, sex or disability to the list of hate crimes already
covered under a 1968 federal law.
</P>
<P>
   It also would give federal prosecutors the option of pursuing a
hate-crime case if local authorities refused to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the Judiciary Committee chairman, was
pressing a rival approach that would set up a $5 million-a-year
fund at the Justice Department to help state and local authorities
investigate and prosecute hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal also would authorize a federal study to see whether
hate crimes were not being prosecuted by state and local
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said the Kennedy measure was overly broad. For instance,
he suggested that under it every rape prosecution could be deemed a
hate crime and prosecuted in federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is little evidence that a broad federalization of hate
crimes is warranted,'' Hatch said. ''Serious constitutional
questions remain.''
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem facing the Kennedy measure: Senate
Republican leaders are wary of further weighing down the defense
bill with irrelevant amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are seeking to use the legislation to press a range of
high profile issues in this election year.
</P>
<P>
   A Kennedy spokesman, Will Keyser, said Kennedy was optimistic
the measure would be approved, although he suggested the vote could
be close.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate adopted the hate-crimes legislation last year as part
of a spending bill for the Commerce, Justice and State departments,
but it stalled in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's measure would expand a 1968 federal law that defines
hate crimes as assaults motivated by the victim's race, color,
religion or national origin as the victim attempts to exercise
certain specified federally protected activities -- including voting
or attending school.
</P>
<P>
   His measure has 42 co-sponsors, including six Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The underlying defense bill is S. 2549

<HEADLINE> Russia, China Attack War Court  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Russia and China on Tuesday accused the
international war crimes tribunal for Yugoslavia of anti-Serb bias,
after the court's president proposed new reforms to speed up
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council session once again showed the clear split
between NATO allies and Russia and China over issues involving the
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately in the activity of the tribunal, we have seen
political ambitions that have emerged and a clear anti-Serb line
has been adopted,'' Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov charged, after
a briefing by tribunal president Claude Jorda.
</P>
<P>
   Lavrov said the court had ''predetermined for itself the culprit
in the Yugoslav tragedy,'' and accused it of turning a blind eye to
crimes committed by Croats or Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are affected by politics too much,'' deputy Chinese
Ambassador Shen Guofang told Jorda.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke immediately came to the
court's defense, calling the criticism neither ''justified, valid,
or productive.'' He noted that Russia and China participated in the
1995 Dayton peace process that ended the 2&AMP;frac12;-year war in Bosnia and
led to the court's establishment.
</P>
<P>
   The United States strongly supports the international tribunal
and stands behind its goal to see war criminals brought to justice,
Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   Jorda rejected the criticism from Russia and China, saying the
court's judges were impartial and had to be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to remind you that the 14 judges have no
involvement with any of the states involved in the conflict,''
Jorda told a news conference after the council meeting.
</P>
<P>
   During the council session, Jorda said that the tribunal had no
obligation to indict or try an equal number of Serbs, Croats, and
Muslims. That would only politicize the court, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
   In his briefing, Jorda warned the council that the court could
still be judging cases in 2016 if reforms -- including creating a
new pool of judges that would preside over occasional trials -- are
not carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Jorda said that with increasing cooperation by the countries
involved -- Croatia's new pro-democracy government has chosen to
cooperate with the tribunal -- and the growing number of arrests,
the court could soon be processing more than 200 cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''The workload of the tribunal is now so heavy that, should no
remedy be found immediately, the institution's very credibility
will be put into question,'' Jorda told the council.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on behalf of the court's judges, Jorda proposed that
professional legal specialists handle the pre-trail phase, from the
arrest of the indictees to the first hearing of their trial,
instead of the judges.
</P>
<P>
   Jorda also urged the council to consider establishing a pool of
reserve judges which would be called on as soon as a case is ready
for trial if necessary, and just for that trial.
</P>
<P>
   The court was established by the Security Council, which must
approve any reform to its structure or mission.
</P>
<P>
   Jorda said the creation of the reserve pool would be cheaper and
more effective than calling in more permanent judges to the court.

<HEADLINE> FAA Sets New Airport Safety Rules  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is
proposing to add about 40 smaller airports to those that must
satisfy federal safety requirements as a condition for obtaining
approval to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Currently an FAA certificate is required to operate an airport
that serves planes with more than 30 seats. Some 660 airports hold
such certificates.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal to be announced Wednesday, the FAA plans to
extend its authority to airports with scheduled service by planes
with 10 to 30 seats.
</P>
<P>
   David Bennett, director of the office of airport safety and
standards, said this would bring about 40 additional airports under
federal requirements for maintenance of runway and taxiway
pavement; marking and lighting; notification of air carriers of
unsafe or changed conditions; and preparedness for aircraft
accidents and other emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said many of these airports already meet most federal
standards because they have sought grant money. But he estimated
the 40 would face a total initial expense of about $1.9 million and
annual expenses of $1.2 million to meet the requirements.
</P>
<P>
   About 220 airports that currently have to meet full federal
standards only during parts of the day when handling flights of
larger planes also will face added costs because of the extension
of the rules to periods when those airports deal with 10-to-30 seat
commuter planes.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said the agency plans to work with the smaller airports
on how they can meet safety standards with the least expense.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, a small airport might not have to set up a
fire and rescue operation if a municipal fire station were adjacent
to the airport and the airport made sure local firefighters were
trained in handling the type of fires and accidents that can occur
at airports.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposal, open for public comment for 90 days, also
revises standards for all airports, including such things as
changes in rules for signs and lighting, local wildlife management
and reporting changes in airport conditions.
</P>
<P>
   He said those overall costs are expected to be about $3.5
million for all involved airports, with $6 million in recurring
annual costs.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists, shippers at odds over Delaware River deepening project </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - On the surface, it seems like the most
boring of issues - river muck. But a plan to deepen the Delaware
River has emotions running high because it's really about health,
the environment, jobs and money.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, with the backing of the
Delaware River Port Authority, plans to deepen 108 miles of the
river to 45 feet, from its current depth of 40 feet. That will
allow ships to carry more cargo - from fruit to paper products to
oil - to the Port of Camden and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority and shippers say this is essential to keeping
the port competitive. But environmentalists say the project is
unnecessary, wasteful and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Several congressmen from New Jersey have asked the federal
government's General Accounting Office to investigate the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Many cargo ships, when fully loaded, draw too much water to
enter the Delaware River. They stop in the Delaware Bay and unload
some of their cargo onto smaller vessels, which bring it up the
river.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we have a deeper river, we dramatically decrease that,''
said Joe Diemer, spokesman for the Delaware River Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The project would deepen the river from the its mouth at the
Delaware Bay to Camden and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping companies, as they have at other ports, have threatened
to take their cargo elsewhere if the channel isn't deepened,
affecting some 54,000 port-related jobs, Diemer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are more jobs associated with the port here than in
other port areas because so much of what moves in and out of here
moves on trucks,'' he said. ''When a fruit ship comes in, there are
hundreds of trucks lined up to take the fruit and get it to
supermarkets. The same with steel and other cargoes.''
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of environmental groups, led by the Delaware
Riverkeeper Network, has been working to stop the dredging project.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that the deepening project would not benefit shippers
because bigger new container ships require a depth of at least 50
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Going to 45 feet gets you nothing,'' said Maya van Rossum,
executive director of the Riverkeeper Network.
</P>
<P>
   But Rich DeGennaro, chairman of the board of the Maritime
Exchange for the Delaware River and Bay, which represents shippers
and terminal operators, said the ''super-modern'' ships that draw
50 feet will not be ''calling on the Port of Philadelphia anytime
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We think 45 feet is a realistic goal for us at this time. It
will accommodate more of the modern ships than 40 feet will, but
not necessarily the super-modern ships,'' DeGennaro said.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental network also says that the six oil refineries
on the Delaware would have to deepen their own berths to
accommodate bigger tankers. Only two have committed to doing that.
</P>
<P>
   DeGennaro said that's not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that when the channel is deepened, that they will all
ultimately find that the economics are compelling to deepen their
berths,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Riverkeeper Network fears that stirring up the river bottom
will release toxins that could harm marine life and groundwater.
</P>
<P>
   ''We might be getting ourselves into real trouble, threatening
people's drinking water supplies, threatening the recovering oyster
population and reintroducing toxins into food chain,'' said van
Rossum.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps says levels of toxins in the river sediment are
not high enough to damage the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Also at issue is what to do with the 22 million cubic yards of
sediment that would be dredged. Plans call for it to be used to
restore beaches along the river and Delaware Bay in Delaware and
New Jersey, Diemer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority also is negotiating with companies that want
the material for highway fill and construction projects, he said,
and is exploring using it to fill abandoned mines in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Army Corps of Engineers can begin the project, it
must sign a financial agreement with the Port Authority. Ed Voigt,
spokesman for the Army Corps in the Philadelphia district, said
negotiations are in the final phase.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the federal government would fund about
two-thirds of the $311 million cost and the Port Authority would
pay about one-third, with contributions from New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   The bill that provides a portion of the funding has been
approved by the House of Representatives and must be considered by
the Senate, said Rich McGrath, spokesman for U.S. Sen. Robert
Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Rob Andrews and Torricelli, both D-N.J., have asked
the Government Accounting Office to look into the project. Reps.
Jim Saxton and Frank LoBiondo, both R-N.J., support the probe. Jeff
Sagnip, spokesman for Saxton, said the GAO has not decided whether
it will study the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the probe, a New Jersey Senate committee has
held back a $13 million appropriation for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Port Authority and shippers are steadfast in
their support.
</P>
<P>
   Said Diemer: ''We can't compete in the 21st century with a
shipping channel that dates back to World War II.''

<HEADLINE> Federal prosecutors say shoe maker manipulated initial public offering </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Designer and shoe retailer Steven Madden was
arrested Tuesday on charges that he conspired to manipulate the
value of his company's stock during its initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Madden, 43, of Manhattan, faces indictments in U.S. District
Court in Brooklyn and Manhattan accusing him of making secret deals
with broker dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am absolutely not guilty,'' Madden said as he left court in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The deals were an effort to manipulate the value of his company
as it grew from a regional small shoe company with limited assets
into a multimillion dollar operation, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Madden Ltd., which is known for its clunky, high-heeled
shoes, operates about 60 stores and sells its shoes in more than
3,000 department and specialty stores. Sales doubled in 1999 to
$163 million.
</P>
<P>
   At an initial court appearance Tuesday, U.S. Magistrate Judge
Douglas F. Eaton set bail at $750,000, secured by Madden's East
Hampton home and the homes of two business associates.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of the most serious charge, conspiracy to commit
securities fraud, Madden faces up to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into Madden's shoe operation apparently grew
out of other investigations into corrupt broker dealers who ripped
off investors for hundreds of millions of dollars during initial
public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   In the Brooklyn indictment, Madden was accused of engaging in
two separate securities fraud schemes with Stratton Oakmont Inc. a
now defunct broker-dealer of securities formerly located in Lake
Success, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, two former top executives of the securities firm
pleaded guilty to charges that from 1990 through 1997 they
manipulated the prices of stocks of at least 34 thinly capitalized
public companies.
</P>
<P>
   Among those fraudulent underwritings, prosecutors said, was a
December 1993 initial public offering of Madden's company.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn indictment accused Madden of crafting the initial
public offering of his company so that three top executives of
Stratton Oakmont gained secret control of the majority of the
fledgling company's shares.
</P>
<P>
   The control allowed the three executives and Madden to
artificially inflate the price of the company's securities and be
ensured substantial illicit profits, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Securities Dealers had refused to
approve the Madden initial public offering if any of the Stratton
Oakmont executives owned more than 4.9 percent of the outstanding
stock, the indictment alleged.
</P>
<P>
   To get around this, Madden falsely represented that the Stratton
Oakmont executives had sold more than 1.2 million shares,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, though, Madden had entered into a secret and unlawful
agreement that the stock would continue to be held by the Stratton
Oakmont executives, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Madden tried to renege on his secret deal, prompting one
of the Stratton Oakmont executives to sue him in state court, the
indictment alleged.
</P>
<P>
   In the other scheme in Brooklyn, Madden was accused of
participating in the manipulation of stock prices of more than a
dozen stocks underwritten by Stratton Oakmont.
</P>
<P>
   In federal court in Manhattan, Madden was accused of
participating in a similar unlawful scheme with executives of
another securities company, Monroe Parker Securities Inc., a now
defunct broker dealer in Purchase, N.Y., prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Joel Winograd, said the charges would not affect his
client's shoe business.
</P>
<P>
   ''We vigorously deny the charges and all the allegations,'' he
said. ''People who are witnesses for the government are scoundrels
who have their own problems to solve and are using him as a
passport to their freedom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate action in civil court, the Securities and Exchange
Commission sought an order barring Madden from serving as an
officer or director of a public company as well as an order forcing
him to give up any ill-gotten gains and to pay penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Madden Ltd.'s shares were down $1.938, or nearly 15
percent, at $11.188 in midday trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Capitol Visitors' Center Planned  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional leaders broke ground Tuesday for
a visitors' center at the U.S. Capitol, taking a small ceremonial
step toward the largest capitol project since the 1850s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we begin the process of constructing a facility that
will enable us to better take care of the visitors to the people's
house,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., co-chair of the
Capitol Preservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The center, which will cost an estimated $265 million, is
expected to open sometime in 2005 to provide tourists with
historical displays, restrooms and food while they wait to enter
the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, Congress has considered having an underground
center on the east side of the Capitol to give as many as 18,000
tourists a day waiting in long tour lines respite from the winter
cold and summer heat.
</P>
<P>
   Republican opposition to the cost put the plan on hold in 1991.
It was revived only after a gunman shot his way into the building
two years ago, killing two police officers. The center would help
security by moving the screening of visitors away from the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 federal budget included $100 million for planning,
engineering, designing and constructing the center, and the sale of
two commemorative coin series has created a fund worth another $28
million.
</P>
<P>
   Private donations will pay the remaining cost, and the Pew
Charitable Trusts, which established a nonprofit foundation
committed to raising $100 million, has already received $35 million
in pledges, Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   The preservation commission still must approve a final design
for the center, but current plans foresee a three-level underground
structure of 558,000 square feet set into the east side of the
Capitol, across the street from the Supreme Court and the Library
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Architect of the Capitol is studying a proposal to link the
Library of Congress to the visitors' center with an underground
tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-construction activities, including testing the soil for
hazardous materials and items of archaeological value, will begin
Wednesday, said Genevieve Erny, a commission spokeswoman. Actual
construction should begin within 12 months to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, commission co-chair and the longest-serving
senator in American history, said he was honored to participate in
the ground breaking, but for him it wasn't the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stood on the east front of the Capitol 41 years ago to break
ground for the extension of our national capitol,'' said Thurmond,
R-S.C., who was first elected to the Senate in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Senate and House leaders joined Hastert and Thurmond at the
site.

<HEADLINE> Clinton puts Rochester-based company in Syracuse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOLTON LANDING, N.Y. (AP) - It looks as if Hillary Rodham
Clinton still has some boning up to do on her adopted state.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, who is running for the U.S. Senate from New York
and has made much of learning about the state she had never lived
in before January, was discussing New York's economy Tuesday before
the New York State Broadcasters Association's annual conference in
Bolton Landing.
</P>
<P>
   Ticking off a list of famous New York companies, including
Eastman Kodak and Bausch &AMP; Lomb, Clinton noted, ''We've got
Paychex, one of the biggest sort of information tech companies in
the country, in Syracuse.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at that point Clinton probably could have benefitted from
an interruption from ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' host Regis
Philbin with his trademark query: ''Is that your final answer?''
</P>
<P>
   Paychex, a national leader in payroll check processing, is
headquartered in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton met in Rochester last year with Paychex chief
B. Thomas Golisano when she was courting the possible support of
the Independence Party, the New York arm of the national Reform
Party. Multi-millionaire Golisano put the party on the electoral
map in New York when he ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1994 and
again in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Golisano didn't seem miffed when told about Clinton's gaffe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very simple mistake to make,'' the company founder
said. ''We have offices all across the state.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those Paychex offices is in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin was honored by at Tuesday's conference with a
''Broadcaster of the Year'' award.

<HEADLINE> Next Missile Defense Test Date Set  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon set a July 7 target date for a
$100 million test of an anti-missile shield, while leaving open the
possibility that Defense Secretary William Cohen could recommend
proceeding with deployment of the controversial system by 2005 even
if the July test is a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ''The July test will be our most demanding trial to date,''
Cohen said in a written announcement of the twice-delayed test.
This will be the first flight test to incorporate a communications
link from ground radars to the missile interceptor in flight,
providing last-minute guidance on where to find the target in
space.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Gansler, the Pentagon's technology chief, acknowledged
Tuesday that the Pentagon's scientists and engineers are pushing
the envelope of technological know-how in trying to shoot down
long-range ballistic missiles in space -- a goal the United States
has pursued, off and on, for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clearly a high-risk overall program,'' Gansler said,
referring to the possibility of setbacks. ''And it's not a high
probability of being able to precisely get everything to work on
this flight'' in July.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has said it wanted to score two missile intercepts
before continuing toward deployment. It managed one intercept last
October, but the most recent test, in January, missed its target.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether a failure in July would preclude Cohen
recommending to President Clinton that he keep to the schedule for
deploying a limited missile defense by 2005, Gansler said, ''It
depends what type of failure it was.'' At any rate, he added, it
will be a decision for Clinton based on factors beyond the
technical aspects.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is scheduled to decide this fall whether to give
the go-ahead for starting construction on a high-powered missile
defense radar on the Alaskan island of Shemya, has said he also
will consider such factors as cost, the global threat of missile
attacks on U.S. soil and the impact on arms control.
</P>
<P>
   If the July test goes as planned, a modified Minuteman II
missile will launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., on July
7 and head west. Cued by high-speed computers at Colorado Springs,
Colo., a single interceptor rocket will be fired from Meck Island
in the Pacific in pursuit of the target. A 130-pound ''kill
vehicle'' will release from atop the interceptor rocket and
maneuver into the path of the target 144 miles above Earth,
colliding with the mock warhead at a speed of 12,000 miles an hour
and destroying it.
</P>
<P>
   The last such intercept attempt failed in January because the
mechanical ''eyes'' aboard the ''kill vehicle'' did not work right.
Because of the work needed to fix that problem, the following test
was delayed from April to July.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the concept of intercepting long-range missiles
outside the Earth's atmosphere is flawed because decoy launches
could fool the U.S. interceptor. The Pentagon acknowledged decoys
present a long-term challenge, but said the system can overcome the
crude decoys likely to be encountered in the short run.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to respond to such critics, Gansler said, ''They're
wrong.'' He noted that a panel of independent experts recently
concluded in a classified report to Cohen that the program is on
track to achieving its goal, although it may take longer than
planned.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Pentagon released an unclassified summary of that
report, dated June 13. It said technology ''is available'' to field
a limited system of missile defenses. It cautioned, however, that
the Pentagon must prepare for the more sophisticated decoys likely
to emerge in the future.
</P>
<P>
   While there is a ''high risk'' that the system may not be ready
for use by 2005, there is ''no technical reason to change the
schedule at present,'' the summary said.
</P>
<P>
   That is a key point, because the schedule is at the heart of
much of the debate over the missile defense project.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to use a combination of powerful radars,
ground-launched missile interceptors based in Alaska, and
high-speed computers to protect all 50 states against an attack by
30 or fewer long-range missiles. The Pentagon estimates this will
cost $36 billion, including the cost of operating it for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   To have the system ready for use by 2005, Clinton needs to give
the go-ahead this fall to award contracts for starting construction
of the high-powered radar on Shemya Island next summer. The
Pentagon has set other key milestones, including a decision in the
summer of 2003 on whether to go ahead with building the actual
missile interceptors that would be based in underground silos near
Fairbanks, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   That 2003 decision, Gansler said, ''is the real decision in
terms of commitment to building weapons.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Investigate GM Suburban  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety agency is investigating more
than 760,000 sport utility vehicles made by General Motors Corp.
after complaints that some batteries leak acid, which can cause
loss of power and increase the risk of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday
that there have been 212 complaints about the problem, including
reports of two crashes and one injury. GM reports 25,122 warranty
claims related to the problem on the Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe
and the GMC Yukon.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has upgraded the investigation into the vehicles from
model years 1995 through 1997 to study the batteries. It notes the
problem may be related to warmer temperatures, since 60 percent of
complaints came from California, Florida, Georgia and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A General Motors spokesman said the company is aware of the
investigation and is cooperating with NHTSA.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA also upgraded its investigation into 1993 to 1998 model
years of the Mercury Villager and Nissan Quest.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 18 complaints from Villager owners and 23 from
Nissan owners that fuel leaks from cracked or deteriorated fuel
tank vent hoses. There are 389,963 of the Villagers on the road and
276,181 Quests.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA opens any safety investigation with a preliminary inquiry
in which the government and manufacturer exchange paperwork that
includes any complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation then could be upgraded to an engineering
analysis, during which engineers study parts to see if they are
defective, as in the GM, Mercury and Nissan cases. An investigation
eventually can lead to a recall, but many are dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recalls in Tuesday's monthly defect report:
</P>
<P>
   --Dodge Ram from model years 1994-1996; ignition switch and
wiring can overheat; 690,000 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   --1995 Mazda Protege; headlights may blink because of headlight
switch lead wire damage, which can result in complete loss of
headlights; 79,000 on the road
</P>
<P>
   --1998 Buick Park Avenue; front seat shoulder belts may twist,
which can make the belt unusable; 77,952 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA also began a preliminary investigation into some Firestone
tires after some consumers complained that the tire tread can
separate while driving at highway speeds.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 90 complaints, including reports of 33 crashes
resulting in 27 injuries and 4 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some drivers heard a loud noise seconds before the loss of
control, but others heard nothing,'' said a NHTSA report. ''Those
that did hear a noise often reported that the loss of control
occurred so quickly they were not able to avoid a collision.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation involves the ATX, ATX II and Wilderness
models, which were installed as original equipment on some Ford
Explorer, Ranger and F150 vehicles and were also available as
replacement tires for those and other vehicles.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Debt Reduction Bill  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to emphasize debt payment over
government spending, House Republicans engineered easy passage
Tuesday of legislation requiring that at least $16 billion in
unforeseen surplus money go directly to retire the public debt.
</P>
<P>
   The House also passed a second bill to ensure that surplus
payroll taxes earmarked for Medicare aren't diverted for spending
or tax cuts -- a measure that Vice President Al Gore called during a
visit to the Capitol a ''strong signal ... that Medicare is not
fair game to be used as a piggybank.''
</P>
<P>
   The debt bill, passed by a 419-5 vote, would require that any
non-Social Security surplus money for fiscal 2000 above the $24.4
billion projected earlier this year be deposited in a new Treasury
Department account created specifically to pay off debt. Sponsors
said upcoming summer estimates are likely to add at least $16
billion in unforeseen surplus revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't take that money off the table, somebody's going to
spend it,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The national debt now stands at $5.7 trillion, with $3.6
trillion owed to the public and $2.1 trillion owed to Social
Security and other trust funds. The bill would also reduce the
government's borrowing limit, currently $5.95 trillion, by whatever
amount is deposited into the new account.
</P>
<P>
   Although Congress could easily pass another law if lawmakers
decided to spend some of that money, Rep. Ernie Fletcher, R-Ky.,
said the House vote would make it politically more difficult to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be very hard to go home and say 'I voted against
appropriating money to pay down the debt,''' said Fletcher, the
bill's chief sponsor. ''If you're serious about it, this is the way
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also supported the bill, but many pointed out that
debt is automatically paid down if nothing is done with surplus tax
revenue. Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., said Republicans did not
want the measure to go beyond fiscal 2000 because they want future
surpluses to go for huge tax cuts if Texas Gov. George W. Bush is
elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality is, this is a political act, not a substantive
act,'' Matsui said. ''It won't hurt, but it doesn't really help,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration opposes the bill for its provision to
reduce the government debt ceiling, but the president has stopped
short of threatening a veto. There is no companion measure in the
Senate, but GOP leaders there said interest was growing in passing
a similar measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare ''lockbox'' bill, passed 420-2, would ensure that
an estimated $126 billion surplus payroll taxes deposited in the
Medicare account isn't borrowed for spending or tax cuts. A similar
''lockbox'' for Social Security passed the House last year -- it
remains bottled up in the Senate -- and Gore has called for a
similar Medicare plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters that the House action would impose ''a moral
obligation'' to keep Medicare off-limits -- but said it should be
made permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're passing a bill that is a lot weaker than it could be,''
said Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   The debt bill is H.R. 4601.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare bill is H.R. 3859.

<HEADLINE> Accusations Fly Over Fuel Costs  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House, trying to stem political
fallout in pivotal Midwest states, said Tuesday the industry
argument blaming new environmental rules for soaring gasoline
prices ''doesn't stand the test of logic'' and that more
investigation of oil company practices is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, the administration was quietly trying to
persuade OPEC oil ministers to increase crude oil production when
they meet Wednesday in Vienna, Austria. It's widely believed some
production increases will be approved, but the additional oil may
do little to drive down gasoline prices that have reached as high
as $2.33 a gallon for regular grade in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   The Energy Department's weekly survey showed the cost of
gasoline nationally increased 5 cents a gallon from last week to
$1.68, a record high for the fourth week in a row. And the high
prices were prompting worries both on the presidential campaign
trail and among Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   ''There is gouging on the part of the large oil companies,''
insisted Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. He
and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the top Democrat in the
House, met with President Clinton last week to emphasize ''the
seriousness of the matter,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two leading Democrats reportedly raised concerns that if
gasoline prices are not reined in, it could mean trouble for both
Al Gore's presidential bid and for Democratic efforts to regain
control of the House in November. States such as Illinois,
Wisconsin and Michigan, where gas prices have eclipsed $2 a gallon,
are pivotal states in the election.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans have lost no time in trying to tar the
administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson -- already under attack because of
security problems at the Los Alamos nuclear weapons lab -- for the
gasoline price surge.
</P>
<P>
	   ''This is the kind of thing people get made about and they want
action,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said the EPA, in areas
hit by major price increases such as Chicago and Milwaukee, should
lift its requirement that they use cleaner gasoline. ''Working
families are bearing the brunt of the EPA's inaction,'' declared
Hastert.
</P>
<P>
	   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said there is ''no
legitimate reason'' for the high gasoline prices and rejected
suggestions that the EPA's requirement for cleaner fuel in areas
with severe summer ozone problem is to blame.
</P>
<P>
	   ''That's an argument that just doesn't stand the test of
logic,'' Lockhart insisted. The EPA has said the cleaner gasoline
should have added 3 to 8 cents to the cost of a gallon of fuel.
Since the oil companies have known of the new requirements for more
than a year, they should have been prepared, the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Trade Commission, at the administration's request,
has begun an informal inquiry into whether there has been illegal
price gouging and collusion.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Gore cited huge profits by oil companies this year
and called for expanding the investigation beyond the Midwest. On
Tuesday, Gore suggested his call already may have had an impact,
saying, ''Some prices came down today by several cents.''
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a former oilman now running for
president, stepped carefully around the price gouging issue,
saying, ''I think it's important to find out whether it's true or
not. I'd like to know all of the facts.''
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said the price differential between conventional
gasoline and the cleaner burning fuel -- about a third of the
gasoline sold -- has no justification.
</P>
<P>
	   ''The oil companies, the refining companies need to explain ...
why prices are so high ... when (the cleaner gas) costs a few
pennies to produce,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ed Murphy at the American Petroleum Institute, the industry
trade group, said there are ''clearly defined reasons'' for the
higher prices including difficulties in blending corn-based ethanol
for the cleaner gasoline, tight gasoline supplies, several problems
with pipelines and the fact that oil prices have been climbing.
</P>
<P>
	   He insisted in an interview that there is no basis for charges
that oil companies are in collusion and involved in improper
pricing activities.
</P>
<P>
	   Administration officials, meanwhile, are guardedly optimistic
that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries oil
ministers will decide Wednesday to boost production and that such a
move will send a signal that will ease the gasoline price crunch.
</P>
<P>
	   ''We've made our views known and our views are that OPEC should
keep an open mind to production increases,'' said Richardson,
declining to suggesting any amounts. It has been reported that the
ministers are considering a daily production increase of 500,000 to
1 million barrels.

<HEADLINE> SUNY board approves $1.7 billion state university budget  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The State University of New York board
approved a budget Tuesday calling for its 64 campuses to spend $1.7
billion in the next year, and projecting that enrollment will climb
by 3,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   The budget contains a state funding increase of $80 million
allocated by Gov. George Pataki and the state Legislature as part
of the 2000-01 state budget they agreed to in May.
</P>
<P>
   Among the larger funding increases planned in the next year are
$23.6 million for raises for faculty members, $12 million for
community colleges and $5 million to improve academic quality by
studying campuses' educational missions.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY trustees said 372,443 students were enrolled at SUNY
campuses in the 1999-2000 school year and expect that number to
climb to about 375,500 in 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also concludes a three-year phase-in of a plan to
allow campuses in the system to retain all revenues they generate.
That plan, designed to make campuses more innovative and
self-sufficient, will mean $16.8 million more in tuition dollars
for campuses, according to SUNY Chancellor Robert King.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the union representing SUNY faculty, William
Scheuerman of United University Professions, continued Tuesday to
oppose the system's adoption of the system of letting campuses
retain the revenues they generate.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that will make weak campuses weaker and bring the
stronger, more popular campuses in direct competition with others
in the same system for students.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under the university's budget system, which has been renamed
for the third year in a row, the result remains the same as before:
Most SUNY campuses are left underfunded and shortchanged,''
Scheuerman said.
</P>
<P>
   The union had proposed putting an additional $9.3 million into
funding at the system's campuses.
</P>
<P>
   King fired back that the union's critique of the SUNY budget is
''simply a rehash of arguments lost years ago about campus
budgeting.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The UUP proposal would recreate the old system which
discouraged excellence,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Scheuerman also complained that the SUNY board failed to adopt a
plan to erase a $116 million shortfall at its teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The SUNY trustees approved the financial plan Tuesday at a
meeting at the College at Old Westbury on Long Island.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States repeated its support for
Taiwan-China talks without commenting directly on a new appeal for
a summit by President Chen Shui-bian in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   At his first news conference since his inauguration a month ago,
Chen said Tuesday that the time was right for a first-ever summit
with the mainland.
</P>

   Asked later Tuesday whether the United States would endorse a
summit, State Department spokesman Richard A. Boucher said: ''Our
view, as we've said before, and I'll say it again now, is that we
strongly support a resumption of the cross-strait dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the United States is ''committed to promoting
peace, stability and prosperity'' in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is up to Beijing and Taipei to determine the basis for the
dialogue and the modalities for the dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will encourage a
summit when she goes to Beijing later this week, Boucher said
''she'll discuss cross-strait development certainly ... and
reiterate our view that the sides should resume their direct
dialogue.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers promise to push for lower prescription prices  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Lawmakers who pushed a bill through the
General Assembly expanding the state's prescription drug program
say they're still fighting to lower drug prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're engaged in a different kind of drug war,'' Rep.
Christopher Donovan, D-Meriden, said Tuesday. ''People here are
committed to making sure that the senior citizens and every citizen
has the ability to receive the medication they need when the time
is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   A bill passed Monday by the House and Senate would allow about
100,000 low-income people to join a prescription program called
ConnPACE B. The original ConnPace program now covers about 30,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   The ConnPACE program is available only to individuals making
less than $14,200 or couples earning up to $17,100. Under the new
legislation, couples earning about $40,000 would be allowed to
enroll in ConnPACE B.
</P>
<P>
   Those people would have to pay an enrollment fee, but would save
up to 30 percent off the cost of prescription drugs. The enrollment
fee and discount rates still have to be set, and there would be no
co-payment requirements.
</P>
<P>
   While ConnPACE B passed the Legislature, a measure to expand
eligibility for people in the original ConnPACE program was
defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Amann, D-Milford, said he and other lawmakers will
try next year to get more people enrolled in the first ConnPACE
program, which charges a $25 joining fee and a $12 co-payment for
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are people who should be in that program but don't
qualify now because of their income level,'' Amann said. ''We want
to increase eligibility by raising the income caps.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edith Prague, D-Columbia, said she and others lawmakers
plan to introduce legislation next year which would force
pharmaceutical companies to sell medication to the state at a
deeper discount or face price controls. The proposal will be
modeled after a similar law in Maine, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are people in this state who simply cannot afford to buy
prescription drugs anymore,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While Prague said pharmaceutical companies are entitled to make
a profit, she also said they have a ''social responsibility'' to
charge reasonable prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies say price control will only hurt the people
who need medication, and insist rising drug prices should be
reigned in under federal law instead of state statutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Price control laws don't take into account the rapid surge in
cost of research and development,'' said Jeff Trewhitt, a spokesman
with the Washington, D.C.-based Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, which represents Pfizer and some other
Connecticut drug producers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal government needs to expand its drug coverage
instead of having states set price controls,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Government proposes plan to combat predatory lending  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The government, citing growing abuses by some
mortgage lenders, is proposing that companies making high-cost
loans be required to give borrowers more accurate data on costs and
terms.
</P>
<P>
   A report on so-called predatory lending released Tuesday by the
departments of Treasury and Housing and Urban Development also
recommends legislation to ban practices such as loan ''flipping''
and to restrict prepayment penalties. In flipping, lenders
constantly refinance mortgage loans to generate fees for brokers,
with little benefit to the borrower.
</P>
<P>
   The report warned that predatory lending, in which companies
seek low-income and minority borrowers and charge them what are
considered unfairly high interest rates and fees, jeopardizes
recent gains in revitalizing neighborhoods and expanding home
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ''For millions of Americans, a home is the sole financial
asset,'' said Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who appeared
with HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo at a news conference. ''Predatory
lending ... blights our nation's cities and rural areas.''
</P>
<P>
   A task force of the two agencies ''learned about some practices
that are clearly abusive'' during recent public hearings across the
country, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the consequences for the borrowers - especially
losing their homes in foreclosure - have been ''disastrous,'' it
says.
</P>
<P>
   ''In many neighborhoods, these abusive practices threaten to
erode the enormous progress that has been made over the past
several years in revitalizing neighborhoods and expanding home
ownership,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommends:
</P>
<P>
   -Lenders should be required to recommend home mortgage
counseling to people applying for high-cost loans.
</P>
<P>
   -Mortgage brokers should be required to demonstrate the
appropriateness of a loan for an applicant.
</P>
<P>
   -Lump-sum credit life insurance should be banned on all mortgage
loans.
</P>
<P>
   The high-cost mortgage loans, while legal, have increasingly
drawn criticism. Democratic lawmakers in April proposed legislation
aimed at curbing predatory lending by limiting to 3 percent of a
loan the total amount of points, fees and prepayment penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has endorsed the proposal, but a lack
of Republican support weakens its prospects for passage by the
GOP-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The task force heard many complaints from consumer advocates and
individuals about ''aggressive door-to-door solicitation that
prompts some borrowers who never would have sought loans on their
own initiative'' to agree to mortgages with ''oppressive'' terms,
the report says.
</P>
<P>
   An example of such terms is the case of an 84-year-old widow
from Rochester, N.Y., who was persuaded by salesmen to buy more
than $20,000 in new windows. Under the loan, she would have to pay
more than $72,000 over 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The financing deal, secured by a mortgage on her $50,000 home,
was signed at the hospital where she was medicated and recovering
from a stroke and breast cancer. Her home is in foreclosure.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists, shippers at odds over Delaware River project  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - On the surface, it seems like the most
boring of issues - river muck. But a plan to deepen the Delaware
River has emotions running high because it's really about health,
the environment, jobs and money.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, with the backing of the
Delaware River Port Authority, plans to deepen 108 miles of the
river to 45 feet, from its current depth of 40 feet. That will
allow ships to carry more cargo - from fruit to paper products to
oil - to the Port of Camden and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The port authority and shippers say this is crucial to keep the
East coast's largest port open and to continue to attract ships.
But environmentalists say the project is unnecessary, wasteful and
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Several congressmen from New Jersey have asked the federal
government's General Accounting Office to investigate the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Many cargo ships, when fully loaded, draw too much water to
enter the Delaware River. They stop in the Delaware Bay and unload
some of their cargo onto smaller vessels, which bring it up the
river.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we have a deeper river, we dramatically decrease that,''
said Joe Diemer, spokesman for the Delaware River Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The project would deepen the river from its mouth at the
Delaware Bay to Camden and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Diemer said shipping companies are demanding that they be able
to send full ship loads up the river.
</P>
<P>
   The shipping companies, as they have at other ports, have
threatened to take their cargo elsewhere if the river isn't
deepened, which would affect the 54,000 jobs that are related to
the port, Diemer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are more jobs associated with the port here than in
other port areas because so much of what moves in and out of here
moves on trucks,'' he said. ''When a fruit ship comes in, there are
hundreds of trucks lined up to take the fruit and get it to
supermarkets. The same with steel and other cargoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar threats were made by shippers using the ports of Newark
and Elizabeth. A project is under way to deepen the Kill Van Kull
and Newark Bay channels, which lead to the ports.
</P>
<P>
   But a coalition of environmental groups, led by the Delaware
Riverkeeper Network, has been working to stop the Delaware River
project.
</P>
<P>
   The groups maintain that the deepening project would not benefit
shippers because new container ships being built to carry more
cargo require a depth of at least 50 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Going to 45 feet gets you nothing,'' said Maya van Rossum,
executive director of the Riverkeeper Network.
</P>
<P>
   But Rich DeGennaro, chairman of the board of the Maritime
Exchange for the Delaware River and Bay, which represents shippers
and terminal operators, said the ''super-modern'' ships that draw
50 feet will not be ''calling on the Port of Philadelphia anytime
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We think 45 feet is a realistic goal for us at this time. It
will accommodate more of the modern ships than 40 feet will, but
not necessarily the super-modern ships,'' DeGennaro said.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental network also says that in order for the six
oil companies on the Delaware to accommodate the more deeply loaded
ships that could navigate a 45-foot deep channel, they would have
to deepen their own berths. Only two have committed to doing that.
</P>
<P>
   DeGennaro said that's not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that when the channel is deepened, that they will all
ultimately find that the economics are compelling to deepen their
berths,'' he said, adding that they've been ''reluctant to commit
funds when it's still not clear that the deepening of the channel
is going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Riverkeeper Network also says that by stirring up sediment,
toxins at the river bottom will be disturbed and could harm sea
life and groundwater.
</P>
<P>
   ''We might be getting ourselves into real trouble, threatening
peoples' drinking water supplies, threatening the recovering oyster
population and reintroducing toxins into the food chain,'' said van
Rossum.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps says levels of toxins in the river sediment are
not high enough to damage the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority, Diemer said, won't do anything that will
cause environmental harm. ''That's an absolute given,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also at issue is what to do with the 22 million cubic yards of
sediment that would be dredged. Plans call for it to be used to
restore beaches along the river and Delaware Bay in Delaware and
New Jersey, Diemer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority also is negotiating with companies that want
the material, which can be used for highway fill and construction
projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority also is exploring using the material to fill
some abandoned mines in Pennsylvania, Diemer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps will store any contaminated material in a secure
landfill, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Army Corps of Engineers can begin the project, it
must sign a financial agreement with the Port Authority. Ed Voigt,
spokesman for the Army Corps in the Philadelphia district, said
negotiations are in the final phase.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the federal government would fund about
two-thirds of the $311 million project and the Port Authority would
pay about one-third, with contributions from New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   The bill that provides a portion of the funding has been
approved by the House of Representatives and must be considered by
the Senate, said Rich McGrath, spokesman for Sen. Robert
Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps also needs an environmental permit from the state
of Delaware before it can proceed.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Rob Andrews and Torricelli, both D-N.J., have asked
the Government Accounting Office to investigate the project. Reps.
Jim Saxton and Frank LoBiondo, both R-N.J., support the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sagnip, spokesman for Saxton, said the accounting office
has not decided whether it will study the plan.
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey Senate committee has held back a $13 million
funding bill that would have contributed to the deepening project.
Senators said they were concerned about releasing state money as
congressional support for an investigation into the project
increased.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Port Authority and shippers are steadfast in
their support of it.
</P>
<P>
   Said Diemer: ''We can't compete in the 21st century with a
shipping channel that dates back to World War II.''

<HEADLINE> No verdict after first full day of deliberations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - The jurors considering the federal tax
case against Albert Pirro, husband of the Westchester district
attorney, spent Tuesday closeted with a mountain of evidence,
emerging only when they announced they were done for the day.
</P>
<P>
   In their first full day of deliberations, the jurors offered few
clues about their thinking. They asked for extra copies of the
indictment and for help finding Albert Pirro's appointment
calendars and some tax returns among the thousands of documents at
their disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro and his brother Anthony, who was his accountant, are
accused of cheating on Albert Pirro's taxes by hiding income and
taking improper business deductions for personal items, ranging
from veterinarian bills to a $123,000 Ferrari. Tax agents used the
appointment calendars to help decide whether expenses were
business-related.
</P>
<P>
   The jury issued one note at about 4:45 p.m., which brought the
defendants, their lawyers and their wives - including District
Attorney Jeanine Pirro - scurrying into the courtroom. But it
amounted to a request to be dismissed for the day, which Judge
Barrington Parker granted.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanine Pirro said afterward that the wait for the verdict was
not nerve-racking because ''My work keeps me busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Pirro, too, said the wait is ''not going to be the
greatest challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got my family, I've got God and I've got my friends,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations are scheduled to resume at 9 a.m. Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> ABC Slips in Ratings  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Survivor'' continues to build as the
television event of the summer, but there were enough NBA
basketball fans to give NBC a weekly win in the prime-time ratings
race.
</P>
<P>
   The two NBA Finals games between the Los Angeles Lakers and
Indiana Pacers were among the 10 most popular shows last week,
Nielsen Media Research said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For the second week in a row, ''Survivor'' was the most-watched
program among viewers aged 18-to-34, normally an audience the
older-skewing CBS has a lot of trouble reaching.
</P>
<P>
   Viewership for the reality show with strangers marooned on a
tropical island has grown each of the three weeks it has been on
the air. Without competition from either ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' or the NBA Finals this week, the numbers are expected
to increase again.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' also had its own ratings ''halo effect.'' The CBS
movie that followed it on the air June 14, ''Addicted to Love,''
finished among the week's top 10 shows.
</P>
<P>
   The reality TV genre is also doing well in a completely
unexpected place. PBS said preliminary ratings for ''The 1900
House'' during its first two weeks on the air were double what the
public broadcasting system normally gets in prime-time. The show
follows a British family that volunteered to live in a house
equipped only with appliances from a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 1900 House'' drew an average of 6 million viewers for its
two airings, PBS said.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, NBC had an average of 10.47 million viewers in
prime-time (7.3 rating, 13 share). CBS had 10.41 million viewers
(7.2, 13), ABC had 9.7 million viewers (6.6, 12) and Fox had 5.9
million viewers (4.0, 7).
</P>
<P>
   UPN, buoyed by the continued strong performance of professional
wrestling, had 3.5 million viewers (2.3 rating, 4 share), the WB
had 2.1 million viewers (1.5, 3) and Pax TV had 1.1 million viewers
(0.9, 2).
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings race with
9.4 million viewers (7.0 rating, 16 share). ABC's ''World News
Tonight'' had 8.6 million viewers (6.5, 15), while the improving
''CBS Evening News'' had 7.8 million viewers (6.0, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of June 12-18, the top 10 shows, their networks and
ratings were:
</P>
<P>
   ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday), ABC, 16.3; ''Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Sunday), ABC, 15.1; ''Survivor,'' CBS,
14.6; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC, 14.5;
''NBA Finals Game 4: L.A. Lakers at Indiana,'' NBC, 13.1; ''48
Hours'' (Monday), CBS, 10.6; ''NBA Finals Game 5: L.A. Lakers at
Indiana,'' NBC, 10.0; ''NBA Finals Tip-Off,'' NBC, 9.0; ''CBS
Wednesday Movie: Addicted to Love,'' CBS, 8.9; ''The Practice,''
ABC, 8.8.

<HEADLINE> Clinton OKs $15 Billion in Farm Aid  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton released a flood of money to
farmers Tuesday, signing a $15 billion package of cash payments and
insurance subsidies that represents the third big bailout of the
agricultural economy in as many years.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation ignored his administration's proposals to
overhaul the market-oriented farm program enacted by the
Republican-controlled Congress in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The bill includes $8.2 billion to expand and cut the cost of
federal crop insurance over the next five years and $5.5 billion
for payments to grain and cotton growers this fall. An additional
$1.6 billion is earmarked for other farmers and lawmakers' special
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the bailout ''was a
clear admission'' that the 1996 farm law ''fails to provide an
effective safety net for American farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   The money is supposed to compensate growers for depressed
commodity prices as well as to encourage farmers to protect
themselves in future years by buying higher levels of crop
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The federal subsidy for the most popular level of insurance will
increase to 59 percent, up from 42 percent, and coverage will be
expanded to crops for which it isn't currently available. The
expansion of the insurance system should lessen the need for
Congress to pass emergency assistance in coming years, USDA
officials said. The changes will take effect for crops planted this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Farmers will have more security to plant. And taxpayers will
have more confidence that their dollars are being well spent,''
said Ken Ackerman, administrator of USDA's Risk Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The $5.5 billion in direct payments that farmers will get in
September will mean an additional $16,000 this year for a 500-acre
corn farm or an extra $12,000 for a farmer who grows 300 acres of
cotton.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman directed his criticism at the way the payments are
being made. Because they go to participants in the1996 farm
program, some of the money will go to growers who didn't plant a
crop this year, Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman had wanted Congress to set up a new subsidy program
that would have targeted assistance to small to medium-scale farms,
but his idea found little support among producer organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also included $500 million for payments to
farmers who grow soybeans and other oilseeds: $340 million in
payments to tobacco farmers, to compensate them for falling
cigarette sales; and $200 million for the government to buy surplus
fruit and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also tucked in money for projects that would benefit
their districts, including a plant genetics research facility in
Santa Fe, N.M., and $14 million to complete construction of an
ethanol research pilot plant at Southern Illinois University.

<HEADLINE> Key Lockerbie Witness Testifies  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- A key witness in the Lockerbie
bombing trial said Tuesday that he manufactured electronic timers
for the Libya's secret service that were similar to the one used to
blow up Pam Am flight 103.
</P>
<P>
   During seven hours of intense questioning before a special
Scottish court in the Netherlands, Swiss businessman Edwin Bollier
of MEBO AG said his company delivered to Libya at least 20 timers,
called the MST13, prior to Dec. 21, 1988, the date of the plane
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the custom-designed piece of electronic
equipment detonated an explosive that blasted a small hole in the
side of the New York-bound jetliner. The plane plunged six miles,
spreading debris over the town of Lockerbie. All 259 passengers and
11 people on the ground were killed.
</P>
<P>
   At the prosecution's request, Bollier peered through a
magnifying glass at a fragment of electronic circuit board used for
timers that was found among the rubble after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like our timer ... but I can't be 100 percent sure,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony came in the case against Libyans Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, who have been charged with
mass murder for the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Bollier first suggested that another company had stolen the
blueprints for the MST13, but later agreed that it was improbable.
</P>
<P>
   Bollier said he personally delivered timers to the Libyan
embassy in former East Germany and gave others to the East German
secret service, the Stasi.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had frequently visited Libya in the mid-1980s, where
he met with one of the accused.
</P>
<P>
   He identified al-Megrahi, describing him as a ''high-ranking
official'' in the Libyan military. ''It's the one without the
glasses,'' he said, pointing to him.
</P>
<P>
   Bollier said he had spent three days with other high-ranking
military officials testing the timers at an isolated military camp
in the Libyan desert near Shiba.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw what these timers were being used for,'' he said. They
were intended for bombs to be dropped from military aircraft and
mechanisms used to destroy abandoned military bases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bollier suggested that the evidence he was shown by prosecutors
on Tuesday had been tampered with since he gave written testimony
to police investigators after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have been modified,'' he said, viewing the piece of
circuit board and an electronic chip found in the wreckage that was
blown across more than 800 square miles of Scotland. ''I swear they
have been modified.''

<HEADLINE> France May Cut Presidential Term  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French lawmakers on Tuesday overwhelmingly adopted
a proposed reform that would cut the presidential term from seven
to five years, the most significant constitutional change in nearly
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would diminish the political weight of France's
most powerful office, but the public seemed unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   Voters, who in recent years have adopted their own way of
neutralizing presidential power, have shown very little interest in
the issue. By contrast, the proposed move has aroused political
passions among both leftists and conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The National Assembly vote was 466 for the proposal and 28
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies from the Communist Party, which has complained that the
issue was not adequately debated, abstained.
</P>
<P>
   The bill will go before the Senate in late September. President
Jacques Chirac then must decide whether to hold a referendum on
changing the constitution or convene a special Congress of both
legislative branches to approve the reform.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac's own party is divided on how to approve the change. Some
party members favor a referendum. Others say a Congress would be
the quickest, surest way to approve the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your vote allows one to hope that this important reform will
take place,'' Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou said in
congratulating parliament for adopting the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the reform could upset the balance that currently
often results in a president of one party serving at the same time
as a government of another. Those in favor of the measure say it
will make for more efficient governing.
</P>
<P>
   French presidents can serve two consecutive terms, or 14 years,
which reform advocates say is too long.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, presidents are elected every seven
years, the parliament every five. In recent years, voters have
tended to sanction sitting presidents by electing a parliament of
the opposing party.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ''cohabitation'' serves as a check to the
president's vast powers by requiring him to serve alongside a
government from the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show that French easily would approve the change
in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The measure has wide support among the Socialists, who hold a
comfortable majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac had opposed the measure, but recently also came out in
favor of it.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the new presidential term would take effect
following presidential elections in 2002.

<HEADLINE> ABC News Out of Campaign Pool  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC News has pulled out of a pool arrangement
where three networks had shared camera coverage of Vice President
Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, citing cost concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The network, whose executives outlined political plans at a news
conference Tuesday, said the withdrawal did not indicate the
commitment to follow the campaign had lessened.
</P>
<P>
   ABC had joined with CBS and Fox News Channel to share camera
coverage of the campaign. But with interest in the candidates at an
ebb now and relatively few public appearances, ABC found it wasn't
worth the expense, spokeswoman Su-Lin Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is using its own cameras to cover some events and relying on
affiliate stations for others, she said. The network currently has
just one producer, without a correspondent or camera crew,
traveling full-time with each candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Withdrawing from the pool means ABC could miss a breaking news
event. It was unclear whether the network would rejoin the pool
later in the campaign or rely on its own resources, Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's by no means a lack of commitment to cover the campaign,''
said Marc Burstein, ABC executive producer. ''It's an increase in
the commitment to cover the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC said Tuesday it has invited Gore and Bush to participate in
a one-on-one televised conversation shortly after Labor Day. The
network said it wanted as little participation as possible from a
moderator so the event doesn't look like a formal debate.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the probable Democratic and Republican presidential
candidates have only agreed to participate in three fall debates
sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. ABC News
President David Westin said he hoped ABC's unusual idea would
appeal to them.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can have them talk to each other directly, it will
become less adversarial and less debate-like,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns keep such tight control on all aspects of personal
appearances that Westin's idea might be a tough sell, ABC anchor
Peter Jennings said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they would accept an empty room with merely them
in it,'' Jennings said. Still, he said ''there are ways to do that
where the facilitator can be a shadow rather than a player.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Texas governor said Bush, who debated 12
times during his primary campaign, will likely debate Gore but
nothing has been set. Ari Fleischer noted many organizations have
submitted proposals, and ABC also has asked for a debate to be
televised on ''This Week''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign did not immediately return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Westin also said the network may legally challenge
the Federal Communications Commission if it is not permitted to run
lengthy profiles of Bush and Gore this fall without offering equal
time to minor party candidates for president.
</P>
<P>
   The network wants to run prime-time profiles modeled somewhat
after A&AMP;E's ''Biography'' series. But Westin said its lawyers are
worried that the FCC will argue that ABC should do the same for Pat
Buchanan, Ralph Nader and other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   FCC spokesman Bobby Baker said the commission has given
television networks several exemptions to the equal time rules to
fit their formats. By coincidence, on Tuesday the FCC ruled that
''Biography'' would not be subject to the rules.

Prescription Bill Caught in Politics   
An AP News Analysis
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Partisan maneuvering is ascendant in Congress'
struggle over prescription drug insurance for Medicare recipients,
clouding prospects for a compromise that could reach President
Clinton's desk in the current campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is imperative that Republicans hang together on this issue
and pass a bill,'' pollster Glen Bolger recently advised the House
GOP rank and file. ''It is helpful if we can be bipartisan in our
approach,'' according to his script, a copy of which has circulated
widely in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   By Bolger's accounting, the issue is a critical one for swing
groups in the fall elections, including rural residents and several
categories of women voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Message: I care, (but say it better than that)'' Bolger
instructed Republicans last week. ''It is more important to
communicate that you have a plan as it is to communicate what is in
the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, Republicans are following the script. They've
drafted legislation, enlisted two conservative Democrats to join
them, and declared the result to be a ''House Bipartisan
Prescription Drug Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Passage in the narrowly divided House remains a challenge, and
the GOP leadership's timetable for a vote on the House floor in 10
days is ambitious. There's scattered grumbling about the $40
billion price tag and also about a provision that makes the
government the insurer of last resort in a plan that otherwise
relies on private insurance companies to offer insurance to
Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the GOP leadership can round up the votes for the House
bill, progress in the Senate is unclear. But House Republican
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, say they will have
accomplished a primary political goal: pushing a bill through the
House, and thus permitting the rank and file to tell the voters
they did what they could.
</P>
<P>
   Not if House Democrats can help it.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to regain control of the House for the first time since
they lost it in 1994, they are matching the Republicans move for
move. For them, it's a matter of holding onto their historic
partisan advantage on Medicare -- an edge in the range of 20
percentage points in recent polling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can understand the Republican proposal if we remember their
attitude towards Medicare,'' House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt
said in a statement last week. ''They hate it.
</P>
<P>
   ''They fought its creation and have been trying to do away with
it ever since,'' the Missouri Democrat added, previewing rhetoric
likely to reemerge when the bill comes up for debate.
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans sought bipartisan support for their bill,
Gephardt sought to discourage it, in keeping with his strategic
plan of denying the GOP legislative accomplishments wherever
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democratic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that in a series of private conversations and meetings, the
party leader stressed the need to hang together behind a different
approach for making drug coverage available to Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   This time -- unlike a bill last month to repeal the estate tax,
where dozens of Democrats defected -- only Reps. Collin Peterson of
Minnesota and Ralph Hall of Texas have joined forces with the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gephardt and Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle
journeyed to the White House to join President Clinton in
criticizing the Republican approach. House Democrats have helped
arrange a string of public events, all designed to raise doubts
about the GOP effort.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent came Tuesday, when Public Citizen accused the
pharmaceutical industry of setting up a ''front group'' to air
commercials critical of Clinton's plan to offer prescription drug
insurance as a new benefit under Medicare. Despite the name,
Citizens For Better Medicare, ''they are not citizens and they are
not for better Medicare,'' said Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   And when Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., made a public statement
recently supporting the Republican bill, Democrats pointed out that
his remarks bore an uncanny resemblance to wording proposed by
Bolger, the Republican pollster.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is unsettled in the Senate, Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., told reporters on Tuesday, although lawmakers in
both parties say legislation could yet emerge in the final days of
the congressional session.
</P>
<P>
   But there, too, political imperatives are at work.
</P>
<P>
   Several sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, say
Democrats are eager to bring the issue up quickly -- possibly as an
amendment on unrelated legislation. That would allow them the
chance to place their stamp on a politically important issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bipartisan efforts persist, including one involving Sen. Ron
Wyden, D-Ore., who says a compromise is readily available.
</P>
<P>
   But he, too, received a call recently from Gephardt. The
message, Wyden said, was ''set the bar high,'' and avoid
compromising too easily.

<HEADLINE> New tests all negative for mosquito viruses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The latest tests of Connecticut's
mosquitoes and dead birds showed no trace of the West Nile-like
strain of the encephalitis virus, state environmental officials
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquitoes also tested negative for Eastern Equine
Encephalitis, the Department of Environmental Protection reported.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of June 20, 3,995 mosquitoes have been tested from
43 sites statewide. As of June 16, 45 birds tested negative for the
West Nile-like strain of encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquito traps placed by the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment
Station in 73 locations will be collected on a 10-day rotation.
Trapping began June 1 and will continue through early fall.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, New York announced that two crows tested
positive for the West Nile-like strain of the virus. Another crow
tested positive for the virus in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The virus has not caused any human illness in Connecticut, but
last year infected 72 people in New York, killing seven.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T opposes town's plan to ban use of cell phones while driving  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MARLBORO, N.J. (AP) - AT&AMP;T has sent a clear message to Marlboro
officials: the telecommunications giant does not support the
township's proposed ban on the use of cellular phones while
driving.
</P>
<P>
   ''AT&AMP;T opposes any legislation or regulation that restricts our
customers' use of their wireless phones or any law that treats
wireless phones in cars any differently than any other potential
distraction, such as food, drinks, children, pets, radios, CD
players, tapes, shavers and computers,'' wrote Dennis M. Maher,
director of AT&AMP;T's government affairs unit, in a letter dated June
19.
</P>
<P>
   The Township Council is expected to introduce the proposed ban
Thursday. The ordinance would restrict all but police, fire and
emergency personnel from using hand-held cell phones while driving.
Exceptions are made for cell phones that can be operated by
speakerphone or with an earpiece. Violators could face a $200 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Township Council Vice President Barry Denkensohn sponsored the
measure. ''They oppose (the ban) even if the activity causes
accidents?'' he said. ''I just think the letter is preposterous.
It's like a lobbyist's response and I wouldn't have expected
anything different. They're going to promote their products and
don't want any restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Wireless Group has 12 million cell phone customers in the
nation. The number of New Jersey customers was not available, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a matter of affecting business,'' said Kathe
Dominick, spokeswoman for AT&AMP;T Wireless Group.
</P>
<P>
   The company opposes the measure because it believes
municipalities do not have jurisdiction over motor vehicle
regulations, Dominick said. She would not comment, however, on
whether AT&AMP;T would support a state-imposed ban.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is one of 22 states that have proposed such a ban,
but none have been enacted.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimated
that there would be 80 million mobile phone users in the United
States in 2000. Studies suggest more than 85 percent of them use
their phones at least occasionally while driving.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Maher noted that cell phones increase personal
safety and enhance communication between users and their family and
business associates. More than 36 million calls for emergency
services are placed annually with cell phones, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that education not legislation is the answer and we
are committed to enhancing public awareness of the dangers of
distraction and encouraging the responsible use of phones in
cars,'' Maher wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in at least one other municipality agree.
</P>
<P>
   West Paterson officials considered proposing a ban, but decided
instead to create a public education campaign on the dangers of
driving while talking on a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first towns in the nation to adopt a ban on using
cell phones while driving was Brooklyn, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Mary-Jo Banish, assistant clerk for the City Council there, said
about a dozen wireless companies opposed Brooklyn's ban. Some even
sent letters to customers, urging them to voice their opposition at
council meetings. No legal challenges have arisen, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brooklyn's ban was enacted in March 1999, enforcement
did not begin until September. To date, 250 violators were issued
$3 summonses for their infractions.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about safety, not collecting fines,'' said court clerk
Grace Musto.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Closes Above 4,000, Dow Dips  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index closed above 4,000
mark Tuesday, the first time it has breached that level in more
than two months, as investors bought shares of the companies that
are expected to post the strongest earnings growth as the economy
slows down. Blue-chip indicators fell.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's return to the 4,000 mark was the latest milestone
in a gradual recovery from the steep selloff in April that knocked
it as much as 37 percent below its record high.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq has been stuck in a very tight range while
investors have debated whether a slowdown was positive or whether
it would weigh on earnings,'' said William Meehan, chief market
analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. ''Once people decided that tech
companies will continue to do very well, they broke out of that
trading range and have been gathering some nice momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology-focused Nasdaq rose 23.53 to close at 4,013.36.
Trading was fairly volatile, with the index wavering between
positive and negative territory for much of the session.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the rebound of the past four weeks, the Nasdaq remains
20.5 percent below the all-time high of 5,048.62 set March 10.
Still, it is now 26.8 percent above its lowest close of the year --
3,164.55 on May 23.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 122.68 to close at
10,435.16 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 10.05 at
1,475.95.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who had grown leery of technology stocks are now
seeking out some of the biggest names in the sector on the
expectation that those companies will show the strongest profit
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Many technology stocks remain very highly priced relative to
their earnings. But now that rising interest rates have begun
forcing a modest economic slowdown, threatening corporate profits,
investors are focusing on companies whose earnings are growing
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Intel rose $1.813 to $138.313 and PMC-Sierra, a
semiconductor component maker, rose $6.125 to $199.125. Yahoo! rose
$8.938 to $148.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a handful of Nasdaq components sustained sharp losses after
warning that their earnings in the current quarter will miss
analysts' expectations. Gadzoox Networks Inc., a maker of hardware
and software for storage area networks, fell $6.875 to $13.438, a
35 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gains and losses are pairing off in this market,'' said Larry
Lawler, manager of equity trading at Dreyfus Corp. in New York.
''There's been no real catalyst to send the market one way or the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said many of the younger, less-proven companies on the
Nasdaq have not recovered from the springtime selloff, and aren't
likely to do so as investors apply tougher standards to the
technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   ''The selloff showed us that there are some junk companies, and
they are pretty much remaining junk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dow component Honeywell International continued paying a price
for its announcement Monday that second-quarter earnings will miss
analysts' expectations. Honeywell said it is struggling with high
interest rates and higher-than-expected raw material prices in its
performance materials unit.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, its shares fell $3.875 to $36.375.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors fell $2.813 to $62.063, adding to the Dow's
declines. North American chief Ronald Zarrella told journalists and
financial analysts Tuesday that profit margins this year will not
reach GM's goal of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram fell $5.688 to $58.063 after French utilities and media
conglomerate Vivendi said it will buy the company in an all-stock
transaction that initially valued Seagram at $77.35 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Shoe company Steve Madden Ltd. fell $1.938 to $11.188 on the
Nasdaq. Owner Steven Madden was arrested Tuesday on charges that he
conspired to manipulate the value of his company during its initial
public offering in the stock market. Madden said he is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.23 billion shares,
ahead of Monday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.92 from
Monday's revised close to 525.69.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.9 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 0.4 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
rose 0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 gained 0.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Media Baron: Putin Ordered Arrest  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Three nights in a dingy jail cell were enough to
convince media baron Vladimir Gusinsky that Russia is threatened by
police state tendencies under President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   In a first public appearance after being released, Gusinsky said
Tuesday he believes Putin personally ordered his detention, and
said his time in jail last week led him to fear a return to
Soviet-style repression of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has denied any prior knowledge of the arrest, which has
been interpreted as a crackdown on press freedoms. He said
prosecutors acted independently according to Russian law.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prison is a special world, and I really wouldn't like the
country I live in to turn into this world,'' Gusinsky said on the
political talk show Glas Naroda on the NTV network, which is part
of his Media-Most Group.
</P>
<P>
   NTV is Russia's largest independent television network and has
been critical of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure that Putin knew, and moreover, the president
personally made the decision (to arrest). I am certain,'' Gusinsky
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky was arrested last Tuesday in a two-year-old fraud case
and imprisoned through Friday in Moscow's rundown Butyrskaya
prison. He was released on condition that he not leave Moscow while
his case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky has been charged with misappropriating property worth
$10 million in connection with a privatization deal. He has denied
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky blamed the episode on vast and arbitrary police powers.
Russia has the highest per capita rate of incarceration in the
world and the second-largest prison population behind the United
States, with about 1 million people behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has vowed to trim the influence of Russia's top
businessmen, who came to be known as ''oligarchs'' under Boris
Yeltsin for their close ties to the government. But analysts say
Putin may be too weak or beholden to some of the oligarchs to go
after them.
</P>
<P>
   Leading tycoon Boris Berezovsky also warned Tuesday of pending
authoritarianism under Putin. Berezovsky had close ties with
Yeltsin's inner circle, but has been increasingly critical of
Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economic course is very liberal, but in the political
sphere we are moving toward a rigid authoritarian system,''
Berezovsky said at an investors' conference in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   He cited Gusinsky's arrest, Putin's plan to strengthen control
over Russia's provinces, and the continuing war in breakaway
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Moscow court on Tuesday refused to consider a
complaint from Gusinsky's lawyers that his arrest and detention
were illegal because he qualified for an amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   A recently passed bill provided amnesty from arrest or
imprisonment for holders of state medals and orders. Gusinsky has a
Friendship of Peoples order.
</P>
<P>
   The court rejected the complaint, saying there was no foundation
for it because the tycoon was no longer in police custody, his
lawyer Genri Reznik said.
</P>
<P>
   Reznik said he would appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stakes are high. The arrest was absolutely illegal, that's
clear to any person who knows the ABCs of criminal law,'' Reznik
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky, one of Russia's most prominent business leaders, owns
several media outlets -- including NTV television, Echo Moskvy radio
station and Sevodnya newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest on June 13 was met with an international outcry and
accusations of a Kremlin crackdown on the press.
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, the lower house of parliament, the State Duma,
will debate a motion by two liberal factions to send a letter to
Putin demanding that he fire the prosecutor-general, who was
responsible for Gusinsky's arrest.

<HEADLINE> Mass. man charged with fraud for allegedly impersonating Sioux heir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) - A Massachusetts man bilked people out of more than
$200,000 by falsely claiming he was the descendent of a Sioux chief
with access to an enormous trust fund, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Hacker, 34, formerly of Watertown, Newton and Wakefield
was arrested in New York on June 8. An indictment alleging fraud
and other charges was unsealed Tuesday in Boston, U.S. Attorney
Donald K. Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Hacker allegedly defrauded a Boston area investment adviser, a
travel agent and Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. by saying he was incredibly
wealthy but had a short-term cash flow problem.
</P>
<P>
   Hacker told his victims he was the beneficiary of a family trust
worth hundreds of millions of dollars set up in the 1860s by an
ancestor, a former Sioux chief, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   He told his victims he was in the process of gaining access to
the trust and he needed loans for day-to-day expenses, Stern said.
He lured them with counterfeit checks worth millions of dollars
made out to organizations with which the victims were affiliated,
Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities allege Hacker used the money to pay for an
extravagant lifestyle that included limousine rides and stays at
the best hotels in Boston and New York.
</P>
<P>
   He also deposited more than $400,000 in personal checks into a
trading account with Charles Schwab, prosecutors said. The company
executed trades on the account before discovering the checks were
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Hacker faces mail and wire fraud charges that carry a maximum
sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He also faces
false check and counterfeit securities charges that carry a maximum
penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> Assad Nomination Announced in Syria  </HEADLINE>
By HAMZA HENDAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Syria's ruling Baath party nominated
Bashar Assad for president on Tuesday, making it virtually certain
he will succeed his late father as leader of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination will be presented to parliament for endorsement
on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   The 250-seat parliament, where Baathists enjoy a clear majority,
is expected to set a date for a presidential referendum in which
Bashar is likely to be the only candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the closing session of the party's congress, Bashar
Assad vowed that Baath would remain faithful to the principles laid
down by his father, President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
   ''My primary concern will be, as it always has been, to work
diligently to achieve whatever is in the interest of society and
the glory of the nation,'' he said, according to the official
Syrian Arab News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad rejected suggestions that the Baath party, which
has monopolized power since 1963, was becoming antiquated.
</P>
<P>
   ''As you know, I am among those who are very enthusiastic about
technological and economic development, but I categorically reject
this idea ... the ideology and slogans of the party today remain
relevant,'' he told the congress, the party's first in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The congress also elected 20 members to join Bashar on the
party's executive, the Baath's most powerful policy-making body. He
will also be on a 90-member central committee that includes 10
women and several high-ranking army officers.
</P>
<P>
   Other new members elected to the executive are Prime Minister
Mustafa Miro, Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa and Deputy Prime
Minister Naji al-Ateri.
</P>
<P>
   The party reshuffle is part of a carefully laid out script to
pass the leadership mantle to Bashar, a former eye doctor, and to
ensure that the transition is smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar's surprisingly swift ascendancy after Hafez Assad's death
June 10 -- within days he was declared commander of the armed forces
and on Sunday named Baath Party chief -- was evidence of the legacy
left by his father's 30 years in power. Under the elder Assad, the
regime showed zero tolerance for dissent or the questioning of
decisions made at the top -- or even suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the country's propaganda machine is elevating the
34-year-old political novice to the status of accomplished leader,
with thousands of Bashar posters and banners declaring him the
nation's future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. Bashar Assad is an embodiment of a promising leadership
for a brighter future,'' said the daily Al-Thawra in a banner
headline. ''Absolute loyalty to Gen. Bashar Assad, leader of the
march of the people and the party,'' read the front-page headline
in Al-Baath, the party's mouthpiece.
</P>
<P>
   The English-language Syria Times spoke in an editorial of ''the
limitless extent of public hope pinned on the leadership of Dr.
Bashar and the extent of love and trust he has already acquired.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's top brass and the state-controlled media speak of
Syria's democracy, but diplomats and analysts say the Baath has
largely been used by the regime to create an illusion of popular
political participation, while members -- 1.5 million -- use the
party to win perks, advance their careers or attain coveted jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a heritage that must be revised and the new leadership
must disassociate the party from the security agencies, which are
the real tools of power in Syria,'' said Hassan Abu Taleb, a Syria
expert with Egypt's Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Sadiq J. Al-Azm, a prominent Syrian philosophy professor, says
that among Bashar's top priorities will be modernizing the economy,
saddled by an unproductive and large public sector, inefficient tax
collection and massive defense spending.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers open new front in battle against online casinos  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - In a new effort against Internet gambling,
lawmakers are proposing to choke off the ability of online casinos
to collect bets through the most common methods of transferring
money: credit cards, checks or electronic funds transfers.
</P>
<P>
   The measure opens a second front in what is proving to be a
tricky battle against Internet gambling, which has proliferated
into a billion-dollar industry.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Treasury Secretary Gregory Baer told the House Banking
Committee on Tuesday that the proposal is an ''innovative''
approach to combating Internet gambling. But he cautioned that
advances in electronic commerce could give the industry new methods
to collect money.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any legislation restricting how people are going to get paid
in the future is going to be very difficult,'' Baer said. ''We are
seeing a revolution in payment in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, the committee chairman, said the bill
would complement a separate measure, passed in the Senate and
pending in the House, to extend to the Internet the current federal
ban on gambling over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   That measure has been stalled numerous times by disputes over
enforcement and exemptions. Enforcement is difficult because many
companies that run virtual casinos are based outside the United
States. And advocates of pari-mutuel betting on horse racing, dog
racing and jai alai won exemptions in the bill, prompting the
Treasury and Justice departments to oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   It took little time for similar disputes to arise on the first
day of hearings on Leach's bill, which he introduced with the
ranking Democrat on the banking committee, Rep. John LaFalce of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Ingle, executive vice president of the New York Racing
Association, said the bill as written would cripple the horse
racing industry by stopping off-track betting.
</P>
<P>
   And Assistant Treasury Secretary Gregory Baer took issue with
the bill's proposal to restrict U.S. funding to countries that
allow a ''high level'' of Internet gambling. Baer said that step
would interfere with efforts to reduce poverty and grow economies
in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Baer said the bill still could work, if credit card companies
can be persuaded to identify Internet gambling operators and cut
off payments to them.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., wondered aloud, ''If you don't
have enforcement, how do you have legislation?''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of online gambling, combined with the reach of
the Internet into homes around the world, are challenging the
ability of states to determine exactly what forms of gambling, if
any, should be legal.
</P>
<P>
   The River City Group, a consulting group for the online gambling
industry, said in a recent report that gambling is offered by
nearly 700 Internet sites operated by 200 different companies or
government entities. The report projected that Internet gambling
will grow from $1.1 billion in 1999 to $3 billion in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for explosive growth in gambling over home
computers alarmed the National Gambling Impact Study Commission,
which recommended in its report last year that Congress outlaw
Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing will give gambling, in my judgment, the power that the
Internet will,'' said Richard Leone, a former New Jersey state
treasurer and member of the gambling study commission, who
testified in support of the Leach-LaFalce bill.

<HEADLINE> 'Big Brother' Contestants Face Fame  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''Big Brother'' contestants, here's the bad
news: While you're stuck in a house for three months with nine
strangers and 28 cameras for the CBS series, booze will be strictly
rationed.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, however, is that surrendering your privacy could
lead to pop stardom. Three European contestants have sold more than
3 million compact discs, the series' producers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Unveiling the American ''Big Brother'' house newly built on a
studio parking lot, CBS Television President Leslie Moonves and the
Dutch producers said they are nearing selection of the 10 ''house
guests'' and equal number of alternates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in the process of .... finding out which combination of
persons will give us the most chance of interaction in the house,''
said executive producer Paul Romer.
</P>
<P>
   The choices could be made within the next day, but the
contestants' names will be closely guarded until the show debuts
July 5.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really want their identities secret until the moment they
enter the house,'' Romer said, thus allowing them to meet each
other and be introduced to viewers at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Tracked by cameras and 60 microphones throughout the house -- the
bathroom is wired as well, although it will not be shown on the air
-- the contestants and TV audience will gradually expel nine
contestants.
</P>
<P>
   The last person left wins $500,000 but all, apparently, can
expect a measure of fame. Contestants from the Dutch, German and
Spanish shows have been mobbed as celebrities, with three Germans
converting the attention into music careers, the producers said.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, no professional entertainers trying to use
the American show as a platform, Moonves said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody came with a ukulele this time,'' he quipped, referring
to a contestant on the hit CBS show ''Survivor'' who was armed with
the instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Contestants will be denied access to radio, TV and newspapers
and will face rationing of food and alcohol, with small amounts of
beer and wine allowed -- ''Not enough to get drunk,'' Romer said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the five-night-a-week show, contestants will be on
display on the Internet. America Online will provide
round-the-clock video feeds, as well as related chat rooms, message
boards and polling.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about criticism of the show as voyeuristic, Moonves
replied: ''I guess it is voyeuristic TV and I don't think it's
necessarily bad. There is a desire to see this kind of programming.
... There are 500 channels. You don't like it, change the
channel.''

<HEADLINE> New owner gives up on USBL's Atlantic City Seagulls, citing attendance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A plastic surgeon who bought the
Atlantic City Seagulls basketball team last year is throwing in the
towel after one season, citing poor attendance and lack of
community support.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ira Trocki planned to sell or move the team after its final
game Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The team is not going to be in Atlantic City,'' he told The
Press of Atlantic City. ''It's final. Obviously, the community
doesn't care. The community is going to lose the team. You're not
going to have family entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Trocki bought the United States Basketball League team from
owner Ken Gross last November, hoping a move and a new marketing
program would help improve attendance, which averaged 989 per game
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The team opened the season playing at Convention Hall, on the
Boardwalk, drawing 836 on opening night. But poor attendance
prompted Trocki to move the games back to Atlantic City High
School. Recently, attendance has dropped under 100 people a game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought 800 people for the opener was bad, but 100 people?
That's an embarrassment. In this community, the USBL is a
failure,'' Trocki said.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Nixes Foreign Aid Change  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House panel decided Tuesday against changing
the formula for dispersing foreign aid to Israel to protest
Israel's plans to sell China a spy plane.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign
operations approved by voice vote a $13.3 billion foreign aid bill
for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The bill permits the full $2.8 billion in foreign aid to go to
Israel, and to be dispersed early, as is the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Some congressional conservatives have suggested a $250 million
cut to Israel to match the sale price of an Israeli-made advanced
airborne early warning system to China.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House panel, Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala.,
had offered an initial version of the legislation that would not
have allowed any of the $2.8 billion for Israel to be dispersed
early.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan protested both the sale of the AWACS-like spy plane,
and the tradition under which Israel -- the largest single recipient
of American foreign aid -- gets its share up front at the start of
each fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries must wait longer to get the money.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel ought to be ashamed of themselves for doing this, or
putting us in this position,'' Callahan said.
</P>
<P>
   But a proposal by Reps. David Obey, D-Wis., and Jack Kingston,
R-Ga, providing early disbursement for the entire amount passed by
voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   That came after an amendment by Callahan was defeated 9 to 6
that would have allowed all of it but $250 million to go to Israel
early.
</P>
<P>
   The bill next goes to the full House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, meanwhile, also took up its version of the foreign
aid bill late Tuesday, but held no votes. The Senate was to resume
debate on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill in its current from does not seek to penalize
Israel for the proposed radar-system sale to Israel. But some
conservatives, including Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee, have proposed that the fund be
withheld.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Eds: The Senate foreign aid appropriations bill is S 2522. The
House version does not yet have a number.

<HEADLINE> New Jersey beats FEMA audit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey beat its lone Federal Emergency
Management Agency audit over a $183,000 underwater cable.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Transit had requested a total of $4.8 million to
repair buildings and damaged equipment after a December 1992
nor'easter.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that included an underwater signal cable near the Jersey
coast that state officials said was damaged by the storm's high
tides.
</P>
<P>
   The cable was used to operate warning signals for train
crossings over a Monmouth County drawbridge.
</P>
<P>
   But FEMA officials contended that the cable was not damaged
during the storm. Agency officials said evidence showed that it was
malfunctioning before the storm. They cited two incidents in July
and August 1992 when the signal failed to work properly.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our opinion the broken wires did not result from the storm,
but instead from a lack of flexibility of the cable,'' FEMA
officials wrote in their audit.
</P>
<P>
   The state appealed the audit and won, according to Michael
Klufas, NJ Transit spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end, what they said was that we were correct in saying
it was storm-related damage,'' said Klufas. ''They withdrew the
audit. We owe them nothing.''

<HEADLINE> Peru Opposition Leader Demands Vote  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Unsuccessful presidential candidate Alejandro
Toledo reiterated his demand for new elections Tuesday after
meeting with a delegation from the Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said he stressed the opposition's position for ''the need
to convene new free, clean elections, supervised by the OAS.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo boycotted the May 28 presidential runoff, claiming it was
rigged in favor of President Alberto Fujimori, who won an
unprecedented third five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation, led by Peter Boehm, Canada's permanent
representative to the OAS, arrived here Monday to lay the
groundwork for a visit next week by OAS Secretary General Cesar
Gaviria and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
   An OAS election mission refused to monitor last month's runoff
vote, saying the election was ''far from what could be considered
free or fair.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 34-member nations later rejected calls from the United
States to question Fujimori's win or consider collective sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the OAS is sending Gaviria and Axworthy on June 27 to
work with the government and the opposition to strengthen
democratic institutions.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama Seeks Help From Congress  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual
leader, said Tuesday that he was open to talks with Chinese
leaders, and he asked members of Congress to help initiate them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyplace, anytime, I am willing to meet with China leadership
without preconditions,'' the Dalai Lama said.
</P>
<P>
   China opposes autonomy for Tibet and sees the Dalai Lama as a
rallying point for pro-independence forces. Officials have refused
to meet with him.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama was invited to Capitol Hill by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to
discuss his relationship with the U.S. government and the future
political status of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton joined the Dalai Lama
during most of his 40-minute meeting with National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger. Clinton expressed support for the Dalai Lama's
continuing effort to encourage dialogue with China. The White House
said he also underscored the United States' strong support of
Tibetans' human rights and their religious and cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we have not seen progress up to now, we haven't given up
hope. We're going to continue to work hard,'' White House spokesman
P.J. Crowley said. ''We continue to press (China) at every
high-level opportunity we have, about its importance.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the meeting, the Dalai Lama gave the president a
hug and the Dalai Lama presented the president with a white scarf
called a hada, Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about a World Bank proposal to move 58,000 Chinese and
Muslims into Tibetan lands, he said, ''Under the present
circumstances this would be the source of more problems. Therefore
it is not the right time.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the opportunity comes, as a Buddhist monk, it is my sole
responsibility to help them, to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 with thousands of supporters
after a failed revolt against Chinese rule. From his headquarters
at Dharmsala, in northern India, he has headed a nonviolent
struggle for Tibetan autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   His U.S. trip also will take him to California. He planned to
return to Washington for Independence Day weekend to participate in
the Smithsonian Institution's Folklife Festival.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Kill Russian Soldier  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUDERMES, Russia (AP) -- Rebels bands tried to storm a key
Russian administration center here, pouring in from surrounding
hills overnight Tuesday and drawing federal troops into scattered
battles, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting erupted in half a dozen spots on the outskirts of
Gudermes, the city that houses the Russian administration in
Chechnya, as rebels apparently tried to break into the city center
and seize government offices, said officials with the Russian
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were forced to fire artillery guns to repel the
insurgents, the officials said on condition of anonymity. However,
the fighting appeared confined to the outskirts and central
Gudermes remained quiet. There was no word on casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The raids emphasized how weak the Russians' hold is over the
two-thirds of Chechnya they claim to control. The two sides have
been at a standoff for weeks, apparently unwilling to risk a major
confrontation. But small groups of rebels have faced little
resistance penetrating Russian lines and ambushing federal troops
and pro-Russian Chechen officials.
</P>
<P>
   The overnight clashes came hours before the man Moscow recently
installed as Chechnya's top civilian official, Islamic leader Mufti
Akhmad Kadyrov, arrived in Gudermes to begin work.
</P>
<P>
   Kadyrov's appointment, announced June 12, was resented by both
Kremlin supporters and rebel leaders in Chechnya. Many Chechens
consider Kadyrov, who fought on the rebels' side during the 1994-96
Chechen war and now cooperates with the Kremlin, a turncoat.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's top spokesman on Chechnya, Sergei Yastrzhembsky,
said Tuesday that Moscow would not reconsider the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Kadyrov was officially introduced to his staff
Tuesday, 43 administrative officials resigned in protest, the
Interfax news agency reported. Many of them had threatened
resignation earlier in response to Kadyrov's appointment.
</P>
<P>
   In another of several attacks across Chechnya, rebels killed a
Russian soldier and wounded two others in an ambush Monday night on
a checkpoint in the capital Grozny, Interior Ministry officials
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops on Tuesday continued shelling suspected rebel
positions in Chechnya's southern mountains. But rain and fog
grounded Russian jets, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have been depending on their overwhelming firepower
to battle the rebels, while the insurgents have favored hit-and-run
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has forced more than 200,000 of Chechen civilians
to flee their homes, most of them seeking shelter in the
neighboring Russian region of Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia lost control of Chechnya after independence fighters
expelled Russian forces in 1996. The troops re-entered last
September after Islamic militants based there seized several
villages in the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan, and after
about 300 people died in apartment bombings the government blames
on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Whitman's sixth Supreme Court appointee sworn in  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Two governors praised him. So did attorneys
general past and present.
</P>
<P>
   During his turn at the podium Tuesday, James R. Zazzali said the
time had come to end the high talk.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first thing I have to do here is put aside the nice things
said today and recognize I have a responsibility here,'' the newest
member of the New Jersey Supreme Court said.
</P>
<P>
   That duty is to do justice for the people of New Jersey, Zazzali
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To render a right and fair decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After his swearing in ceremony at Trenton's War Memorial,
Zazzali became Gov. Christie Whitman's sixth appointee and the
third former attorney general she has named to the state Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   At 63, the Rumson resident is also Whitman's oldest appointee.
He will likely retire before his seven-year term expires. He
replaces Associate Justice Daniel O'Hern, who reached the mandatory
retirement age of 70 on May 23.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali joins Chief Justice Deborah Poritz and Associate Justice
Peter G. Verniero, all former attorneys general nominated by
Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's other appointments to the high court are associate
justices Virginia Long, Jaynee LaVecchia and James Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time this year, Poritz bid goodbye to a member of
her court before welcoming another.
</P>
<P>
   ''He taught us by example to speak with strength and dignity,''
Poritz said of O'Hern. ''He defined us at our best.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman praised Zazzali for his intelligence and integrity as
well as for his humility and sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he is ready for the challenge that now confronts
him,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali was an assistant prosecutor when former Gov. Brendan T.
Byrne was the Essex County prosecutor. Byrne later named Zazzali
his attorney general in 1981. Zazzali also served as general
counsel to the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority under
Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody needs testimonials for Jim Zazzali,'' Byrne said. ''He
is a student of the law. He is just the right person to join the
Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the chief justice, the six associate justices are
supposed to be evenly split, three Republicans and three Democrats.
Because O'Hern is a Democrat, tradition holds that he be replaced
with someone from the same party.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali was a commissioner on the State Commission of
Investigation from 1984 to 1994, including a period as chairman.
The SCI is an independent office created by the Legislature to
examine and issue written reports on corruption and policy
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman last year named Zazzali to a search committee to find
candidates for state police superintendent. He also headed a
coalition of six former state attorneys general who supported
former Attorney General Peter Verniero's hotly contested nomination
to the high court.
</P>
<P>
   Recently a partner in the Newark law firm Zazzali, Zazzali,
Fagella &AMP; Nowak with his brother, Andrew Zazzali, Zazzali graduated
from Georgetown University in 1958 and earned a law degree there in
1962.
</P>
<P>
   Zazzali said he would dedicate his years on the bench to his
parents. In 1950, Zazzali's father, who was close to President
Harry S. Truman, appeared headed for appointment as a federal
judge.
</P>
<P>
   But the nomination was torpedoed by partisan politics after
Zazzali, then 12 years old, told a reporter his father had Truman's
backing, Zazzali said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He never mentioned the incident to me for the rest of his
life,'' Zazzali said. ''Today represents the vindication of a
father and the redemption of a son.''

<HEADLINE> Fiji Crisis Heads Toward End  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Even if the political standoff in Fiji ends
peacefully, as now appears likely, the South Pacific nation may
still pay a high price for permitting an armed gang to topple a
democratically elected government by taking it hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The country's new military rulers and the gunmen holding the
former government hostage inside parliament entered their third
straight day of negotiations Tuesday to form an interim regime that
would presumably guide the country to elections within two years.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides insist the negotiations are going well, and that the
31 hostages -- including former Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry --
will likely be released within days.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the hostage takers, Jo Nata, told The Associated
Press on Wednesday that ''a preliminary accord has been drafted and
has been gone through by lawyers and all the parties, and could be
signed by this afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nata refused to give a time table for the hostages' release,
saying, ''the release of the hostages is not of importance to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to sack both the prime minister and Fiji's 1997
constitution has caused alarm among those who see it as a triumph
for racism and coup-making.
</P>
<P>
   ''The power of the gun must not be allowed to dictate policy,''
said an editorial Tuesday by The Fiji Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Yet reinstating the deposed prime minister -- the first ethnic
Indian to hold that post in a nation where most people are
indigenous Fijian -- isn't even on the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Fiji's power brokers are haggling over how to implement
the demands of George Speight -- the man who, a year after being
fired by the Chaudhry government as a timber-industry
administrator, led the May 19 armed takeover of parliament amid
widespread looting and street violence.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial of Speight's demands, that political
power be wrested from Fiji's relatively well-off Indian minority,
has been watered down somewhat. On Monday, Speight told reporters
he'd be willing to allow a few Indians in the interim government.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Fiji is already well on its way to pariah status in the
international community, no matter the makeup of a new government
whose legitimacy will likely be questioned from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   The military took control of Fiji and imposed martial law 10
days after Speight's raid. Military commander Commodore Frank
Bainimarama has announced a plan to restore civilian rule by
appointing an interim administration to oversee a recasting of the
constitution and hold elections within two years.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Australia and New Zealand have said they will
slap sanctions on Fiji, a cluster of islands 2,250 miles northeast
of Sydney, Australia, if it does not return to full democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The country is already losing millions of dollars a day in lost
tourism revenue and the refusal by Australian unions to handle
cargo to and from Fiji -- cutting off the country's sizable garment
industry from its principal market.
</P>
<P>
   Just how Fiji, a supposedly idyllic island paradise, descended
into ethnic turmoil is a story of intrigue and intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and his followers said their armed takeover of
parliament was to restore dignity to the Fijian majority, whose
rights, they said, had been trampled upon by an arrogant Chaudhry
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is the country's conflict has as much to do with power
and privilege as Fijian nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Speight is a front man for Fijians who lost their
ability to make sweetheart deals under Chaudhry, especially in the
country's lucrative timber and sugar industries.
</P>
<P>
   Most troubling to Chaudhry opponents was the former prime
minister's refusal to accept higher rents charged to Indian sugar
farmers on land communally owned by indigenous Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's coup might do more harm to the sugar industry than
anything Chaudhry could devise, however. The European Union is
reportedly considering canceling a trade agreement under which it
pays Fiji up to three times the market price for sugar.
</P>
<P>
   And sugar growers, many of whom are sympathetic to Chaudhry, are
boycotting this year's harvest until the hostages are released.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's new public face -- military roadblocks, a dawn-to-dusk
curfew, burnt out and sacked buildings, a refugee camp full of
badgered Indians -- augurs poorly for a quick recovery of the
tourism industry.

<HEADLINE> Bond Denied for Former Army Colonel  </HEADLINE>
By PAT LEISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A former Army officer accused of spying for
the Soviet Union and Russia for 25 years was ordered held without
bond Tuesday after prosecutors disclosed details of videotaped
evidence against him.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said retired Army Reserve Col. George Trofimoff, who
was a civilian intelligence employee, was captured on one tape
putting his hand to his heart and telling an undercover agent
posing as a Russian agent: ''I'm not American in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Trofimoff, 73, the highest-ranking American military officer
ever charged with spying, could face life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Court-appointed attorney Daniel Hernandez argued for bail,
pointing out that Trofimoff has retired to Melbourne, Fla., and
works as grocery store bagger. He also said Trofimoff has no
passport and has suffered a mini-stroke in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. Magistrate Mark A. Pizzo said the government presented
overwhelming evidence and ordered Trofimoff held without bond.
Trofimoff's wife, Jutta, sat behind him at the two-hour hearing and
later refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Trofimoff, born in Germany to Russian emigres, became a
naturalized U.S. citizen in 1951, joined the Army in 1953 and was
honorably discharged three years later, although he rose to colonel
in the reserves. He was hired as a civilian in Army intelligence in
1959.
</P>
<P>
   From 1969 until 1994, Trofimoff was a civilian chief of an Army
installation in West Germany where refugees and defectors from the
Soviet bloc were interrogated.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Terry Furr said Trofimoff collected $300,000 for
photographing volumes of secret U.S. intelligence documents and
giving them to the KGB through a go-between, boyhood friend Igor
Vladimirovich Susemihl, a Russian Orthodox priest.
</P>
<P>
   Furr told the judge the government had a videotape of a six-hour
meeting at a Melbourne hotel in 1999 of an undercover agent and
Trofimoff discussing ''in great detail the entire scope of his work
for the Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Trofimoff allegedly said he would sometimes work overnight
photographing documents. ''He said 'If I had it, you got it,' and
he said it proudly,'' Furr said.
</P>
<P>
   Furr also said Trofimoff told the undercover agent that if he
were ever caught: ''I will swear on a stack of Bibles I didn't do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trofimoff was arrested last week after meeting in Tampa with an
undercover agent who supposedly was to deliver a long overdue
payment for spying during the Cold War.

<HEADLINE> Animal rights groups angry about diving mule  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LACKAWANNA, N.Y. (AP) - Animal rights activists are enraged over
plans to feature a diving mule at an annual summer festival here.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ARA hot line has received a barrage of phone calls from
local citizens embarrassed Lackawanna would choose this event in
the festival,'' said Lori Szewczyk of Animal Rights Advocates of
Western New York.
</P>
<P>
   Szewczyk said many such acts have been cited for poor treatment
of animals and insists the only way the animal would jump is out of
fear.
</P>
<P>
   City recreation director Angelo Iafallo, though, called the
diving mules ''a great attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials said the Tim Rivers World Famous Diving Mule act
has never abused an animal. This year, it will also include a
diving dog and pony.
</P>
<P>
   Szewczyk said her group is considering a protest of the
festival.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mule diving is an unnatural act,'' she said. ''I don't find
that entertaining.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Hate-Crimes Measure  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a furious last-minute lobbying blitz by
the Clinton administration, the Senate voted 57 to 42 on Tuesday to
approve legislation that would make it easier for federal
prosecutors to try hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore interrupted presidential campaigning in
Kentucky to fly to Washington to be ready to cast a deciding vote
should there be a tie in the Republican-controlled chamber.
</P>
<P>
   He presided over the Senate, but his vote wasn't needed.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen Republicans defied their leaders to vote ''yes'' on the
measure. Only one Democrat voted ''no,'' Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton applauded the Senate action. ''This amendment
recognizes that hate crimes are different from other crimes,'' he
said in a statement. ''These crimes affect entire communities and
strike at the heart of our American system of values.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the administration victory, the bill faced an uncertain
future.
</P>
<P>
   The vote attached it as an amendment to a massive defense bill
on which more than 100 amendments were still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the vote, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., put the legislation aside and the Senate turned to other
business. It was not clear when the defense bill would be up again.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the House has rejected such an approach to hate
crimes in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the principal sponsor,
urged colleagues to ''take a clear and unequivocal stand'' for the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would add offenses motivated by sexual
orientation, sex or disability to the list of hate crimes already
covered under a 1968 federal law.
</P>
<P>
   It also would give federal prosecutors the option of pursuing a
hate-crime case if local authorities refused to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters cited the 1998 death in Jasper, Texas, of James Byrd,
a 49-year-old black man, who was dragged behind a pickup truck; and
the death, also in 1998, of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old
homosexual University of Wyoming student, who died after being
beaten into a coma and tied to a fence.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming has no hate-crime law. Texas has one that punishes
crimes committed with bias or prejudice as a motive, but it has
been criticized as too vague and the last attempt to toughen it
failed in the state Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   But critics, including Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, suggested that the bill would infringe on state and
local authorities' law enforcement authority.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch suggested that, under the measure, for instance, all rapes
could be tried as federal hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch offered his own version, calling for a study of whether
states and localities were pursuing hate crime prosecutions, and
providing $5 million a year for the Justice Department to help pay
for such prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also accepted Hatch's amendment, 50-49, then went on
to approve Kennedy's.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore called the vote ''a sign of hope for all of
America'' and had special praise for families of hate-crime
victims. They have waged ''an extraordinary effort to turn their
grief into a challenge for our nation,'' Gore told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about criticism that his return to the Senate was
politically motivated, Gore said, ''It's my job.'' Senate Minority
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., interrupted to add: ''I asked the vice
president to come back because the last time this legislation was
up, it lost by one vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the vote, those on both sides warned that it would be
close. However, in the end, more than enough Republicans joined
Democrats in voting approval.
</P>
<P>
   The vote further bogged down the defense bill, which has now
become a catchall for many pet pieces of legislation. Earlier, a
campaign-finance proposal pushed by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was
added to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Lott suggested that, unless some way was devised to separate the
unrelated amendments, the entire defense bill might have to be
indefinitely put aside.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, the Senate rejected, 50 to 49, a
Democratic-sponsored amendment that would have allowed military
women stationed overseas to obtain abortions at military hospitals
-- if they paid for them with private funds.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, such abortions are prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Gore announced the vote and, at one point, after Byrd complained
about noise and confusion, urged senators to take their seats and
stop milling in the front of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, as the constitutional president of the
Senate, may vote in cases of ties.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also worked the phones to try to solidify
support for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   While an almost identical bill was passed overwhelmingly by the
Senate last year, this time it touched off heated debate over
whether the measure infringes on state and local powers of law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Lott opposed the administration-supported bill, saying it would
''federalize'' many violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''State laws are working and doing a fine job,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Byrd's family Monday in Houston and renewed his
appeal for Senate passage. Byrd was dragged to death on a country
road by a trio of white men.
</P>
<P>
   The president cited FBI statistics that showed almost 8,000 hate
crimes were reported in 1998, the latest year available.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would add offenses motivated by sexual
orientation, sex or disability to the list of hate crimes already
covered under a 1968 federal law.
</P>
<P>
   It also would give federal prosecutors the option of pursuing a
hate-crime case if local authorities refused to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's measure would expand a 1968 federal law that defines
hate crimes as assaults motivated by the victim's race, color,
religion or national origin as the victim attempts to exercise
certain specified federally protected activities -- including voting
or attending school.
</P>
<P>
   His measure has 42 co-sponsors, including six Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The underlying defense bill is S. 2549

<HEADLINE> Former Japanese PM Takeshita Dies  </HEADLINE>
By J.L. HAZELTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister who
influenced a generation of Japanese leaders,'' has died after a
lengthy illness. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Takeshita died Monday from respiratory failure at a Tokyo
hospital a month after he officially retired from politics.
</P>
<P>
   He was lauded as a longtime driving force in Japanese
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no other politician who has trained so many people
in the political world,'' Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said.
</P>
<P>
   Takeshita was driven from the premiership by scandal, but his
power only increased. At the height of his influence, Takeshita
could anoint leaders and banish them as a master of the
consensus-building at the center of Japanese politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''His power was not based on his charisma or his smartness, but
on his ability to get more allies by handing out money and
networking behind the scenes,'' said Hokkaido University politics
professor Jiro Yamaguchi, adding that his negotiating talent
''reached the level of an art.''
</P>
<P>
   Demure in manner and evasive of speech, Takeshita headed the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party's largest faction in Parliament
until turning over the position to Keizo Obuchi in the mid-1990s.
The LDP has ruled almost without a break since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi later became prime minister. When he suffered a fatal
stroke in April, his successor was Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   Takeshita was hospitalized in April 1999 with lower back pain
and announced his retirement from politics last month. As is common
with ailing politicians in Japan, little information was released
about Takeshita's health. His retirement speech was recorded by
aides, and part of it was played on national television.
</P>
<P>
   Takeshita was forced from office in 1989 after admitting to
accepting illicit stock and cash donations from the marketing firm
Recruit Co. He was never charged. One of his top aides committed
suicide that year, prompting speculation in the Japanese media that
he may have chosen death over disclosure of his boss's wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The two prime ministers who succeeded him, Sosuke Uno and
Toshiki Kaifu, were seen as hand-picked by Takeshita.
</P>
<P>
   Takeshita's own mentor, Kakuei Tanaka, prime minister from 1972
to 1974, was arrested in 1976 and convicted of taking bribes from
U.S. aircraft maker Lockheed. He died in 1993 while his case was on
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Takeshita's death came in the midst of campaigning for Sunday's
elections for the 480-member lower house of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Top government spokesman Mikio Aoki canceled a campaign tour in
western Japan and was returning to Tokyo, national broadcaster NHK
television reported. TV footage showed LDP Secretary-General Hiromu
Nonaka visiting Takeshita's Tokyo home, where his body was taken.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Tuesday extended his condolences to the
former leader's wife, Naoko, his daughters and the Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Takeshita was a strong supporter of close U.S. -Japan
relations and a good friend of the United States,'' Clinton said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a sake-brewer in Shimane prefecture, Takeshita
graduated from prestigious Waseda University in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   He was an English teacher before turning to politics but
confessed to not speaking the language very well. He was first
elected to Parliament in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Takeshita was finance minister in 1985, when a foreign-exchange
rate agreement by the world's industrial powers sent the Japanese
yen soaring, setting off the roaring ''bubble'' economy.
</P>
<P>
   Takeshita also served in the key post of construction minister
and held the powerful position of chief Cabinet secretary.
</P>
<P>
   As prime minister, Takeshita maintained his party's
conservative, pro-business and pro-U.S. philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   An unpopular sales tax passed during his term, combined with the
corruption scandals, led to the LDP's massive and humiliating
defeat in the 1989 upper house elections.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include a wife and three daughters. A wake was
scheduled for Tuesday, and a private funeral was set for Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> E. coli Eyed in 4 More Deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Three elderly people and a young man may be the
latest victims of an E. coli outbreak that has killed at least
seven people and sickened hundreds, said health officials.
</P>
<P>
   Ontario chief coroner Dr. James Young said Tuesday the four
brought to 18 the number of deaths still under investigation as
being possibly caused by the E. coli outbreak in Walkerton, a rural
community of 5,000 people, located 90 miles west of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The four additional deaths included a 90-year-old man, an
86-year-old woman, a 96-year-old man and a 25-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have ruled that seven people -- six elderly adults
and a 2-year-old girl -- were killed by E. coli, an intestinal
bacteria usually spread by animal or human feces that causes
diarrhea, nausea, cramps, and in severe cases, kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   The contamination was the worst known E. coli outbreaks in North
America, and officials have yet to determine what caused it.
</P>
<P>
   Walkerton officials have acknowledged that the town's water
utility knew the water was possibly contaminated several days
before a boil order was issued on May 21. An investigation into the
cause of the contamination continues, with officials focusing on
surface water that contained animal manure and might have entered
two town wells.
</P>
<P>
   One of the wells had a defective chlorinating system, officials
have said.
</P>
<P>
   A boil order for town water was likely to continue for at least
another month. The Ontario Clean Water Agency has assumed control
of the town's water system from the local utility.

<HEADLINE> Brazil: $1.7B Plan To Curb Crime  </HEADLINE>
By STAN LEHMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's government proposed a major
anti-crime package Tuesday that would severely limit gun sales,
hire 2,000 new federal agents, better train and equip police and
improve lighting in neighborhoods across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that it could take months before the bill is approved, the
government decreed a nationwide, six-month ban on gun sales. Other
aspects of the plan require congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   The 124-step National Security Law would cost Brazil $1.7
billion over three years, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said
in Brasilia, the capital. He said the plan will not affect his
government's austerity policies, essential in keeping inflation
within current one digit level.
</P>
<P>
   The government proposal is a response to frustration among
Brazilians over rampant crime and recent violence. The murder rates
in the Rio de Janeiro and the nearby city of Vitoria are considered
to be among the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''Society is demanding from all of us a quicker response,''
Cardoso said. ''We could ask, who among us has not suffered because
of violence?''
</P>
<P>
   The plan would restrict possession of firearms to the armed
forces, police, private security personnel, collectors and gun
clubs. Everyone else would have 360 days to turn in their guns and
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   According to government figures, Brazilians own an estimated 8
million guns, of which about 6 million are unregistered.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came a week after a bus kidnapping that left a
20-year-old teacher and her kidnapper dead. The episode shocked
viewers across the nation who followed the incident on live
television for four hours.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was hailed by government supporters, but independent
lawyers expressed reservations about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government is giving priority to repression instead of
focusing on education and rehabilitation of young people,'' said
Reginaldo de Castro, president of the Brazilian Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is expected to be approved in the Senate and then go to
the Chamber of Deputies. Altair Goncalves Soares, a committee
secretary, said the proposal still could be modified and would take
months before it becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is the most expensive and comprehensive in recent years
in Brazil, where a killing takes place every 13 minutes, according
to recent statistics. The country ranked fourth last year
kidnappings after Colombia, Mexico and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Another major measure requiring congressional approval makes it
legal for police to infiltrate drug-trafficking gangs as part of
anti-drug campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Other measures going immediately into effect include a
witness-protection plan to encourage victims and witnesses to help
police. Another major step assigns $55 million to expand the
prison's capacity with 8,500 new places and to construct new
federal prisons to host additional 500 inmates this year.

<HEADLINE> Five indicted in Central Park attacks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Five young men have been indicted for alleged
attacks last Sunday on dozens of women in Central Park, a
prosecutor said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Maxine Rosenthal said the five were
charged with first-degree sexual abuse and first-degree riot. The
defendants face up to seven years in prison if convicted on the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Cynthia Kern kept the defendants
in jail and told their lawyers to apply for bail on July 10 when
the five are to be arraigned on the indictments in State Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The five who were indicted are Manuel Vargas, 18, the Bronx;
Imanuel Nunez, 18, the Bronx; Roberto Comacho, 16, Nassau County;
Steven Burt, 32, Jersey City; and Jensen Soto, 16, of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Another man arrested in the attacks, John Taylor, 24, of Queens,
was released without bail by Kern after Rosenthal told her the
grand jury had taken no action in his case. Charges against him
have not been dropped.
</P>
<P>
   However, Taylor's lawyer, Alan Kudisch, said prosecutors have
told him they are unlikely to present Taylor's case to the grand
jury or prosecute him further. Kudisch said Taylor is innocent of
the sex and riot charges.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, Taylor went to each of the dozen family
members and friends and hugged them as everybody laughed happily.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy to be going home with my family,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, police announced the arrests of three more
suspects in connection with the park assaults, bringing to 20 the
number charged in the June 11 attacks on women by several packs of
men.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested were Dellon Evans, 17, of Queens; Alexander Eraide, 23,
of Queens; and a male 15-year-old whose identity was withheld.
Police said they arrested the suspects after culling their photos
from videos of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said on Tuesday that police are
looking for at least 22 more men, identified by victims from
amateur videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of women have told police they were doused with water,
chased, stripped, molested or assaulted. On Monday, four more women
reported they were sexually abused, bringing the number of known
victims to 53.
</P>
<P>
   At least 14 of the women also said they were the victims of
robberies or attempted robberies, and at least four women have
declared that they intend to sue the city on the ground that police
failed to try to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said an internal investigation into the allegations that
some officers ignored pleas for help is ongoing. He has warned that
police officers could be fired if the Police Department finds that
the allegations are true.

<HEADLINE> Prayer Continuing, Despite Order  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUMA, La. (AP) -- High school football games in at least one
Louisiana parish will keep starting with a prayer, in defiance of a
Supreme Court ruling that calls the practice unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we get an objection, we'll stop it, we'll follow the law,''
said James Charles, acting superintendent of Terrebonne Parish
schools. Charles said Tuesday no one had complained about the
prayers yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, in its ruling Monday on a Texas high school
that allowed public prayer at games, said that when a school
sponsors a religious message it makes some students feel like
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   The decision -- the most sweeping on this issue since the court
prohibited clergy-led prayers at public school graduation
ceremonies in 1992 -- could carry enormous significance beyond
football games or other high school sports events.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Luke, principal of South Terrebonne High School, said prayer
before games is acceptable because it reflects the Judeo-Christian
values at the heart of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   ''To make some allegation that this is an infringement of church
and state is an extreme reach,'' he said. ''I don't believe that
this nation is one nation under nothing; it's one nation under
God.''

<HEADLINE> Inmate testifies millionaire was behind murder plot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) - A man serving a 19-year prison sentence for
solicitation of capital murder testified Tuesday against a South
Texas millionaire accused of arranging his ex-wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Gonzales said he was approached by friend Daniel Rocha,
who said millionaire Allen Blackthorne was offering thousands of
dollars for the bludgeoning of Sheila Bellush.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Gonzales said he hired his cousin, Jose Luis Del Toro,
the alleged gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Bellush was killed Nov. 7, 1997, shortly after moving with her
second husband, Jamie Bellush, and six kids to Sarasota, Fla. Her
2-year-old quadruplets from her second marriage were discovered
unharmed in the house, two of them crawling in their mother's
blood. Jamie Bellush and the children now live in Sussex County,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne, who has been linked in the shooting and stabbing
death of Bellush, is charged with interstate conspiracy to commit
murder for hire and interstate domestic violence. He faces a
mandatory life sentence if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gonzales and Rocha are serving prison terms in Florida for
solicitation of murder. Rocha, who received a life sentence, has
also testified against Blackthorne in the federal trial that began
last week.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Gonzales said that he and Del Toro discussed killing
Bellush when they drove by her San Antonio home in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzales said he got frightened and the men left the area.
When they returned later in the month, the Bellush family had
moved.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne later told Rocha that he was seeking Bellush's new
address in Sarasota, according to Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Rocha) said there's a $10,000 incentive if she's hurt
badly enough and Allen gets his daughter back,'' Gonzales said. ''I
was getting in real deep now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales said Rocha also said it ''would be easier just to
shoot'' and kill Bellush.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, 22-year-old Anna Morales of Austin told the
court Del Toro asked her to get a gun for ''some business he had to
take care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Another witness, Carol Arreola, 23, said Del Toro sounded
nervous in a phone call and told her he had ''done something I
shouldn't have done.'' She testified he later asked her to dispose
of some clothes and boots in her apartment and get a gun that was
stashed in his car.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Blackthorne's 14-year-old daughter testified that her
father pressured her for her mother's address just days before the
woman's slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Bellush also testified that her father told her he had
hired someone to follow her mother after the family moved to
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony last week centered around the bitter custody battle
between Blackthorne and Bellush, who had two daughters and divorced
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales also testified during Rocha's trial, saying Rocha told
him the money and the murder plot came from Blackthorne.
</P>
<P>
   Del Toro, 23, a former high school football star in Uvalde, is
scheduled for trial next month in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne's trial, expected to last several more weeks, has
been difficult for relatives of the victim, said Bellush's mother,
Jean Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the hardest thing I have ever done in my life, to sit
here and listen to those murderers who killed Sheila,'' Smith told
a reporter.

<HEADLINE> Sands president testifies in support of Icahn plan for bankrupt casino </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - The president of the Sands Casino Hotel
testified Tuesday in support of billionaire financier Carl Icahn's
plan to pull it out of bankruptcy, calling it superior to a
competing plan submitted by casino giant Park Place Entertainment
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Al Luciani, the Sands' president and CEO, said Icahn's plan to
invest $65 million in the property would help it recover quickly
from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy case it has been mired in for more
than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn's plan would give a better deal to the casino's existing
bondholders, it has won the support of the Sands' unsecured
creditors and employees favor it over the one submitted by Park
Place, Luciani said.
</P>
<P>
   The casino needs as big a cash investment as it can get to
recover from its poor performance and stay competitive, especially
given the impending addition of at least one casino in Atlantic
City's marina district, Luciani said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Sands has been a relatively underprivileged property in
terms of capital improvements, and in this industry, capital
improvements are very important,'' Luciani said.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony came in the opening day of four days of
confirmation hearings aimed at deciding who gets to rescue the
Sands from bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeding, which resumes Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, will end with Judge Judith Wizmur deciding whether Icahn or
Park Entertainment Corp. gets to take over the bankrupt casino.
</P>
<P>
   Under Icahn's plan, he would get 46.3 percent of Sands' new
stock and he would issue $110 million in new bonds in exchange for
the $182.5 million in existing Sands bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Park Place has proposed spending $40 million on the property in
exchange for 57.5 percent of the new stock and giving bondholders
$128 million in new bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The unsecured creditors, who are 1,500 vendors owed $6.7 million
when the Sands filed for bankruptcy, have voted in favor of the
Icahn plan, which also is supported by Sands' management.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn, who owns two Las Vegas casinos, is also making a play for
the Claridge Casino Hotel, which is located next door to the Sands
and also is currently under bankruptcy court protection.
</P>
<P>
   Park Place owns 28 casinos - including three in Atlantic City -
and could face scrutiny from regulators fearful that the company
would exert undue economic concentration on vendors and the rest of
the market should it get control of the Sands, too.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's casino law originally banned any one company or
individual from owning more than three casino licenses. It was
amended in 1995, striking the license limit and instead giving
regulators the authority to decide on a case-by-case basis whether
the granting of a license would lead to undue economic
concentration.
</P>
<P>
   The Sands' vendors have expressed fears that under Park Place
management, they would be forced to accept price concessions in
order to do business with the company.

<HEADLINE> State demotes Greystone CEO  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The state replaced the embattled CEO of
Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital Tuesday with an administrator
officials said was better suited to close down the troubled
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Greenstein was named special assistant to the director
of the state Division of Mental Health Services and will be
replaced as head of the Parsippany hospital by Gregory Roberts,
chief executive officer of Ancora Psychiatric State Hospital in
Camden County, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The ouster of Greenstein had been sought for months by
politicians and employees who blamed him for the reports of patient
assaults, pregnancies, suicides and unsanitary conditions at the
state-run hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's obvious Michael Greenstein had lost control of Greystone
and deserved to get fired,'' said Senate Minority Leader Richard
Codey.
</P>
<P>
   Both Greenstein, who didn't return a telephone call on Tuesday,
and Roberts will get to keep their $95,000 annual salaries. Roberts
will take over July 17.
</P>
<P>
   ''Michael did many good things at Greystone,'' said State
Department of Human Services Commissioner Michele K. Guhl. ''But
closing a hospital requires a different set of skills and I felt at
this time we needed someone with Greg's specialized expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman said in April that the 124-year-old
Greystone hospital would close within a few years, after reports
that the hospital's 610 patients were crowded into bedrooms and
unsupervised, that employees had sexually assaulted patients and
that patients had become pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Many patients will be moved to group homes and other
community-based centers over the next three years, while the
chronically ill patients likely will end up in a smaller hospital
the state will build on Greystone's grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Greenstein, 51, was hired four years ago to replace CEO George
Waters Jr., who was fired after several female patients claimed
they were sexually assaulted by employees and legislative hearings
were held.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, 49, was formerly CEO of Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital
and oversaw the closing of that hospital from 1995 to 1998. Roberts
supervised the assessment and placement of 776 Marlboro patients
and 1,180 staff. He became CEO of Ancora two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   La Tanya Wood El, the section chief of Holly Hall at Ancora and
an 18-year hospital employee, will become acting Ancora CEO, the
state said.
</P>
<P>
   A scathing report on Greystone issued in March by a
court-appointed watchdog group concluded that patients were
sleeping on floors, had no access to toilet paper or soap, and get
hurt fighting each other.
</P>
<P>
   Federal inspectors in May gave the hospital failing grades for
safety and staffing, saying the hospital had been overcrowded for
15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Other troubles that have occurred at the hospital include:
</P>
<P>
   -A suicidal patient left unattended hanged himself by a bedsheet
in February.
</P>
<P>
   -A male patient was charged with sexually assaulting a mildly
retarded female patient in an elevator.
</P>
<P>
   -Four employees were charged with assaulting and illegally
restraining another patient with a bedsheet. The charges were
recently dropped when police didn't appear at a court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   -At least a dozen employees are under investigation for failing
to report a suicide attempt last year.
</P>
<P>
   -Officials say at least 12 mentally impaired patients have
become pregnant while being treated at Greystone since 1995,
despite a policy prohibiting them from having sex.

<HEADLINE> Charles, Camilla Host Charity Dinner  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prince Charles and his longtime love smiled and
looked relaxed Tuesday as they attended their first semiofficial
engagement together at a London warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   But they refused to give the waiting photographers the image
they craved -- a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of photographers were waiting for Charles and Camilla
Parker Bowles when their car pulled up outside the new headquarters
of the Prince's Foundation in east London for a charity
fund-raising dinner. The couple smiled but refused to pose for
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ''My feet have a nervous twitch and I can't stop moving,''
Charles joked to one photographer, who asked the couple to stop and
pose inside.
</P>
<P>
   Photographers had no joy as the couple left the event shortly
after 11:30 p.m., either. The couple walked out together and got
into their green Bentley without pausing.
</P>
<P>
   Guests at the dinner said Parker Bowles had looked relaxed
throughout the evening.
</P>
<P>
   The by-invitation-only dinner, held in honor of the prince's
foundations in the United Kingdom and the United States, comes less
than three weeks after Queen Elizabeth II relented and met socially
with her eldest son's companion at a private party.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Parker Bowles at the Tuesday dinner is another
landmark in an increasingly successful campaign by Charles, 51, and
his advisers to gain public acceptability for the woman who was
blamed by Charles' ex-wife, the late Princess Diana, for the
breakup of their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, St. James's Palace has said that Parker Bowles, 52,
will not accompany the heir to the British throne on official
engagements. The palace has said the dinner was a private ''thank
you'' for the foundation's supporters.

<HEADLINE> Auction of treasure from sunken ship brings in more than $2.9 million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - The opening session of a two-day sale of gold
recovered from a sunken ship brought in more than $2.9 million at
an auction at Sotheby's on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The SS Central America was carrying three tons of California
gold when it sank off the coast of South Carolina in 1857 during a
hurricane. More than 400 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The gold consisted of uncirculated coins from the U.S. Mint in
San Francisco and gold bricks weighing nearly 80 pounds each.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Ohio found the ship and began removing the gold
in 1989. The lots for auction at Sotheby's were put up for sale by
the companies that had underwritten the ship's voyage in the 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-two lots were offered for auction on Tuesday night,
ranging from gold bars to nuggets. A second session was to be held
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The total sale for the night was $2,988,425, above the expected
sale of $2.7 million, Sotheby's said in a statement. The sale total
includes the auction house commission.
</P>
<P>
   The top-seller was a gold bar, weighing in at 652.23 ounces,
which sold for $308,000. A large gold and quartz nugget that had a
pre-sale estimate of between $15,000 and $25,000 went for $121,000.

Senate Passes Hate-Crimes Measure
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a furious last-minute lobbying blitz by the Clinton
administration, the Senate voted 57 to 42 today to approve legislation that
would make it easier for federal prosecutors to try hate crimes. Vice President
Al Gore interrupted presidential campaigning in Kentucky to fly to Washington to
be ready to cast a deciding vote should there be a tie in the
Republican-controlled chamber. He presided over the Senate, but his vote wasn't
needed. Thirteen Republicans defied their leaders to vote ''yes'' on the
measure. Only one Democrat voted ''no,'' Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson also delayed the part of his June 7
order aimed at imposing restrictions on Microsoft business practices found to
have been anticompetitive. That order had automatically stayed the breakup of
the company into two parts, pending all appeals.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House reversed itself today and agreed to free $4
million in a $101 billion spending bill to help fund the federal government's
massive lawsuit against the tobacco industry. The agreement came a day after a
major confrontation between the Clinton administration and the Republican-led
House during which the president said failure to fund the lawsuit was
''capitulating to the tobacco industry'' and GOP lawmakers said the Justice
Department was depriving veterans of needed health care funds.

like a watery maze. ''There's nothing left. Clothes, personal stuff, pictures --
things that couldn't be replaced. It's all under water now,'' said Debbie
Poitra, whose basement-level apartment in Fargo was filled with 6 feet of water.
Poitra said the water started pouring in late last night. The city got about 7

   WACO, Texas (AP) -- The $675 million wrongful death case against the
government over the 1993 disaster at Waco opened Tuesday with a lawyer showing
pictures of the child victims, reciting their names and intoning: ''Never fired
a gun. Never broke the law. Never hurt anyone.'' Michael Caddell, lead attorney
for the plaintiffs, made the presentation to the jury that will consider whether
the government used excessive force in the raid on the Branch Davidian compound.
About 80 members of the cult -- including at least 20 children under 16 and
Davidian leader David Koresh -- were killed, some in the blaze that destroyed
their compound, others from gunfire.

Mexico's borders. The leaders came from Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago and other
U.S. cities to meet last night with Francisco Labastida in Tijuana, less than
two weeks before one of the most tightly contested races in Mexican history.
Labastida promised them he would help create better jobs so fewer Mexicans would
be forced to make what he called ''the painful exit'' to the United States in
search of work.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes for China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate vote on a China trade bill is
likely to take place right after Congress returns from its Fourth
of July recess, Sen. Patrick Moynihan said Tuesday after a White
House strategy session on getting the measure passed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope to have it the first week we return from the July 4th
recess,'' Moynihan, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance
Committee, told reporters on the White House driveway. ''This is
not the most important vote this year. It may be the most important
vote this decade,'' he said. ''We don't want it to last on until
the (political) convention season.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle expressed
worry that a vote might be put off until September, just before the
presidential election. But speaking to reporters earlier in the
day, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott reiterated his belief that
the vote could be held next month, before the August recess, which
begins July 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to get the bulk of these appropriations bills done
before we can go to the China trade bill,'' he said. ''Hopefully we
can get to that in July.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight senators met for about 45 minutes with Clinton, U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky, Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is
scheduled to visit Beijing later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sooner we bring it up, the better off we are -- the less
chance for something to go wrong,'' Senate Finance Chairman William
Roth, R-Del., told reporters at the White House. ''The longer we
wait, the more danger there is of mischief.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would end annual votes on China's trade status and
grant the nation permanent normal trading relations. The
legislation itself has wide support, but it has been the victim of
political maneuvering in the rush to clear the legislative decks
before this summer's political conventions. Democrats have blamed
Lott for playing politics with the bill to gain leverage on other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters also hope to keep the bill from being further amended
in the Senate, which would require another likely contentious vote
in the House. Amendments have been threatened by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. And Sen. Fred Thompson,
R-Tenn., said he will push for an amendment if he can't get a
separate vote on his bill to impose sanctions on China for weapons
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hope that it would be done as an independent bill,''
Roth said. ''It's critically important that there be no amendments
to this legislation. We do not want to take it back to conference.
We do not want to have a second vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bills are H.R. 4444 and S. 2277

<HEADLINE> Anti-Abortion Group Sues U.S. Court  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anti-abortion activists sued the Supreme Court
on Tuesday, claiming a rule barring large signs on sidewalks
outside the court violates the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the Christian Defense Coalition asked U.S.
District Judge Thomas Hogan to issue a preliminary injunction to
stop Supreme Court police from enforcing the regulation.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the Supreme Court sought a summary judgment in
the high court's favor or a dismissal of the lawsuit altogether.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing arguments for both sides, Hogan said he expected
to render a written opinion within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Brian R. Chavez-Ochoa noted that ''Regulation Six,''
written by Supreme Court police Marshall Dale Bosley and signed by
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, was enacted on the very day of
his clients' demonstration to stop them from protesting.
</P>
<P>
   Court police arrested 22 demonstrators April 25 when they
refused to remove huge, graphic banners that included a full-color
depiction of a decapitated fetus. The Supreme Court was hearing
arguments over Nebraska's ban on a surgical procedure that
opponents call partial birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators spent 12 hours in jail before pleading
innocent to a misdemeanor that carries a maximum penalty of six
months in jail and a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez-Ochoa also noted that his clients had conducted similar
protests two days earlier but were not arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulation was issued under the authority of a federal
law that lets the court protect its building and grounds and the
people who use them. It bans from ''perimeter sidewalks of the
Supreme Court grounds'' signs larger than 4 feet long and 4 feet
wide and elevated higher than 6 feet from the ground if they are
not carried by hand.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters had propped up some of their signs, including one
that was 4 feet by 6 feet, outside the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, the Supreme Court did not agree with the content of
our message,'' said the Rev. Patrick Mahoney, the protest leader.
''It is an unconstitutional regulation against free speech on what
should be the most hallowed sidewalk in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Sally M. Rider, arguing on behalf of
the Supreme Court, told Hogan that the regulation was enacted
because Bosley had legitimate concerns for ''safety, security,
access and decorum.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of thought went into it,'' said Rider, whose office is
part of the Justice Department. ''It has nothing to do with the
content (of the signs). It has to do with the physical size of the
signs.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Bosley testified that he only saw the back of signs and
was not concerned with their anti-abortion message. He said the
signs were large enough to be used as a weapon, to hide an
assailant, to block the line of sight of court police, and to block
access to the court.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Cuts War Commemoration  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Amid warming relations with communist
North Korea, South Korea said Tuesday it had canceled a massive
military parade and battle reenactments to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   The plans were replaced by more benign ceremonies, such as
seminars, wreath-layings, photo exhibitions, and luncheons and
dinner parties for domestic and foreign veterans, said Seoul's
Defense Ministry in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   ''We decided to change our plans in order to assure the
successful implementation of the summit agreements,'' the ministry
said, adding the change will help promote harmony and
reconciliation with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea also will ship 23,000 tons of fertilizer to North
Korea by midnight for arrival on late Wednesday, which is the last
batch of 200,000 tons of fertilizer it promised to the hungry North
last month as a goodwill gesture.
</P>
<P>
   The moves followed a series of measures taken by both Koreas to
improve ties after the historic June 13-15 summit in Pyongyang in
which South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader
Kim Jong Il pledged to work toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   The official Korean Veterans' Association, headed by a former
defense minister, endorsed the government decision, but some
veterans angrily accused the Seoul government of trying too hard to
please North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's as if the government were telling the people to forget
the war without even getting an apology from North Korea for
starting the war,'' said Choi Chong-tae, 70, leader of a group of
decorated war veterans.
</P>
<P>
   It would be ''shortsighted'' for South Korea not to properly
recognize veterans' sacrifices because of political motives, said
Manert Kennedy, 70, a former U.S. Marine sergeant from Boulder,
Colo., who fought in the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a person who saw considerable bloodshed and agony both on
the part of warriors, veterans, and the civilian population, I
think it is wrong to ignore that suffering without some sort of
recognition,'' said Kennedy, a survivor of the 1950 Chosin
Reservoir battle.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea had originally planned to stage a military parade in
downtown Seoul on June 25, the 50th anniversary of the Korean War's
outbreak, and reenact major battles, including U.S. Gen. Douglas
MacArthur's Inchon Landing in September 1950.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea started the three-year war that claimed the lives of
at least 36,900 U.S. soldiers and at least 58,000 South Korean
troops. The war's total military and civilian casualties are
estimated at more than 4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Before the summit, North Korea accused Seoul and Washington of
planning the events to drum up another war against the North. But
Kim Jong Il said, during the summit, that North Korea's war
anniversary programs were canceled in a peace gesture.
</P>
<P>
   The two Koreas have since stopped loudspeaker propaganda
broadcasts across the Demilitarized Zone separating the two
countries and Red Cross officials will meet Friday at a border
village to discuss reuniting separated families.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the thawing relations, the two Koreas still have
sensitive issues to resolve such as suspect nuclear weapons
development and long range missile of North Korea and the presence
of 37,000 U.S. troops in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Police on Tuesday detained six activists and two photographers
on charges of trespassing on the Koon-Ni bombing range off the west
coast despite red flags declaring the zone off-limits to civilians
because of an impending bombing exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Air Force range has been a constant source of friction
with villagers who claim that noise from the bombing exercises
threatens their health. Villagers demand a closure of the range,
but the Seoul government rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 8th U.S. Army in Seoul said it had not changed
any plans for its own war anniversary events. Up to 1,000 U.S. and
other allied nations' veterans were invited to Korea for ceremonies

<HEADLINE> Rocker To Take No. 7 Train in NY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- John Rocker can't wait to get to New York next
week -- and ride the subway with all the people he insulted last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first day I get to New York, I'm getting on the (No.) 7
train,'' the Atlanta Braves reliever told USA Today Baseball
Weekly, which hits the newsstands Wednesday. ''I'm taking it to
Shea Stadium. I won't be in a cab. I won't be on the bus. I'll be
on that train.
</P>
<P>
   ''And I'm looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker said he won't initiate any conversations with people on
the train, ''but if someone wants to talk to me, that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that same subway line that Rocker insulted in an
interview with Sports Illustrated last December.
</P>
<P>
   ''Imagine having to take the 7 train looking like you're (in)
Beirut next to some kid with purple hair, next to some queer with
AIDS, right next to some dude who got out of jail for the fourth
time, right next to some 20-year-old mom with four kids. It's
depressing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest thing I don't like about New York are the
foreigners,'' Rocker said in the Sports Illustrated interview.
''You can walk an entire block in Times Square and not hear anybody
speaking English. Asians and Koreans and Vietnamese and Indians and
Russians and Spanish people and everything up there. How the hell
did they get in this country?''
</P>
<P>
   After the story came out, Rocker was suspended for a month and
fined $20,000 by commissioner Bud Selig. The players association
appealed, and an arbitrator reduced the penalty to a two-week
suspension and $500 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves also fined Rocker $5,000 last month for threatening
the Sports Illustrated reporter who wrote the story revealing
Rocker's offensive comments about gays, minorities and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was sent down to the minors the following day, but was
recalled last week when Rudy Seanez tore a ligament in his right
arm.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers are poised for Rocker's return to the city June 29
for a four-game series with the Mets. Rocker is also looking
forward to it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not scared, I'm not intimidated in the least,'' he said.
''Come on, what are they going to do to me but boo me? I hope they
do.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worst thing they could do to me there is have no reaction.
No reaction at all. ... I'd hate that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to get booed. That fires me up. Look at what happened
last year in New York. I didn't give up an earned run at Shea or
Yankee Stadium in the playoffs. Those people bring out the best in
me.''

<HEADLINE> Reds 3, Rockies 2  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. made a diving catch to snuff
out a Colorado rally in the eighth, and Dmitri Young homered
leading off the bottom of the inning as the Cincinnati Reds beat
the Rockies 3-2 Tuesday night, ending a six-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Young's eighth homer on the first pitch from Pedro Astacio (6-4)
helped the Reds end their longest losing streak in two years.
They've dropped 11 of 13 overall, a free fall that has left them
with a losing record at 33-35.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati overcame a pair of solo homers by Todd Helton, who
went 2-for-4 and raised his NL-leading average to .396.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring 33 runs in their last two games against Arizona,
the Rockies couldn't do much against Osvaldo Fernandez, the Reds'
most reliable starter since he was called up May 13 to replace
disabled Pete Harnisch.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez allowed six hits in 7 1-3 innings, including solo
homers by Helton in the second and seventh. He came out of the game
after giving up Mike Lansing's double just inside third base with
one out in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Dennys Reyes walked Larry Walker, and Danny Graves (9-1) came on
to face Jeff Cirillo, who hit a soft fly to center on the first
pitch. Griffey charged and made a diving catch, then threw to
second to get Lansing for a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Young went 3-for-4, including a single in Cincinnati's two-run
first. Barry Larkin doubled and came around on Dante Bichette's
two-out single to right. Young's single and Sean Casey's
ground-rule double made it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   As it has throughout their slump, the Reds' offense fizzled
after a promising start. Cincinnati stranded at least one runner in
every inning and failed to score after getting the leadoff batter
aboard in three consecutive innings.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Tom Goodwin took a homer away from Larkin in the
second, when he timed his jump and reached above the yellow padding
atop the wall in center to grab the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Helton's two homers gave him 21 on the year. Helton, the
Rockies' top hitter on the road, is 14-for-29 career at Cinergy
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Hammonds doubled in the fifth, extending his hitting
streak to 17 games. It's the longest of his career and the longest
for the Rockies this season.
</P>
<P>
Notes: It was the 13th multihomer game of Helton's career and
fifth this season ... In their last four games, Rockies starters
have walked only three batters. ... Cirillo went 0-for-4, ending
his 11-game hitting streak. ... Fernandez is 2-0 in his last five
starts with a 1.48 ERA. ... When Larkin scored in the first inning,
he tied Johnny Bench for second on the club's career list with
1,091. Pete Rose scored 1,741 times with Cincinnati. ... Harnisch
threw 80 pitches in batting practice before the game. Harnisch,
disabled by a weak shoulder, could start next Thursday against St.
Louis.

<HEADLINE> Witnesses: Skakel admitted involvement in murder  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel confessed
to the 1975 murder of a teen-age neighbor telling a classmate,
''I'm gonna get away with murder. I'm a Kennedy,'' according to
testimony at a pretrial hearing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Coleman was one of two students who said Skakel
confessed to them while they attended the Elan school, a
residential substance abuse treatment center for youths, in the
late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   They testified before a judge who will decide whether there is
enough evidence for a trial and, if so, whether the 39-year-old
Skakel is to be tried in juvenile court. The hearing is scheduled
to last several days.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel, 39, is charged as a juvenile in the October 1975 slaying
of Greenwich teen-ager Martha Moxley. Both Skakel and Moxley were
15 at the time of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman testified that he noticed that Skakel appeared to have
special privileges - including a stereo and records.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said he commented to Skakel that it appeared he could
get away with murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''At which point he said to me, 'I'm gonna get away with murder.
I'm a Kennedy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said Skakel told him he beat Moxley's skull in with a
golf club after she rejected his romantic advances.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman also said that he heard Skakel make an admission to the
murder during a ''primal scream therapy session'' in which
participants were urged to get in touch with their pain and then
scream ''I'm sorry'' over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination by Skakel's lawyer, Michael Sherman,
Coleman acknowledged that he waited 20 years to come forward about
the purported confession, and only after seeing a segment on the
case on a television news program.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman asked Coleman why he did not call police. He said he
didn't know why.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman then ran through Coleman's criminal record, which
includes a 1983 conviction for robbery and a 1999 conviction for
criminal trespassing, for which he is now serving a 1-year prison
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman suggested that Coleman was looking for a deal from
prosecutors by agreeing to testify against Skakel.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said although he did ask the state's attorney's office
for $1,200 when he learned his father was dying of cancer, he said
he told prosecutors he would testify regardless of whether they
helped him financially.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, John Higgins, another former Elan student, testified
that one night while he and Skakel were on ''night owl duty'' -
making sure no one ran away from the dormitory - a sobbing Skakel
discussed the Moxley murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''He related to me that he had been involved in a murder ... or
thought that he had been involved,'' Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said Skakel told him he remembered going through golf
clubs stored in the Skakel family garage, then running through the
woods and seeing pine trees, then blacking out and awakening the
next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Moxley was beaten to death with a 6-iron; the club was traced to
a set owned by the Skakel family.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said that he didn't know whether he did it and he couldn't
remember,'' Higgins said. ''He eventually said that he, in fact,
did it.''
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, Higgins admitted that he and Skakel were
never close friends, and that he had lied about Skakel's alleged
comments when contacted by an investigator in the state's
attorney's office many years later.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to talk to this guy - or anybody else - about
it, ever,'' Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's lawyer suggested Higgins had only come forward after he
heard about a reward. But Higgins said he did not try to claim the
reward, which later was withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman asked Higgins if he would be surprised to learn there
was no garage on the Skakel property. Higgins replied that he could
only relate what Skakel had told him.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel became visibly upset during Higgins' testimony, tears
trickling down his face.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just very upset about hearing this moron get up there and
lie,'' Sherman told reporters during a break.
</P>
<P>
   Moxley's brother, John, who was 17 when his sister was murdered,
said he thought Skakel's emotion was fear.
</P>
<P>
   ''They weren't tears of joy. I think the reality is starting to
tumble down around him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's lawyer called Higgins' testimony ''baloney'' and
''devoid of character.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Greenwich police Chief Thomas Keegan, a captain in the
detective division at the time of the murder, testified that the
Skakels told police they often left golf clubs lying in the yard of
their estate in the wealthy enclave of Belle Haven.
</P>
<P>
   But he said police dismissed their original theory that the
slaying was committed by a stranger. The club used in the killing
broke into several pieces, and the handle was never recovered
despite an extensive search of the neighborhood, including draining
swimming pools and checking the Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   ''My conclusion is that the person who killed Martha was aware
that that name was on the club,'' Keegan said.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from Skakel's attorney, Keegan acknowledged
that for years, police considered Thomas Skakel, Michael's older
brother, and Ken Littleton, a Skakel family tutor, as suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law in effect at the time of the killing, Skakel could
face a maximum of only four years if he were convicted as a
juvenile. If he were convicted as an adult, he could get 25 years
to life.
</P>
<P>
   Martha's body was found under a tree on her family's estate. She
had been at the Skakel house the night before with a group of
friends, including Michael and Thomas Skakel, then 17.
</P>
<P>
   Rushton Skakel Sr., the father of Michael and Thomas Skakel, is
the brother of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors said they expect to wrap up their case
Wednesday. Skakel's lawyers are expected to begin presenting their
defense on June 28.

<HEADLINE> Pitcher Eichhorn Starts Comeback  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- Former Toronto reliever Mark Eichhorn
pitched a scoreless ninth inning in his first pro appearence in two
years Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year old right-hander allowed one hit and struck out two
as Toronto's Class-A Dunedin affiliate beat Clearwater 7-1 in the
Florida State League.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels great,'' Eichhorn said. ''I was just trying to keep
the ball down and throw strikes. Outside of just one hitter, I felt
I threw the ball well.''
</P>
<P>
   Eichhorn last pitch in the pros for Triple-A Durham in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Eichorn went 48-43 with a 3.04 ERA and 32 saves in his major
league career.

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Bridget Pettis' scored a season-high 22
points and the Phoenix Mercury pulled away in the second half to
beat the Minnesota Lynx 74-55 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight loss for the Lynx, following a
franchise-record five-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota shot just 38.6 percent from the field while being held
to its season-low point total.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's lead was only 33-30 at halftime, but it opened the
second half on an 8-2 run, keyed by six points from Tonya Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards finished with 16 points, while Pettis, who went 8-for-13
from the field overall, scored 13 points in the first half for the
Mercury (6-3).
</P>
<P>
   Betty Lennox led the Lynx (6-4) with 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's Katie Smith, fresh off being named the WNBA's player
of the week, played all 40 minutes of the game. But she struggled
offensively. Smith opened the night by missing her first three
shots and wound up with 10 points on 4-for-15 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury avenged a 69-62 loss to Minnesota last Saturday in
Phoenix.

<HEADLINE> Shaq To Pay For L.A. Police Car  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal, whose work in the community
has shown he's a man with a large social conscience, will pay to
replace one of two police cars torched by rowdy fans celebrating
the Los Angeles Lakers' NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers and owner Jerry Buss will chip in with Staples Center
to replace the other police vehicle that was burned outside the
arena, Lakers spokesman John Black said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fully equipped police vehicles can cost around $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, the 7-foot-1, 330-pound center who capped his first
championship season by winning the NBA Finals MVP award, is very
active in the community, particularly in children's programs. He
participates in Shaq Paq, Wish Kids, Shaqsgiving and Shaq-a-Claus.
He also is a spokesman for Reading is Fundamental.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, Buss and Staples executives all had their victory
celebrations put on hold after Monday's night's 116-111 clinching
victory over Indiana. They remained in the arena some two hours
before police deemed it safe to leave the building.
</P>
<P>
   Two TV news vans also were damaged or destroyed, and other auto
fires were reported in the general area of Staples. There were 11
arrests, but no major injuries were reported.

<HEADLINE> BB Offers To Take Back 22 Umpires  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball has offered to take back some of the 22
umpires who were let go last September, while demanding umps agree
not to criticize management in the future.
</P>
<P>
   During about two dozen negotiating sessions over the past three
months, the new umpires' union and owners have found themselves in
four areas of disagreement: pay; the fate of the 22 former umps;
that discipline be taken only with ''just cause;'' and control over
when umps can talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made an effort to compromise and accommodate the 22 in
particular ways and have frankly not gotten a serious response,''
Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations in
the commissioner's office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson, without specifying how many of the 22 could return,
said baseball had offered a combination of jobs and termination
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Another participant in the talks said the new union, formed
after the umps dumped Richie Phillips' Major League Umpires
Association, had been asked to share in the cost of dealing with
the 22, a group that includes well-known umps such as Richie
Garcia, Frank Pulli and Terry Tata.
</P>
<P>
   ''Guys that have given 28, 25 years of their life to baseball
shouldn't be cut off from their medical, cut off from their
pension, cut off from their severance pay,'' said AL ump Joe
Brinkman, vice president of the new union. ''They shouldn't try to
crush them. We'd like to see them satisfy the 22 so they could go
home and hold their heads up.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22 were let go last Sept. 2 after a failed mass resignation
plan by Phillips' MLUA, which was largely controlled by NL umps.
</P>
<P>
   During the offseason, umpires voted in a new union, the World
Umpires Association, which they said would be less contentious than
the Phillips-led group. The new union is negotiating a contract to
replace the agreement that expired Dec. 31, and both sides have
agreed there will be no strike or lockout through at least July 14.
No new talks currently are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Management is insisting that in any new deal, umpires agree that
they will never speak with reporters without first getting approval
from management. The only exception would be that crew chiefs could
explain controversial decisions about 15 minutes after the final
out of games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We couldn't talk about baseball, our personal life,
anything,'' Brinkman said. ''That's going a little far. We're still
in the United States, where we have freedom of speech. They want to
muzzle us completely. You have to be able to give your side of the
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Umpires said they would agree only if management and teams
promised never to criticize them. Negotiators for the
commissioner's office said they could agree on behalf of
management, but players couldn't be stopped from speaking out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consistent with other sports, we don't want umpires engaging
in the same sort of mudslinging and petty criticism that sometimes
others in the game engage in,'' Alderson said. ''We don't think
it's good for the profession. We think it's demeaning to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Umpires want raises that would give them average salaries about
25-30 percent above NBA officials. Umpires, who currently make
$95,000 to $282,500, including postseason bonuses, made about the
same as NBA officials when the previous contract began in 1995, but
their NBA counterparts have been given raises in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We work 58 percent more games than basketball does and were
asking for 30 percent more in money,'' Brinkman said.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball management counters that umps gets more pension money
than NBA referees, and they get up to five weeks' vacation. NBA
referees aren't eligible for vacation until after 10 seasons, a
baseball management lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Umpires also want a ''just-cause'' clause involving discipline.
The expired agreement didn't have one.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't discipline just because you want to,'' Brinkman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Owners, tired of their many grievance losses with players, say
they won't agree to having arbitrators review cases, which could
lead to more litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had enough of that in recent years,'' Alderson said.
</P>
<P>
   While no talks are scheduled, both sides anticipate scheduling a
meeting before June 30. That's when either side can give two weeks'
notice of a strike or lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ''They came in with a preconceived idea of everything they
wanted to do,'' Brinkman said, ''and there's been no listening to
umpires.''

<HEADLINE> Braves 11, Cubs 4  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SALADINO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Chipper Jones hit a pair of two-run homers,
including a 443-foot blast, and Kevin Millwood won for the first
time in more than a month as the Atlanta Braves routed the Chicago
Cubs 11-4 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Quilvio Veras went 4-for-5, scored three runs and knocked in
three, Andruw Jones had a pair of hits -- including his 19th homer --
scored three times and drove in three runs, and Brian Jordan went
3-for-4 with an RBI in Atlanta's 14-hit attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, coming off a dismal 3-5 road trip against the
Pittsburgh Pirates and Philadelphia Phillies, lost four of five
before coming to life against the Cubs and right-hander Kevin
Tapani.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones, who matched his career high by getting a hit in
his 18th consecutive game, capped a four-run second inning off
Tapani with a shot into the right-center field stands, the fourth
longest home run hit at Turner Field. Former Brave Ryan Klesko has
the longest at 449 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones added his second two-run shot in the fourth off
Steven Rain, a line drive into the left-field stands, his 18th
homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood (5-6) last won on May 17. He was 0-4 with two
no-decisions and a 10.12 ERA during that span.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander gave up four hits, one run, walked one and
struck out six, including Sammy Sosa twice, in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs' only run off Millwood came in the fourth on a leadoff
double by Mark Grace, a wild pitch and Henry Rodriguez's sacrifice
fly.
</P>
<P>
   Tapani (4-7) lasted only two innings, giving up seven hits and
six runs. The right-hander was struck in the right heel by a liner
off the bat of Andruw Jones in the second inning, which may have
had something to do with his poor outing.
</P>
<P>
   Veras led off the Braves' first with a double, and Andruw Jones
followed with the shot that caromed off Tapani's right heel into
right field for an RBI double. After several warmup tosses, Tapani
signaled he was all right and continued. Two outs later, Jordan
singled to right, scoring Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Veras had a two-run single in the second and an RBI double in a
three-run sixth. Andruw Jones followed with his two-run homer over
the left-field wall off reliever Daniel Garibay.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young was 4-for-4 for the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's other three runs came on a solo home run in the eighth
by pinch-hitter Gary Matthews Jr., the first of his career, and RBI
hits by Sosa and Joe Girardi.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews is the son of former major leaguer Gary Matthews, who
played with five major league clubs, including the Cubs and
Braves.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Chipper Jones' hitting streak is the longest for the Braves
this season and equaled his longest, set in August 1996. It's the
longest for Atlanta since Marquis Grissom hit in 28 straight in
1996. The two-homer game was the 15th career for Jones. ... Veras'
four hits matched his career best, done four previous times. ...
Tapani worked at least seven innings in each of his previous nine
starts. The two innings pitched gave him 2,000 1-3 for his career.
... Ismael Valdes, scheduled to start Thursday against the Braves,
instead will start on Saturday at Florida to give a blister on his
pitching finger more time to heal. Left-hander Scott Downs will
replace Valdes on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Sunken Ship's Gold Brings in $2.9M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Gold recovered from a sunken ship brought in
more than $2.9 million Tuesday during the opening session of a
two-day auction at Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   The SS Central America was carrying three tons of California
gold when it sank off the coast of South Carolina in 1857 during a
hurricane. More than 400 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The gold consisted of uncirculated coins from the U.S. Mint in
San Francisco and gold bricks weighing nearly 80 pounds each.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Ohio found the ship and began removing the gold
in 1989. The lots for auction at Sotheby's were put up for sale by
the companies that had underwritten the ship's voyage in the 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-two lots were offered for auction on Tuesday night,
ranging from gold bars to nuggets. A second session was to be held
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The total sale for the night was $2,988,425, above the expected
sale of $2.7 million, Sotheby's said in a statement. The sale total
includes the auction house commission.
</P>
<P>
   The top-seller was a gold bar, weighing in at 652.23 ounces,
which sold for $308,000. A large gold and quartz nugget that had a
pre-sale estimate of between $15,000 and $25,000 went for $121,000.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 3, Mets 2, 10 innings  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Lieberthal's two-out single in the 10th
inning off Armando Benitez gave the Philadelphia Phillies a 3-2
victory Tuesday night over the New York Mets, their fourth win in
five games against the top two teams in the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez (1-3), who had not allowed a run in 17 innings since May
6, allowed a game-tying solo homer to Pat Burrell in the ninth
before losing it in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Glanville opened the Phillies 10th with a double, but
Benitez struck out Ron Gant and Scott Rolen before Lieberthal lined
a single to center on a 1-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies beat the first-place Braves three out of four over
the weekend and defeated the Mets for the sixth time in seven games
dating to last season.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell's fourth homer and Benitez's third blown save in 19
chances spoiled a fine performance by New York starter Mike Hampton
and saved Phillies starter Paul Byrd from a tough loss.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Brock (3-4) got the last two outs in the ninth and Jeff
Brantley worked the 10th for his ninth save in as many chances.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza staked New York to a 2-0 lead in the first with his
19th homer and Hampton pitched seven strong innings.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton struggled early, walking six in the first four innings,
but was able to work out of trouble until his final inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies made it 2-1 in the seventh when Kevin Sefcik, who
had two hits, and Alex Arias opened with singles. Following a
sacrifice by pinch-hitter Desi Relaford, Doug Glanville hit a
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Jordan had the other hit off Hampton, singling in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton finally got nice weather to pitch in. He was limited to
47 pitches on June 11 at Yankee Stadium in a game that was rained
out in the third inning. His next start in Chicago three days later
was cut short after one inning (32 pitches) because of a lengthy
rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton took his full rest this time to allow a left-groin
strain to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, an All-Star last season, pitched well in his return to the
majors following a trip to Triple-A Scranton. Byrd allowed two runs
on six hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled through most of his nine starts before being sent
down on June 2, compiling a 7.86 ERA. But in three starts for
Scranton, Byrd was 2-0 in three starts with a 1.73 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   He was recalled Sunday when Andy Ashby went on the disabled list
with an infected finger.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: Hampton, who leads NL pitchers with 11 hits, failed to get
one for the seventh time in 15 starts this season. He went 0-for-2
but did hit a shot to deep center field that was tracked down.
Hampton hit safely in seven of 14 at-bats before Tuesday. ... Byrd
is 5-12 since last year's All-Star Game. ... Phillies SS Desi
Relaford was benched for the second time in four games. Relaford,
who has 19 errors, committed 13 in his last 22 games and three in
his last three starts. Alex Arias once again started in his place.
Relaford pinch-hit in the seventh. ... Piazza threw out Kevin
Jordan, attempting to steal second base in the sixth. It was the
18th runner Piazza caught this season. ... Lieberthal caught Jay
Payton going for second in the second -- the 20th runner he has
nailed.

<HEADLINE> Haiti Results Favor Aristide Party  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Haiti's Elections Council on
Tuesday released more results from the May 21 elections, giving
former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's party 26 seats in the
parliament's lower house. The party already won control of the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The council announcements came a day after violent protests
paralyzed Haiti's three biggest cities as demonstrators pressed for
results from the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the lower Chamber of Deputies, Aristide's Lavalas Family
Party won the first round of voting with 26 seats in the 83-member
body. Results from another 11 seats are still being tabulated. For
the remaining 46 seats, no one won a majority so runoffs will be
held.
</P>
<P>
   The council said Monday that Aristide candidates won 16 of 17
Senate seats contested in the May 21 balloting.
</P>
<P>
   The election results have been challenged by the international
community and Elections Council President Leon Manus, who fled to
the United States over the weekend in fear of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has demanded an honest count of ballots cast
in the elections, which are crucial to restoring some $500 million
in suspended international aid. The United Nations and Organization
of American States have also questioned the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government Tuesday urged Haitians to exercise
restraint. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
administration officials currently are Haiti for meetings related
to the election.
</P>
<P>
   The Elections Council also said it was postponing the second
round of elections scheduled for Sunday but gave no date.
Opposition leaders have threatened to boycott, charging the count
was fixed to give Aristide a victory that would set Haiti on the
road to a virtual one-party state.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Manus told a radio station from an undisclosed
location in the United States that he refused to give in to
pressure from President Rene Preval to sign off on incorrect
results giving Aristide candidates 16 Senate seats. Manus said
Aristide candidates won only seven seats, Radio Galaxie reported.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's Senate results were signed by six remaining council
members.
</P>
<P>
   Among new legislators who would join the Senate under the
disputed results are at least three whom opponents have linked to
Haiti's increasing traffic in cocaine headed for the United States.
Aristide's party says the allegations linking Aristide cronies to
drug dealing are political propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Also becoming a senator is former police chief, Dany Toussaint.
A 1997 U.S. Senate vote to deny U.S. visas to Haitians implicated
in extrajudicial and political killings identified Toussaint among
''suspected murderers.'' Toussaint was detained in the United
States for three months that year in what he said was a successful
attempt to prevent him from running for Haiti's Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over the results comes down to the method Haitian
officials used to count the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Under Haitian law, candidates must win a majority to avoid a
second round of voting. But officials counted the votes of only the
top four contenders and not the others who ran and may have gotten
a few votes. Those missing votes created an erroneous winning
percentage count, observers say, giving at least eight of 16 Senate
seats to Aristide candidates who otherwise would have to face a
second round.
</P>
<P>
   In Port-au-Prince on Monday, protesters stoned vehicles and set
tire barricades ablaze. They blocked the capital's main arteries
with hulks of vehicles, junked refrigerators and large rocks. Shops
and schools stayed shut.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters also reportedly paralyzed Cap-Haitien and Gonaives,
Haiti's second- and third-largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince, demonstrators set a
large pile of debris on fire and chanted anti-American slogans.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Vote Simplification Sought  </HEADLINE>
By JORGE RUEDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Electoral officials asked lawmakers
Tuesday to separate the country's upcoming general election into
two stages to simplify balloting.
</P>
<P>
   The National Electoral Council said Tuesday night it wants
voters to elect the president, governors and mayors on July 30,
with elections for regional and local councils sometime after Sept.
17.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the institutional health of the country ... it is
necessary to make the electoral event simpler,'' council president
Cesar Pena Vigas said in a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   All of the elections were originally scheduled for May 28, but
Venezuela's Supreme Court canceled them because of technical
problems including the omission of some candidates from a database
needed to count votes.
</P>
<P>
   More than 36,000 candidates are vying for 6,236 public offices.
The vote will cement a new constitution that President Hugo Chavez
has promised will better distribute power between rich and poor
Venezuelans.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's Legislative Commission will make the final decision
on the election dates. The Legislative Commission -- dominated by
Chavez allies -- was appointed by the Constitutional Assembly as a
temporary legislature after constitution-writers dissolved Congress
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Commission president Luis Miquilena said he wanted to meet this
week with opposition parties and civic groups to reach a consensus
on the election date, which has divided the parties.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians want all of the elections on the same
date. They fear that if the presidential vote is held first, a win
by front-runner Chavez would give momentum to other candidates of
his party.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's main opponent in the presidential race, Francisco
Arias, has accused Miquilena of ''manipulating'' the election
dates. He also warned that staging two elections would be costly.

<HEADLINE> Indians 4, White Sox 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Travis Fryman hit a two-run double in a four-run
sixth inning Tuesday night to lead the Cleveland Indians to a 4-1
victory over the White Sox, snapping Chicago's eight-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   The victory pulled the Indians within 7&AMP;frac12; games of the White Sox
in the AL Central and was Cleveland's second win in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Brower (2-1), who lasted just 1 1-3 innings against the
White Sox in his last start June 14, gave up one run and six hits
in 7 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sirotka (6-6) allowed four runs and nine hits in eight
innings, striking out six.
</P>
<P>
   But Sirotka committed a critical throwing error in the sixth
that led to the four runs. Second baseman Ray Durham also made a
throwing error that inning, the 66th miscue by the White Sox
(45-25), who have the best record in the majors and the worst
fielding percentage in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar singled to lead off the sixth and advanced on
Kenny Lofton's sacrifice. Lofton was safe on Sirotka's throwing
error, and both he and Alomar scored on Fryman's double to make it
2-1. One out later, Jim Thome singled to score Fryman, his third
hit of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Ramirez and Sandy Alomar each singled, scoring Thome to
make it 4-1. Durham had thrown home but the ball hit Alomar's bat
in front of home plate and bounced past catcher Brook Fordyce for
an error.
</P>
<P>
   Jolbert Cabrera then grounded out to second and Ramirez was
caught in a rundown between third and home for an inning-ending
double play.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera made two outstanding plays, catching Durham's fly ball
in center on the run to end the Chicago third and making a diving
catch of Paul Konerko's fly ball to close the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Karsay pitched the ninth for his 15th save in 18
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko hit an RBI single with two outs in the fourth to put
Chicago up 1-0.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Although Tuesday's crowd of 20,005 was considerably smaller
than Monday's sellout of 43,062, the fans still gave the White Sox
players a standing ovation before they took the field as they did
Monday. ... Cleveland outfielder David Justice had to leave the
game after five innings because of a strained abdominal muscle. He
was listed as day to day. ... The loss was only the second in the
last 16 games for the White Sox.

	   NEWARK, N.Y. (AP) - A kindergarten teacher was arrested Tuesday
and charged with videotaping his students as they undressed, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael S. Dorrington, 26, of Geneva, was charged with five
counts of endangering the welfare of a child. He was arraigned and
released on $2,500 bail. Dorrington will be back in court at 10
a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Newark police said Dorrington hid a video camera in a storage
closet in his classroom, then told five girls to go inside and
change into bathing suits as part of ''Water Fun Day'' at Lincoln
Elementary School. A news release did not indicate when the
videotaping allegedly took place.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Dorrington will not return to his teaching position.
</P>
<P>
   School officials have notified the parents of the pupils who
might have been videotaped. Police hope to interview the students
soon.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Tuesday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Orioles-Athletics:
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: Brady Anderson missed his second straight game with a
slight strain of his right quadriceps. Luis Matos took his spot in
center field for the second straight game and made a leaping catch
to rob Randy Velarde of a solo homer in the seventh. Anderson is
expected to be able to return for Wednesday's series finale. ...
The Orioles activated RHP Calvin Maduro from the disabled list and
optioned RHP Gabe Molina to Triple-A Rochester. Maduro had been
sidelined since mid-May with a strained ligament in his elbow.
Molina appeared in three games as a reliever, giving up three runs
in three innings.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: The A's have spent 17 days with at least a share of the
AL West lead this season, after spending a combined 16 days in
first place over the previous five seasons. ... The A's will call
up RHP Ariel Prieto from Triple-A Sacramento in time for him to
start Wednesday's series finale against the Orioles. He will
replace Omar Olivares, who went on the DL last Saturday with a
strained right shoulder. Oakland had been debating whether to bring
up Prieto or LHP Barry Zito to replace Olivares. ''We definitely
took a long, hard look at (Zito), but the people down there thought
Ariel was doing better,'' manager Art Howe said. Howe added that
Prieto's performance Wednesday will determine whether he makes more
than just the one start. He was promoted for one start earlier this
season, and got shelled.
Yankees-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: RHP Roger Clemens (groin) reported improvement after
his third day of workouts and treatment at the team's player
development center in Tampa, Fla. There is no definite return date
for the five-time Cy Young Award, who has not yet resumed a regular
throwing schedule. ... Three of owner George Steinbrenner's special
advisers -- Al Rosen, Clyde King and Bob Kennedy -- were scheduled to
watch Triple-A Columbus on Tuesday night. The trio were at the
Class-A Tampa game Monday. ... Steinbrenner was in Boston, and he
spoke to manager Joe Torre by phone before the game. There were no
developments on trade talks, Torre said. ... Chuck Knoblauch, who
has had problems throwing accurately to first base, will come out
in the late innings for defensive purposes for the near future.
''Hopefully, by August, this doesn't happen. Right now, I think
it's best for everyone,'' Torre said. Knoblauch had assists on the
first two outs of the game, one to his right and one to his left,
and made two more plays flawlessly in the second. ... Derek Jeter
has reached base in 19 of 21 games since returning from the
disabled list on May 27.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: The Red Sox have scored only eight runs in Pedro
Martinez' previous four starts. ... Boston recalled pitcher Tim
Young from Triple-A Pawtucket to take Rob Stanifer's place on the
roster. Stanifer was sent down after allowing nine runs -- one
earned -- on seven hits and a walk in Boston's 22-1 loss to the New
York Yankees on Monday night.... Nomar Garciaparra extended his
hitting streak to 10 games with a first inning bloop single. ...
Martinez struck out six consecutive batters in innings 1-3. ...
Knoblauch was picked off first base in the fourth by Martinez, his
second pickoff of the season and the eighth for the Red Sox.
Tigers-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: The Tigers purchased the contract of RHP Steve Sparks
from Triple-A Toledo. They designated LHP Allen McDill for
assignment. Sparks, a knuckleballer, was 5-11 with a 5.42 ERA with
Anaheim last season. ... 3B Dean Palmer, who sat out Sunday because
of a shoulder spasm, was in the lineup as DH.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays won't know extent C Darren Fletcher's
shoulder injury until later in the week. Dr. James Andrews will
look at X-rays in the next couple of days. ... Rookie OF DeWayne
Wise had surgery on June 19 to remove a pin from his left big toe.
He was transferred to the 60-day disabled list.
Indians-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: OF Manny Ramirez, sidelined since May 29 with a
strained left hamstring, was to see a doctor in Cleveland on
Tuesday because of hemorrhaging in his thigh. Ramirez will be out
at least another week. ''We miss his bat,'' manager Charlie Manuel
said. ''Manny's our RBI guy. We definitely miss him.'' ... RHP
Charles Nagy, who made his first rehab start Monday, rejoined the
team in Chicago Tuesday and will throw on the side Thursday. The
Indians will decide after the side day whether Nagy is ready to
rejoin the rotation. ''We want Charlie to be 100 percent,'' Manuel
said. ... Pitchers Paul Shuey and Sean DePaula, both on the
disabled list, will throw simulated games Wednesday in Chicago. If
all goes well, they will then begin rehab assignments. Shuey is out
with a torn labrum in his right hip while DePaula has tendinitis in
his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Manager Jerry Manuel said he'll probably stay with a
seven-man bullpen until the All-Star break. The White Sox lead the
AL in relief appearances. ... Manuel was impressed by the fans
standing ovation before the players took the field before Monday
night's game. ''Someone mentioned it was like coming home to a
hero's welcome,'' Manuel said. ... The White Sox have agreed to
terms with shortstop Tim Hummel and second baseman Tommy Nicholson,
the second- and 11th-round picks in the June draft. Both will
report to Class A Burlington.
Twins-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Struggling RHP Sean Bergman refused an assignment to
Triple-A Salt Lake City and was placed on waivers Tuesday by the
Twins. The right-hander, claimed on waivers from Atlanta last
October, was 4-5 in 14 starts for the Twins this season with a 9.66
ERA. He gave up 111 hits and 76 runs in 68 innings, with 36
strikeouts and 33 walks. ... SS Cristian Guzman leads the majors in
triples with 11. Going into Tuesday night's game, that put him on
pace for 25. The Twins club record is 16 by Rod Carew in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: LHP Darren Oliver's scheduled start has been pushed back
from Thursday to Saturday to give the Rangers more time to evaluate
an MRI, a bone scan and a nerve test. Oliver (2-4 with a 6.66 ERA
in 13 starts) has had a recurring shoulder problem. Matt Perisho
(2-0, 5.40 ERA) will start Thursday. If Oliver isn't ready
Saturday, the Rangers will recall Ryan Glynn from Triple-A
Oklahoma. Glynn made a spot start earlier this season, and allowed
just two hits in eight shutout innings in a 2-0 victory over the
Dodgers and Kevin Brown. ... Even though the Rangers were in last
place after a 1-8 road trip, their worst in 14 years, GM Doug
Melvin doesn't foresee any major changes soon. ''We've already made
a lot of changes. We need more time to evaluate the situation.''
Melvin said he's also not ready to give up on the season and start
dealing potential free agents such as pitcher John Wetteland and
designated hitter David Segui.
Tampa Bay-Seattle:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: Vinny Castilla, Jose Canseco and Greg Vaughn, who are
all currently on the disabled list, have played together for 31 of
the 68 games. ... The Devil Rays, at 28-40, at the same record
after 68 games as they had last season.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: If RHP Gil Meche isn't able to take his turn in the
rotation on Friday against Baltimore, RHP Brett Tomko will start in
his place. Meche has experienced a ''dead arm'' this season. He
left his last start after throwing 80 pitches on Sunday. Tomko is
eligible to come off the DL on Thursday. He has been sidelined with
tendinitis in his right shoulder.
Royals-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: The Royals, who were outscored 39-11 by Oakland in
three game over the weekend, entered their series at Anaheim having
plummeted eight games in the AL Central standings in two weeks and
were 11 games off the pace. ... Jermaine Dye is leading AL
outfielders in the All-Star balloting, and could become the first
Kansas City player to get a starting nod since Bo Jackson in 1989.
... Jose Rosado, on the DL since May 1 because of tendinitis in his
left shoulder, is scheduled to undergo arthroscopic surgery Friday
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: The Angels invited No. 1 draft pick Joe Torres to
Edison Field to give him a taste of what he has to look forward to
-- if he earns it. ''It makes no difference if you're a first-round
pick or a 30th-round pick, as far as the attention he'll get in
development,'' said manager Mike Scioscia, who had a chance to meet
the left-hander before Torres leaves Sunday for Class-A Boise. ...
The Angels have already played seven games this season in which
they've homered at least four times. Last season they did it on
nine occasions. ... Jason Dickson, who is on the DL because of
tendinitis in his left hip and a sore right shoulder, will make a
rehab start on Wednesday night with Triple-A Edmonton. ... RHP Kent
Bottenfield threw a simulated game Tuesday and is expected to be
activated in time to start Saturday against Minnesota. ''He looked
great. His pitches were sharp and he felt very strong,'' Scioscia
said.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Pirates-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: The Pirates, currently on a four-game losing streak,
have lost 11 of their last 16 -- including five of six -- since
fashioning a season-high four-game winning streak May 29-June 2.
Pittsburgh was a season-high 10 games under .500 heading into
Tuesday night's game. ... RHP Kris Benson, Tuesday's starter, had a
2.08 ERA in his previous 10 starts, allowing just 18 earned runs
over his last 78 innings. Benson has gone seven innings or more in
nine of those starts.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: The Expos had four players with more than 45 RBIs
entering Tuesday night's game, including RF Vladimir Guerrero, who
leads the team with 60 RBIs. 1B Lee Stevens was next with 48,
followed by 2B Jose Vidro (47), and LF Rondell White (46). ...
White missed his second straight start in left due to a sore left
knee. White injured the knee Sunday while trying to beat out a
double play grounder in Chicago. X-Rays done on the knee Tuesday
came back negative. ... Wilton Guerrero started in left for the
second straight game.
Brewers-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Brewers signed RHP Heath McMurray, their
12th-round draft pick in this year's First-Year Players Draft.
McMurray attended Louisiana State and he'll report Ogden, the
Brewers' rookie affiliate in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Preston Wilson entered Tuesday's game leading the
majors with 100 strikeouts and is on pace to break Bobby Bonds'
record of 189 set in 1970. His career ratio of one whiff every 2.88
at-bats is the highest. ... Marlins ailing pitchers are on the
mend. A.J. Burnett will begin a minor league rehab assignment on
July 1, but on June 29, the right-hander will pitch for Double-A
Portland against the Marlins in an exhibition game. ... Set-up man
Dan Miceli, out since May 31 with inflammation of his right
forearm, is scheduled to return before the All-Star break while RHP
Alex Fernandez, who has been out for five weeks with soreness in
his right elbow, isn't close to returning. ''I do think he'll be
back this season, knowing Alex,'' Marlins manager John Boles said.
Phillies-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: The Phillies began their first series this season
at Shea Stadium, the only NL road venue in which they are over
.500. Philadelphia has also beaten New York at Veterans Stadium in
five of last six. ... SS Desi Relaford, who leads the majors with
19 errors, was not in the starting lineup for the second time in
four games. Relaford, the last NL starting shortstop to make an
error this season, has committed 13 in his last 22 games and three
in his last three starts. Alex Arias once again started in his
place. ... Several Phillies, including C Mike Lieberthal, got a
chuckle watching a scoreboard video showing Robin Ventura's
impersonation of Mike Piazza during a recent rain delay at Yankee
Stadium. Ventura took a comical trip around the puddle-filled tarp,
dressed in a Piazza jersey and fake mustache, sliding into second
base and home plate.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Tuesday's starter Mike Hampton finally got nice
weather in which to pitch. Hampton was limited to 47 pitches on
June 11 at Yankee Stadium in a game that was rained out in the
third inning. His next start in Chicago three days later was cut
short after one inning (32 pitches) because of a lengthy rain
delay. Manager Bobby Valentine said the left-hander, who also has
been dealing with a strained left groin, was completely fit to
pitch a full game. Tuesday's game-time temperature was 81 degrees
under sunny blue skies. ... OF Darryl Hamilton, who has not played
soince the first week of the season because of a sprained left
foot, took batting practice and ran Tuesday and might be ready to
be sent out on a rehab assignment by the weekend. ... SS Rey
Ordonez, who broke a bone in his arm last month, is almost free of
pain.
Rockies-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Reliever Gabe White hasn't given up a run in his last
19 2-3 innings, two innings shy of the club record set by Curtis
Leskanic in 1998. ... Jeffrey Hammonds' 54 RBIs left him one shy of
his career high set in 1997 with Baltimore. ... Entering a
three-game series against the Reds, Todd Helton was 12-for-25
(.480) career at Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Starter Pete Harnisch threw 80 pitches in batting
practice. The Reds are hoping to pitch him next Thursday against
St. Louis. Harnisch, the Reds' top winner the last two seasons, has
been on the disabled list since May 6 with a weak shoulder. ...
Manager Jack McKeon said struggling starters Steve Parris and Rob
Bell will stay in the rotation for now because there are no other
options. Reds starters were 0-10 with a 7.34 ERA in the last 13
games.
Cubs-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Entering Tuesday's game, Sammy Sosa needed five hits to
reach the 1,500 mark. ... SS Ricky Gutierrez began an injury rehab
assignment Monday with the Cubs' Daytona Class-A affiliate. He has
been on the DL since May 25 with a separated right shoulder. ...
The Cubs began their longest road trip of the season -- a two-week,
12-game, four-city excursion.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: RHP Kevin McGlinchy (sore right shoulder) threw off the
mound for the first time since going on the DL on May 24. He threw
about 60 percent and is hoping to pitch a couple of minor-league
rehab assignments by the end of the month. ... LHP Odalis Perez,
continuing rehab from a torn medial collateral ligament in his left
shoulder, threw off the mound for the first time since last August.
There is no timetable for his return, but it likely won't be until
next season.
Dodgers-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Entering Tueday's game, the Dodgers were 7-1 on the
road vs. teams from the NL Central, including 3-0 against the Reds,
2-0 vs. the Cubs and 2-1 vs. the Cardinals. ... With C Todd Hundley
playing, the Dodgers averaged 6.04 runs per game in 49 games. Since
he went on the DL May 31, they're averaging 4.44 runs a game.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: OF Richard Hidalgo didn't suit up because of his
sprained right knee and will have an MRI Wednesday. Hidalgo, who is
hitting .283 with a club leading 20 home runs and 54 RBI, left the
game in San Francisco on Sunday after stretching the knee running
to first base. ... With the rash of injuries to key players such as
Ken Caminiti, Roger Cedeno and Billy Wagner, GM Gerry Hunsicker
says the team isn't giving up on the season. But he admits, ''From
now on you're going to see a lot of young guys like the Julio Lugos
and Chris Trubys on a regular basis. Hopefully, that youth will
jump-start the team.''
Giants-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Kirk Rueter, who starts Wednesday, has the
third-highest winning percentage among left-handers since 1980 with
a 74-43 career record. He trails only Randy Johnson (170-89) and
Andy Pettitte (87-49). A native and resident of nearby Hoyleton,
Ill., he's 4-0 with a 2.21 record in six starts at Busch Stadium.
... The Giants have won four straight series against the Cardinals.
... With 26 homers in 58 games, Barry Bonds was off to the quickest
long-ball pace of his career. His previous pre-All-Star break total
was 24 in 1993, when he won the MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: General manager Walt Jocketty skipped the team's
10-day trip on doctor's orders, although he spent some time in the
office. Jocketty had an angioplasty on June 7 after a checkup
detected artery blockage. ... Manager Tony La Russa isn't concerned
that the Cubs might trade Sammy Sosa to the AL and break up a
possible third straight McGwire-Sosa duel. ''I'd be bummed out if
he got traded and they got to be a better club,'' La Russa said.
''This is not a home run competition, it's our club against their
club.'' ... Garrett Stephenson goes for his 10th victory Wednesday
and will try to maintain a perfect record against NL teams. He's
9-0 against the NL and 0-2 against the AL.
Padres-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Brian Tolberg, who pitched Tuesday, is the 10th
starter the Padres have used in 69 games this season. When the
Padres won the NL pennant in 1998, they used just 10 starters all
season. They used just eight last year. ... Going into Tuesday's
game, San Diego was 1-9 at Bank One Ballpark in the 1999 and 2000
seasons, 0-4 this year. ... Before Tuesday's game, the Padres are
4-22 against teams that currently lead their divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: After days of 100-plus degree temperatures that forced
the Bank One Ballpark roof to be closed, it was open Tuesday thanks
to severe afternoon thunderstorms that cooled the air
significantly. ... Arizona's Todd Stottlemyre got his first pickoff
of the season when he caught Damian Jackson off first base in the
second inning. ... Trainers say dehydration and humidity in the
enclosed ballpark caused Randy Johnson's brief dizzy spell on the
mound in the second inning Monday.

Canada's Health System Ranks 30th in UN Assessment
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The World Health Organization has ranked Canada's
health system a lackluster 30th in the world in results obtained
for money spent.
</P>
<P>
   Canada lags developing countries like Colombia, Cyprus, Oman and
Morocco in the first attempt to objectively compare health systems
of 191 UN member states.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment suggests that problems with Canadian medicare are
not simply due to lack of funding, but also to inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
   It appears to support Health Minister Allan Rock's view that
Canada's system needs reform, not just more money.
</P>
<P>
   Canada ranks 10th in the proportion of gross domestic product it
devotes to health, and seventh in health attainment as measured by
indicators such as average healthy life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you compare Canada's level of attainment to what it should
be able to achieve given its resources, that's where Canada drops
to 30th,'' WHO spokesman Christopher Murray said in an interview.

Alliance Memberships Appear in Chaos
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The Quebec campaign of the Canadian Alliance
leadership race appeared to be in chaos Tuesday as organizers for
candidate Tom Long conceded they had found numerous bogus party
memberships in the Gaspe region.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Sauve, Long's principal organizer in Quebec, confirmed
Tuesday that an investigation of 1,656 membership names turned up
600 people who had no knowledge of signing up. Staff are still
working the phones to check on other numbers gathered by campaign
workers in the region, where it was earlier leaked there were 2,800
new members.
</P>
<P>
   The number -- in an area of separatist political leanings with no
Alliance presence -- brought widespread ridicule of the Long
campaign.

Two Sides Square Off in Halifax on Disputed Health Effects of
Perfume
</P>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- The two sides in a raging battle
over the right to bear scent took their fight to the media Tuesday,
although from separate floors of the same hotel.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, activists and researchers claimed a slew of
untested, carcinogenic chemicals are ending up in perfumes and
making people sick with asthma and other respiratory illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, officials from the perfume industry insisted their
scented products are safe and have been the victim of
misinformation.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups held separate news conferences in Halifax, a
small seaside city that has become ground zero for a dispute over
the rights of individuals to wear scents versus those who may have
sensitivities to them.
</P>
<P>
   Halifax has had a ''no-scent encouragement program'' in place
for four years. The policy, which isn't law, encourages people to
be aware of the possible sensitivities of others by not wearing
fragrances.

Hundreds Attend State Funeral of Grant MacEwan in Edmonton
</P>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Hundreds of Albertans gathered in the
provincial capital Tuesday to bid farewell to a man described as
the living, breathing spirit of Western Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we'll have another Grant MacEwan,'' said former
Alberta premier Peter Lougheed, blinking back tears.
</P>
<P>
   MacEwan -- teacher, author, livestock judge, politician and
lieutenant-governor -- died last Thursday at the age of 97, two
years older than the province he served.
</P>
<P>
   Over his lengthy career, he taught at the University of
Saskatchewan for 18 years, served as a Calgary alderman for a
decade, led the Alberta Liberals in 1958-59 and was elected mayor
of Calgary in 1963. In 1965, he was appointed lieutenant-governor,
a post he held to wide acclaim for 8&AMP;frac12; years.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 people attended inside and outside Robertson-Wesley
United Church to say goodbye at the first state funeral in Alberta
since 1963.

<HEADLINE> Three hurt in lake shore accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GORHAM, N.Y. (AP) - A platform fell off an elevator-style tram
used to carry people up the steep banks of Canandaigua Lake's
eastern shore, injuring three women who were tossed onto the narrow
beach or into the lake.
</P>
<P>
   As the women rode down to the lake around 5 p.m. Monday, a
pulley broke away from the tram's motor, sending the platform
streaking 75 to 100 feet down rickety-looking tracks and
catapulting the passengers into the lake, according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The women were rescued by neighbors and passers-by in two boats.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the tram nor the tracks had been inspected, according to
Donna Stebbins, assessor for the town of Gorham, Ontario County.
Permits are not required for older trams like this one, though they
would be for new ones, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The most seriously injured was Denise Leary, 40, of Rochester,
who sustained fractures in both legs and a severe cut to the head.
She was in satisfactory condition at a hospital Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Sage, 52, of Rochester, broke a leg and Kathryn Jackson, 40,
of Batavia, sustained bruises and cuts. They were hospitalized in
fair condition.
</P>
<P>
   Several homemade trams using pulleys and cables operate along
the lake's steep eastern shore, Barnes said. They connect the beach
to homes situated along the top of the banks.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Years after coming to the rescue of victims from
California earthquakes to Pennsylvania blizzards, the government demanded nearly
a half-billion dollars back from states and local communities, federal records
show. The Federal Emergency Management Agency insisted on the refunds after
auditors found the aid wasn't deserved. The nation's disaster relief agency has
recouped $442 million over the last decade, according to FEMA.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a furious last-minute lobbying blitz by the Clinton

Al Gore interrupted presidential campaigning in Kentucky to fly to Washington to
be ready to cast a deciding vote should there be a tie in the
Republican-controlled chamber. He presided over the Senate, but his vote wasn't

<HEADLINE> Plattsburgh students cast no-confidence vote for president  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (AP) - Plattsburgh State's Student Association
cast a no-confidence vote in college President Dr. Horace Judson
after he hired an administrator who was rejected by a search
committee.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in the association's 38-year history that
members have voted no-confidence in the chief administrative
officer, Student Association President Adam McGlynn told The
Plattsburgh Press-Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. Judson has continuously shown no regard for and (has) gone
against the thoughts and opinions of the college community at
large. In our opinion, he made little to no effort in establishing
any relationship with the students of this college,'' the Student
Association's three-page resolution said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are asking the SUNY Board of Trustees to take some action.
I'm not sure if they're aware of what's been going on,'' said Ryan
Courtien, vice president for academics in the Student Association.
</P>
<P>
   Judson was unavailable for comment Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The recent hiring of Dr. Donald Peters to the vice presidency
for student affairs despite the committee's opposition ''was the
straw that broke the camel's back,'' the students said.

<HEADLINE> Scores Killed in Indonesia Violence  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A Protestant preacher said Tuesday he
buried scores of fellow Christians killed on a remote island in
eastern Indonesia, victims of religious violence that has been
spiraling for nearly two years. There were reports that 161 people
died.
</P>
<P>
   Smith Dungir said he survived Monday's rampage in the mostly
Christian village of Duma by hiding in his church from mobs of some
4,000 Muslim fighters. The church was set on fire, he said, as were
houses all over Halmahera island.
</P>
<P>
   ''I helped bury 161 bodies before I left,'' Dungir said by
telephone. ''It is a miracle that I am alive.'' The victims were
buried Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The violence in Duma was the latest brutal round of religious
killings in the Maluku islands, also known as the Moloccas, the
once fabled Spice Islands. The islands are 1,600 miles northeast of
Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,500 members of both faiths have been killed in the
past 18 months. Last December hundreds of Muslims were slain by
marauding Christian gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on Monday's death toll varied. Police said 116 were
killed, almost all Christians. The military said 108 died, but
refused to say what their religions were.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thousands of Muslims walked into the village and started
shooting,'' said Pattiasina, a church worker who quoted other
survivors of the attack who sought shelter in the nearby town of
Tobelo. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the dead were adult men. Some died of gunshots, some
by homemade bombs and other by swords,'' said Dungir, the pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses said some Muslims were armed with military-style
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Dungir said about 30 soldiers posted in Duma could not do much
to stop the attackers. The Muslim fighters were later dispersed by
military reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   Local Muslim groups said they had few details about the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   The violence shows no sign of abating in the Maluku islands,
despite repeated peace efforts by Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid, a Muslim cleric who espouses religious tolerance. The attack
happened while he was on an overseas tour and he has not commented
on it.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Pope John Paul II urged Indonesia's leaders
to do more to stop the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 210 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's most populous Islamic country.
</P>
<P>
   Christians, however, are a majority in the Maluku islands,
formerly renowned for its religious tolerance before communal
violence broke out in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some blame the conflict on economic and social pressure from an
increasing numbers of Muslim settlers from other parts of the
sprawling Southeast Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago an Islamic group, calling itself Laskar
Jihad, or ''Holy War Force,'' was accused of dispatching more than
2,000 Islamic paramilitary troops into Maluku to counter a round of
Christian attacks.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Urges Calm Amid Virus Fears  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- The government on Tuesday moved to
dispel fears of a recurrence of a viral epidemic that killed more
than 100 people last year and ruined pig farms across Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Health authorities in northern Perak state killed more than
1,700 hogs on a farm over the weekend to prevent a return of the
Nipah virus, newspapers and the national Bernama news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a 46-year-old woman living near the hog farm
in Gopeng town was tested positive for the virus, which is
transmitted from pigs to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Tuesday that
authorities were trying to contain the virus and insisted the
problem was confined to Perak.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the information obtained, we took steps to contain the
outbreak several days ago,'' Abdullah was quoted as saying by
Bernama.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pig farmers in the affected areas have also been asked to
cooperate by not taking their livestock out for sale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The virus swept through a large part of Malaysia early last
year.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent its spread, the government ordered the destruction of
a million pigs in the Southeast Asian nation that is the region's
biggest pork producer. The last case was reported in July 1999 and
the epidemic was declared over in October.
</P>
<P>
   Government health officials, believing that there are still some
infected pigs, have been conducting random tests in Perak state.
Any hog farm found with even one infected pig must destroy its
entire stock.

New Jersey spends the most in the nation on schools - again
Eds: Story embargoed until 12:01 a.m. Wednesday
By NANCY PARELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey again spent more per pupil than
any other state in the U.S., according to a U.S. Census Bureau
report.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996-97 school year, New Jersey schools, on average,
spent $9,461 per student. The national average is $5,873.
</P>
<P>
   New York was second at $8,467, followed by Alaska ($8,213) and
Connecticut ($7,998), according to the latest school-finance
figures from the Census Bureau, released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has been the top spender since 1992 - with the
exception of 1994 when Washington, D.C., was first and New Jersey
was second, according to Sharon Meade, a Census Bureau analyst.
</P>
<P>
   State officials and school board representatives said New Jersey
spends more because it values education.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a reflection of the fact that New Jersey citizens and its
government value quality education,'' said John Crosbie, state
education department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The money allocated to schools nationwide has increased 30
percent from 1991-92 to 1996-97, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Spending was $307.5 billion in the 1996-97 year, up from $236.3
billion in 1991-92, according to the bureau's analysis of local,
state and federal records.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the school-funding pie is essentially divided the same way
it was nearly a decade ago. The federal government's share on
average is about 7 percent. States contribute 49 percent and the
rest comes from local tax coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of New Jersey's school funding - $5,978 per student - comes
from local taxes, with the state ranking second in local dollars
spent, after Washington, D.C. Nationally, the average local share
is $3,021. State spending on education ranks ninth at $3,909,
compared to the national average of $3,288.
</P>
<P>
   Some policy-makers and educators say the state needs to boost
the amount it sends to local districts to reduce schools' heavy
reliance on property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The state also ranks first in teacher salaries, with $4,226 per
student, compared to the national average of $2,641. It's also
first in spending on instruction costs, which include salaries, at
$5,788 per student, compared to the national average of $3,628.
</P>
<P>
   And New Jersey ranks second behind Maryland when it comes to
school administrative spending at $524 per pupil, compared to $342
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a combination of factors,'' said Frank Belluscio,
spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association. ''We do
have a strong commitment to public education in New Jersey. You
also have to weigh the fact that we're in a higher cost region.''
</P>
<P>
   The state is often criticized for spending more and getting
less.
</P>
<P>
   While average SAT test scores are inching up, New Jersey
students still lag behind the national average.
</P>
<P>
   High school students who graduated in 1999 scored an average of
498 on the verbal portion of the exam, below the national average
of 505. New Jersey's average math score was 510, just below the 511
national math average.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say that's because so many more students take
the SATs.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, 80 percent of high school graduates took the SAT
exams, nearly twice the national average of 43 percent. Belluscio
said the state ranks second in math scores among states where 60
percent or more of students take the test.
</P>
<P>
   The state is taking steps to improve performance, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've put mechanisms in place to ensure that we are using the
money to effectively educate children,'' Belluscio said, citing the
state's education standards, which are being implemented in schools
around the state.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 5, Twins 2  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Kenny Rogers allowed just five hits over
eight-plus innings as the Texas Rangers returned home after their
worst road trip in 14 years with a 5-2 win over the Minnesota Twins
on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers (6-5), who had two no-decisions in games the Rangers lost
during their 1-8 trip, set the Twins down in order in five of the
six innings after Minnesota got its only run in the second inning.
He retired 13 in a row before walking Matt Lawton to start the
ninth and then allowing a double to Butch Huskey.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland, who had gone three appearances since his last
save June 5, came on for his 17th save in 21 opportunities. Denny
Hocking had an RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, starting a stretch of 13 road games in 13 days, lost
for the eighth time in 10 games. The Twins had won five of the
first six games this season against the Rangers, after losing all
12 in the series a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers struck out five and walked three, but has allowed just 18
hits over 27 1-3 innings in June. In his last start, last Wednesday
at Baltimore, Rogers allowed six earned runs in an 11-10 Texas
loss. He had season highs with seven strikeouts and five walks.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota starter Mark Redman (4-3) lost his third straight
start. He allowed four runs and 11 hits in four innings with four
strikeouts and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   Texas went ahead for good when Gabe Kapler's solo homer to
right, his first since April 18, made it 2-1 in the second inning.
He was 2-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler has a six-game hitting streak and is 14-for-40 (.350)
since coming off the disabled list June 9 after missing 33 games
with a quadriceps injury. He has four homers this season, including
in his first two Texas at-bats in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lamb singled on the pitch right after Kapler's homer and
later scored on Rusty Greer's RBI single to make it 3-1. Greer hit
the second of three straight two-out singles that loaded the bases
for the Rangers before Rafael Palmeiro struck out.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers left the bases loaded again in the third, without
scoring a run, when Luis Alicea grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea and Palmeiro did, however, combine for the first Rangers
run. Alicea led off the first with a double and scored on
Palmeiro's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro also had an RBI single in the fourth inning, and Royce
Clayton had and RBI single for the last run an inning later off
reliever Mike Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota got even at 1-1 in the second when David Ortiz led off
with a double and Corey Koskie hit an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Hocking tried to make it 2-1 but was called out by umpire
Bruce Froemming after trying to score on Chad Moeller's groundout
to third. Though television replays showed Hocking's leg touching
the plate before he was tagged high by Texas catcher Ivan
Rodriguez, there was no obvious argument from the Minnesota bench
about the rare 5-3-2 double play.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rogers walked Twins leadoff hitter Jay Canizaro, then got
out of the first inning with three straight fielder's choice
grounders. ... Moeller, a catcher recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake
City earlier in the day, made his major league debut. ... Texas had
lost 10 of its previous 11 games. ... The Rangers play 14 of their
next 17 games before the All-Star break at home.

<HEADLINE> Martinique Mayor, Poet To End Tenure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) -- Aime Cesaire, the poet and
philosopher who helped found the ''Negritude'' movement in Paris,
says he is ending his 55-year tenure as mayor of Martinique's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have accomplished the job I had to do,'' the 86-year-old
Cesaire was quoted as saying in the weekend edition of
Frances-Antilles newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   An icon of black pride, he has been mayor of Fort-de-France,
capital of the French Caribbean island, since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Cesaire, who influenced writers such as Langston Hughes and Maya
Angelou, coined the word ''negritude'' to describe the black
identity and blacks' need to understand their history and the
history of race relations. His black awareness teachings and
vigorous criticism of colonialism helped spur the post-World War II
independence movement in Africa and his native Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The Progressive Party of Martinique that Cesaire founded in 1958
will meet to find another candidate for mayor. Cesaire said he will
not present a protege.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not a monarch. I have no heir, no successor,'' Cesaire
said. ''The choice will be made by the people of Martinique.''

<HEADLINE> Canada Soldiers Face Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Criminal charges could be filed against Canadian
soldiers accused of poisoning an officer in Croatia in 1993, a
military official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   An initial military investigation concluded last month it was
too late to file charges against soldiers who allegedly put
antifreeze, boot polish and other substances into coffee consumed
by Matt Stopford, a warrant officer.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators charge that the soldiers wanted to disable
Stopford because they feared he would lead them into danger. But
they said that because a three-year statute of limitations had
expired, no charges could be filed.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Canada's chief of defense staff, Gen. Maurice Baril,
said a special military panel that reviewed the case reached a
different conclusion. He said the case would be turned over to the
Ontario attorney general for consideration of criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Stopford, who is blind in one eye and suffers from unexplained
bleeding and joint problems, said Tuesday that only a public
inquiry could bring out the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Similar ailments among other peacekeepers raised accusations
that they were exposed to toxic waste or other hazardous material
in Croatia. A separate military inquiry found no hazardous material
in soil samples taken last summer from the areas in Croatia where
the Canadians served.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Chuck Knoblauch Ejected  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- This time, Chuck Knoblauch's throw was right on
target.
</P>
<P>
   After being called out for interference on his way to first
base, the Yankees second baseman threw his helmet onto the field
and was ejected from Tuesday night's 3-0 victory over Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did a stupid thing. That's all,'' he said. ''Sometimes you
do stupid things and I did a stupid thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch has attracted attention the past week for his
struggles in the field, making three wild throws on Thursday before
he was sent home early by manager Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
   He made another throwing error on Saturday -- his 13th error of
the season -- hitting a fan in the stands. Torre said that he would
use a defensive replacement for the 1997 Gold Glove winner for the
immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a temporary situation,'' Torre said. ''A guy
doesn't win a Gold Glove and then proceed to forget how he did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's arm wasn't the problem on Tuesday, though. His legs
were.
</P>
<P>
   He had four assists and two putouts in the first five innings
against Boston, making one play deep in the hole behind second base
to throw out Jose Offerman to end the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   But Knoblauch was picked off first base after singling to start
the fourth inning. Then he was called out for running inside the
basepath in the sixth after hitting a slow roller back to the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   Replays showed Knoblauch was barely on the inside edge of the
baseline when Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez hit him in the back
with a throw to first. First base umpire Bill Miller called
Knoblauch out; as he returned to the dugout, he threw his helmet
back onto the field and was immediately ejected by home plate
umpire Larry Young.
</P>
<P>
   ''He threw the helmet because he was frustrated,'' Torre said.
''I'm sure he came in and saw the replay and saw that he was inside
the line. He was illegal on that play.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay Bellinger, the designated defensive replacement for
Knoblauch during his throwing troubles, took over at second base in
the bottom of the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch was on the other side of the interference rule during
Game 2 of the 1998 AL Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 1-1 in the 12th, Cleveland's Travis Fryman
dropped a sacrifice bunt down the first base line. Yankees first
baseman Tino Martinez fielded the ball and threw to Knoblauch, who
was covering first.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's throw hit Fryman in the back and bounced behind
Knoblauch, but he ignored the ball and argued that Fryman had
interfered. Meanwhile, Enrique Wilson, who was on first, circled
the bases and scored to propel the Indians to a 4-1 victory.

<HEADLINE> Parrish Signs With Yankees, Dad Says  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- University of Michigan catcher David
Parrish has signed a contract with the New York Yankees that
includes a $1.4 million signing bonus, said his father, Detroit
Tigers coach and ex-All-Star catcher Lance Parrish.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees selected Parrish in the first round, the 28th pick
overall, in the amateur draft two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''David is very, very excited,'' said his father, who negotiated
his son's signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish, 21, will start with the Yankees' Staten Island club in
the Class A New York-Penn League.
</P>
<P>
   In his junior season at Michigan this year, he was the
Wolverines' MVP, leading the team in batting average (.356), home
runs (11), RBIs (41) and slugging percentage (.621).
</P>
<P>
   He was the first Michigan player drafted in the first round
since pitcher Jim Abbott was chosen by the California Angels in
1988.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Attica guard stands by inmates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Corrections officer Michael Smith
testified Tuesday that the state should own up to its role in the
September 1971 Attica prison uprising, the bloodiest in American
history.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was blindfolded and paraded atop the Attica prison catwalk
on Sept. 13, 1971. One inmate held a knife to his throat, another
had a spear and a third a ball-peen hammer. But the inmates never
hurt him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When state troopers stormed the prison though, their bullets hit
him five times. Smith said there were ''deadly errors'' made the
day the state retook the prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I'm most frustrated by is I think we've probably got the
best system of justice in the world,'' Smith testified Tuesday in
U.S. District Court in Rochester. ''In this event it's been
politically manipulated. And that's beyond unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Michael Telesca allowed Smith, who never
returned to work at the prison after the riot, to testify in the
civil case brought by inmates who were at Attica during the riot.
The state has agreed to an $8 million settlement for the inmates in
the 25-year-old civil case; $4 million more will go to lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Attica stands as the nation's deadliest prison uprising. In all,
43 people died - 32 inmates and 11 prison employees. One guard,
William Quinn, was killed by inmates. The rest died in the gunfire
during the retaking.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public is still under the general misconception that
inmates killed hostages,'' said Smith, who lives in Bliss, Wyoming
County. ''With the exception of Bill Quinn, that did not happen.''

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Adrienne Goodson scored 23 points to lead
the Utah Starzz to a 66-63 WNBA victory over the expansion Seattle
Storm on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was a franchise-record fourth in a row for the
Starzz, and their 7-5 record is their best for the first 12 games
of a season.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (2-8) has lost three straight.
</P>
<P>
   Margo Dydek scored 17 points and pulled down eight rebounds for
the Starzz. But Dydek went to the sideline with a sprained right
ankle with 9:37 left. In the four minutes she was out, Seattle made
a 7-0 run to narrow Utah's lead to 54-51.
</P>
<P>
   But Utah held on as Seattle never got closer than 65-63 in the
final minute.
</P>
<P>
   Edna Campbell led the Storm with 17 points, including 11 in the
second half. Kamila Vodichkova added 14 and reserve Michelle
Edwards scored 10.
</P>
<P>
   Utah played for the second straight game without All-Star
forward Natalie Williams, who strained her lower back in pregame
warmups Sunday and is listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   She was replaced Tuesday by rookie Naomi Mulitauaopele, who tied
her season high with 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   The game was played at the Delta Center before 5,376 fans.

<HEADLINE> Second Quake in 4 Days Hits Iceland  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The second earthquake in four days hit Iceland
early Wednesday and was felt throughout the island nation, the U.S.
Geological Survey said. There were no immediate reports of damage
or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The geological survey said the quake had a preliminary magnitude
of 6.6, the same as Saturday afternoon's shock, and struck 45 miles
east-southeast of Reykjavik, the capital, also like the last.
</P>
<P>
   The quake occurred 6.2 miles below ground, which scientists
characterized as ''very shallow.'' It hit at 12:51 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's temblor caused some electrical and water outages.
Before the past two quakes, the last event of that size took place
in Iceland in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   Iceland, where there are many active volcanoes, frequently
experiences minor earthquakes.
