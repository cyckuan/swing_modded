<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The British ruling Conservative
Party is heading for a massive defeat in the general election, its
defector George Gardiner said.
</P>
<P>
"Tory seats are going to go down the toilet in an almighty
flush," the BBC TV quoted Gardiner as saying today.
</P>
<P>
He said his shift to the Referendum Party had not hindered the
prime minister's electoral chances.
</P>
<P>
Gardiner urged Prime Minister John Major to "get off the fence"
and state the Government's position on EMU and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Gardiner's resignation was announced on Saturday and put John
Major's government in a minority of two in embattled
Conservatives.

<HEADLINE> Greek Government Searches for Job-Creation Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government is seriously
considering important changes in employment relations, especially
concerning the working week and the cost of labour, in order to
tackle the country's unemployment problem.
</P>
<P>
According to the local Greek weekly "To Vima" (The Tribune)
today, the government is looking for consensus reforms, acceptable
both to the employers and the unions.
</P>
<P>
Among the measures being discussed is making the working week
more adaptable so that, in periods of peak activity, employers can
use workers for more than eight hours, provided that the overall
working week averages 40 hours over a year. This would help
contain costs by allowing employers to avoid paying overtime.
</P>
<P>
Another measure would involve the provision of incentives to
firms that hire special categories of unemployed, such as young
people under the age of 25. These firms will pay two percent less
for social security, with the balance being provided by the state
employment office. Such measures have already been applied in
other European countries, with positive results.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment in the country currently stands at 10.3
percent with the young people high on the unemployment list. While
the jobless rate among Greeks aged 25-65 is 7.4 percent, it rises
to 29.8 percent for young people under 24. Young women are at an
even greater disadvantage: unemployment among them was 40.6
percent in 1995, compared with 20.3 percent for young men.

<HEADLINE> Girl Education Strengthened in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is
committed to ensuring that girls have the same education
opportunities as boys so as to bridge the gender gap in the
country.
</P>
<P>
This was said by Grace Mulapesi, the permanent secretary for
the gender in development division, at a function here today to
mark the International Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
She said that women's full participation will only become a
reality when girl education is given top priority by the society.
</P>
<P>
She noted that if women continue to be marginalized, the
nation will not attain full development.
</P>
<P>
At the function, another speaker Nancy Oloro stressed that the
nation can achieve true economic and political development only
when women are regarded as equal partners and into full
partnership with men in all the fields.
</P>
<P>
Gender bias is reportedly available around Zambia,
particularly in rural areas where many girls do not receive or
only get poor education because of hard life and traditional
prejudice. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Maria Mutola of Mozambique burst
into tears after winning her third successive women's 800m title
at the world indoor athletics championships here on Sunday and
dedicated the victory to her father who was killed a fortnight
ago.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Mutola, who won in a time of 1min 58.96
seconds, said she had returned to Mozambique after hearing of his
death and thought about not coming to Paris.
</P>
<P>
"He was so influential and the closest friend I had. I was
unable to eat or sleep for three days. However, my mother and
sisters persuaded me to come and defend my title. I have done
that and I dedicate this to my wonderful late father," Mutola
said.
</P>
<P>
Mutola, who lost her outdoor world title when she was
disqualified in the semi-finals in Gothenburg in 1995, said she
would probably just stick to 800 meters outdoors this season and
try and beat the new powerhouse in the event Svetlana Masterkova
of Russia.
</P>
<P>
"I was ill with pneumonia when I lost to her in Atlanta, but
having said that I know I will have to run 1:55 if I am to have a
chance of winning the outdoors title," Mutola said.
</P>
<P>
Mutola beat home Natalya Dukhnova of Belarus, who took the
silver in 1:59. 31, while Joetta Clark of the United States took
third in 1:59.82, a personal best.

<HEADLINE> Road Situation in Zimbabwe Deteriorates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Road situation is deteriorating
fast as many roads have gone unattended for years due to reduced
state funding in Zimbabwe which was once hailed as one of the few
African countries with well-developed road infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Director of Roads Ngoni Kudenga said here today that most of
the roads, under pressure from increased traffic volumes, mainly
heavily-loaded international trucks, need to be rehabilitated
urgently.
</P>
<P>
Over 72.7 million U.S. Dollars is needed annually to
rehabilitate the country's major roads, most of which are 10
years older than their design life, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is proposed that a road fund and a board will be put in
place to oversee the distribution of funds for maintenance to
departments of roads, urban councils and rural district
councils," he said.
</P>
<P>
The public sector would continue to be involved in the
construction of roads through issuing tenders for contractors and
consultants. enditem

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian President Calls For Sustainable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian president Negasso
Gidada today called on Ethiopian development associations to
jointly use resources under their disposal in nation-wide
endeavours to bring about sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by the president when he was addressing the
special fund raising program organized by the Oromo development
association at Addis Ababa exhibition center.
</P>
<P>
Negasso said his government will do all in its capacity to
reinforce indigenous development associations whose contribution
for economic growth is indispensable.
</P>
<P>
The government, he said, would intensify efforts to build a
peaceful democratic social order which will lay fertile ground
for those interested to further enhance development ventures.
</P>
<P>
A number of development associations have been formed to
coordinate and organize development activities the public has
started to undertake in a bid to extricate itself from abject
poverty and backwardness, he said.
</P>
<P>
The associations with financial and technical assistance they
receive from both foreign and indigenous donors coupled with the
material and labour contributions from the public have
constructed schools, clinics, roads and other infrastructures, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed firm belief that the Oromo development
association will promote development schemes now underway in the
region to an ever high standard fully exploiting the fund raising
program it has launched.
</P>
<P>
Supporters, both from the country and abroad, have pledged
107,883,304.80 birr (about 16,157,451 dollars) during the meeting
from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Oromo region, the largest region in Ethiopia, is situated in
southern part of Ethiopia and has about 40 percent of the
country's population.

<HEADLINE> Israel Promises to Pullback Further From West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai today said that Israel would complete within a
few days the first stage of further troop pullbacks in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai held consultations this morning with senior army,
police and security officials to discuss the preparation for the
pullout. Later he toured the areas to be handed over to the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
He said that, barring a few remaining details to be worked
out, the army was ready to implement the cabinet decision made
Friday on pulling out from another 9 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"We can do it in a very short time. I think in two to three
days, it can be completed, all the redeployments in the area,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister defended the cabinet decision of handing over
more land to the PNA despite the strong opposition from some
coalition members who threaten to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to continue the peace process with the
Palestinians. It is necessary to give more and more authority to
the Palestinians, and at the same time not to damage the
security of Israel and security of the settlements in Judea and
Samaria, and not to damage the rights of Jews in the area,"
Mordechai said.
</P>
<P>
Because the 9 percent of land concerned includes 2 percent of
the Area C which is under Israeli complete control, this has
aroused strong protests from ultra-rightist members within the
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The government is currently facing a real crisis of collapse
because eight Knesset (Parliament) members within the coalition
have threatened to rebel against the government in the
no-confidence vote this week. Voting with the 54 opposition
Knesset members, they could bring down the government with the
the required 61 votes in the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The influential Council of Settlers in Judea and Samaria (or
West Bank and Gaza Strip) has denounced the government's decision
to transfer more land to the PNA and called on sympathetic
lawmakers to vote against the government.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the PNA has also denounced the Israeli decision on
the first stage of the three-phase redeployments.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the PNA has expected Israel to hand over more than 9
percent of the West Bank; secondly, it also criticized Israel for
making unilateral decision on the scope of further redeployments
without consulting with the Palestinian leadership.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the PNA only controls 3 percent of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, while Israel retains control over 70 percent of
the land. The rest area, called Area B, is under joint
Israeli-Palestinian control which means Israel having security
control and the PNA having civil control.
</P>
<P>
The PNA hopes to gain control over about 80 percent of the
territories after Israel completes the three-phase redeployments
by mid-1998. However, Israel has declared that it would refuse
to hand over more than 50 percent of the territories to the
Palestinian self-rule.

<HEADLINE> Italian Aid Agency's Convoy Ambushed in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Two security guards for a
convoy of an Italian aid agency were shot dead while at least
eight others wounded during an ambush in EL-Gudud Mosque village
controlled by Ali Mahdi Mohamed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The convoy of the agency called CISP, consisting of five
vehicles, was attacked by a number of gunmen who had erected a
road lock just outside the village, about 180 kilometers north of
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The motorcade returned from EL-Dher district after having
transported medicine and health utensils there from capital
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The wounded, five of them CISP militiamen working at the
agency premises in north Mogadishu, include a woman who also
works for the agency and two attackers.
</P>
<P>
Most of the wounded were rushed to the ICRC-run Keysaney
hospital in north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The reason of the attack has not yet been made clear.
</P>
<P>
However, reports from the area said a group of armed people
had set up the blockade there in reprisal against another faction
who was suspected for hijacking a lorry from them.
</P>
<P>
The agency lost none of its vehicle in the ambush to the
gunmen, who fled after two of them were wounded.
</P>
<P>
CISP is the second aid convoy attacked by gunmen in the past
three days.
</P>
<P>
A motorcade of 24 trucks carrying with maize seeds to Bardera
of the Gedo region were attacked in Badoa by fighters loyal to
Hussein Mohamed Aidid two days ago.
</P>
<P>
CISP, running a hospital in EL-dher, 350 kilometers north of
Mogadishu, launched a major health operation in El-dher and
Harardhere districts of Mudug and Galgudud regions of central
Somalia on November 25.
</P>
<P>
During the CISP operation, eye clinics for more than 157 blind
and semi-blind patients in those regions were restored with eye
lenses and medicines offered free by the agency to the patients
after they had received eye surgeries. enditem

<HEADLINE> AL: US Veto Contradicts Previous Stances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) said today that
the U.S. veto of a draft U.N. resolution banning Israel's housing
project in Arab East Jerusalem contradicts previous U.S. stance
on settlement.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. veto at the U.N. Security Council contradicts the
remarks made by U.S. President Bill Clinton and previous American
positions that considered Jewish settlements illegal and an
obstacle to peace," the Cairo-based Arab alliance said in a
statement released today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the AL appreciated the positions adopted by the
other 14 Security Council member countries that supported the
European-sponsored draft resolution, which calls on Israel to
refrain from any action with negative implications for the peace
process and to abide by its obligations under international
law.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Israel's biggest ally and sponsor of the peace
process, last week joined an international chorus of disapproval
over Israel's plan to build 6,500 Jewish homes on Abu Ghoneim (Har
Homa), a tree-covered hill in Arab East Jerusalem. However, the
U.S. vetoed the draft resolution Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the AL supports the Arab and
non-aligned groups at the U.N. for turning the matter to the
185-member U.N. General Assembly, where there is no veto.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the AL has been following up
developments of the U.S. reaction towards the Israeli settlement
activities since Clinton held a meeting with Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat in Washington on March 3.
</P>
<P>
The AL statement echoed the Palestinian opinion that the veto
runs contrary to the U.S. letters of guarantees relayed to the
Palestinian side at the Madrid peace conference. The letter says
that no change would be made on the demographic features of the
Holy City.

<HEADLINE> PNA Vows to Resist Israeli Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian Authority
official today warned that the Palestinians would adopt practical
measures to confront the Israeli government's policy of
settlement, according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press
service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Abdel Rahman, Palestinian Cabinet Secretary, made the
statement when he was addressing the first Conference of the
Islamic National Committee of Defending Land in Gaza. Rahman,
who was introduced to speak on behalf of Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat, said that the time for passive resistance to
construction of Jewish settlement is over.
</P>
<P>
From now on, he added, it is of no use to carry on
the struggle by means of words of protests or to complaints to
the U.N. Security Council due to U.S. opposition.
</P>
<P>
"Israel enjoys a full U.S. support to bypass the
international law," said Rahman, referring to U.S. veto Friday
during a Security Council debate on a draft resolution calling
on Israel to abandon plans for a new Jewish settlement at
Har Homa in the Arab East Jerusalem. The vote in the
15-nation council was 14 in favor, with only the U.S.
opposing the resolution, which was sponsored by four of its
European allies -- Britain, France, Portugal, and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Rahman said, "We don't want the U.S. to become an enemy
for Palestinians, but want it to stand by the right,
justice and the international legitimacy."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Bomb Hezbollah Targets in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes carried out
this afternoon an air strike at the bases of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, no words on casualties have been given by the security
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Several Israeli jet fighters dived from the overcast sky at
the sunset and attacked hills west of the Machghara town in
Western Beqaa, opposite to the east sector of the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The warplanes fired six air-to-surface missiles in three
bombing rounds at the vicinities of the Ein Amin village at 5:20
p.m. (15:20 GMT), security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The anonymous sources estimated the weight of each missile
at 500 tons, noting that explosions echoed at every corner
of Western Beqaa, some 80 kilometers southeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli planes also released hot balloons in order to
avert upward shots fired by Lebanese army artillery and Hezbollah
guerrillas in the area.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Islamic Resistance, the military wing of
Hezbollah, confirmed the air raid in the southwest part of
the Beqaa Valley, saying that the bombed hill was a no-man's
area.
</P>
<P>
This was the second Israeli air raid at Hezbollah targets
in south Lebanon in 24 hours. No casualties were caused in
the previous air strike at Iglim Al-Toffah 60 kilometers
southeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Today's offensive followed an attack by Hezbollah militants
at an Israeli position in the central sector of the buffer
zone, Israel said one soldier was wounded in the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance announced that one of its tanks
opened fire at an Israeli Merkava tank at Kassarat Orouj near
Rihan in the Jezzine area and "directly hit the enemy tank,
killing and wounding all elements of the crew."
</P>
<P>
This was the first time the Shiite guerrilla group admitted
that it used tanks in military operation against Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
It added that its artillery also bombarded Kassarat Orouj,
when Israeli reinforcing troops arrived at the position, "and
caused additional casualties among the Israeli forces."
</P>
<P>
Radio Israel confirmed that several missiles were fired by
Lebanese guerrillas at the position of Kassarat Orouj this
afternoon, and one Israeli soldier was wounded when his tank was
hit by one missile.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that the wounded was transported by a
helicopter to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone' in
1985 in a bid to protect northern Israel from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.

CAIRO, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) said today that

<HEADLINE> U.N. Should not Reform by Damaging Its Functions: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Reforms on the United Nations
should not sacrifice its social and economic functions, Nigeria's
Ambassador to U.N. Ibrahim Gambari said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria in New York,
the ambassador said Nigeria is opposed to any reform that will
hinder the U.N. social-economic functions.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed concern that the reforms may result in a
disproportionate cut in U.N. staff.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is pressure from the United States and
other western powers to contract the economic and social aspects
of U.N..
</P>
<P>
"What we will like to see is in fact for the U.N. to
strengthen its activities in social-economic areas so as to
impact more positively on Africa and reduce the undue influence
of the Bretton Woods Institutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said U.N. has made a great impact on Africa in the areas of
peacekeeping, conflict resolution,, decolonization and the
struggle against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, U.N.'s impact on Africa's social and economic
development has been less significant, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly want to preserve the regional economic
commissions...We are very proud of the work of the economic
commission for Africa," said Gambari, also Nigeria's permanent
representative to U.N..
</P>
<P>
For many western countries, reform means cutting staff, and
when that was done in the past, the cuts fell disproportionately
on third world countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"If staff have to be cut, which should not be the principal
purpose of reform, then there should be equality of sacrifice,"
he said, adding that reform should be aimed at making U.N. more
efficient and effective.
</P>
<P>
Gambari commended the efforts so far made by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in reforming U.N..
</P>
<P>
Nigeria supports Annan, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully in support of the secretary-general. He has laid
out his plans which we think is cautious and realistic," he said.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier separate interview also with the News Agency of
Nigeria, Gambari restated Nigeria's quest for a permanent seat in
the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"It is about the capacity and willingness to maintain
international peace and security, and indeed even our biggest
critic must really acknowledge Nigeria as a major contributor to
the maintenance of international peace and security," he said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Albania Crisis Worries Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The crisis in neighboring Albania,
which has lasted for more than two months now, has worried Greece
and Athens is anxious to see an early end of the crisis in that
country.
</P>
<P>
The safety of lives and property of the ethnic Greeks living in
Albania is considered by the Greek government as the most
important element in relations between the two countries, which
experienced a stormy relations in 1994 when five ethnic Greeks
were charged and arrested by Albanian authorities for alleged
spying and possessing illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
There is large ethnic Greek minority in the south of the
neighboring country, estimated by the Greek side at some 300,000,
where the situation has been deteriorated and the government has
lost control of some important towns such as Vlora, Tepelena,
Sarande and Delvina.
</P>
<P>
Fears among the minority were heightened by reports that some
ethnic Greeks were attacked, shops burnt and property looted in
the region. "This is an attempt to terrorize the Greeks", a report
by the correspondent of a major Greek TV channel Mega said.
Hundreds of people fled the area, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis held telephone talks with
Albanian President Sali Berisha earlier in the week to ask him to
guarantee the safety of the ethnic Greeks while Greek Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos told CNN that one of the main
interests concerning Greece "is to protect this community we have
in southern Albania".
</P>
<P>
Greece shares a common border of 150 kilometers with Albania
and it fears tens of thousands of Albanians might try to flee over
the border, making Athens especially conscious of the explosive
situation in Albania.
</P>
<P>
"We have managed to keep 300,000 Albanian immigrants in Greece
but we cannot afford to have any more," the Foreign Minister
declared. These illegal immigrants entered the country after the
big changes took place in 1992 in Albania.
</P>
<P>
The third reason that worries Greece is that the crisis may
destabilize the region, threatening the peace and stability in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The crisis could be more explosive than the war in Bosnia. If
hotheads hijack policy in Kosovo or Macedonia, where large number
of ethnic Albanians live, Greece will have a huge problem right on
its doorstep, observers here noted.
</P>
<P>
In short, the large Greek monority in southern Albania, the
fear of a massive new influx of Albanian refugees and the
possibility of Macedonia too being destabilized make Tirana's
problems the problems of Athens.
</P>
<P>
In order to defuse the tense situation in Albania, Greece has
tried to push for a peaceful settlement to the crisis. It sent its
Foreign Under secretary Yannos Kranidiotis to Tirana on Saturday to
meet Berisha and political party leaders.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Press in Tirana after the meetings, Kranidiotis
stressed that Greece, along with the European Union, believed in a
political solution to the crisis with new elections.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's DYP Supports Efforts on Curbing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's True Path Party (DYP)
today reaffirmed its stance in favor of implementing the
recommendations made by the military on curbing fundamentalist
activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, DYP deputy chairman
Mehmet Golhan said that the measures proposed at the
military-dominated National Security Council (NSC) were aimed at
maintaining the country's integrity, saying " there must be no
doubt that the recommendations will be carried out."
</P>
<P>
Chaired by President Suleyman Demirel, the NSC council met on
February 28 and issued a 22-point communique urging the
coalition government to take effective measures to curb the
increasing fundamentalist activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Reacting against the signals by some Welfare Party (RP)
deputies, especially RP leader and Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan, who is opposed to the implementation of the NSC
recommendations, Golhan said that the proposal would not be
debated in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
"The NSC decisions have never been conveyed to Parliament. We
have only proposed to discuss the protection of the democratic
system, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Though the military-dominated NSC is only a consultative
body, its recommendations have traditionally been adopted by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, however, took a hard stance and vowed that he would
not implement the NSC recommendations aimed at defending the
secularist system established by Kemel Ataturk, founder of the
republic.
</P>
<P>
Under the strong pressure from the military and the threat
from his coalition partner DYP, he made a U-turn last Wednesday
by signing the 22-point communique to avoid the collapse of the
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Recent proposals by the RP led by Erbakan on ordering women
civil servants to wear Islamic-style head covering and building
a mosque in one of the main commercial squares in Istanbul, the
largest city of the country, triggered strong criticism from
Western-oriented Turks, especially the military.
</P>
<P>
A religious rally called "Jerusalem Night" held on February 1
in Sincan city, 40 kilometers west of Ankara, also caused serious
concern over the increase of the fundamentalist force in the
secular republic.

<HEADLINE> 3,000 Protest National Front in Nice, Southern France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Three thousand people demonstrated
today in the southern French city Nice to protest the holding of a
meeting by the extreme-right National Front (FN) party and the
coming of its president, Jean-Marie Le Pen.
</P>
<P>
Two people were arrested in a small-scale clash between police
and a dozen demonstrators, but no one was injured in the clash,
according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were protesting Le Pen's decision to choose
Nice for re-starting his political activities in 1997 and for the
beginning of the campaign by FN for the 1998 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Le Pen told 2,000 FN sympathizers today that he will run for the
regional council of the department of Alpes-Maritimes in 1998, and
will not run for the legislative elections that year.
</P>
<P>
He also presented the list of nine FN candidates for the 1998
legislative elections in the nine constituencies of Alpes-Maritimes.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Requests to Purchase More Iraqi Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is preparing to ask
the United Nations for special permission to purchase more oil
from neighboring Iraq to meet its domestic demands, the Anatolia
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Huseyin Celem, Turkey's permanent representative to the U.N.,
met with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan last weekend to
discuss the oil purchase.
</P>
<P>
Celem told the U.N. chief that the three-month term of
U.N. Resolution 986, also known as the oil-for-food deal, had
ended and the results showed that Turkey suffered a loss of 5
billion U.S. dollars yearly as a result of the U.N. trade
sanctions imposed on Iraq since the Gulf War in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Anna reportedly told Celem that he really understood the hard
situation in Turkey, which used to benefit from the exports of
Iraqi oil.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Parisians Protest New Immigration Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Parisians today staged
a street protest for the third time within three weeks against the
new immigration law drafted by Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre,
which is aimed at greatly tightening control of illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
According to police estimate, 11,000 people joined the
demonstration today in southeast Paris, while organizers of the
protest put the figure at 30,000.
</P>
<P>
Shouting "the first, second and third generation, we are all
the children of immigrants," the demonstrators called on the
French Senate to reject the law during their second debate on it
which will begin on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The law, also called Debre bill, was adopted by the National
Assembly (lower house of parliament) late last month after
undergoing a heated debate between deputies of the rightwing
majority and the leftwing oppositions.
</P>
<P>
The most controversial part of the law, which required
Frenchmen to inform police the time of the departure of foreigners
from France, was scrapped during the second reading by the
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators accused the law of "creating inextricable
situations and throwing people into clandestinity," and thus
threatening the liberty of all.
</P>
<P>
They also blamed the law for setting up a card index system for
foreigners who have visited France.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of leftwing parties, unionists, intellectuals,
immigrants, non-governmental organizations and some former
resistance fighters during World War II joined today's
demonstration.

<HEADLINE> President: Turkey Should be Full EU Member </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said here today that Turkey should be a full member of the
European Union (EU) and Europe should not reject Turkey's bid for
admission into the EU, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting entitled "Turkish economy and
Turkish-Belgian economical and financial cooperation" arranged for
Belgian Crown Prince Phillippe and his accompanying delegation,
Demirel said that Turkey's entrance to the customs union was an
important step for its full EU membership.
</P>
<P>
"Isolating Turkey from the other candidate countries will hurt
Turkey. I advise our European friends to avoid acts which will
deteriorate Turkey's relations and cooperation with Europe," the
president added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly press conference today, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sermet Atacanli said that Turkey would spare no efforts
in making the EU change its attitude toward Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Turkey welcomed the remarks made by the current EU president
and Dutch Foreign Minister Van Mierlo in favor of Turkey's bid
for full EU membership, he added.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, on March
8 with his Turkish counterpart Tansu Ciller, Mierlo claimed that
he disagreed with some European leaders who had said that Turkey
should not be considered as a candidate of full EU membership in
the foreseeable future. Mierlo said he was a supporter of
Turkey's EU membership drive.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, an associate member of the EU, has long spared no
efforts in obtaining admission into the EU, but no breakthrough
has been achieved so far due to human rights, Kurdish and
Cyprus issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese guerrillas detonated a
car loaded with explosives targeting an Israeli patrol inside the
Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon this
afternoon, wounding one Israeli soldier.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the border strip said that a white Toyota
loaded with explosives exploded around 2:00 p.m. (12:00 GMT)
when the Israeli patrol was passing by at Markaba, 200 meters
from the Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
Four civilians were also injured in the blast, according to
the anonymous security sources. They described that the situation
of the injured Israeli soldier as "very dangerous."
</P>
<P>
They added that the car was parked in front of a house in the
town and was detonated when the Israeli patrol was passing by it,
wounding the Israeli soldier and four civilians on the balcony of
the house nearby.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army spokesman confirmed that one Israeli soldier was
"slightly" injured in the bombing attack, adding that the wounded
soldier has been hospitalized in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces since this morning sporadically bombarded Iglim
Al-Toffah, or Province of Apple, a height some 60 kilometers
southeast of Beirut, the capital of Lebanon. The height is often
used by guerrillas as a springboard to launch attacks at Israeli
occupation forces.
</P>
<P>
Tensions escalated in south Lebanon at the weekend after
Israeli forces carried out a wave of air raids and bombardments
at guerrillas targets in south Lebanon, the last active
battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The third round of Russian-NATO
negotiations on NATO's planned eastward expansion ended here with
no concrete results released, according to the Itar-Tass News
Agency today.
</P>
<P>
The latest negotiations were positive but differences remained
on a range of issues, the agency cited the Russian Foreign
Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni Primakov and NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana discussed issues relating to
NATO's oft-stated eastward expansion, including the alliance's
responses to the previous proposals from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Russia still insists on making the Russia-NATO agreement a
legal and obligatory document while the Western alliance wants it
to be a charter.
</P>
<P>
The two previous rounds of negotiations were held respectively
in Moscow on January 20 and in Brussels on February 23.
</P>
<P>
After the end of the talks, Solana left Moscow for Central Asia
Monday on a weeklong tour to four former Soviet republics --
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
It is the first visit to Central Asia by a NATO chief since
1992 when former NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner visited
the region.

HONG KONG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's tour agencies are
expecting an Easter boom as travelers plan holidays to avoid the
peak period during the handover in the middle of this year,
according to today's South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
The Post said some agencies have reported full bookings for
Easter and the industry's regulatory body has banned surcharges.
</P>
<P>
Agencies said most of the air tickets to Hong Kong during the
handover period have been sold, forcing travelers to bring their
itineraries forward.
</P>
<P>
A travel service agency managing director was quoted as saying
that their sales staff have warned clients that if they want to
travel in June, they may not be able to secure the return air
tickets -- unless they can delay returning until August. Airline
companies have already told travel agencies to confirm their June
bookings.
</P>
<P>
The local Travel Industry Council issued a directive to
agencies last week, banning surcharges for tours departing between
 March 23 and April 2, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Australian-US Exercise Goes On Despite Cyclone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyclone Justin today caused
cutbacks in the Australian-US joint military exercise, but the war
games at Shoalwater Bay on the central Queensland coast will go on
as scheduled, a US military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The joint military exercise, codenamed Tandem Thrust 97, will
be the largest between Australia and the US since World War II.
The exercise, which will involve more than 27,000 military
personnel, is to be staged during March 12-17.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said in Brisbane that huge swells and strong
winds from Cyclone Justin forced the US Navy to order the aircraft
carrier USS Independence and about 50 other warships to move away
from the coast to minimize storm damage.
</P>
<P>
"Some things have slipped, a landing operation involving
amphibious craft planned for today has been canceled," the
spokesman said. But a land exercise involving Australian troops
and US Marines was under way.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 13 US warplanes diverted from Rockhampton to Darwin
yesterday because of bad weather conditions, and continued their
flight today to Australian Air Force bases at Amberley and
Richmond.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Brisbane Anti-Bases Coalition, union
representatives, students and Queensland Green members have
launched serial campaigns against the military exercise since last
week, which they fear will cause environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
They also planned to hold more protests and marches in
Rockhampton from Wednesday to Saturday next week to express their
concerns at the long-term damage to the environment.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Deems Mubarak-Clinton Talks Ultra-Important </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said today the Egyptian-U.S.
summit is extremely significant as it comes at a very important
time when the atmosphere of the Middle East peace process has been
poisoned by the recent Israeli action aimed to tighten its grip on
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Ossama el-Baz, Political Advisor to Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, in an interviewed with an Egyptian
T.V. station.
</P>
<P>
"There is fear that the peace march would be frozen due to the
Israeli decisions to build 6,500 Jewish homes in Har Homa and
close four Palestinian offices in East Jerusalem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under 1993 Oslo accord, the demographic features of Jerusalem
should remain unchanged before Israel and the PNA could decide the
status of the holy city in "final status" talks set to start this
month.
</P>
<P>
"All those decisions and developments constitute obstacles that
necessitate constant contacts with the United States and parties
concerned in the peace march," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak held separate talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu, Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat in Cairo and French President Jacques Chirac in
Paris last week before he flew to Washington to meet
U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli track will take priority in today's
talks between the two presidents, said Baz, who is accompanying
Mubarak on his five-day visit to the U.S., which is a key sponsor
of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of Mubarak's arrival, the U.S. Friday vetoed a
European-initiated U.N. Security Council draft resolution against
the Israeli settlement project, which was supported by all of the
other 14 Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president, in an interview with the CNN Sunday,
said that the veto will create a feeling of injustice in the Arab
world and lead to the loss of U.S. credibility as a fair partner
in the peace march.
</P>
<P>
However, he said if the U.S. had refrained from using the veto,
it would have sent a message to Israel "not to breach the
agreements and not to create problems to the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he would ask Clinton to use his influence to make
Israel realize the complications and problems stemming from this
settlement project and to pressure it into reversing the decision.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian issue will not be the sole priority of the
talks, Baz said. "The Syrian track is no less important than the
Palestinian one," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Israel itself knows well that if there is
no progress on the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli tracks
within a reasonable period, the peace process will run into
stagnation.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is expected to present new ideas to the U.S. president
in a bid to restart the Syrian-Israeli talks, which has been
stalled for a year.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president told the American T.V. network that he
supports Syrian President Hafez Assad's demand that talks resume
where they ended last February and the full return of Golan
Heights is a must in return for peace with the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Miners Block Bonn Government District Against Subsidy Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of western German coal
miners today blocked major roads in the government district in
Bonn and surrounded party headquarters in continued protests
against government plans to reduce subsidies for the coal mining
industry.
</P>
<P>
Police said that 2,000 to 3,000 protesters had blocked the main
road in Bonn and surrounded the headquarters of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) and that of coalition partner the
Free Democrats (FDP), as well as the building housing the main
opposition Social Democrats (SPD).
</P>
<P>
The protest in Bonn is due to be echoed later today in coal
mining towns of Bergkamen and Luenen.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations began last weekend in the industrial Ruhr area
in western Germany, where the country's main coal mining industry
is based, after Kohl's center-right government announced a subsidy
cuts plan last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, annual subsidies to coal mines in the Ruhr
Valley and Saarland would be gradually reduced to 3.8 billion
marks (about 2.2 billion U.S. dollars) by the year 2005 from the
current level of 10 billion marks (about 5.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Such deep cuts in subsidies for the coal mining sector are
believed to have led to the loss of at least 60,000 jobs out of a
total of 90,000 at mines, which pushed up unemployment in the
country to a record of over 4.67 million last month.

<HEADLINE> India's Sensitive Index Loses 107 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The sensitive index on the
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market today registered a sharp fall
of over 107 points in the wake of heavy selling pressure triggered
by higher carry forward charges of around 3.5 to 4 percent,
indicating the market was in a heavily overbought position.
</P>
<P>
The sensitive index started lower at 3861.47 and gradually
moved downwards to close at 3768.74 as against last weekend close
of 3876.04. The national index dropped by 44.48 points to 1638.15
from 1682.63 last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-200 and US dollar index finished at 364.77 and 169.35
compared to the previous close of 374 and 173.59 respectively last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
As the budget euphoria, which pushed the sensitive index up by
over 13 percent or 448 points in the last settlement period,
petered out, speculators and bull operators lightened their long
position in view of the end of account tomorrow on the national
stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
Foreign institutional investors and domestic institutions were
unwilling to place big orders in the prevailing market situation,
which required a sizable technical correction as the gains were
overextended. In spite of the market-friendly budget, they had
adopted cautious approach as there were no clear signs of reversal
of recent economic slowdown.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Accused of Slandering China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Recent reports by some U.S. media
about China's alleged involvement in political donations to the
U.S. Democratic party and bribery of U.S. Congress are sheer
fabrications, a Chinese foreign affairs official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side is deeply concerned about this issue," said
Mei Ping, director of the Department of Affairs of the Americas
and Oceania of China's Foreign Ministry, who made serious
presentations about the issue today with William C. McCahill, Jr.,
charge d'affairs ad interim of the U.S. Embassy in China.
</P>
<P>
According to Mei, some U.S. media have accused the Chinese
Embassy in the U.S. of making illegal political donations and
bribing Congress, basing their claims on information allegedly
released by officials with U.S. judicial department.
</P>
<P>
"China has consistently observed the principle of
non-interference into each other's internal affairs when handling
nation-to-nation relations," Mei said, adding that "the Chinese
side has never got involved in the U.S. political affairs in any
form."
</P>
<P>
"Such slanderous news and reports about China are ill-motivated
fabrications." Mei said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the actions of the U.S., which have created
bad feeling and undermined Sino-U.S. relations, are irresponsible
and absolutely wrong.
</P>
<P>
"We hereby express our indignation and strong displeasure
over the matter." Mei said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.S. government to proceed from the overall
interests of both countries, stop such libel and attacks against
the Chinese Embassy in the U.S., and erase the ill will, in a bid
to remove any disturbances that might jeopardize the healthy and
steady development of bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Rival Parties of Northern Iraq to hold Talks in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of three rival
parties of northern Iraq will meet here Tuesday to discuss
measures for bringing peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Sermet Atacanli told a
weekly press briefing today that this was the first meeting of
the High-level Coordination Committee, established within the
framework of the northern Iraq reconciliation talks.
</P>
<P>
He said that representatives of the Kurdistan Democratic
Party (KDP), the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and Turkmen
Front would participate in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli stressed that Turkey would not participate in the
tripartite talks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department official Robert Deutch, who is in
charge of its Iranian-Iraqi section, is expected to arrive in
Ankara to hold talks with the officials of the three parties
and Turkish officials.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli said the meeting was planned for one day but it
might be extended if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The parties concerned will establish subcommittees on
cooperation in education, health, transportation and free
circulation so as to install confidence among them and
facilitate humanitarian assistance activities.
</P>
<P>
With the participation of the United States, Britain and
Turkey, the three parties in northern Iraq held talks on January
14 and 15 in Ankara in a bid to reestablish peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Concluding the third round of talks, the parties issued a
statement claiming that the KDP and PUK would withdraw their
forces from the disputed areas along the cease-fire line, and
would take effective measures to provide security for the
members of the Peace Monitoring Force (PMF).
</P>
<P>
The statement also said the High-level Coordination Committee
made up of the three parties would meet once a month in Ankara
to promote political reconciliation as stipulated in the Final
Statement issued last October.
</P>
<P>
The KDP, supported by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, fought
with the PUK in late August, which led to a U.S. air strike
against Iraqi military targets.
</P>
<P>
The two groups signed a peace deal on October 31, 1996
under the meditation by the U.S., Britain and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The northern part of Iraq has been occupied by Kurdish
rebels since the Gulf War in 1991, but it split into rival
zones after the KDP and the PUK began fighting each other in
1994.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Briefs Lebanese FM on New Peace Formula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Miguel Angel Moratinos, envoy of
the European Union (EU) to the Middle East peace process, briefed
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz here today on a European
peace formula based on the principle of "total withdrawal for
total security."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister appreciated the new formula,
which was raised to replace the "land for peace" principle of the
Madrid peace conference. He said he was waiting for an
Israeli reaction.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos, also a Spanish diplomat, arrived here from the
Syrian capital of Damascus this morning to continue his peace
mission in the region. He held a meeting with Boueiz in the
latter's office.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, Moratinos told a press conference
that he and the Lebanese foreign minister discussed the formula
which he put forward in order to bring fresh momentum into the
peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
"I told him the formula which says a total withdrawal in
exchange for a total security, and the foreign minister found
the formula good and worth studying and developing," Moratinos
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this formula satisfies all parties involved,
because it meets all what they are seeking," the EU envoy
underlined.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel are still quarreling over what kind of
peace would finally be established, with Israel demanding full
peace, including diplomatic and other ties, and Syria demanding
a full Israeli withdrawal from Syrian and Lebanese lands.
</P>
<P>
Predicting that the formula will lead to an "easy" settlement
of the dispute, Moratinos said that Israel has not given an
answer and "it is studying the formula."
</P>
<P>
He denied a competition between the United States and Europe
for their roles in the Middle East peace process, adding that the
EU had informed the United States of the new European peace
formula but has not received an official response.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos is scheduled to have meetings with Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri this evening.

<HEADLINE> Rural Chinese Woman Distinguishes Herself in Pig Raising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a pig farm with
a total floor space of 28,000 square meters, owned by a rural
Chinese woman in central China, was completed on the eve of March
8, the International Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
Ouyang Mixiu, owner of the farm, which has five one-story
red-brick-and-grey-tile pens, plans to raise 10,000 pigs this year.
</P>
<P>
The well-designed family-run farm is reportedly the largest of
its kind in her province of Hunan, and has attracted many visitors.
</P>
<P>
"This pig farm is the embodiment of 20 years of hard work of
Ouyang and her family," said one visitor from a nearby village.
</P>
<P>
Ouyang, 43, got married in 1976. The only wedding gifts she
received from her parents-in-law were a bamboo pole for carrying
things, two manure baskets and a hoe.
</P>
<P>
The couple led a satisfactory life from farming and raising
pigs.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, three years after the reform policy took effect in
rural China, Ouyang leased five pig pens in her village and
started raising pork.
</P>
<P>
Though she has only a primary school education, she loved to
read popular science and experimented with scientific methods of
feeding and taking care of pigs.
</P>
<P>
Her efforts paid off and the pigs grew fast. In the first year,
she was able to sell 60 to the state, earning some 10,000 yuan --
a big sum at that time.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, she put her entire savings, 136,000 yuan, into raising
pigs, built 35 pig pens and bought a truck and a grain crusher.
</P>
<P>
Her husband became her driver, a grain buyer and a salesman,
and her daughter, who was then studying in an agro-technical
school, became her assistant.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, she sold 1,050 pigs to the state and earned a net
income of some 100,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, when her family had become affluent, she
offered to help her village's 12 needy families shake off poverty,
and provided them with piglets and feed. All these families later
became better off, and their farms served as examples of new
scientific and technical ways to boost pig raising.
</P>
<P>
Supported by the public, she was elected a county legislator, a
model worker of her province, an outstanding representative of the
province's women, and a member of a goodwill mission overseas.
</P>
<P>
"I'll expand my pig raising business by making full use of the
new pig pens and applying new techniques, maybe getting 10,000
pigs this year, and contribute more to my country," she said in an
interview.

</P>
<P>
This year, the city government plans to develop the cultural
sector as an industry and has made it one of the five new economic
sectors to receive special government support.
</P>
<P>
Beijing and Spain share a vast field for cooperation and
exchange, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Toledano told the mayor that his company started cooperation
with Beijing University five years ago, and he expects further
cooperation with Beijing in the field of new, hi-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish businessmen have been in Beijing to demonstrate
their new products.

BRUSSELS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)

that no country in the world has stopped or reduced imports from
India so far on grounds of human rights or child labor.
</P>
<P>
"No country has put forth conditions regarding human rights
conditions or use of child labor in production of goods which are
imported by it from India," he said while answering questions in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Export of certain goods from India to some developed countries
might have been affected because of the adverse publicity launched
by some interested groups in the importing countries and
misconceptions among importers regarding the use of child labor in
production of goods in India, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken measures to counter the adverse
publicity, he added.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Boost Pyrethrum Production This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Pyrethrum Board of Kenya
will distribute five million seedlings to farmers this year to
boost pyrethrum production, compared with three million seedlings
last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1997 Pyrethrum Growers Bulletin, the board
has raised five million seedlings in its nurseries ready for
distribution to the farmers for the 1997 planting season
beginning from March.
</P>
<P>
In last year's growing season, a total of three million
seedlings and 3,875 kilograms of seed were distributed, the
bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the steady increase of demand for pyrethrum
worldwide has called for new measures to expand the area under
the crop.
</P>
<P>
Starting last year, it added, many farmers in the east African
country have shown great interest in pyrethrum growing as the
board pays attractive prices to the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Pyrethrum products have become popular in recent years after
it was established by researchers that pyrethrins are practically
non-poisonous to mammals, having shown a rapid breakdown with no
residues in the environment and little build-up of resistance in
insect populations.
</P>
<P>
Because of the increasing consciousness of the risks
associated with widespread use of synthetic insecticides, the
demand for pyrethrum products has continued to increase in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
The current annual demand for pyrethrum in the world market
stands at about 20,000 tons of dried flowers, of which Kenya
produces about 50 percent, with Tanzania, Australia, Rwanda and
Papua New Guinea supplying the rest.
</P>
<P>
Kenya exports an average 9,000 tons of dried pyrethrum flowers
annually, which is an important foreign exchange earner in the
east African country.

<HEADLINE> Reform Not to Sacrifice UN's Social-Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Reform to the United Nations (UN) should
not sacrifice its social and economic functions, Nigeria's
Ambassador to UN, Ibrahim Gambari said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria in New York, the
ambassador said Nigeria is opposed to any reform that will hinder
the social-economic function of the UN.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the concern that the reform may result in a
disproportionate cut in the UN staff.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador noted that there is pressure from the U.S. and other
Western powers to contract the economic and social aspects of the UN.
</P>
<P>
But he said, "What we will like to see is in fact for the UN to
strengthen its activities in social-economic areas so as to impact
more positively on Africa and reduce the undue influence of the
Bretton Woods Institutions."
</P>
<P>
According to him, the UN has made a great impact on Africa in the
areas of peace-keeping, conflict resolution,, decolonization and the
struggle against apartheid, its impact in social and economic areas
has been less signficant.
</P>
<P>
"We cerntainly want to preserve the regional economic
commissions...We are very proud of the work of the economic commission
for Africa," said Gambari, who is also Nigeria's permanent
representative to the UN.
</P>
<P>
He observed that to many countries in the West, reform means
cutting staff, and that when that was done in the past, the cuts fell
disproportionately on third world countries.
</P>
<P>
"If staff have to be cut, which should not be the principal purpose
of reform, then there should be equality of scrifice," he said, adding
that reform should be aimed at making UN more efficient and effective.
</P>
<P>
Gambari commended the efforts so far made by Secretary-General Kofi
Annan in reforming the UN and expressed Nigeria's support to him.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully in support of the secretary-General. He has laid out
his plans which we think is cautious and realistic," he said.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier separate internview also with the News Agency of
Nigeria, Gambari re-stated Nigeria's quest for a permanent seat in an
expanded Security Council of the UN.
</P>
<P>
"It is about the capacity and willingness to maintain international
peace and security, and indeed even our biggest critic must really
acknowledge Nigeria as a major contributor to the maintenance of
international peace and security," he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Ocean Shipping Leader Sets Up W. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company
(COSCO) launched here today its first west African outlet to
exploit the huge potential in the shipping market in the west and
central African region.
</P>
<P>
COSCO (West Africa) Limited, the new company, is 99 percent held
by its parent company with only one percent share in the hand of a
local partner.
</P>
<P>
Located in the center of the west African coast, Nigeria boasts a
total import and export value of more than 20 billion U.S. dollars
annually, most of which are carried by ships.
</P>
<P>
The country also handles about 70 percent of imports meant for
west and central Africa, according to shipping experts here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lagos-based Apapa port is the third largest and
best equipped in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"All these are good conditions for developing shipping business
here," said Xue Xingyou, General Manager of the newly-born company.
</P>
<P>
Xue said his company, established on the basis of the former COSCO
Representative Office, will start from soliciting shipping business in
Nigeria, and gradually develop the shipping market in all the 16
countries in the west African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The company will try to become solely-owned or joint-venture
shipping agent in these countries, while engaging in trade.
</P>
<P>
As planned, the company will this year establish a shipping agent
with local partners and a trade company for on-land development in
Nigeria, as well as a representative office and shipping agent in
Zaire, the general manager said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Warns Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat today warned that the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process was in "real crisis" because of
Israel's violation of peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Gaza, Arafat accused Israel of
endangering the peace process with violation of signed
accords. "There is a real crisis because of the Israeli clear
breaching of what has been agreed upon," he said.
</P>
<P>
He denounced the recent Israeli decision on the first stage
of further troop withdrawals on the West Bank as a clear
violation. "It's a trick and conspiracy against the peace
process, against the agreements which have been signed," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat refused to comment on reports that senior Palestinian
negotiator Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) had asked to resign to
protest the Israeli violation of peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Abbas had presented a letter of resignation
to Arafat, saying he could not continue his job because of
Israel's continued violation of the signed accords.
</P>
<P>
Abbas' move came after he held talks with Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy Sunday night in Jerusalem, during which he
rejected Israel's unilateral decision on withdrawing troops from
another 9 percent of the West Bank in the first of three-stage
pullbacks.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision should have been made after
consultations with the Palestinian side, which hoped to gain
up to 30 percent rather than the 9 percent of West Bank
in the first stage. Levy insisted that Israel retained sole
right of deciding the scope of further pullbacks.
</P>
<P>
Abbas also protested Israel's recent moves on the issue of
eastern Jerusalem, including the plan to build a settlement in
Har Homa in southeastern Jerusalem and the order to close four
Palestinian offices in eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Arafat dispatched senior Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat to Jordan to send messages to Jordanian King Hussein
on the issues of further redeployments, Har Homa project and the
closure of Palestinian offices.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Arafa returned from a two-day visit to Amman where
he held consultations with King Hussein on current situation of
the peace process. He denounced Israel's latest moves on further
troop pullbacks, Har Homa and Palestinian offices as
"conspiracies and tricks."

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A coin bearing the image of
Dr. Sun Yat-sen was sold on the auction block here Sunday for
500,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The most expensive item at the first modern coin auction in
China, the coin was minted in 1929, when the rule of Yuan Shikai
was overthrown and the new government issued coins with the face
of Sun to replace those with Yuan's image.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign-made coin was never put into
circulation. Most were destroyed, except for a few that are now in
private collections.
</P>
<P>
The new owner of the coin is a collector in east China's
Zhejiang Province who declined to reveal his name. He said that
having the coin is his long-cherished dream.
</P>
<P>
The auction included more than 1,000 coins falling into 392
categories, with the earliest being a silver one issued in Tibet
in 1794. The most recent was a silver coin with a panda design,
issued in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The auction, which scored a turnover of some five million yuan,
attracted more than 120 coin collectors, including those from the
United States, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> China to Strike Economic Crimes with Amended Criminal Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China is cracking down on
economic crimes, especially crimes of sabotaging the order of a
market economy, as is evidenced by its move to amend the Criminal
Law.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts and legislators attending the Fifth Session of
the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) here, which these days
is deliberating draft amendments to the existing Criminal Law,
said that the draft amendments reflect the authorities's
determination to protect the development of a socialist market
economy by means of law.
</P>
<P>
They noted that, as economic crimes in China today are
increasing and causing more damages, it is of great realistic
significance to make detailed stipulations in the Criminal Law to
deal a heavy blow on various criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
In the existing Criminal Law, there are only 16 articles
dealing with crimes that sabotage economic order.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of supplementary laws and regulations previously
enacted on punishing economic crimes, the draft amendments have
added one chapter on economic crimes, the most voluminous of the
whole law with 91 articles.
</P>
<P>
The chapter, which is divided into eight parts, makes detailed
stipulations on crimes that may occur at various stages of goods
production and circulation and in various fields of a market
economy, including the manufacture and sales of fake and shoddy
goods, smuggling, hindrance of managerial order in companies and
enterprises, sabotage of financial management, financial fraud,
harming tax collection and management, infringement on
intellectual property rights, and disturbance of market order.
</P>
<P>
While maintaining the strength of crackdowns on economic
crimes, the draft Criminal Law has also made abstract and vague
stipulations in the old version more concrete and specific, and
defines many new crimes and punishments for violators in
accordance with new developments.
</P>
<P>
For example, the crime of "engaging in speculation and
profiteering" has been done away with, and replaced by more
specific crimes such as contract fraud, illegal operation of
monopolized businesses (goods), trading of import and export
quotas and permits, production and sales of fake and shoddy
commodities, and sabotage of financial market order.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendments also make clear stipulations on the crime
of money laundering, so as to crack down upon drug trafficking,
smuggling and crimes with mafia features.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the draft amendments contain a special chapter on
crimes of embezzlement and bribery as well as provisions dealing
with property infringements.

<HEADLINE> 2,300-Year-Old Tomb Group Found in Shaanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-seven tombs dating back to
the middle of the Warring States period (475-221 BC) have been
found in Gucheng Village, Danfeng County, in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists have been intrigued by the fact that the
tombs, which belonged to the people of the Chu State, were found
in the manor of a famous minister of the Qin State.
</P>
<P>
The area around village, a border area among the Qin, Chu, and
Jin states, was fought for by all military strategists. Historical
records show that the Qin State successfully established a county
here and later granted the area to Shang Yang in 340 BC.
</P>
<P>
Shang was an important minister of Qin who experimented with
state reform, making Qin the most powerful state and paving the
way for Qin to later unify China.
</P>
<P>
The newly-found tomb group represents a burial system different
from that of Qin. For example, all occupants in the excavated 72
tombs, were laying on their backs instead of in the curled position
commonly found in the Qin people.
</P>
<P>
It is yet to be determined whether the site was ruled by the
Chu State or was a home of Chu people under the rule of Qin, the
experts say.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 pieces of pottery and some 50 bronze items have
been found in the tombs. Among the pottery items are tri-pots,
vessels, food containers, plates and cups. The bronzeware includes
swords, arrowheads and carriage ornaments.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, characteristics such as the densely
located tombs and the presence of more pottery and less bronze
burial articles indicate that tombs' occupants were ordinary
people.

ANKARA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati arrived here today for a two-day visit to Turkey in
a bid to improve relations between the two countries.

<P>
Velayati will convey to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel an
invitation from Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani to attend a

</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister is to hold talks with his
Turkish counterpart Tansu Ciller and meet with Demirel and Prime

<P>
Velayati has reportedly brought with him a message from
Rafsanjani concerning the current diplomatic dispute between the
two countries.

<P>
The dispute was triggered by Iranian ambassador to Ankara
Muhammed Reza Baqeri who made a pro-Sharia (Islam) speech at the
commemoration of anti-Israeli "Al-Quds (Jerusalem) Night"
gathering in the Turkish city of Sincan, 40 kilometers west of
Ankara last month, and resulted in exchange of expulsions of
diplomats by both sides.

<P>
Early this month, Demirel sent Turkish foreign ministry
undersecretary Ali Tuygan as special envoy to Iran and handed
over a written message to Rafsanjani in a bid to improve the
strained ties.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Stems Illegal Logging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has acted to check rampant
illegal logging and all would-be investors in the timber sector
will be closely scrutinized and monitored, Environment and
Natural Resources Minister William Harrington has said.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted him as saying that from now on
the would-be investors will only be given concessions if they
show genuine capacity in machinery, fiscal and financial backup.
</P>
<P>
He said at the weekend that his country is worried over the
illegal activities in the north of the country where concession
holders are not complying with conditions of licenses granted.
</P>
<P>
In Copperbelt, over 30,000 people including foreigners are
encroaching in the state forests, added the minister who launched
an investigation on the illegal activities two months ago.
</P>
<P>
He said the licenses of the loggers involved in illegal
cutting of trees will not be renewed.
</P>
<P>
If the illegal logging is not contained, "water works in Kafue
will dry and therefore no drinking water for Lusaka. There will
be no hydro-power stations at Kafue, no navigation and fishing.
The entire social life of the people will be affected," warned
Harrington.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry will encourage agro-forestry and those
who plant their own timber will be given incentives to export 75
percent of their products.
</P>
<P>
Harrington cited certain constrains such as inadequate fund to
police the affected areas effectively.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Morocco Sign Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Morocco today
signed a trade agreement to promote bilateral trade between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Malaysian International Trade and
Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz and Moroccan Minister of Commerce,
Industry and Handicraft Driss Jettou, who is leading a 12-member
delegation on a three-day visit to Malaysia beginning today.
</P>
<P>
Describing the present trade volume between Malaysia and
Morocco as "too small," Rafidah called for more aggressive
promotion and marketing efforts and expressed hope that the trade
agreement would pave the way for the private sector to explore
trade and investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
She said at the signing ceremony that total trade between
Malaysia and Morocco last year stood at 41.3 million ringgit
(about 16.52 million U.S. dollars), with Malaysian exports
amounting to 40 million ringgit (about 16 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's imports from Morocco were mainly thermoinic valves
and tubes, integrated circuits and parts and electrical machinery
and apparatus.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's main exports to Morocco included natural rubber,
palm oil, sound recorders, fruits and nuts, television receivers
and radio-broadcast receivers.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah suggested that business leaders of the two countries
get together to exchange views and ideas.
</P>
<P>
"They should initiate business and trade gatherings, perhaps,
through meetings and seminars on a more frequent basis as to be
updated with the latest opportunities available," she said.
</P>
<P>
Jettou told reporters later that Morocco was seeking foreign
investment for the privatization of its telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
Morocco has opened its doors to foreign investors in areas like
agro-business and also encouraged investment in its textile sector
which faces no quota restrictions in the European market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Morocco could also serve as a gateway for Malaysian traders not
only to the European market but also the Arabic and African
markets, he said.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Advancing to China's Forefront as Deng Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The development history of north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has proven the
correctness of what Deng Xiaoping had predicted a decade ago when
he said that the region would most likely to march into China's
forefront row.
</P>
<P>
Liu Mingzu, secretary of the regional committee of the CPC,
gave this remark today at a press conference during the current
sessions of the Eighth National People's Congress and the Eighth
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference.
</P>
<P>
Liu briefed reporters both at home and from overseas on the
changes and progress in social, economic, cultural and other
sectors that have been scored over past five decades after the
founding of the autonomous region and especially since the
launching of reform and opening-up 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, founded on
May l, 1947, was the first autonomous regional government with a
status of a province, he said this represented the successful
practice of the Chinese Communist Party in using the Marxist
theory to resolve China's ethnic issues and signified a great
victory of historical significance scored by all ethnic groups in
the region.
</P>
<P>
During the past five decades, Liu noted, the economic and
social undertakings in the region have kept advancing, the people
of all local ethnic groups have continuously improved their
material and cultural life, the system of regional autonomy of
minority nationalities have given scope to their vitality, the
unity of all ethnic groups kept consolidating and developing, and
the socialist system have shown its advantages.
</P>
<P>
Late Chinese Leader Deng Xiaoping told former US President
Jimmy Carter during a meeting ten years ago that Inner Mongolia
has a vast expanse of grasslands and its population is not large
and, once it develops, it will possibly march into China's
forefront, Liu recalled.
</P>
<P>
He went on to note that Inner Mongolia covers an area of over
1.18 million sq km inhabited by the people of 49 ethnic minorities
with a total population of more than 23 million, including 3.779
million Mongolians and 18.41 million Han people.
</P>
<P>
The regional GDP reached 98.3 billion yuan and the fiscal
revenue hit 9.3 billion yuan in 1996. The region has become a
major energy and raw material base, where per-capita living
expenses for urban residents reached 3,100 yuan and the per-head
net income of farmers and herdspeople was 1,860 yuan. Some 98.5
percent of the school-age children were at school.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, at the time of its founding in 1947, the
autonomous region has a gross domestic product of merely 537
million yuan, the fiscal income of was 90,000 yuan and virtually
no industries. Illiterates and semi-literates accounted for 95
percent of its population then.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The shortage of foreign currency
in Jordan has caused the Ministry of Finance to owe big domestic
debts to contractors as it has to repay foreign loans with the
money earmarked for internal construction.
</P>
<P>
The ministry owes big debts to contractors for the
construction and development of sewage disposition and water
distribution system. the Jordanian news agency, Petra, reported
today.
</P>
<P>
"The JWA budget for these projects were in conjunction with
the Ministry of Finance, but when we sought the funds for
payment, we were informed by the ministry that the funding had
been used to repay our outside loans," said Adnan Zou'bi,
director of Public Awareness of the Jordan Water Authority (JWA).
</P>
<P>
The JWA is in charge of water and other civil work projects at
a cost of 15 million Jordanian dinars (about 21 million
U.S. dollars) and has signed 37 contracts, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The payments to the JWA are now already 60 days behind the

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Wants New Oil Deal with Foreign Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Africa's leading oil producer Nigeria
has re-stated its earlier call for a production sharing pact with
foreign oil prospecting firms that will allow it a stronger hold on
exporation.
</P>
<P>
Press reports today quoted the country's Finance Minister Anthony
Ani as saying that Nigeria was not getting value for its investment in
the joint venture deals.
</P>
<P>
Therefore the country, also a member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, may soon withdraw from the arrangement
and sponsor another whereby the partners will be allowed to explore
and exploit for commission, the minister said in Abuja, capital of
Nigeria, over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Nigeria is in the dark about details of
operational modalities.
</P>
<P>
"We don't even know how much it costs to explore and exploit; all
that is happening is that we get bills which we have to settle," he
said, regretting that Nigerians are not actively involved in the whole
business.
</P>
<P>
"It is only in Nigeria that a country does not take 100 percent of
the oil produced from her soil," he added.
</P>
<P>
Thus a system might soon be introduced whereby Nigeria would
gradually ease out of the joint venture deal.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, the oil companies will explore the oil, exploit
it and take their commission, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported the Nigerian government has plan for an outright sale
of its average 57 percent equity interest in the current six oil
prospecting joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which is highly favored by the Western companies, is
expected to give the government not only immediate cash estimated at
some 20 billion U.S. Dollars, but also to remove the cash call
problems and bring in private investors from both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The plan to privatize the oil industry in the country, however, is
still under consideration partly due to strong opposition.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Attracts More Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The amount of overseas funds
flowing to east China's Zhejiang Province increased by 50 percent
last year though the number of new projects and the contractual
value involved decreased.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government approved 1,208 direct overseas-funded
enterprises last year, a drop of 34 percent compared with the
previous year's figure. The amount of contractual value decreased
by 3.7 percent to 3.1 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the actual amount of overseas funds used in local
projects stood at 2.2 billion yuan, an all time high.
</P>
<P>
The average investment for each project rose to 2.59 million US
dollars from 1.77 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Investment in 146 projects, or one fifth of Zhejiang's total
key projects, surpassed 10 million US dollars each.
</P>
<P>
Owing to a change in the investment structure, investment in
hotels and real estate has given way to projects in the fields of
energy, transport, and communications.
</P>
<P>
Investment from Europe and Asian countries has gradually
increased. The Republic of Korea (ROK) alone poured over 100
million US dollars in Hangzhou last year, five times the 1995
amount.
</P>
<P>
This year, the provincial government will encourage overseas
companies to invest in infrastructure, basic industries,
technology upgrading and high technology.

<P>
FUZHOU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A poverty relief relocation
program for 100,000 peasants will be completed ahead of time this
year, in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government allocated 12.69 million yuan in 1996
to finance the program, together with 15.66 million yuan of
subsidies from local governments.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 49,000 people, nearly 10,000 households, were
moved to other places last year.
</P>
<P>
The province launched the Benefit Project in 1994, in line with
the nationwide anti-poverty campaign. Its target date to alleviate
poverty by the year 2000 has shifted to 1997.
</P>
<P>
Three years of hard work has helped a total of 84,000 people in
the poor and remote mountainous areas move to other places, where
working and living conditions show greater promise.
</P>
<P>
Top priority has been given to infrastructure in the relocation
camps. Most people who came from poor areas now enjoy adequate
food and clothing, as well as good medical care. enditem

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Macao Manufacturing Sector Expects Revival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Manufacturing industry in Macao
is expected to see a revival this year following a slowdown for
two years.
</P>
<P>
Macao economists say that the revival of Macao's manufacturing
business is based on the fact that both the U.S. market and the
European market have gained growth and that Hong Kong's return to
the embrace of the motherland has brought an economic boom.
</P>
<P>
Orders to Macao garment and knitwear manufacturers for the
first half of the year have increased as a result of the market
growth in the United States and the European Union. Orders from
Japan, Australia and Southeast Asian nations have also risen.
</P>
<P>
Macao's manufacturers have tried their best to gain more orders
 as Hong Kong has embarked on a new economic rise, economists say.
</P>
<P>
Macao has been closely linked with Hong Kong economically. An
economic boom in Hong Kong is seen as a push to Macao's economy.
</P>
<P>
Textile and garment-making are the main manufacturing business
for the 21-square-kilometer territory, whose population stands at
455,000. Traditional factories making electronics, fake flowers
and toys are fading out.
</P>
<P>
Due to an economic slowdown, the manufacturing sector has
become sluggish in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Quotas of hot items of textile and garment products from the
EU, the U.S., Canada and Norway, which account for more than 80
percent of Macao's total exports, were met only by 79.5 percent
last year, down 3.8 percent from 1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the toy-making industry in Macao is dying out,
with exports plunging 117.7 percent during the first 11 months of
1996 to only at 254 million patacas (about 32 million
U.S. dollars). Toys accounted for merely 1.8 percent of all
exports.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that the toy-making industry, like electronics
and fake flowers, which witnessed a boom in the 1980s, was
severely hit by a shortage of labor and higher cost of production
compared with neighboring regions.
</P>
<P>
The overall decline of the manufacturing sector last year was
blamed partly as a result of U.S. restrictions on imports from
Macao. The U.S. customs imposed an "extra guarantee system" on
products from Macao, suspecting the origin of Macao-made products.
</P>
<P>
As a result, many U.S. importers canceled their orders.
</P>
<P>
Another factor leading to the decline was the Macao
government's decision in July 1995 to stop using migrant laborers
in a bid to cut unemployment rate, local economists say.
</P>
<P>
Although the unemployment rate dropped a little bit, many local
manufacturers suffered from a serious shortage of labor, and were
forced to move their factories to the Chinese mainland. Foreign
investors were also reluctant to come to Macao, partly because of
the shortage of labor, they say.
</P>
<P>
They applauded the recent statement by a government official on
the use of migrant laborers. Vitor Pessoa, secretary for economy
and coordination of the government, said that the government is
"to adopt a flexible policy on the use of migrant labor".
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the new idea could lead to the import of a proper
 number of migrant laborers," Leong Song, secretary-general of
the Macao Manufacturers' Association, said in a recent
seminar. "If the government can fundamentally solve the problem
of labor, Macao's manufacturing sector would probably make a
breakthrough in the new year."

<HEADLINE> HK Wetlands Threatened by Development, Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Local conservationists said
that redevelopment and pollution are threatening Hong Kong's
wetlands across the New Territories and islands.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lew Young, World Wide Fund for Nature Hong Kong manager of
Mai Po Marshes, said in a report in today's South China Morning
Post that the threat of redevelopment loomed over many wetlands,
including a marsh at Shuen Wan near Ting Kok.
</P>
<P>
"It is half the size it was," he said. "There is a lot of
village encroachment, a lot of it illegal. One of the big problems
is gradual redevelopment."
</P>
<P>
While Mai Po Marshes nature reserve is the largest and most
famous, Hong Kong has many other wetlands including freshwater
streams in mountainous and lowland areas, marshes, reed beds,
mangrove stands and even reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's freshwater lowland streams, which harbor several
endemic species such as the cascade frog and Hong Kong newt, were
being polluted or covered in concrete, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It said that threatened sites which lack protection of country
parks should urgently be declared sites of special scientific
interest.

<HEADLINE> Macao Tourist Arrivals to Score Five Percent Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Macao's tourist arrivals are
expected to see a 5-percent growth this year following last year's
5.14-percent increase, experts predict.
</P>
<P>
The occasion of Hong Kong's return to China on July 1, the
increase in the number of new scenic sites in Macao and its
neighboring regions, the promotion of Macao as a tourist
destination and the addition of air routes will lead to the
growth of tourists, said Lee Kwai, chairman of the Association of
Macao Tourist Agents, at a recent seminar.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people will arrive in Hong Kong to see the
 grand ceremony when China resumes the exercise of its sovereignty
over Hong Kong on July 1 this year and that will also be a chance
for Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Many of those coming to Hong Kong will also visit Macao or
some other places via Macao," said Lee.
</P>
<P>
Macao will benefit from the increase in the number of new
tourist attractions in neighboring Zhuhai City, Guangdong
Province. Travelers from Hong Kong, Taiwan and some foreign
nations tend to visit Zhuhai via Macao.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Macao has become known to more people around the
world as the Macao government steps up its promotion campaign. The
 increase in the number of new air routes to Macao will also make
it convenient for travelers to visit Macao.
</P>
<P>
Tourism constitutes a major source of the government's annual
revenue. Last year, a total of 8.15 million tourists visited
Macao, mostly from Hong Kong, Taiwan, China's mainland, Japan and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Tourists spent 27 billion patacas (about 3.42 billion U.S.
dollars) in Macao (including the money spent in casinos), up 9
percent from 1995. The money spent on boarding, shopping and
transportation reached 11.5 billion patacas (about 1.46 billion
dollars), up 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the number of travel agencies rose
substantially. There are now 104 such agencies, compared with 80
in early 1996.

<HEADLINE> China's Auto Demand Predicted to Hit 1.62 Million Units in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The demand of automobiles in
China this year will reach 1.62 million units, a source from
China's Ministry of Machine-building Industry predicted.
</P>
<P>
Following the low-growth year of 1996, the automobile market
this year will be another year to see slight growth, the expert
said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the number of automobiles this year will
reach 12.97 million nationwide by the end of this year. The output
volume is about 1.59 million units and the import volume may reach
144,000 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Of the different models, the proportion of trucks will shrink
from 59.18 percent in 1994 to 44.37 percent this year; while the
ratio of bus increases from 20.75 percent to 27.50 percent and car
from 20.07 percent to 28.13 percent. The expert considered that
the product mix in which the cars and other passenger vehicles
account to more shares is catering to the trends in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
In his forecast, the demand of cars this year will be about
446,000 units. Private buyers this year may purchase 90,000
units. The public institutions and taxi companies will buy 230,000
and 126,000 units, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Following the price cut war that occurred in last year, all car
makers consider price adjustment an effective means to grab more
market share.
</P>
<P>
On the markets of heavy- and medium-duty trucks, the expert
foresaw that even though the production capacities of the two
models have already hit 60,000 units and 350,000 units,
respectively, the market shares will be further reduced following
three successive years of doldrums.
</P>
<P>
In his eyes, small buses, mini-vans and pickups, along with
cars are the main growth outlets for China's automobile industry.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong, Hong Kong Economies Forge Closer ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The economies of Hong Kong and
its neighboring Guangdong Province are moving towards closer ties,
as shown by statistics.
</P>
<P>
Data from the provincial statistics bureau show that more than
26,000 trucks, over 800 ships and over 20 trains shuttle between
Guangdong and Hong Kong every day.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong people have opened more than 40,000 factories in
Guangdong, employing five million local people.
</P>
<P>
More than eighty percent of Hong Kong's manufacturing sector,
which include textiles, garments, electronics, toys, clocks and
watches and plastic, have moved into Guangdong, successfully
improving Hong Kong's economic structure and at the same time,
enabling Guangdong to become one of the richest coastal provinces
in China.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, Guangdong's GDP proceeded at an annual
rate of 19 percent, far higher than the world average of 2.9
percent. Guangdong, which has led the country in foreign trade
volume for years, has estimated that its import and export
volumes reached 50 billion US dollars and 60 billion US dollars
respectively in 1996.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, 75 percent of foreign investment,
approximately 53 billion US dollars, came from Hong Kong. In that
year, around 80 percent of import and export business was done
between Hong Kong and Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that China's resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong will strengthen existing economic ties
between the two partners.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between the two economies will be less of a
"shop-factory" or "shop-storage" type and will move faster towards
integration. Hong Kong will participate more in finance, science
and technology and infrastructure construction in
Guangdong.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Netanyahu Wants Moscow Dropping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu is leaving today on a two-day visit to Moscow,
which is expected to feature attempts to head off Russia's weapon
sales to Israel's Arab rivals.
</P>
<P>
During his first official visit to Russia, Netanyahu will hold
intensive talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
and other senior officials. He is also to visit the Jewish
communities in the Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda is believed to be Russia's military
technological transfers to Israel's two arch Arab rivals Iran
and Syria. Russia is reportedly helping Iran in adapting the
SS-4 missile which is within range to hit Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel has long been haunted by the threat to its security
posed by missiles owned by its Arab rivals. During the 1990 Gulf
War, Iraq launched dozens of missiles at the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Countering missile threats from Iran and Syria has been a focus
of Netanyahu government's defense strategy. Netanyahu attacked the
previous Labor government, which had been bent on achieving a
regional comprehensive peace, for ignoring the threats.
</P>
<P>
Besides the joint efforts with the United States to develop
and install sophisticated anti-missile systems, Israel is trying
to persuade Russia and other countries which possess advanced
missile technologies to cancel military cooperation with its
Arab neighbors, especially Iran and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Local Hebrew daily Marriv reported today that Netanyahu will
offer a 3-billion-U.S.-dollar deal to purchase Russia's oil and
gas in exchange for its agreement to halt weapons sales to Iran
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Another sensitive issue for Netanyahu will be to decide
whether Israel will pursue a strategic relationship with
Moscow. In 1995, the two countries signed a defense memorandum
that both Israeli and Russian officials acknowledge has
virtually been ignored.
</P>
<P>
Israel hopes to promote joint ventures with Russia in defense
contracts. Several projects got stuck because Moscow has blocked
deals involving third countries, such as the upgrading of about
3,500 Mig-21 fighter planes sold by the former Soviet Union around
the world.
</P>
<P>
For Russia, which is striving to oppose the eastward expansion
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Israel is
considered a strategic partner to influence the United States.
</P>
<P>
Russian diplomats have been urging Israel to lobby the
U.S. government to abandon the NATO expansion, saying that it
could increase tensions in the Middle East, the English daily
The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Russian talks are also expected to cover the role
of Russia, co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process together
with the U.S., in pushing forward the peace march, which has
been facing with difficulties since Netanyahu's access to power
in June.
</P>
<P>
Israel hopes Russia to play a more active role in the process,
especially in helping resume the stalled Israeli-Syrian peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, Israel looks forward to a faster growth
the bilateral trade, whose volume rose to 350 million U.S. dollars
last year from only 44 million dollars in 1992.

Netanyahu's visit to Egypt last week.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Deputies attending the current
session of the National People's Congress, the Chinese
legislature, warn against a possible fall in grain output after
last year's record harvest of 480 billion kg.
</P>
<P>
The good harvest owes much to the favorable weather last year,
Premier Li Peng said in his government work report, adding that
while the grain output rose, the outputs of cotton and oil-bearing
seeds dropped a bit due to reduced sown area.
</P>
<P>
Deputies concurred that last year's record grain output
outperformed the actual capacity of China's agricultural
production, and voiced their concern about a possible fall in
grain output as had been the case several times in the past.
</P>
<P>
Lu Xueyi, a deputy from east China's Jiangsu province, said
that there had been seven ups and downs in grain yield since the
founding of New China, and each bumper harvest was followed by a
steep drop in output, seriously affecting the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Among the seven, he pointed out, four were caused by
inappropriate policies deriving from a misunderstanding of China's
grain production capability.
</P>
<P>
He urged governments down from the central level to attach more
importance to the status of agriculture as the foundation of the
national economy after a good harvest.
</P>
<P>
In a White Paper on the Grain Issue released in 1996, the
Chinese government announced that China has the ability to feed
its people. In addition, the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) sets
the goal of producing 500 billion kg of grain in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
China prides on its achievement of feeding 22 percent of the
world's population with only seven percent of its farmland.
</P>
<P>
In the government work report, Premier Li Peng stressed that
agriculture should continue to be given top priority in economic
work, adding "with a large population but limited arable land and
frequent occurrences of natural disasters, China cannot afford to
neglect agricultural production at any time."
</P>
<P>
The premier's statement was unanimously acclaimed by deputies
and provincial government heads, the latter are attending the NPC
session in a non-voting capacity.

<TEXT>
<P>
The northeast province of Heilongjiang, one of the leading
grain producers in China, turned out 30.5 billion kg of grain, 4.5
billion kg more than in 1995 and fulfilling four years ahead of
schedule the target of grain output increase for the year 2000 set
by the central government.
</P>
<P>
However, Yue Qifeng, secretary of the provincial Party
committee, pointed out that the province still lacks sound basic
agricultural facilities, and agricultural production still relies
considerably on natural conditions.
</P>
<P>
"We shall not slack for a moment on agricultural work, in order
to make greater contribution to helping feed the nation," said
Yue.
</P>
<P>
Another main grain producer, central China's Hubei province,
was hit by severe floods last year. During the slack season last
winter and this spring, provincial authorities mobilized eight
million people and invested 1.7 billion yuan in rebuilding water
conservancy facilities that were destroyed by the floods, and in
consolidating dams and reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
The authorities also decided to invest an average of more than
two billion yuan each year in water conservancy projects during
the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
Governor Jiang Zhuping added that Hubei will spare no efforts
in popularizing improved varieties of crops, and in preventing and
treating plant diseases and pests.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China's Sichuan province, the most populous
in the country, plans to add 40 million yuan to its input in
agriculture this year, mainly for building water conservancy
projects.
</P>
<P>
The provincial authorities have worked out a plan for good
grain harvests in the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a sustained growth of agriculture, deputies pointed
out, agricultural production should be geared to a market economy,
to link up the millions of individual farmers with the big market,
and tackle such issues as finding a suitable mechanism for
agricultural development in a market economy and boosting the
economic efficiency and economies of scale of agricultural
production.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the deputies' concern over a possible drop in
grain output after a good harvest is in effect a propitious sign
for China's agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Government Advisors Calls for Making up Talents Shortage  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Members of China's top advisory
body are suggesting ways and means for the retrieval of a
generation of talents at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by Wang Zhaohua, a member of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National
Committee from the Chinese Association of the Aged People,
indicates that more than 42 percent of the professors and
associate professors and over 50 percent of the senior engineers,
research fellows and agronomists in China are expected to retire
around the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that of the one million-strong talented
people with senior professional titles, only 6.3 percent are aged
below 45 and 1.1 percent younger than 35 years. Besides, a great
drain on the number of talented people is also indicated.
</P>
<P>
"China has entered into a period of superseding the veterans by
the younger talents," Wang said, but added that the lack of
talents, especially a shortage of those promising in the
scientific and technological fields, will greatly affect the
sustained growth of the Chinese economy and is detrimental to the
country's international competitiveness."
</P>
<P>
The current difficulties are attributed not only to a loss of a
generation of talents that would have been trained in the absence
of the Cultural Revolution (19966-76) but to contradictions
between personnel supply and demand in the wake of accelerated
economic and social development during China's reform and
opening-up drive, Wang explained.
</P>
<P>
However, many other CPPCC members held that China can avoid a
crisis of a lack of talented people provided that proper measures
are adopted.
</P>
<P>
Wang went on to note that many retired experts, who have both
capability and desire to work, should be urged to go on working
or, at least, be encouraged to help train a contingent of younger
people.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, it is becoming increasingly popular to
re-employ retired workers. Many CPPCC members said that the
government should not keep to one pattern in upbringing talented
personnel, especially younger talents.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jianhua, a woman materials expert, said: "The mechanism
governing the selection of talented people under a planned economy
should be done away with."
</P>
<P>
Progress in this regard has already been made, greatly shorting
the time that is required for talented people to come to the fore.

<HEADLINE> Government Advisors Calls for Making up Talents Shortage (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In many important departments, the personnel policies have
begun to incline toward the younger people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of
Engineering and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences have
formulated their respective plans for training trans-century
personnel and some of their major study and research projects are
headed by younger, talented people.
</P>
<P>
Preferential treatment is believed to be an important factor
that affects the emergence of talented people, so Zhou Fuyu, an
expert of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, said that
the State should greatly raise the salary and housing conditions
for those talented people engaged in basic research and in high
technology.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Zhou added, efforts should also be made to turn
knowledge into economic benefits through reform.
</P>
<P>
However, some members shared the view that the spirit of
patriotism and contribution should continue to be emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"This was the foundmental motive force behind China's success
in developing the atom bomb and the technology for typesetting
Chinese characters with laser.
</P>
<P>
"Real talented people cannot be bought with money," said Gu Ke,
vice-chairman of the Shenzhen City Scientific Association.
</P>
<P>
He said that is the best opportune time right now for talents
to emerge, adding that reform, opening-up and economic
construction call for the launching of various kinds of
unprecedented large and high-tech projects.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot say that there is a shortage of a talents generation
simply because some units fail to persuade people to stay on," he
said. "The Shenzhen miracle is chiefly resultant from a free flow
of talented personnel."
</P>
<P>
Many other CPPCC members said that a reservoir of overseas
talents may become a major resource for China's development in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten or more years, a total of 270,000 people have
gone and studied overseas, and 90,000 of them have already
returned.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that talented people do not exclude high-quality
workers. And official sources noted that China is formulating a
plan right now to beef up professional education so as to help
provide a large number of high-quality workers for various
sectors.

<HEADLINE> Policy Preference for Interior Areas Bears Fruit (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The first half of 1997 marks two
important events for China's vast interior areas: the completion
of rail laying for the most expensive railway in the country, the
Nanning-Kunming, and the going into operation of a major power
generating plant in the coal-rich Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
These are initial results of China's plan to shift economic
focus to central and western regions which are underdeveloped
relative to the booming coastal areas which have enjoyed rapid
economic growth over the last 17 years.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, the central government will spend 75
billion yuan in Xinjiang, northwest China, alone to launch a
number of projects covering cotton, petrochemicals and chemical
fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
Central and western regions refer to all Chinese provinces and
regions except 12 coastal provinces and municipalities. The
widening development gap between the coastal and interior areas
has been a focus of attention for a few years for the National
People's Congress, China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
In a long-range development plan approved by the NPC at its
fourth session in March,1996, the government set it as an
important strategy to accelerate development in the central and
western areas so as to realize common prosperity for the entire
country in the next century.
</P>
<P>
The central government has vowed to support interior areas by
investing in a large number of resources exploitation and
infrastructure projects. Five policy measures have also been
formulated to spur economic development in these areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the first year for the implementation of the strategy,
investment grew remarkably in interior areas. In the first half of
last year, growth in investment in infrastructure and
technological renovations in these areas exceeded that in coastal
areas for the first time in many years. In the whole of 1996, more
than 43 percent of all investment money for key projects launched
last year went to the interior areas, compared with 30 percent in
the five years from 1991 to 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
The important shift in China's investment strategy shows that
China has made marked headway in bridging the widening gap in regional
economic development in the first year of the Ninth Five-Year Plan
period (1996-2000), said Li Xiaoxi, a noted economist and research
fellow from the State Council's Research Office.
</P>
<P>
As one of predominant economic indicators, the growth of
investment will undoubtedly lead to the rise of many other
economic indicators, said Li.
</P>
<P>
"It is a successful worldwide experience to promote the
economic development of a country through government investment in
infrastructure facilities," said Wu Jinglian, a well-known
economist.
</P>
<P>
Different from the open policy in the coastal areas, China's
policy shift to the central and western areas is mainly
represented by increased government input in infrastructure
construction so as to improve their investment environment, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Nanning-Kunming Railway is one of such projects which can
benefit 36,000 square kilometers, equivalent to five percent of
the total land area of Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi combined, said
Huang Kangsheng, an NPC deputy from a prefecture inhabited mainly
by ethnic groups of Bouyei and Miao nationalities in Guizhou.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Nanning-Kunming Railway, the central government has
also started the construction of Pingguo Aluminum Plant in
Guangxi, the Nanning-Kunming Optical Fiber, and the first and
second phases of Tianshengqiao hydropower station, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report delivered at the current NPC
session, Premier Li Peng promised further policy preference for
the central and western areas, which includes the construction of
a number of projects with vital importance to optimizing the
product mix and improving regional industrial distribution in
interior areas. Most of the projects listed by the Chinese premier
as key projects to be launched in 1997 are located in the interior
areas.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the central government has adopted more
effective measures to help develop the interior areas, which with
an improved investment environment are expected to attract more
foreign investment, said Ablait Abdureschit, chairman of Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
In light of such policy shift by the central government, he
said, Xinjiang has decided to open such investment areas as
agricultural development, energy and communications, the
petrochemical industry and infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Boost Pyrethrum Production This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Pyrethrum Board of Kenya
will distribute five million seedlings to farmers this year to
boost pyrethrum production, compared with three million seedlings
last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1997 Pyrethrum Growers Bulletin, the board
has raised five million seedlings in its nurseries ready for
distribution to the farmers for the 1997 planting season
beginning from March.
</P>
<P>
In last year's growing season, a total of three million
seedlings and 3,875 kilograms of seed were distributed, the
bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the steady increase of demand for pyrethrum
worldwide has called for new measures to expand the area under
the crop.
</P>
<P>
Starting last year, it added, many farmers in the east African
country have shown great interest in pyrethrum growing as the
board pays attractive prices to the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Pyrethrum products have become popular in recent years after
it was established by researchers that pyrethrins are practically
non-poisonous to mammals, having shown a rapid breakdown with no
residues in the environment and little build-up of resistance in
insect populations.
</P>
<P>
Because of the increasing consciousness of the risks
associated with widespread use of synthetic insecticides, the
demand for pyrethrum products has continued to increase in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
The current annual demand for pyrethrum in the world market
stands at about 20,000 tons of dried flowers, of which Kenya
produces about 50 percent, with Tanzania, Australia, Rwanda and
Papua New Guinea supplying the rest.
</P>
<P>
Kenya exports an average 9,000 tons of dried pyrethrum flowers
annually, which is an important foreign exchange earner in the
east African country.

<P>
HONOLULU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. admiral said here today
that the U.S. and Chinese navies have entered a new era of peace
and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The current visit by three Chinese naval ships to Hawaii and
coming tour of San Diego will be a milestone in the relations of
the two countries, said Admiral Archie Clemins, commander in chief
of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.
</P>
<P>

destroyers and an oiler and their crews, which arrived at the
Pearl Harbor today.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this was the first visit to the naval base in
eight years and the first ever to the American mainland.
</P>
<P>
Both navies share a common bond to maintaining peace and
prosperity in the Pacific region, Clemins said.
</P>
<P>
Noting expanding trade ties between the U.S. and China, he said
the bond is not just economic.
</P>
<P>
Clemins told reporters that the exchange and cooperation
between the two navies have been getting very well.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of local Chinese-Americans attended today's welcoming
ceremony. Leaders of the Chinese community in Honolulu have also

<TEXT>
<P>
HONOLULU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The current visit of Chinese
naval ships to the Pearl Harbor and the coming tour of San Diego
will increase mutual understanding and friendship, a visiting
Chinese naval commander said here today.
</P>
<P>
Vice Admiral Wang Yongguo, commander of the Chinese South China
Sea Fleet, said at the welcome ceremony hosted by the Pearl Harbor
naval base.
</P>

Shanghai on four occasions with a total of 3,800 sailors.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the Pacific will become a tie of friendship between
China and the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that all his sailors are envoys of friendship, and that
the tour is providing an opportunity to examine the long Voyage
abilities of the Chinese naval ships and crews.
</P>
<P>
The ships sailed 18 days against bad weather before arriving at
the Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the ceremony, Chinese Ambassador to the
U.S. Li Daoyu said the visit is a big event in the relations
between the two military forces and the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed the conviction that the relations between China
and the U.S. will continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
Two Chinese naval destroyers and one oiler arrived at the Pearl
Harbor earlier today to start a four-day visit in Hawaii.

<HEADLINE> PNA Rejects Israeli Unilateral Decision on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has rejected the unilateral decision made by
Israel on the scope of further troop pullbacks on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting here Sunday night with Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy, PNA Secretary-General Mahmoud Abbas (Abu
Mazen) protested the Israeli decision on withdrawing troops from
another 9 percent of the West Bank in the first stage of the
three-phase pullouts.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side complained that the scope of the first
pullback was too small. Abbas said the decision on the scope
should have been made after consultations with the PNA, adding
that the Palestinian side hoped it would be more than 30 percent
rather than only 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Levy insisted that Israel retain the sole right of deciding the
scope of further pullbacks, and this should not be a subject for
negotiations. He called on the Palestinian side to "lower
expectations."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the meeting was dominated by Palestinian concern
over the recent Israeli moves on the issue of East Jerusalem,
including the decision to build a new settlement in Har Homa and the
order to close four Palestinian offices in the controversial
city.
</P>
<P>
Levy also rejected a request by the Palestinian side to
reconsider the decision on building new Jewish homes in Har Homa,
citing that there was nothing in the Oslo accords which forbids
Israeli construction anywhere in the interim period, letting alone
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli decision to close four Palestinian offices,
the Palestinian officials acknowledged that the Oslo accords did
not permit the PNA to have offices in Jerusalem, but they denied
that the offices concerned were related to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The only agreement reached during the meeting was that both
sides agreed that talks on the final disposition of the
territories would resume, as scheduled, on March 17.
</P>
<P>
Other Israeli officials attending the meeting included
Foreign Ministry Director-General Eitan Bentsur, Cabinet
Secretary Danny Naveh and Army Planning Branch chief Shaul
Mofaz. Palestinian negotiators Saeb Erekat and Hassan Asfour as
well as Palestinian security head Mohammed Dahlan were also
present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the meeting, the Palestinian team returned
to Gaza to report to PNA President Yasser Arafat, who had just
come back from a visit to Jordan. Earlier Sunday in the Jordanian
capital of Amman, Arafat denounced the latest Israeli moves as
"conspiracies and tricks."
</P>
<P>
Levy and Abbas currently head the steering committee that
supervises nine parallel committees meeting on issues of
substance. There has been no breakthrough by any of these
panels.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Urges Israel to Cancel Settlement Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today urged Israel
to cancel its plans to set up new settlements for the Jewish
community in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia believed that the new settlements and the seizure of
Palestinian land would change the actual status of Jerusalem,
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia also believes that the latest Israeli action will
contribute to its efforts to make Jerusalem a Jewish city and it
fears this will soon become an accomplished fact," Abdullah was
quoted by the Malaysian news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced last week
the approval of new settlements in East Jerusalem and
ground-breaking works are scheduled for this month.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Malaysia condemns Israel's decision to set up new
settlements as it considers them a provocative move which would
have negative implications on the on-going peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia would support efforts to have an emergency
session of the U.N. General Assembly to debate and approve a
resolution to oppose the Israeli action.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia believes that a firm resolution from the assembly is
necessary to voice the common sentiments and views of the
international community on this issue, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The international community considers the Israeli action as
invalid and a violation of international law and U.N. Security
Council resolutions and also against the accord reached between
Israel and Palestine," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia regretted the failure of the U.N. Security Council
last week to approve a draft resolution on the matter, which had
the support of 14 members of the council but was vetoed by the
United States, he said.

size.

for broader inter-regional cooperation between the U.S. and the
ASEAN," he said.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan to Produce More Grain This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 10 (Xinhua)-- Sichuan, a major grain producer in
southwest China, will take more effective measures to increase
grain production this year.
</P>
<P>
The most populous province in China made steady progress in
grain production in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Its grain output soared to 46.92 billion kg last year, 1.1
billion kg up from the previous year's figure. Its agricultural
output value reached 181.9 billion yuan (22 billion US dollars), a
4.2-percent rise.
</P>
<P>
The goal for grain production this year is to increase the
output by 500 million kg.
</P>
<P>
To reach this quota, the local government will readjust
agricultural structures, raise the gross and unit grain output and
speed up animal husbandry and aquatic production.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government will also allocate 40 million yuan
(about 5 million US dollars) for construction of water-control
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Millions of agro-technicians will go down to rural areas to
popularize modern farming techniques in various forms. The ratio
of science to agricultural development will be raised from present
40 to 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the province will develop a diversified economy in
its countryside. Hilly areas will give priority to aquatic and
poultry raising. Areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups will
develop animal husbandry and fruit growing. Southern Sichuan will
cater to tobacco and sub-tropical fruit production.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Bans Use of Toxic Pesticides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has banned the use of
persistent, highly toxic pesticides by vegetable growers.
</P>
<P>
The ban, voted on last October, is now being actively enforced.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's urban residents consume 4,000 tons of fresh
vegetables daily, 70 percent of which come from the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Some growers continued to violate regulations, as city dwellers
paid scant attention to washing the vegetables before eating. Many
people suffered from poisoning, some were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
The city stopped the supply of highly concentrated pesticides
to provide safe vegetables for consumers, to prevent growers from
being poisoned in production, and to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
The ban stipulates that further poisoning occurrences or
environmental contaminations will be prosecuted.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Brighter Prospects for Malaysian-South African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela left here today for home "fully enriched" after a
five-day state visit to Malaysia, which paved the way for closer
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two countries signed the Trade Agreement
and the Merchant Shipping and Related Maritime Matters Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Trade agreement will grant each other the Most Favored
Nation treatment in matters relating to customs duties and foreign
trade formalities.
</P>
<P>
The pact will also enable the establishment of a Joint Trade
Committee to discuss measures to enhance two-way trade and
facilitate each other's participation in trade fairs and
exhibitions which are exempted from customs duties and other
charges for their samples.
</P>
<P>
This augurs well for closer economic cooperation, especially
for further stimulating the flow of trade, investments and
individual business initiatives between the two countries,
Malaysian International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz
said after the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysia-South Africa Business Council (MSABC) was launched
jointly by Mandela and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
during the visit to promote closer contacts between the respective
business communities and governments.
</P>
<P>
Both Mahathir and Mandela stressed the need to strengthen the
economic cooperation between Malaysia and South Africa during
their talks.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir assured Mandela that Malaysia would help the South
Africans, especially the blacks, by sharing with them its
experience and expertise in various fields such as
entrepreneurship, human resource development and skills training.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who wants to see more Malaysian investments in his
republic, particularly through joint ventures, assured Malaysian
investors of the safety of their investments as he said South
Africa is stable.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, which established diplomatic relations with South
Africa in late 1993 after the dismantling of apartheid there, has
been supportive of the national unity government of Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, who made an unofficial stopover in South Africa in
1992, paid his first official visit to South Africa in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the two countries' ties, especially economic
cooperation, between Malaysia and South Africa have been
developing at a fast pace.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is now the four largest investor in South Africa with
total investments so far standing at 3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is Malaysia's largest trading partner in Africa.
In 1996, total trade amounted to 1.362 billion ringgit (about
544.8 million dollars), an increase of 14.3 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's exports to South Africa, amounting to about 287.6
million dollars in 1996, include palm oil, wood, natural rubber
and latex, telecommunications and sound equipment, office
machinery and data processing machines. It imports from the
country gold, iron and steel bars, cereals, paper and paperboard
and fertilizers, which were valued at about 257.2 million dollars
in the year.
</P>
<P>
With the new agreements signed, the launching of the MSABC and
the political will the leaders expressed, Mandela's fruitful visit
opened up broad prospects for closer relations and cooperation
between Malaysia and South Africa, observers said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen Expressway Co Ltd
in Guangdong Province raised 1.763 billion yuan (one U.S. dollar
equals 8.3 Chinese yuan) from the issue of H shares in Hong Kong
from March 4 to 7.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 500 million yuan more than the company's original
expectation of 1.2-1.4 billion yuan through this issue of shares.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to build a 44.3 km expressway linking
Shenzhen Airport and He'ao. The road is expected to be completed
in June 1999, according to earlier reports.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Expressway is the second highway enterprise listed
on the Hong Kong Stock Bourse. Anhui Expressway Co Ltd was listed
in Hong Kong late last year.
</P>
<P>
The stock market has become a new source for overseas capital
to facilitate the building of the nation's highways.
</P>
<P>
China plans to build 6,500 kilometers of highways during the
1996-2000 period, and needs some 65 billion U.S. dollars, 15 to 24
percent of which will be a capital shortfall.

<HEADLINE> Remains of 2,000-Year-Old Imperial Resort Unearthed in Liaoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Remains of an imperial resort of
the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC) has been found on the coast of
northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The resort covers an area of 25 sq km, nearly 35 times that of
the Beijing-based Palace Museum which was the imperial residence
of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Exploration at the site has shown that a 1.5-km wall enclosed
the palace compand, in which a square building foundation
measuring 30 m at its side is located in the central part.
</P>
<P>
Big tile ends with dragon-like motifs, hollowed brick steps,
and pottery well rims have been found among the remains.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that such construction materials,
which have been appraised as first degree cultural relics under
state protection, provide a clue to the restoration of the
building.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, the resort is the best-preserved Qin
site ever found.
</P>
<P>
Building remains from the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) have been
found above those from the Qin Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The excavators, from the provincial Institute of Archaeology,
have been awarded for their excellent site work by the State
Bureau of Cultural Relics.

<HEADLINE> NPC Increases Exchanges, Cooperation with Foreign Counterparts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The National People's Congress
(NPC) and its Standing Committee increased their exchanges and
cooperation with the parliaments of other countries and
international parliamentary organizations last year, a senior
legislator said here today.
</P>
<P>
Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee made
the remark while delivering a work report of the NPC Standing
Committee to the fifth session of the Eighth NPC.
</P>
<P>
For the most important event last year, the Standing Committee
successfully organized the 96th conference of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), which was regarded as the most
high-level international political meeting ever held in China
since its founding in 1949, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary delegations from 118 countries and 23
international organizations participated in the IPU conference.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the efforts of the NPC delegation and its cooperation
with the delegations of other countries during the conference, the
general debates and the resolutions adopted reflect the appeal of
most developing countries for equality, cooperation, development,
and opposition against hegemonism and power politics.
</P>
<P>
During the IPU conference, Tian said, the chairman and
vice-chairpersons of the NPC Standing Committee met with the
parliamentary delegations of 34 countries separately, briefing
them on China's great achievements in reform and opening up and on
its major progress in building socialist democracy and a socialist
legal system.
</P>
<P>
"This has increased the exchanges and cooperation between the
parliaments of China and other countries and the international
parliamentary organizations," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to heads of the IPU and delegations of many
countries, Tian said, they were deeply impressed by the meticulous
preparation and warmhearted reception of the NPC and the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
Also last year, Tian told that Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC
Standing Committee, made successful visits to a number of
countries on two occasions, which helped increase mutual
understanding and facilitated the further development of friendly
cooperation and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Delegations led by vice-chairpersons or dispatched by the
special commissions and other departments under the Standing
Committee also visited some countries and participated in a number
of international meetings.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Tian said that last year the NPC Standing Committee
received 34 foreign parliamentary delegations and its special
commissions received 23 delegations of committees or institutions
of foreign parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NPC set up six friendship groups dealing with
foreign parliaments, raising to 45 the number of bilateral
friendship groups.
</P>
<P>
Multi-layer and multi-channel foreign-related activities have
reinforced exchanges between the NPC and foreign parliaments,
promoting the friendship between the Chinese people and people of
other countries, and advancing economic, trade, scientific and
technological, cultural and educational cooperation with other
countries, Tian said.

<HEADLINE> China's Conservation Efforts Bring Hope to Endangered Animals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Efforts to preserve China's
nearly 100 endangered species show promise in a number of reserves
and breeding centers.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Zhibao, Vice-Minister of Forestry, to date
574 natural reserves for wildlife have been established, which
accounts for nearly six percent of the total land area of China.
</P>
<P>
"The figure is expected to be doubled in the next ten years,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice-minister, the current 14 breeding centers
for endangered animals across China play a key role in the
conservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
"For example," he said, "the breeding center for Chinese
alligators, an animal so threatened that only 200 remained some
ten years ago, has developed successful techniques to reproduce
more alligators by the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, significant achievements have also been made
in the conservation of the giant panda and crested ibis, both of
which only exist in China.
</P>
<P>
He said that although natural disasters have constantly hit the
habitats of the giant panda, the number of this world famous rare
animal remains about 1,000 as a result of the state conservation
efforts.
</P>
<P>
"When first discovered, the number of crested ibis was only
seven, but now the figure has been increased to 80," Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Guests Comment on Tourism Quality in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Most overseas tourists to China
in 1996 were satisfied with the hotel and restaurant service,
according to a recent survey taken by the China National Tourism
Administration.
</P>
<P>
The CNTA poll noted that 80.9 percent of the overseas guests
polled were content with the comprehensive service offered by
China. And 93.7 percent of the travelers were happy with the hotel
quality.
</P>
<P>
Twelve provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions,
including Beijing, Jiangsu, Guangxi and Shaanxi, scored four or five
points in the survey in which the highest rating was five points.
</P>
<P>
The sample poll conducted by CNTA covered seven aspects
including hotel, restaurant, city-transportation, market order and
hygiene, entertainment, shopping, and tourist guide.
</P>
<P>
About 40,000 overseas air passengers filled the inquiry
form at the country's major airports, according to Zhong Haisheng,
deputy director of CNTA's Planning and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, overseas tourist arrivals to China topped 51.12
million.
</P>
<P>
"The results of the poll indicate that though tourism quality
in China has constantly improved, it still lags far behind
the international standard", commented a CNTA official.
</P>
<P>
China now ranks fifth in overseas tourist arrivals and tourism
is expected to continue to grow in coming years. The Chinese
tourist industry has realized that quality is the most vital
factor for sharpening the competitive edge in the increasingly
competitive market.
</P>
<P>
During a national tourism conference held recently, CNTA
authorities called for the tourism sector in each locality to
strengthen its awareness of service quality and to do their utmost
to improve it.

which is scheduled for June 29 to July 3.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Foreign Ministry Spokesman Thinakorn Kannasuta said
 Sunday that the meeting was part of a strategy of economy-led
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which will be attended by 104 honorary consuls, is
designed to help the consuls get first-hand information about
investment and trade in Thailand while helping Thai businessmen
know business opportunities overseas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand currently appoints local nationals as its honorary
consuls in countries or regions where it had not stationed
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The honorary consuls had a mandate to issue Thai visas, but
could not conduct negotiations on the behalf of the kingdom, the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Petition on Forming New Govt Submitted to Nepali King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Nepal's political
parties today submitted a petition to King Birendra for forming a
new coalition government to replace the one that resigned last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The petition, signed by a majority of lower house MPs including
those of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist,
CPN-UML), the National Democratic Party (RPP) and the Nepal
Goodwill Party (NSP), was registered at the royal palace this
morning, sources of the palace said.
</P>
<P>
RPP parliamentary leader Lokendra Bahadur Chand will become
prime minister of the proposed three-party coalition under the
petition.
</P>
<P>
Chand, a former prime minister in the partyless Panchayat era
which ended in 1990 following a nationwide people's movement,
played a crucial role in bringing down the outgoing coalition
government led by Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress (NC)
party.
</P>
<P>
Deuba resigned Thursday after failing to secure a confidence
vote for his government as ruling partners the RPP and NSP
withdrew from the coalition and two MPs of his own NC party
defected.
</P>
<P>
Chand, backed by a faction within his party, has been trying to
oust the Deuba government by joining hands with the main
opposition CPN-UML, the largest party with 90 MPs in the 205-seat
lower house.
</P>
<P>
Two earlier attempts by Chand to overthrow the government
through no-confidence motion in March and December last year
failed as some MPs of his RPP party chose to remain in the ruling
side at the last minute when voting was held in the house.
</P>
<P>
However, the no-confidence motion last December reduced the
Deuba government to a minority status, forcing Deuba to seek the
confidence vote last week.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the royal palace will make an announcement
on the three parties' petition this evening.

<HEADLINE> Tribal Refugees to Return to Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Tribal refugees of Bangladesh's
southeastern Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) will start returning
home from refugee camps in the Indian state of Tripura on March
28.
</P>
<P>
Some 5,000 refugees will be repatriated in the first phase, the
local press today quoted a joint declaration issued by a
government committee and tribal leaders as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The National Committee on CHT led by Chief Whip Abul Hasnat
Abdullah and leaders of Parbatya Chattagram Jumma Sharanarty
Kalyan Samity reached a 20-point agreement to help arrange a safe
return of tribal refugees to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the government and the tribal leaders
of the CHT will hold the next round of peace talks in the
country's capital, Dhaka, on March 12, in a bid to put an end to
the long-standing CHT insurgency problem.
</P>
<P>
A two-decade-old bush war between the security forces and the
tribal rebels, who have been fighting since 1973 for autonomy of
the CHT districts bordering India and Myanmar, have forced about
50,000 tribal people out of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Under the newly-signed agreement, a joint task force will be
formed comprising the CHT national committee members and tribal
refugees to provide support for and monitor the implementation of
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a delegation of the national committee visited the
camps where tribal people are living and discussed issues and
privileges to be provided by the Bangladeshi government as
confidence-building measures.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, each of the repatriated refugee family
will be provided with a total of 15,000 taka (about 375 U.S.
dollars) as house building and agricultural grants.
</P>
<P>
The refugee families, who have cultivable lands, will be given
10,000 taka (about 250 dollars) each to purchase a pair of
bullocks after their return home.
</P>
<P>
The refugees who are enjoying their ancestral lands but failed
to record them in their own names will be given the facility after
the collection of succession certificates from the headmen.
</P>
<P>
For landless families, each of them will be given 3,000 taka
(about 75 dollars) to purchase cows and steps will be taken to
allocate land to those families as per the government's policy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the general amnesty announced by the government in
the CHT region will remain in force and will be applicable to
every case of arrest warrant relating to emergency.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Govt Out to Resolve Sugar Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government, under
mounting pressure from sugar producers, has agreed to take
measures to save the country's sugar industry which has been
plagued by a price crisis for months.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ruben Torres, a close aide to President
Fidel Ramos, said Friday that the government has drawn up a series
of measures to stabilize the slumping sugar prices on the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
Torres admitted that excessive import of sugar last year has
caused a sugar surplus in the country and resulted in a drastic
drop in sugar prices since last fall, causing huge losses to the
industry.
</P>
<P>
He said these measures were supported by sugar industry leaders
representing the country's more than half a million sugar millers,
planters and traders.
</P>
<P>
Torres heads an inter-agency task force created by Ramos
earlier this year to map out measures to save the slumping sugar
industry.
</P>
<P>
Under the measures, four regional task forces, one each for
Luzon, Western Visayas, Eastern Visayas and Mindanao, will be set
up to conduct consultations in sugar-producing provinces and
determine the best solutions to the woes of the industry.
</P>
<P>
To prevent another sugar glut on the domestic market, the
government will immediately limit the import of sugar by local
traders and stop the import of sugar by duty-free shops.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Food Authority will expand its sugar
procurement from local sugar producers to prop up sugar prices on
the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Torres also said the government is considering sugar producers'
request for a delay in the reduction of import tariffs on raw
sugar. The import tariffs are scheduled to go down in July to 80
percent from the current 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the government stopped short of suspending a 35-percent
tariff discount given to refined sugar imports from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as demanded by
sugar producers.
</P>
<P>
Since last September, the country's sugar prices have been
nose-diving because of an estimated sugar glut of one million tons
on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The farm gate price for a 50-kilogram bag of sugar dropped to a
record low of less than 500 pesos (19 U.S. dollars) last December,
compared with 1,000 pesos (38 dollars) in 1995. Currently, the
farm gate price went up to 575 pesos (22 dollars) after the
government began to buy sugar last month.
</P>
<P>
Because of depressed prices, sugar planters and millers said
they hardly had cash to pay their workers' wages and bank loans.
The jobs of 500,000 workers directly employed by the sugar
industry have been under threat due to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Sugar producers and farmers have blamed the country's free
trade policy, especially the 35-percent tariff discount on refined
sugar imports, for the glut in sugar supply.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the crisis will worsen if tariff for imported
raw sugar is reduced from the current 100 percent to 80 percent as
planned in July.
</P>
<P>
But sugar analysts here believed trade protection measures are
not the prescription for the ills obsessing the sugar industry.
</P>
<P>
For seven decades until the 1980s, sugar had been the
Philippines' top export commodity because of preferential trade
arrangements with the United States, the country's former colonial
ruler.
</P>
<P>
With the privilege given by the U.S. and the then steep tariffs
on imported sugar, sugar producers invested little in modernizing
their farms with better technology and hiring professional
managers for greater efficiency, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The sugar industry, equipped with out-dated facilities and
management mechanism, now became no longer competitive on both
global and domestic markets.
</P>
<P>
Currently, sugar production cost in the country is higher than
in many other countries due to inefficient production and milling
facilities. As a result, sugar prices in the country are higher
than those on the world market.
</P>
<P>
The analysts said the only effective way to resolve the sugar
crisis for good is to modernize the industry to make it
competitive globally.

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Vietnamese Prime
Minister Vo Van Kiet has assured India of full support for its
membership in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)

</P>
<P>
Kiet, who arrived here on March 7 on a three-day state visit to
India for enhancing bilateral ties and cooperation, called on
Indian President S. D. Sharma and held talks with Indian Prime
Minister Deve Gowda on bilateral relations as well as on regional
and international issues of mutual concern, official sources said

<P>
During the visit, the two sides signed four cooperation
agreements including bilateral trade, mutual protection and
promotion of investments, cooperation in the environment and
forestry and a 10-million U.S. dollar credit facility from India
to Vietnam in a bid to facilitate export of capital goods and
services from India.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is reportedly seeking India's cooperation in the field
of defense production and in the setting up of stock exchanges as
Vietnam is shifting to a market economy. India would soon send an
experts team to Vietnam for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
India would also assist Vietnam in offshore exploration of
crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Vietnam is reported to want India's technical help in
the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed to hold the next meeting of the
India-Vietnam Joint Commission in Hanoi in July this year.

<HEADLINE> 7,500 Die of Air Pollution in India's Capital in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- As many as 7,500 people died
premature deaths while a whopping 2.5 million people received
medical treatment on account of air pollution-related diseases in
New Delhi, capital of India, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
air pollution has become the most serious health hazard in the
city and, if not checked in time, it would make Delhi an unlivable
city very soon, a Delhi government official quoted Delhi Transport
Minister Rajendra Gupta as saying here today.
</P>
<P>
The mounting pollution level in the capital is exacting a heavy
toll on Delhi citizens and it is leading to the birth of premature
and even deformed babies.
</P>
<P>
Something needed to be done to check the increasing number of
vehicles on the roads as vehicular pollution was the single
largest contributor to air pollution, its share being over 75
percent.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, there are 2.8 million vehicles on Delhi roads,
of which around 2 million are two-wheelers. Studies show that
two-wheelers and auto-rickshaws cause the greatest damage to
healthy air.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi government has decided to impound polluting vehicles
from the city and outside for keeping smoke emissions under the
permissible limit.

<P>
SINGAPORE, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Singapore police arrested 178
suspected secret-society members and drug abusers in a major
operation over the weekend, the Straits Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Dressed in plain clothes, about 100 men from the main
enforcement units in the Home Affairs Ministry covered six
night-spots in the downtown area, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Code-named Operation Cheetah, the three-hour operation, jointly
conducted by the Police, Central Narcotics Bureau, Singapore Civil
Defense Force and the Customs &AMP; Excise Department, began at about
11 p.m. on Saturday night and concluded the following morning at
around 2 a.m..
</P>
<P>
A total of 180 persons were arrested during the operation, with
54 of them being suspected drug abusers and the other 124,
suspected gangsters and two under-age drinkers. In Singapore,
those who are under the age of 18 are not allowed to consume
alcoholic drinks.
</P>
<P>
Central Narcotics Bureau deputy director Tan Seck Kang said
that out of the 54 suspects arrested, 26 tested positive for
drugs, while six were to be sent to Drug rehabilitation Centers as
they had traces of some heroin in their urine samples.
</P>
<P>
The Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which actually led
the operation, said it was still interrogating all 124 suspected
gangsters nabbed during the operation. Most of the arrested were
between 16 and 40 years and were thought to be involved in secret
societies and street-corner gangs.

<HEADLINE> Russian Deputy PM Starts Visit to Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg
Lobov arrived here today on a two-day visit to promote the
economic cooperation between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Lobov will meet Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov, caretaker
Prime Minister Stefan Sofianskia and other officials during his
stay, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues the leaders of the two nations will discuss
are: a gas pipeline linking Russia, Yugoslavia, Macedonia and
Greece via Bulgaria, and an oil pipeline transporting Russian oil
to Bulgaria and Greece.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they will also tackle issues of tax exemption of
Bulgarian exports to Russia, Russia's payment of arrears to
Bulgaria, cooperation in building a nuclear power plant in
Bulgaria, establishment of a free trade zone and NATO's eastward
expansion.
</P>
<P>
The deals, which Lobov had tried but failed to clinch in his
last visit to Sofia in December 1996, were reported to be able to
provide Bulgaria with an estimated annual gain of 6 billion
U.S. dollars from the gas pipeline, and an annual supply of 2
billion dollars worth of Russian oil.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of his departure, Lobov said that pacts could be
concluded if the two countries mend differences over opening a
joint energy company and NATO's expansion.
</P>
<P>
Lobov hoped Bulgaria could adopt a more practical stance on
NATO's expansion, which he said could create new division in
Europe and threaten Russia's national security, according to media
reports here.
</P>
<P>
However, Bulgaria's new caretaker government, sworn in last
month, was the last eastern European country to voice its desire
for NATO membership.

HANOI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is working hard at
strategic programs to preserve biodiversity and protect the
environment in order to reduce risks to the ecosystem and human
health.
</P>
<P>
Immediate measures to be taken in the 1996-2000 period include
the implementation of a national program for phasing out ozone
depleting substances, and more than 60 projects totaling nearly
210 million U.S. dollars to preserve, and develop biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
Official reports say Vietnam's forest coverage has reduced
sharply from 60 percent in the 1940s to 28 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's wood reserves are now estimated at only 48 million
tons because of forest destruction and unplanned logging.
</P>
<P>
Environmental conditions are worsening alarmingly because of
factory pollution and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The concentration of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and carbon dioxide
(CO2) measured in some urban areas and road intersections is
respectively 8-10 times and three times higher than designated
safety standards.
</P>

<HEADLINE> All Set for Hong Kong's Return, Says Qian Qichen (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the field of laws, he said, the Preparatory Committee first
deliberated the implementation of the Nationality Law of the
People's Republic of China in the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with relevant provisions in the Basic Law of the
HKSAR and the Nationality Law, and in line with the consistent
policy of the Chinese government on the issue of Hong Kong
residents' nationality, we had taken Hong Kong's history and
current situation into account to devise a flexible and loose
plan, and had suggested the NPC Standing Committee to explain a
certain problems concerning the implementation of the Nationality
Law in the HKSAR," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Preparatory Committee also studied Article
24, Section 2 of the Basic Law of the HKSAR, which stipulates on
the qualifications of the permanent residents of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
"In view of Hong Kong's specific situation, and proceeding from
the overall situation of stabilizing public sentiments and
benefiting the smooth transition, we had set forth the
'suggestions on the implementation of Article 24, Section 2 of the
HKSAR Basic Law', which could provide reference for the HKSAR in
formulating detailed rules and regulations," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The methods for the implementation of the Nationality Law and
Article 24 of the Basic Law in the HKSAR, he added, had won
favorable comments of the Hong Kong people, for stabilizing Hong
Kong's public feeling and laying a foundation for the preparatory
work for the HKSAR in the aspects of nationality and identity of
permanent residents.
</P>
<P>
He noted that another major task for his committee in the legal
aspect was to make an all-round inspection of the existing laws in
Hong Kong, and put forward suggestions on the disposal of laws
that have contravened the Basic Law of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
"We have completed the examination and study of all existing
Hong Kong laws in the written form, including more than 640
chapters of regulations and over 1,100 auxiliary laws," Qian said.

<P>
He said that one major problem for handling Hong Kong's
existing laws is the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, enacted
in June of 1991 by the British side without consultations between
the two sides, and regardless of opposition from the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
He said that in accordance with the HKSAR Basic Law and the
NPC's relevant decisions concerning the Basic Law, the Preparatory
Committee had put forward "suggestions on handling Hong Kong's
existing laws," on the basis of which the 24th session of the
Eighth NPC Standing Committee adopted a "Decision on Handling Hong
Kong's Existing Laws in Accordance with Article 160 of the Basic
Law of the HKSAR" on February 23 this year.
</P>
<P>
Calling the return of Hong Kong "a joyous occasion for the
entire Chinese people," he said that the Preparatory Committee has
set a rough framework for non-governmental celebrations of the
event, and has supported and promoted the establishment of a
"committee for activities to mark Hong Kong's return to the
motherland by various sectors in Hong Kong," which is now busy
preparing some grand non-governmental celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee also adopted a resolution, which
suggested that the HKSAR government build a monument in Hong Kong
to mark the region's return to the embrace of the motherland, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Since the regional emblem and flag of the HKSAR will naturally
be used in large quantities in celebrations of Hong Kong's
return, he said, the Preparatory Committee also formulated an
"interim method for the use of the regional flag and emblem of the
HKSAR", so as to safeguard the dignity of the regional flag and

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Coconut Production Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's coconut production
dropped 2 percent during the first ten months of 1996 according
to the latest figure from the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Total coconut production decreased to 2,249.1 million as
against 2,295.1 million during the same period the previous year.
</P>
<P>
There was also a decline in desiccated coconut production of 8
percent and coconut oil production 4 percent, the bank says.
</P>
<P>
The export of copra dropped 24 percent and the export of fresh
coconuts dropped 37 percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
In October 1996 desiccated coconut production increased 6
percent but coconut oil production dropped 4 percent and copra
exports declined 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline in Sri Lanka's coconut production was mainly due to
the drought that prevailed in coconut cultivation areas in the
country, the bank explains.
</P>
<P>
The felling of coconut trees for real estate business purposes
also contributed to the decline.
</P>
<P>
Despite the poor performance of Sri Lanka's coconut industry,
the country's tea and rubber production increased 5 and 11 percent
respectively during the first ten months of last year.
</P>
<P>
Coconut, tea and rubber are three main economic crops and
leading export items of Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> All Set for Hong Kong's Return, Says Qian Qichen (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's return to the embrace
of the motherland has become a foregone conclusion, and the
overall situation for its return is inspiring, Qian Qichen said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said in a report to the
Fifth Session of the National People's Congress (NPC), the
committee has done all things possible in line with the principles
of"one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" and a high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
In the Fourth Plenary Meeting of the current NPC session, he
said that since its establishment in early last year, the
committee has abided by the principle of "one country, two
systems", the Basic Law and the relevant decisions of the NPC and
its Standing Committee to deal with the Hong Kong issue, when
stipulating relevant regulations and decisions.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he added, the committee has faced up to the HK people,
relied on them and absorbed their views and suggestions in its
working process to promote involvement by HK people in the work of
establishing the HKSAR, he said, adding that it is precisely for
this reason that the work of the Preparatory Committee has scored
smooth progress.
</P>
<P>
Since the preparatory committee was established on January 26,
1996, it has concentrated on issues concerning the establishment
of HKSAR in accordance with the Basic Law of HKSAR and relevant
decisions by the NPC and its Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
With the concerted efforts of all members in the preparatory
committee, he said, the committee has concluded the following
matters such as establishment of the Selection Committee for the
first HKSAR Government, election of the first chief executive of
the HKSAR and the HKSAR Provisional Legislative Council. Moreover,
it has also set forth proposals on dealing with the existing laws
in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> All Set for Hong Kong's Return, Says Qian Qichen  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The preparatory committee of has raised suggestions on some
major economic issues concerning the stable transition and a
smooth transfer of power and arrangement of celebration activities
to mark HK's return to the motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen described the formation of the Selection Committee
for the First HKSAR Government that comprises 400 permanent
residents of Hong Kong as the "dragon head" in the work to prepare
for the establishment of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
In April, 1996, the preparatory committee conducted, in an
extensive way, consultancies among the Hong Kong people on the
details involved in the establishment of the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
And detailed rules on establishing the Selection Committee were
worked out, based on the suggestions of the Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
On November 2, 1996, the plenary meeting of the Preparatory
Committee elected 340 members of the Selection Committee on secret
ballot. The 400-member Selection Committee for the First HKSAR
Government was established by the 340 members, together with 26
NPC deputies in the Hong Kong area and 34 members of the Chinese
People's Political Consulative Conference (CPPCC) National
Committee in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Qian also called the election of the first chief executive of
the HKSAR "an important issue which drew the attention in the
entire Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
On December 11, 1996, the Selection Committee elected the first
chief executive of the HKSAR Government on secret ballot in Hong
Kong. As a result, Tung Chee-hwa, one of three applicants for
chief executive, won 320 out of 398 votes and was elected the
first chief executive. Five days later, Li Peng, premier of the
State Council, signed a decree on appointment of Tung Chee-hwa as
the chief executive of the HKSAR Government.

<TEXT>
<P>
Qian said it is the best way to illustrate the principle of
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and "a high-degree of
autonomy" that a Provisional Legislative Council, which purely
consists of permanent Hong Kong residents, be set up as a
temporary arrangement before the first HKSAR Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
In March of 1996, a plenary session of the HKSAR Preparatory
Committee passed a decision on the formation of the HKSAR
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC), while the election method
for producing the PLC was adopted in October of the same year.
</P>
<P>
On December 21, 1996, the Selection Committee cast vote in
Shenzhen to elect the 60-member PLC, which on January 25 this year
elected its chairwoman, Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai.
</P>
<P>
The 60 PLC members include both figures from the industrial and
commercial circle and representatives of workers and ordinary
residents from the grassroots. Among the 34 incumbent members of
the British Hong Kong Legislative Council that had applied for a
post in the PLC, 33 were elected.
</P>
<P>
"The PLC has won acknowledgement and approval from Hong Kong
society, for it has the broadest representation," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the maintenance of Hong Kong's economic stability
and development is of critical importance to the smooth transition
and long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the Preparatory Committee had set up an economic
panel, to give full play to Hong Kong people's role in studying
and putting forth suggestions for a series of major problems,
which cover power handover and smooth transition of Hong Kong,
large local infrastructure projects, and Hong Kong's long-term
development," he explained.

"This year, the NPC Standing Committee will continue to take
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and
the Party's basic line as the guideline, and carry out the basic
principle of 'seizing opportunities, deepening reforms, opening
wider to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining
stability' in an all-round way," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Standing Committee would seriously fulfill its
duties, further complete the system of people's congresses, and

supervision on law enforcement, so as to play a still more
important role in promoting the rule of law and building the

</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the people's congress system is China's
basic political system that suits the country's specific national
conditions, and the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics founded by Deng Xiaoping is the scientific
guideline for the development of the system in the new historical
period.
</P>
<P>
"We must carry work forward at the behest of Comrade Deng
Xiaoping, unite more closely around the Party Central Committee
with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, and with a high sense of
responsibility, make painstaking and unremitting efforts to do a
good job, to contribute still more to the building of socialist

TIRANA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said today the European Union (EU) countries, especially
Italy, would help Albania out of its present difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Dini paid a visit to Albania today after Albanian President
Sali Berisha and the Albanian opposition parties reached an
agreement on national reconciliation, which has helped ease the
tenseness in the country.
</P>
<P>
Berisha told Dini that his government would abandon the illegal
"pyramid" fund raising which caused the recent upheavals in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He believed the agreement on national reconciliation would seek
a way for friendly nations and international financial
institutions to continue their aid to Albania.
</P>
<P>
Dini said his government would continue its aid to Albania and
would call for EU aid to Albania at the coming Brussels meeting
scheduled for March 24.
</P>
<P>
He said the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund were
working on special plans to help the country out of difficulty.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Expert Calls for Building Think Tanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China should pay attention to
building think tanks under a unified guidance of the government to
meet challenge of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Qu Shijing, head of the Center for the Study of English
literature under the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, made the
proposal at the current session of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that China, following the examples of other
countries, develop its social sciences research bodies into true
brain trusts and think tanks for the Party and the government,
using mathematical models and other modern theories to do study on
major issues for China's social, economic and cultural
development.
</P>
<P>
China's long-range plan for its national economic and social
development through the year 2010 makes it clear that researches
on major issues of economic and social development, reform and
opening-up should be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
And social scientists have participated in the formulation of
important policies and measures concerning, for example,
establishment of a socialist market economy, macroeconomic
controls and promotion of cultural and ethical progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qu proposed that the government provide standardized and
unified management over social sciences, like it does natural
sciences, and increase input in social sciences.
</P>
<P>
He urged the establishment of an incentive system for social
scientists, like that for natural sciences circles, and the
introduction of modern information technologies to improve
research in social sciences.
</P>
<P>
Qu suggested adjusting subjects for China's various social
science research bodies to avoid redundant projects on the same
subject, and changing some basic social science theories into
social technologies and social organizational management methods
that can be applied in China's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Social science study in China today is done mainly by people in
five quarters -- academies of social sciences, universities, Party
schools, government research bodies, and army research units, a
structure that gives rise to redundant projects.

Members of the Standing Committee maintain that strengthening
the work of the auditing institutions and fully tapping the role
of auditing are an important measure to improve financial
management, enhance macro-control and establish a supervision
mechanism for the socialist market economy, he said, adding such
measures will be continued in the future.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tian said, enhancing the work relating to the
handling of letters of complaints and visits by the people was
another aspect of the Standing Committee in performing its
supervisory function.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee's department that oversees the handling
of letters of complaints and visits received 11,547 visits and
handled 67,070 letters of complaints last year, prompting relevant
departments and localities to correct some wrong cases and helping
the masses of people solve some problems and difficulties, Tian
said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that guaranteeing the implementation of the
constitution and the laws is a key link in governing the country
by law and in building up a socialist legal system.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee will sum up the experience in its work
of supervision over recent years and focus on supervision of the
implementation of the constitution and other laws, in order to
facilitate the drive of administrative institutions carrying out
their duties in accordance with law and the judicial and
procuratorate bodies performing their functions in a fair and just
manner, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tian revealed that the Standing Committee's inspection and
supervision effort this year will focus on the implementation of
the Agriculture Law, the Law on Scientific and Technological
Development, the Forestry Law, the Water Law, the Product Quality
Law and other relevant laws.
</P>
<P>
The system that the Standing Committee conferences hear and
examine the work report of the State Council and its relevant
departments, of the Supreme People's Court and of the Supreme
People's Procuratorate will be further improved, he said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to enhance supervision over the
implementation of plans and budgets and of the building of a clean
and honest government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Tian called on the standing committee of the people's
congresses at all levels to combine the publication and education
of laws with the concrete practices of social development.

enforcement supervision teams, led by eight vice-chairpersons of
the NPC Standing Committee, to examine the implementation of the
Agriculture Law, the Education Law, the Law on Environmental
Protection, the Labor Law, and the decision on comprehensive
control of social security, Tian said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Standing Committee was keen on improving its
examination methods by combining inspection from atop with
self-examination, and examination by the people's congresses with
the supervision by the masses of people and public opinions,
combining comprehensive inspection with examinations on particular
subjects.
</P>
<P>
A telephone hot-line was opened for implementation of the Law
on Environmental Protection, Tian said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, more than 5,000 telephone calls, letters of
complaints and visits were received in the examination of the law,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the current NPC has examined the
implementation of 17 laws while implementation of some laws has
been examined twice and three times in a row, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Examinations have bolstered the legal awareness and concept of
the masses of officials and people and effectively facilitated the
implementation of laws, he said.
</P>
<P>
On supervision of the work of the administrative and judicial
institutions, Tian said, the Standing Committee for the first time
heard and reviewed the auditing work report on the implementation
of the 1995 central budget last June.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Business leaders from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will push for the
adoption of an "ASEAN First Policy" as a means of developing the
capital goods industry in the region.
</P>
<P>
Jose Concepcion, executive committee chair of the ASEAN Chamber
of Commerce and Industry, said Sunday that ASEAN governments
should give priority to capital goods sourced from the region,
particularly when it comes to government projects, according to
today's local press.
</P>
<P>
"We should give priority to ASEAN national or corporations in
the bidding for government procurement projects within the
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said in this way, ASEAN countries will be encouraged to
produce their own capital goods and therefore do away with their
dependence on developed countries for capital goods requirement.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Concepcion said the proposal will be similar to the trading
arrangements between countries of the North American Free Trade
Area, which gives priority to goods and services coming from the
trade bloc.
</P>
<P>
For ASEAN, businessmen are targeting at least a 50-percent
ASEAN content in all capital goods in five years not only to
develop the capital goods industry but to correct the 39
billion-U.S.-dollar current account deficit of the region against
the rest of the world, he said.

<HEADLINE> China's People's Congress System to Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) will conscientiously perform its
duties in 1997, to improve the people's congress system and play a
bigger role in building a country with a sound socialist legal
system.
</P>
<P>
Tian Jiyun, Vice Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, made
the remark today when he delivered a work report of the committee
to the Fifth Session of the Eighth NPC.
</P>
<P>
He said that the people's congress system is China's
fundamental political system that conforms with its actual
conditions, and that Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics, especially the part concerning
democracy and the establishment of a legal system, is the guidance
for adhering and improving the people's congress system in the new
historical period.
</P>
<P>
He vowed, on behalf of the committee, to carry work forward at
Deng's behest, and guided by the theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics and the basic line of the Party, more
closely unite around the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin
at the core, unswervingly and untiringly perform the duty of the
people's congress with a strong sense of responsibility and
mission, to make new contributions to strengthening socialist
democracy and a socialist legal system and guarantee a smooth
progression of reform, opening-up and modernization.
</P>
<P>
The vice chairman pointed out that the year of 1997 is a very
important one in the history of China's development. During the
year, the Communist Party of China will convene its 15th national
congress and China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
This year, he noted, apart from speeding up the pace of
legislation and improving supervision over law enforcement, the
NPC Standing Committee will make preparations for Hong Kong's
return and the election of deputies to the next NPC.
</P>
<P>
A Basic Law Committee will be established as a working
committee under the NPC Standing Committee in Hong Kong after the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region comes
into effect, said Tian, adding that the NPC Standing Committee
will do a good job of presiding over the election of NPC deputies
in Hong Kong in accordance with an election method to be adopted
by the NPC at its current session.
</P>
<P>
Election of deputies to the next people's congresses at
national, provincial, municipal and county levels will start in
the latter half of this year, Tian noted. And the NPC Standing
Committee will provide strengthened guidance over elections to
guarantee their smooth progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that elections should strictly abide by the
Election Law, the Organization Law and resolutions on relevant
legal matters and that the democratic rights of voters and
deputies should be respected.
</P>
<P>
Tian called for improving the knowledge structure and age
structure of NPC deputies and Standing Committee members in the
coming elections and attaching importance to deputies' quality and
capability of discussing state affairs while ensuring their broad
representation. He also called for a gradual professional
specialization and a younger average age for members of the NPC
Standing Committee
</P>
<P>
Tian said that much attention should be paid to popular legal
education and supervision over the implementation of a resolution
of the NPC Standing Committee on continuing popular legal
education.
</P>
<P>
He also called on standing committees of people's congresses
at all levels to promote the rule of law in all regions and in
all walks of life by integrating legal education with economic
and social development realities.

<HEADLINE> NPC Satisfied with Agriculture Law Enforcement (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) --China has maintained a faster
growth in agriculture input than regular state revenue increases
and successfully curbed to a certain extent excessive price hikes
for capital goods for farm use during 1994-1996, said a senior
legislator today.
</P>
<P>
In his report on implementing the Agriculture Law, Buhe,
vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC), said agriculture expenditures by the central and
local governments from 1994 to 1996 were up to requirements set by
the Agriculture Law.
</P>
<P>
In the report, delivered at the Fifth Session of the Eighth
NPC, Buhe hailed Agriculture Law which took effect in 1993 as an
important law guaranteeing agriculture as the base of the national
economy and safeguarding the legitimate interests of
agriculture-related organizations and farmers.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on law enforcement at the NPC session, Tian Jiyun,
vice-chairman of NPC Standing Committee, said the state is paying
great attention to the inspection and supervision of law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
According to Buhe, the NPC Standing Committee has attached
great importance to the implementation of the Agriculture Law and
conducted inspections on enforcement of the law since 1994. Such
inspections have helped solve some problems to a certain extent,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In the last couple of years, Buhe said, the state has
strengthened macro-controls on the purchase and marketing of major
farm products and helped solve grain marketing problems for
farmers in some areas.

<P>
In addition, farmers' financial burden has been lightened and
the strategy of invigorating agriculture with science and
education has been extensively implemented. The contribution to
increases in agricultural production by science and technology
went up to 39 percent last year, according to the vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, he said, China has reaped good
harvests for three consecutive years. Grain production hit record
highs and the collectively-owned economy in rural areas has kept
developing. Urban and rural residents have seen richer supplies of
vegetables and other foodstuffs. Farmers' living standard has
gradually improved.
</P>
<P>
"All these are inseparable from implementing the Agriculture
Law and mobilizing farmer's enthusiasm for agriculture
production," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the NPC vice-chairman also warned that there still
exist some problems in implementing the law such as inadequate
investment, heavy financial burdens for farmers and unsmooth grain
allocations and marketing.
</P>
<P>
Buhe put forward five proposals to further implement the
Agriculture Law:
</P>
<P>
-- Strengthen people's legal sense with regard to agriculture
and further improve enforcement of the Agriculture Law;
</P>
<P>
--Take strong measures to lighten farmers' financial burdens;
</P>
<P>
--Increase agriculture input in accordance with law and raise
the level of comprehensive agricultural production;
</P>
<P>
-- Deepen agriculture reform and promote the restructuring of rural
economy as well as a fundamental shift in agricultural growth
mode; and
</P>
<P>
-- Step up the enactment of supplementary laws and regulations to
guarantee the implementation of the Agriculture Law.

<HEADLINE> Thailand May Go to WTO over EU Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand may ask the World Trade
Organization (WTO) to rule on a European Union decision to rule on
 import tariffs on Thailand's food products, according to Pisanu
Rienmahasarn, minister (commercial) to the EU based in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has been unsuccessful in negotiations with the EU to
preserve low tariffs under the latter's Generalized System of
Preferences, a program aimed at helping developing countries
export their products.
</P>
<P>
The last attempt by Thailand to negotiate involved a special
working group set up to calculate various economic indicators.
Thailand contends that the EU based its decision to remove GSP
privileges on inaccurate data about Thailand's per capita income
and farm product exports.
</P>
<P>
The EU cut tariff benefits on Thai farm products by 50 percent
in January, and will fully withdraw the benefits on January 1,
1999. Frozen shrimp exports have been particularly hart hit.
</P>
<P>
Pisanu was quoted today by local press as saying that Thailand
could also claim discrimination, since the EU continues to extend
GSP privileges to certain South American countries in return for
their efforts to combat narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Thai commercial counselors based overseas agreed at a meeting
in Bangkok last month that GSP issues required constant attention,
and that appealing to the WTO should be considered.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Charges Foreign Meddling in Mideast Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Lieutenant
General Omar Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir claimed today that present
tensions in the Middle East are caused by foreign interferences.
</P>
<P>
Foreign powers did not want stability in the region unless it
suited their strategy of subjugating Sudan and other contries in
the region, in order that they might plunder the wealth and
resources of these countries, the president told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Bashir said his country viewed the establishment of peace,
security and cooperation particularly with its neighboring states,
as of great importance.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan, he said, pursued an independent policy and rejected
the hegemony of foreign powers and their conspiracies to undermine
its independence.
</P>
<P>
He said he welcomed any mediation initiative through a third
party. He stressed his keen interest in maintaining progressive
ties with neighboring countries, adherence to regional and
international peace and stability, and commitment to
non-interference in the internal affairs of other states and
abiding by international covenants as well as bilateral and
regional agreements.
</P>
<P>
Bashir said he intended to establish stability and security
throughout the Sudan, particularly in the petroleum-rich areas, by
implementing the peace charter signed by a number of rebel
factions, with the ultimate target of exporting petroleum by 1999.
</P>
<P>
He noted that consensus has been reached between the Sudan and
several foreign oil companies for the extraction of crude oil, its
refinement and transport.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, the Sudanese president highly praised the
existing ties and cooperation between his country and China. He
said the bilateral ties stemmed from true relationship, the
principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs,
and historic relations that bound the two countries in fighting
against foreign colonial conspiracies.

<HEADLINE> Legislator Deplores U.S. Veto on E. Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- An Indonesian legislator Sunday
strongly deplored a U.S. decision to veto a U.N. Security Council
draft resolution calling on Israel to stop its plan to build a
Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. stance is absolutely against the U.S.-supported peace
accord between Palestine and Israel," the official Antara News
Agency today quoted Theo Sambuaga, chairman of the
Inter-Parliamentary Cooperation Board, as saying at the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson cast the U.S. veto in the
15-member U.N. Security Council last Friday, thus blocking the
passage of the resolution proposed by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"We are shocked that the U.S. has taken such an indecisive
stance. Some time ago President Bill Clinton opposed Israel's plan
to build new housing in East Jerusalem, but now it vetoes the U.N.
resolution which calls on Israel to abandon its plan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decision would pose a threat to the peace process in
the Middle East because it favored Israel, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"This will arouse an increasingly stronger reaction from
Palestine and other Arab countries and threaten the peace process
as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that not only former Israeli Prime Minister Simon
Peres but also most Israeli people oppose Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's stance.
</P>
<P>
"We must urge (the world community) to get Israel's plan
canceled. Indonesia has taken the clear stance that the existing
Jewish settlement is illegal because it is built on Arab land and
it obviously contradicts peace efforts," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Exit From IMF Program as Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Finance Secretary
Roberto de Ocampo has expressed optimism that the country can
graduate away the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program this
June.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported today that he was optimistic despite
Senate President Ernesto Maceda's recent statement that Congress
may not be able to pass the last part of the Comprehensive Tax
Reform Program (CTRP) earlier than July.
</P>
<P>
Congress had already passed the first two parts of the CTRP,
the full deregulation of oil industry and the tax on "sin"
products like cigarette, beer and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the last part, the individual income tax, is now
the only structural reform that remains tied to the country's exit
from the IMF program.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo anchored his optimism on the promise given by House
Speaker Jose de Venecia to President Fidel Ramos to expedite the
deliberation on the tax reform measure.
</P>
<P>
The House Ways and Means Committee will reportedly sponsor this
week the individual income tax bill, but the Presidential Palace
is trying to dissuade House leaders from pushing through with its
plan to grant 184,000 pesos (7,022 U.S. dollars) per household
exemption on the ground that government will lose 37 billion pesos
(1.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Department of Finance is also willing to accommodate
adjustments in its original individual income tax blueprint as a
counter-proposal to the scheme drafted by the House on condition
that only minimum wage earners would be exempted from income
taxation.

<HEADLINE> Tens of People Wounded in Indonesia's Irian Jaya Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Tens of people were injured in a
fresh clash that broke out last Saturday in Kwamki Lama Kampong,
five kilometers north of the mining town of Timika in central
Irian Jaya, Indonesia, according to reports reaching here today
from Jayapura of Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
Regional military district commander Maj. Gen. Joni Lumintang
said the riot was triggered by a robbery or extortion attempt and
Amungme Tribe's unwillingness to make peace with other indigenous
tribes in the province.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's violence followed tribal clashes on Wednesday and
Thursday which killed three people and wounded five others,
allegedly over miscommunication between members of several tribes.
</P>
<P>
The riots on March 5-6 temporarily stopped when on Saturday the
Amungme Tribe wanted to take revenge following the death of tribal
members during the previous violence.
</P>
<P>
The tribal riots involved Amungme, Dani, Nduga and Moni tribes,
said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities and religious leaders have helped abate
Saturday's riots, Lumintang said.
</P>
<P>
"For the time being, it is not necessary to multiply the troops
because the existing troops have already been able to handle the
violence," he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue to Strengthen Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China made an important step
forward in establishing a legal system for its socialist market
economy, a high-ranking legislator said here today.
</P>
<P>
Tian Jiyun, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the
Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), the Chinese legislature,
said the committee will continue to accelerate the pace of
legislation in 1997, the last year of the five-year term for the
Eighth NPC, and will continue to give top priority to enactment of
economic laws.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark when delivering a work report of the
NPC Standing Committee to the ongoing NPC session.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, said the report, the NPC Standing Committee
passed 20 laws and law-related resolutions, and approved 12
treaties and agreements with foreign countries and international
conventions.
</P>
<P>
Laws enacted last year include Law on Business Partnership, Law
on Township Enterprises, the Auction Law, the Coal Law, Law on
Control of Noise Pollution, Law on Protection of the Elderly, Law
of the Bar, Law on Gun Control, Law on Civil Air Defense, and the
Hong Kong Garrison Law.
</P>
<P>
The enactment and implementation of these laws will play an
important role in promoting a sustained, rapid and healthy
development of the national economy, and cultural and ethical
progress, conserving resources and the environment, regularizing
administrative activities, and guaranteeing Hong Kong's smooth
transition, prosperity and stability, said Tian.
</P>
<P>
He added the committee also examined the drafts of a trust law,
a construction law, a law on energy saving, a highway law, a law
on blood donation, a law on the prevention of animal epidemics, a
law on administrative supervision, a law on exclusive economic
zones and continental shelves, and a defense law. The draft
defense law has already been submitted for deliberation by the NPC.
</P>
<P>
Tian pointed out, the committee has always put emphasis on
enactment of laws concerning a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Since its term started in 1993, the Eighth NPC and its Standing
Committee have promulgated 95 laws and law-related resolutions,
including 39 that concern a market economy, and "a legal framework
for a socialist market economy has initially taken shape."
</P>
<P>
Tian pointed out legislation is the premise for governing the
country with law and building a country with a sound socialist
legal system.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the goal of the Eighth NPC to initially form
a framework for a socialist market economy within its term, he
added, the committee will continue to attach much importance to
the enactment of economic laws, and the pace of enacting laws
concerning a market economy such as a law on state assets, a
securities law and a law on futures trading, will be speeded up.
</P>
<P>
The committee will also focus on the enactment of other laws
that are urgently needed, such as a law on legislation and a law
on supervision.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapers Reportedly More Brazen in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Some anti-crime organizations have
expressed fear that kidnapping in the Philippines is getting
worse, with 41 persons victimized from January to March 7.
</P>
<P>
Today's local press quoted the Citizens' Action Against Crime
and the Movement for the Restoration of Peace and Order as saying
kidnapers have been paid ransoms amounting to 30.6 million pesos
(1.16 million U.S. dollars) for 25 cases.
</P>
<P>
The two civic groups said kidnapping started out big with 12
cases in January, followed by 10 in February and three in the
first week of March.
</P>
<P>
Kidnappers showed "increasing brazenness and daring" in the
three successive kidnappings in Metro Manila last week, with two
cases victimizing very prominent families, said Teresita Ang See,
chair of the Citizens' Action Against Crime.
</P>
<P>
See said the scenario is scaring domestic investors out of the
country, especially as 22 persons died due to kidnappings last
year.
</P>
<P>
"We need not think of enticing foreign investors to come in.
Our own capitalists have no confidence at all of the safety and
security in their own homes and offices," she said.
</P>
<P>
Fortune magazine of the United States recently cited the
Philippines as "the Capital of Asia's Kidnapping," touching off a
heated debate in the country.

<HEADLINE> Innsbruck Says no to 2006 Winter Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Innsbruck decided on
Sunday their city should not bid to host the 2006 Winter Olympics
following a referendum in which 52.5 percent voted against.
</P>
<P>
The city in the western Tyrol region has already hosted the
extravaganza back in 1964 and 1976.
</P>
<P>
Before the outcome was known, regional politicians had said
they would drop the project if the city gave it the thumbs down.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the province-wide vote registered 69 percent in
favour outside Innsbruck itself. That led several politicians to
suggest holding the Games at the ski resort of Kitzbuhel.
</P>
<P>
The southern province of Carinthia is meanwhile looking to
co-host the Games with the northeastern Italian region of
Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Slovenia, all formerly part of the
Austro-Hungarian empire.
</P>
<P>
Salzburg also hopes to put its own case to co-host with
Berchtesgaden over the German border.
</P>
<P>
Austria's National Olympic Committee will decide on its
representative in October.

<HEADLINE> Kipketer Sets Record at World Athletics Indoor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Wilson Kipketer shattered the world
indoor 800 meter record for the second time in three days and
collected 100,000 U.S. dollars at the world indoor athletics
championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan-born Dane reduced his previous mark by more than a
second to one minute 42.67 seconds.
</P>
<P>
For his efforts Kipketer won 50,000 U.S. dollars for finishing
first and another 50,000 U.S. dollars for breaking the world
record at the first championships to feature prize money.
</P>
<P>
During two action-packed hours on the final day of the
three-day competition, the Russian women's team broke the
six-year-old 4x400 meters record.
</P>
<P>
And 25-year-old American Stacy Dragila won the first women's
pole vault title and equalled the world record in the process.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Kipketer became the first person at any world indoor
or outdoor championship to break a world record in a preliminary
round.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, supremely confident and enviably relaxed, he
swept to the front from the gun and moved steadily away from the
field.
</P>
<P>
He covered the first lap in 24.22 seconds and the 400 in 50.22.
</P>
<P>
Kipketer, who has lived in Denmark since 1990, was not allowed
to compete for his new country at last year's Atlanta Olympics. He
won the world outdoor title in Gothenburg, Sweden, two years ago
and has been ranked world number one for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The Russian women's 4x400 relay team of Tatyana Chebykina,
Svetlana Goncharfenko, Olga Kotlyarova and Tatayana Alekseyeva
clocked 3:26.84 to break the six-year-old mark set in Seville by a
German team anchored by Grit Breuer.
</P>
<P>
Breuer again anchored the German team, who finished third on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the women's pole vault, Dragila upset Australia's world
record holder Emma George who failed at both 4.40 meters and 4.45.
</P>
<P>
Dragila equalled George's world record of 4.40 and made three
creditable attempts to increase the mark to 4.45.
</P>
<P>
Forty-four-year old Russian Yekaterina Podkopayeva snatched
victory from American Mary Slaney, six years her junior, at the
line in the women's 1,500 meters final.
</P>
<P>
Podkopayeva was third behind Slaney over the same distance at
the inaugural Helsinki world outdoor championships in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie made no contest of the men's 3,000
meters final, leaving the likes of world steeplechase champion
Moses Kiptanui struggling in his wake.
</P>
<P>
Gebrselassie clocked 7:34.71, almost four seconds outside his
own world record.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Sunday Bada broke his own African record in the men's
400m final, overhauling Briton Jamie Baulch over the final 100
meters to win in 45.51.
</P>
<P>
Mozambiques's Maria Mutola, the 1993 and 1995 champion, won the
women's 800 meters, proving too powerful over the final lap for
her rivals.
</P>
<P>
Mutola, wearing a black ribbon in memory of her father who died
in a car crash last month, clocked 1:58.96.
</P>
<P>
The United States finished top of the medals table with six
gold medals. Cuba and Russia had three apiece.

This was the third round of talks between them this year. The
first was in Moscow on January 20, and the second, in Brussels on
February 23.

<HEADLINE> Hangzhou's Hi-Tech Zone Growing Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The hi-tech development zone of
Hangzhou, the capital city of Zhejiang Province, grew rapidly in
1996, turning out 5.2 billion yuan in business income and an
export volume of 41 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figures represent an increase of 69 percent and 25 percent,
respectively, over the previous year. In terms of production
scale, the zone now ranks 18th among the country's city-level
hi-tech zones.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hangzhou approved the establishment of 55
enterprises, raising the total to 469, and imported 71 items of
high technology.
</P>
<P>
Seeking a faster growth and greater profit turnover, the city
government expanded the zone's area by 10.5 square kilometers this
month.
</P>
<P>
A official with the zone said that the expansion will largely
ease the bottleneck in the development of the zone, which rejected
10 enterprises in 1996, thus losing 50 million US dollars in
foreign investment as a result of its limited area.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items In Leading Australian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Victorian State Premier Jeff Kennett blamed a two-day strike
by transport workers for a 26 percent slump in attendance at the
Australian Formula One Grand Prix, which he predicted would cost
taxpayers 5-10 million Australian dollars (3.9-7.8 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- The young unemployed would be given the option of doing
rudimentary military training at army camps to help improve their
motivational skills under a plan being considered by the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Victorian public transport workers had lost crucial support
and bargaining power by striking at the weekend and the government
would come down hard, high-profile public Transport Union leader
Lou Di Gregorio admitted yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- A rash of privatization projects and the resurgence of
resources industries pushed up the value of projects on which
Australia's banks and other financiers acted as advisers by 45
percent to nearly 41 billion Australian dollars (32 billion U.S.
dollars) last year, but the boom is not translating into easy
money for the project finance industry.

<HEADLINE> Frenchmen Arrested for Kidnaping, Raping Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A 35-year-old Frenchman who was
arrested today for trying to kidnap a 10-year-old girl also
admitted having kidnaped eight other children and sexually abused
some of them, before setting them free, reported the Agence
France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Jean-Paul Barbault, a salesman from the southwest department of
Gironde, last Friday tried to kidnap little Maelle in Villepinte,
central France, by pretending to offer her a ride on her way to
school.
</P>
<P>
Barbault immediately let her get off his car after he found
that he was followed by a school security guard, AFP quoted police
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Police also accused him of kidnaping eight children -- and
having raped some of them -- over the past one year and a half in
several cities across the country where he traveled frequently as
a salesman.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Barbault has drawn a lot of attention from the
public as French police have posted everywhere the picture of
little Marion, a schoolgirl who disappeared last November on her
way to school in Agen, southwest France.
</P>
<P>
But police said that they have found no evidence that Barbault
had kidnaped little Marion.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Secretary Defends Chemical Weapons Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said today that the Chemical Weapons Convention was "very
much" in the interest of the United States and his country should
ratify it.
</P>
<P>
Cohen made the remarks on NBC Television's "Meet the Press"
program, one day after Jesse Helms, Chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, vowed to block U.S. ratification of the
treaty unless it is substantially modified.
</P>
<P>
"This treaty is very much in our interest, Cohen said, "We will
be worse off as far as the American people are concerned about
trying to gain control over the proliferation of chemical weapons
throughout the world," if the Senate does not ratify the treaty,
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles made the same point
on ABC Television's "This Week" program.
</P>
<P>
The convention, which outlaws chemical weapons, has been
ratified by more than 60 nations and is due to take effect on
April 29.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak to Ask Clinton to Presure Israel on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak said on Sunday that he would ask President Bill Clinton to
use his influence to pressure Israel into reversing its decision
to build Jewish homes in Arab east Jerusalem,
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's remarks came after the Untied States vetoed a draft
on Friday calling Israel to abandon its plan to build 6,500 homes
in east Jerusalem. The draft sponsored by U.S. European allies was
backed by U.N. Security Council's other 14 members.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who arrived in Washington for three-day visit, told
CNN's "Late Edition" program that he is going to ask Clinton "to
use his influence to stop this," when he meets him at the White
House on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"He could persuade the Israelis that this could cause problems
in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to make complications for the negotiations in the
future and it will be a big problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said earlier last Monday when he met Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat that Israel's decision for the housing
project in east Jerusalem could only "build mistrust" between the
Israelis and Palestinians rather than build confidence.
</P>
<P>
But no sooner than his criticism came out, his representative
to the United Nations vetoed the draft, defying the effort of U.S.
European allies to pressure Israel to reverse its decision.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak criticized the U.S. veto, saying: "It will create a
feeling of injustice" in the Arab world and cause the United
States to lose credibility.
</P>
<P>
He also warned Israel that its move to build a Jewish neighbor
in Arab east Jerusalem could spark a flare-up of violence.
