<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ If it were anybody else, people would be
sticking a fork in him.
</P>
<P>
   For anybody else, there are too many strokes to make up and too
many people to leapfrog.
</P>
<P>
   But because it's Tiger Woods, and because the two players
leading the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am don't exactly have a
proven track record of fending off a superstar, nobody is jumping
the gun to announce the end of Woods' winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Those in front of him are practically breaking their necks
looking over their shoulders. And those closest to Woods say there
isn't a single reason why he can't extend his streak to six
consecutive victories today _ if his balky putter straightens up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't putted very well all week,'' Butch Harmon, Woods'
coach, said Sunday evening after an extended putting session on the
practice green. ``We worked on that a lot, and if he putts well in
the final round he probably will win the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being five behind the leader is a lot for some people. But not
for Tiger. He could have easily shot 63 (Sunday). That's how well
he's hitting the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's Harmon's job to be optimistic and to instill the
same sort of confidence in his star pupil.
</P>
<P>
   But you get the feeling that Woods is not going to let the
streak die without a huge fight.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he shaved three shots off the deficit he was facing at
the beginning of the day. Woods shot a decent round, 4-under-par 68
in the third round at Pebble Beach Golf Links, leaving him at
7-under 209.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd feel a lot better,'' said Matt Gogel, ``if he was about
2-under.''
</P>
<P>
   And Woods' chances of rallying might be slimmer if it were
somebody other than Gogel and Mark Brooks sharing the lead at
12-under 204. Gogel is a rookie who just graduated from the Nike
Tour (now the Buy.com Tour), and Brooks might as well be coming out
of retirement, for all we've heard from him since he won the '96
PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   These just aren't the sort of guys whom people envisioned ending
Woods' streak.
</P>
<P>
   Especially not Gogel, who had a 67 at Pebble Beach on Sunday.
Unheralded outside family circles until two weeks ago, Gogel
finished in a tie for seventh at the Bob Hope Classic and now is in
the driver's seat to gain his first PGA Tour victory.
</P>
<P>
   But he already has experience at final-day sloppiness. He was
one stroke off the lead going into the final round of the Hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got passed by,'' he said. ``It was like being at the Indy
500 watching cars go by.''
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't sound like the voice of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   As for Brooks, who shot 6-under 66 at Poppy Hills, he hasn't had
a top-three finish in four years.
</P>
<P>
   A shot behind the leaders is Vijay Singh, whose round of par-72
Sunday at Pebble Beach did nothing to strike fear into Woods or
anybody else. Notah Begay is at 10-under 206 after a 72, and nobody
else is closer than four shots.
</P>
<P>
   So can Woods catch all seven players ahead of him?
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on the weather,'' Begay said. ``But if it's a
day like we had today, with not much wind, if he's within seven or
eight shots, Matt might be hearing footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, actually, is hoping for a nasty day, and he'll probably
get his wish. Rain was moving into the Monterey Peninsula area
Sunday night, and more rain and wind were forecast for today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's ugly out there, then I'm in great shape,'' Woods said.
``But if it's calm, then it's going to be a tough task to make that
many birdies to catch them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if it's ugly and it's blowing hard, maybe even raining,
just make a few birdies here and there and it might be enough.''
</P>
<P>
   And a friendlier putter wouldn't hurt, either. The greens at
Pebble Beach have been softened by the rain and scraped up by 180
players walking around the same pin placements for three days.
</P>
<P>
   The bumpy greens are the same for everybody, however. Woods was
more concerned about fixing his putting stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of times I hit it high on the face or sometimes I hit
it thin,'' Woods said. ``That's not a good sign. That means you are
not hitting the putt solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Harmon said Woods' goal Sunday was to reach 10 under par, which
would have meant shooting a 65. Woods said he will pick a target
number before he starts today's round. What that number will be
depends on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, of the seven players ahead of Woods, only Singh
would seem to be a major threat to handle today's pressure,
particularly if Woods, who will tee off 30 minutes before the
leaders, posts a couple of early birdies to tighten things before
the others begin their rounds.
</P>
<P>
   And so, we wait to find out who will be the Fred Haas of 2000 or
if he even emerges today. Haas was the amateur who ended Byron
Nelson's streak of 11 consecutive wins in 1945, beating Nelson by
five shots in Memphis.

 REVIEW  of ``GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING'' 
 By Tracy Chevalier (Dutton, $21.95) 
 
 
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The girl looks back over her shoulder with wide eyes and parted
lips, as if someone has come up from behind and taken her by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Her earring, a giant pearl, catches the light, and a blue turban
hides the unruly hair that she never lets anyone see. Her pose
seems natural, but we know she was coaxed into it by the artist who
painted her _ he even instructed her to lick her lips and not to
close them. As she gazes back at him, we also know her secret: She
loves the man, but she can never speak of it to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   She is 17. Her name is Griet, and she is a maid in the house of
Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer, who is known today as the ``master
of light'' but who in 1665 was merely a respected artist struggling
to support a wife and six children (11, by the time he died a
decade later) in 17th century Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeer and his family are real, but Griet is the invention of
Tracy Chevalier in her novel, ``Girl With a Pearl Earring,'' which
was inspired by Vermeer's painting of the same name. Griet is only
16 when she is sent to work in Vermeer's house, a move made
necessary after her father, a Delft tilemaker, is blinded in a kiln
explosion and unable to work.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an easy time for Griet, who has never been away from
her parents. She is Protestant and the Vermeers are Catholic, and
their home is full of religious paintings (Vermeer is a collector
as well as an artist) that are foreign and frightening to her. Her
days are long and hard, and she must fend for herself in the
constant power struggle that simmers among the women of the house:
Vermeer's suspicious and mercurial wife, Catharina; his
mother-in-law, the sly and powerful Maria Thins; Maria's personal
maid, Tanneke; and Cornelia, Vermeer's malicious 7-year-old
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Griet holds her own well enough. She has an instinct for
flattery that disarms Tanneke at first, and she manages to
establish a minor alliance with Maria Thins. But her biggest weapon
is the master himself. From the moment he meets her, Vermeer
recognizes Griet's eye for color and detail. It is not long before
he secretly enlists her as his assistant, teaching her how to mix
paints and plan what will appear on a canvas. And Griet begins to
see him not just as employer but as an artist, and then as a man.
</P>
<P>
   Griet narrates her story with a certain plodding charm, the
voice of a working-class girl who knows her place in life but
cannot resist the allure of what is beyond her. She is
hard-working, cautious, uncomplaining and clever, a Jane Eyre in
the land of canals.
</P>
<P>
   That her story moves so quickly (I read it in two days) is a
reflection of how shallow it actually is _ we never really have a
sense of why any of the characters are the way they are. But that
is not a drawback. Griet does not have time to analyze the people
whose lives touch hers. She must support herself, contribute to her
parents' well-being and navigate the dicey emotional tides in the
house of Johannes Vermeer.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she does not settle happily into her master's arms
like Jane Eyre, but perhaps does something better: She makes a life
for herself and sees it for what it is, growing into a pragmatic
woman who tells her story exactly as it should be told.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeer left only 35 paintings behind at the end of his life.
Several _ including ``Young Woman With a Water Pitcher'' and
``Woman With a Pearl Necklace'' _ make appearances in Chevalier's
book, as if she cannot resist making up stories to explain these
dazzling and enigmatic works of art. Any one of them would have
made a good premise for a novel, but Chevalier has chosen well. We
don't know who really posed for ``Girl With a Pearl Earring,'' but
her Griet is a character worthy of the honor. &QL;

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LEGAL mayhem made the NFL what it is today, our premier spectator
sport, the 800-pound gorilla in the network boardrooms. For three
quarters of a century, from Johnny Blood to Chuck Bednarik to Dick
Butkus to Jack Tatum to any one of a number of contemporary
helmeted hooligans, violence has always been the engine driving the
game's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Even the WWF's faux body-slammers and hatemongers want to get
into the act, offering up a new football league _ the XFL _ that
will exhibit a real ``attitude.'' Oh, goody, another giant step for
mankind.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, hardly a play passes on any given Sunday without
some sort of heinous, and felonious, assault upon another man's
person. We not only demand brutal behavior; we pay big, big money
for it. Yet, illogically, we also ask the participants to be
perfectly normal when they leave the office to return to home and
hearth.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, we accord them the status of role models, somebody for
little Billy to admire and, gulp, emulate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the non-genteel requirements of their jobs, what's
most surprising about the arrests of Rae Carruth and Ray Lewis is
that they were practically unprecedented. Statistics show that NFL
players are led off in handcuffs at a far lesser rate than American
males at large.
</P>
<P>
   First Carruth was charged with murder in the death last fall of
his pregnant girlfriend. Now Lewis, Baltimore's superstar-caliber
linebacker, joins him in jail after two men who had crossed Lewis'
path in Atlanta _ the night of the Super Bowl, no less _ wound up
stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rams linebacker Leonard Little played in the Super
Bowl only a season after he did time for manslaughter, having
killed a St. Louis woman while driving drunk. Ex-Ram Darryl Henley
did miss the game, however. He's in prison for drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
   All these gents hold, or held, a special place in our society,
with its badly skewed, ``hero''-worshipping value system. By virtue
of their high-profile occupations, we pay undue attention to what
they do and what they think. People in my business frantically
scribble down or electronically record their every utterance,
giving them platforms way out of kilter with what they contribute
to the greater good. Lewis, as the leader of the Ravens' defense,
is routinely allowed to hold court on all manner of subjects, one
of which produced the following observation: ``The devil's busy,
always after God's children. He's always trying to get you one way
or another.''
</P>
<P>
   The devil, it seems, has been particularly troublesome for Mr.
Lewis during his football career. Before the ill-fated soiree with
his shady entourage in Atlanta's swinging Buckhead district, he was
already scheduled to stand trial for attacking a woman in a
Baltimore bar in early December. He was twice accused of assault
while in college, and he has had his share of paternity problems as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens signed Lewis to a $26 million contract in late 1998
that made him the league's highest-paid linebacker. They showed him
the money even though they knew he was hanging with an unsavory
crowd, yet they have done next to nothing to protect him from his
own bad instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials say they intended to speak to Ray after the Pro
Bowl. You wonder if they waited so as to not distract him from his
football duties, perhaps fearing that asking him to settle down off
the field might also stymie his valuable antisocial tendencies on
it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the children of Baltimore _ their parents, too _
begged for his autograph and wore his name and number on their own
jerseys. If Lewis beats the double-murder rap, they no doubt will
again, applauding his strength and courage for overcoming, ahem,
adversity.
</P>
<P>
   That's not going to change. We can't help ourselves. The
physically gifted in all cultures have always been accorded status
that's grossly out of sync with their tangible contributions to
humankind.
</P>
<P>
   While it's pointless to begrudge jocks in general their exalted
status and oft-obscene riches, it would be a more perfect world if
athletic prowess didn't unilaterally provide a license to behave
badly and profit accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   The bright, upstanding ones should be afforded the full
privileges of celebrity, including, of course, the capacity to
influence behavior in others. In turn, wouldn't it be nice if the
cretins _ Dennis Rodman and John Rocker's names come quickly to
mind here _ would simply disappear from our collective
consciousness, out of sight, out of mind, the moment they return to
the locker room?

GM MELVIN DEFTLY STEERS RANGERS CLEAR OF INSANITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The richer Juan Gonzalez gets, the smarter Doug Melvin looks.
</P>
<P>
   I telephoned Doug Melvin personally Sunday to tell him so. In
light of recent baseball insanities, Melvin, general manager of the
retooling Texas Rangers, is now a confirmed genius.
</P>
<P>
   My recommendation of Melvin for American League Nostradamus of
the Year comes in the wake of both Gonzalez's new contract offer
and the latest bad blood being dripped in the Ken Griffey Jr.
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin deftly avoided both. But there, but for the grace of a
little fiscal planning, go the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Back in November, when two-time MVP Gonzalez was dealt to the
Detroit Tigers, local wise rumps _ well, me, for one _ criticized
Melvin for not getting enough. The proverbial ``cow for a bag of
beans'' argument.
</P>
<P>
   The other question was, why then? Why November? Shouldn't Melvin
have waited and shopped Gonzalez to a more eager bidder?
</P>
<P>
   Melvin's answer remains the same. ``My fear,'' he said, ``was
not so much what the player was asking. It was the stance of the
agent, if word were to get out that we were close to trading him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The player could have said, `If you trade me, it doesn't
matter because I'm not going to sign with the new team, anyway.'''
</P>
<P>
   Try closing that deal, in other words, for Justin Thompson, Gabe
Kapler and Francisco Cordero. It can't be done, as the Seattle
Mariners are systematically finding out.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey sat down with ``The Seattle Times''' Steve Kelley last
week at the Pebble Beach pro-am and revealed that since the trade
stories began, he has received a death threat from an allegedly
fed-up and demented Mariners fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like that is pretty much the last straw,'' Griffey
told Kelley. ``How can I possibly go back there and play now?''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners open spring training Feb. 17. It doesn't sound like
Junior plans to be there.
</P>
<P>
   As each day passes, the Mariners' trade leverage dwindles. There
are baseball people who chuckle that Seattle general manager Pat
Gillick was playing liar's poker from the beginning. Griffey gave
them a list of seven teams that he agreed to be traded to, and he
soon skinned the list down to one.
</P>
<P>
   That's not exactly leverage. Then, on Dec. 13, according to
Junior, Gillick called him at his Florida home at 11:40 p.m. and
asked Griffey if he would OK a pending trade with the New York
Mets. ``You've got 15 minutes,'' Griffey said Gillick told him.
</P>
<P>
   Junior, stunned at the deadline, said no. And here they sit,
with Cincinnati general manager Jim Bowden erasing names from the
potential trade pool weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The latest rumored offer has the Reds sending spare outfielder
Dmitri Young and pitchers Denny Neagle, Dennis Reyes and Scott
Williamson, and the Mariners dispatching Griffey and _ get this _
cash. They want Seattle to help pay Griffey's 2000 salary.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin himself remembers hanging up the phone in November, after
talking to Detroit's Randy Smith, and telling his people, ``I want
to do this deal today. Let's get Tom Hicks on the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the clairvoyance, of course, is Melvin's
assessment of the kind of money that Gonzalez would be after. Faced
with the opening of a new stadium and seats to fill, Smith has
offered Juan a package worth $148 million over eight seasons. He
wants Gonzalez, in effect, to become the symbol of the new Detroit
Tigers _ big shoes for a man who prefers to walk softly.
</P>
<P>
   If memory serves, there was outrage when the Twins made Kirby
Puckett the game's first $3-million-a-year player. The same people
gasped when Roger Clemens became the first to make $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But ever since the White Sox ignored the $9- and $10-million
plateaus and made Albert Belle baseball's first $11 millionaire,
there have been quantum leaps in salaries. Gonzalez is just the
most recent example.
</P>
<P>
   Juan hasn't signed the Tigers' deal, by the way. On the day last
week that he was supposed to be in Detroit, signing the $140
million contract, Gonzalez was photographed jogging on a Dominican
Republic beach.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. Heaven can wait?
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of GMs seem to realize that a team can't
consistently field a winner if too much payroll is tied up in one
player. Consider last season _ of the 14 players whose annual
salary exceeded $8.5 million, nine of them didn't make the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   As each day passes, Griffey drifts further away from Seattle,
and Melvin's November big score seems a bit wiser.
</P>
<P>
   The bag of beans never looked better. nn

NEW WORLD ORDER TAKES CENTER STAGE AT ALL-STAR GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ A simple, albeit poignant, clip capped pregame
festivities at Sunday's 50th NHL All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   NHL legends Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux and Gordie Howe were
seen walking along a snowy trail, talking hockey and reminiscing,
before arriving at a frozen pond. All of them toy with playing
until Anaheim's Paul Kariya, Philadelphia's Eric Lindros, Florida's
Pavel Bure and Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr skate over.
</P>
<P>
   Nah, Gretzky says, the game is now theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The first Gretzky-less All-Star Game in 18 years _ won 9-4 by
the World Team _ showed that the torch has indeed been passed to
guys like Bure. He turned in an MVP performance with his hat trick,
including two goals that his younger brother, Valeri, set up. Pavel
Bure also assisted on another goal.
</P>
<P>
   He said being involved in filming that clip with Gretzky a
couple days earlier had effected him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was part of the hockey history when you see
those legends like Wayne, Mario and Gordie,'' Bure said. ``Just
shooting this _ I don't think it was just a commercial. It was
something bigger. It was something, something that specific, a
little movie would probably make history. It is like changing
generations, and it meant a lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bure wasn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of guys on ice Sunday realized that the face of the game
is changing. A league once ruled by Gretzky and Lemieux suddenly
has Jagr and Bure along with names like Gomez and Turek and Kariya
dominating games. NHL hockey is definitely younger and more global.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a changing of the guard,'' Stars captain Mike
Modano said. ``You don't know how much more Ray Bourque is going to
play or (Mark) Messier or Steve Yzerman or guys like that who were
part of the Gretzky-Lemieux era. Those guys are going to be the
front-and-center guys now.''
</P>
<P>
   This new generation certainly commanded attention Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' Pavol Demitra scored twice. Modano assisted on goals
by Phoenix's Jeremy Roenick and Chicago's Tony Amonte. Jagr had a
goal and an assist. Of course, Bure had an assist along with his
hat trick. He said some of those moves were picked up while playing
with his brother on a pond near their home in Russia not too unlike
the one in the Gretzky spot.
</P>
<P>
   For the first All-Star Game without him, Gretzky was everywhere.
The NHL retired his number around the league before the game. He
drew the largest ovation of the day as he walked out for the
presentation. But mostly, the game he helped build was moving on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard that they were going to do it, I was almost
shivering,'' St. Louis Blues coach Joel Quenneville said. ``Then
when I saw it, I saw it prior to going out on the ice and `Wow.' It
was `Wow.' And when I saw it again on the big screen, I almost got
a tear going down my cheek. It was a special moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The clip didn't end with Gretzky's symbolic declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Kariya, Lindros and Bure began skating away, Jagr called
them back to face Gretzky and Lemieux and Howe. They slowly began
tapping their sticks on the ice, the way hockey players honor other
hockey players.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Stars watching down on the ice starting tapping their
sticks, too.
</P>
<P>
   That, Bure says, was their way of saying thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody did more things for hockey than Wayne,''
Bure said. ``He brought the hockey in the south of United States,
to Calgary, to everywhere, and he is still great. And so I think it
is going to be really hard to compare our generation to guys like
Wayne Gretzky.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry, they promise to try.

AT TULSA, SUCCESS REMAINS A CONSTANT
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Growing up in Bakersfield, Calif., Brandon Kurtz had always
dreamed of playing basketball at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing up a high-scoring senior year at Newman Smith High
School in Carrollton, Greg Harrington was leaning toward SMU.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of high school in Eufaula, Okla., Eric Coley was
getting a lot of advice about positioning himself in a high-profile
program at a major state university.
</P>
<P>
   All three are now starters at Tulsa, which _ as usual _ is
progressing toward a berth in the NCAA Tournament. Following a
sweep of TCU and SMU last week, the Golden Hurricane (22-2, 7-1) is
leading the Western Athletic Conference and figures to improve on
its No. 17 national ranking.
</P>
<P>
   And as usual, there is speculation about the coach. The names
and faces change every few years, but the basic profile remains
strikingly similar: a young, energetic talent, who is obviously
ready for a leap to college basketball's ``national'' level.
</P>
<P>
   The chronicles of the past are laced with the names of Nolan
Richardson, Tubby Smith, and Steve Robinson, all of whom moved on
to higher profile positions.
</P>
<P>
   The current resident, Bill Self, 37, regards the process with an
air of detached amusement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I know there's always some kind of speculation,'' he
said, laughing. ``But it's usually done by people who aren't really
involved in the process. Anyway, I am definitely not going to let
it become a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that in the past this has been a steppingstone type
job ... but that was before we built the new arena. It was also
before they made a hire where both the coach and his wife were born
and raised in Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   True, the $28 million Donald W. Reynolds Center _ including a
state-of-the-art, 8,355-seat basketball arena _ represents a
dramatic departure from the school's frugal past. Sitting alongside
it, ancient Skelly Stadium, the football stadium, assumes a
skeletal aura.
</P>
<P>
   And Self, who grew up in Edmond, Okla., and played at Oklahoma
State, is definitely a native son. After a year as an assistant
under Larry Brown at Kansas, he spent seven seasons _ three under
Eddie Sutton _ at Oklahoma State before a four-year tenure as head
coach at Oral Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   When Robinson left for Florida State after the 1996-97 season,
Self _ who won 31 of his last 38 games at Oral Roberts _ moved
across town.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing a remarkable tradition, he has won 64 games in less
than three seasons in the time-honored Tulsa fashion _ with players
that others missed, such as Kurtz, Coley and Harrington. Beginning
with Richardson's first team (1980-81), which played in the
National Invitation Tournament, Tulsa has reached the postseason 14
times in 19 years, including 10 trips to the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It has been accomplished over two decades at a small (4,300
enrollment) private school with a limited budget despite numerous
changes in administration, and with coaches continually leaving for
more prestigious, better-paying jobs _ Richardson to Arkansas,
Smith to Kentucky, Robinson to Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   The secret, Self says, is ``players.'' And obviously,
aggressive, hungry young coaches with the sense and ability to
recruit them.
</P>
<P>
   At Tulsa, the pattern was established with Richardson and has
been broken only once _ with the hiring of J.D. Barnett, an
established head coach who came in when Richardson went to Arkansas
after the 1984-85 season. It turned out to be the least successful
tenure of the past 20 years, although Barnett averaged nearly 18
victories per season.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the school has hired rising assistants or fledgling
head coaches who yearned to stack up victories as a way of
introducing themselves to Division I society. In the process, an
odd juggernaut _ without the usual trappings of stability at the
top _ was established.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched it all, because I was in highschool when it
started,'' Self said. ``When Nolan came in, Oklahoma was not yet a
basketball-crazed state. It was a football-crazed state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school tried to hire either Nolan or Billy Tubbs, who took
the Oklahoma job. They both took over programs that had had
sporadic success, and they began winning almost immediately. The
whole state went crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   While Tubbs built a powerhouse at OU, Richardson did the same at
Tulsa, which became a certain kind of destination for young coaches
on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get inside it, there's a lot there,'' Self said.
``Tulsa has always been a good job because there's a strong
recruiting base. There's a lot of talent in this state, and if you
work at it, you'll get your share.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great community, a city with a college-town atmosphere,
but with a technology base that presents at lot of opportunities.
You can get a terrific education _ and that's always been a major
selling point.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's also true that each school recruits a certain type of
player that fits its atmosphere. We've had highly recruited players
here, like Shea Seals (who wanted to stay in his hometown), but
more often, the program has been built with under-recruited
prospects who have developed into strong college players.''
</P>
<P>
   A typical example is last year's wheelhorse, Michael Ruffin, a
cerebral type who stayed four years, thoroughly enjoyed the
curriculum, married his sweetheart, nurtured an eclectic menagerie
of pets, including the only coatimundi in the WAC, and collected
enough rebounds and blocked shots to sign a contract with the
Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last place I ever expected to wind up,'' said Kurtz,
who was overlooked by UCLA and wound up at a small private school
2,000 miles away because Self knew his junior-college coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he called me, I said, `I don't need a big man,''' Self
recalled, ``and he said, `You need this one.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now an all-star candidate, the 6-foot-10 Kurtz says, ``I love it
here. There was a cultural difference at first, but I found
something. I'm very glad this happened, because it was the best
thing for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington wound up at Tulsa because SMU ran out of
scholarships. So he consoled himself by becoming the WAC Freshman
of the Year in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactlythe place I need to be,'' he said. ``It's
perfect _ it's not a big city and it's not a small town. Everything
you want is here, but you're not overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Coley came because he wanted to stay close to home _ and be part
of a tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was close, it was familiar, it was what I wanted,'' he
said. ``It was a blow when we missed the NCAA's a couple of years
ago, because it broke a streak. But we got back in it last year
(making the school's fifth NCAA Tournament appearance in six
years). Around here, that means a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Self's team will make it six of seven this year, after which he
mightbe gone. He has a multi-year contract, but so did the others
... and there are suitors out there offering bigger salaries,
national exposure, and membership in a conference with a lucrative
television contract, something the WAC lacks. If Georgia Tech
calls, does Self answer?
</P>
<P>
   If so, it could actually be a painful decision. As far back as
the memory stretches, the ``homecourt'' of the Golden Hurricane has
been the Tulsa Convention Center. Now there is an on-campus arena
that is packed for almost every game.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the previous residents would have been thrilled by the
facility. Probably only Self _ born in Okmulgee, raised in Edmond _
could describe it thusly:
</P>
<P>
   ``All those years, we never had a home ... now, we do.'' nn

MODANO ENJOYS TIME ON IRONIC LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Stars captain Mike Modano said he's coming back from
the All-Star break feeling rejuvenated for the stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, Phoenix's Jeremy Roenick deserves a little
credit for that turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Playing on a line with Roenick and Chicago's Tony Amonte
reminded Modano just how much fun the game can be. Modano had two
assists, giving him six points in the past two All-Star Games. The
three had played together in the World Junior Championships in 1988
and again in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what? It was funny. I was standing with Teemu Selanne
in the third period, that was the line that we had back in the
World Junior Championship,'' Roenick said. ``Myself, Modano and
Tony playing guys like Fedorov, Bure and Mogilny, Teemu. He
remembered that, and we had a chuckle about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say that the group has had a few ``issues'' since.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick earned a five-game suspension earlier this season for
purposely slashing Amonte, a particularly strange incident in that
Amonte and Roenick were good friends in Chicago. Roenick, of
course, took a jaw-breaking hit from Stars captain Derian Hatcher
last season, an incident that many believed was retaliation for an
earlier hit on Modano.
</P>
<P>
   Hard feelings, though, have seemed to evaporated. At least
between Modano and Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always gotten along,'' Modano said. ``You get him into
these situations and you get him alone, he's fun to be around and
fun to play with.'' HIT MAN
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Roenick, he was the only player on either team to
have any hits with three. One of them was on Toronto defenseman
Dimitri Yushkevich, drawing boos from the partisan crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Typically in All-Star Games, there isn't any hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refs told me to leave everybody alone,'' a disappointed
Roenick said. ``Only three? I thought I had four or five hits.''
SO-SO FOR TUREK
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Blues goalie Roman Turek had a pretty good All-Star
experience.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed only two goals in the period he played. The second,
however, was a little more annoying than the first considering it
was his turnover that started it. And even worse, it was his former
Stars teammate, Modano, who picked off the pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe, he knows me well,'' Turek said, laughing. GRETZKY
RETURNS
</P>
<P>
   Maple Leaf Gardens had a pretty big visitor Saturday: Wayne
Gretzky. He skated around and played hockey for a while, his first
skate since he retired last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``First time I have skated, played hockey, since April 18, and
it probably showed that,'' Gretzky said. ``I actually had a lot of
fun, and Maple Leaf Gardens, as everyone knows, is always one of
the great places to play in. I had a really good time playing.'' nn

SCELZI IS TOP DOG IN TOP FUEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA - Gary Scelzi has enough experience to know that one race
does not make a championship.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop him from celebrating Sunday after defeating
reigning Top Fuel champion Tony Schumacher to win the 40th
Winternationals at the Fairplex.
</P>
<P>
   Scelzi, who won this event in 1997, was joined in the winner's
circle with Jerry Toliver in Funny Car, Jeg Coughlin in Pro Stock
and Bob Panella in Pro Stock Truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``To beat Tony Schumacher was extra special,'' said Scelzi after
beating his new rival in the final. ''He's the (Top Fuel) champion.
We're No. 2, but right now we're No. 1 in (championship points).
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't forget the rest of the season. This is one race, but
it's a great way to start.''
</P>
<P>
   And Scelzi achieved the right beginning with consistency. The
former two-time series champion had both the quickest and most
consistent car Sunday, making four passes in the 4.60-second range,
including a 4.605 at 317.12 in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to the final and don't win it,'' said Scelzi, who
beat Tim Gibson, Cory McClenathan and Larry Dixon en route to the
final, ``it's like somebody putting a big chocolate cake in front
of you with a mountain of ice cream. You finally get to it, then
somebody takes it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Not on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Scelzi made sure by blistering the Pomona asphalt with a stout
4.613 at 317.79 mph, more than enough to beat Schumacher's losing
4.712 at 309.56.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Former Funny Car champion) Frank Hawley once told me that
every athlete that does well, practices,'' Scelzi said. ''You have
to. My guys went into training during (preseason testing). (Crew
chief Alan Johnson) was playing with different combinations and he
found out what worked. It carried right over to Pomona. My guys are
tired right now, but there's nothing like winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final, I was probably a little more nervous. It was Tony
Schumacher. He's the champ, and I want to knock him off. I didn't
want to blow it because I knew we had a race car. And I knew they
would have to step up to beat us, and they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Consistency proved to be the difference for Toliver as well. The
former drag boat racer, in just his second full season, made three
consecutive passes of 4.95 or quicker before beating Tony Pedregon
on a hole shot in the Funny Car final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just in a zone,'' said Toliver, who has now won
back-to-back national events at Fairplex. ``Everything was great.
My lights were great, I was leaving hard and the car was was
working well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did we run all day? (4.94s), .95s, .93s ... that's tight.
That just shows you the ability of (crew chief) Dale Armstrong.
He's phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   So was Toliver, who used a .09-second advantage off the starting
line to defeat Pedregon, who ran a quicker 4.929 but couldn't get
around Toliver before the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin, victorious in the previous two national events at the
Pomona facility, made it three in a row after running a smooth 6.89
at 199 mph, beating two-time defending class champion Warren
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Crew chief Dick Maskin) has a good handle on tuning here at
Pomona and I just like running here,'' Coughlin said. ``I wish we
could be here for the next 23 (national events).
</P>
<P>
   ``The highlight of today was that we were the quickest car every
round. To have last year's champion and runner-up in the final,
that's what it's all about. And fortunately, No. 2 beat No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Panella won in Pro Stock Truck, beating former sportsman
teammate Greg Stanfield following a 7.454 pass at 178.52 mph.
Stanfield, who held a slight starting-line advantage, ran a slower
7.568.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw him until the finish,'' said Panella, the 1999
class champion. ``Then I looked over and saw my win light come
on... what a feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will celebrate this, and just hope we can keep it going for
14 more races.''

LAKERS COULD SEE JAZZ IN PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (set ital) Today's run-and-gun edition of The Sporting Muse:
(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   - The Lakers' rout of Utah last week sure looked great, but
wasn't it just a few weeks ago that Utah routed the Lakers in Salt
Lake? The Jazz are showing their age, and no longer can win at a
.700 rate. But pity the fool who thinks they couldn't beat the
Lakers in a playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   And as the playoff race is shaping up, the Lakers could wind up
meeting the Jazz in the first round. That could happen whether they
finish first in the Pacific Division or not, too. Through Saturday,
a mere four wins separate the five teams elbowing for position in
the Western Conference behind the Lakers, Spurs and Trail Blazers.
...
</P>
<P>
   - The Zen-ification of the Lakers may continue if Phil Jackson
gets his way. He hasn't hidden his attitude about the selfish Glenn
Rice, who may be traded, or his desire for the Bulls' Toni Kukoc, a
big man who can shoot. Kukoc's downside is his age, 31, and the
fact he's considered an old 31 because of bad habits (smoking) and
so many years playing physical international basketball. ...
</P>
<P>
   - The Lakers' chances of winning the Pacific and the No. 1 seed
in the playoffs may hinge on how well they play on the road. After
the all-star break, they play 20 of 34 on the road. ...
</P>
<P>
   - I think I've discovered the secret to keeping college
basketball juniors and sophomores in school: Give the Clippers the
rights to all underclassmen. ...
</P>
<P>
   -It's good to be Orange: Jim Boeheim's Syracuse team is still
unbeaten, and former Boeheim assistant Wayne Morgan is 16-3.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the 49ers dominated the crowd in Saturday's win at
Fullerton, raising the question of where they go on game nights at
the Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   For those confident of the 49ers' earning a NCAA berth, the west
regionals will be held in Tucson and Salt Lake City. And while on
that subject, will the meddlesome NCAA please explain the
geographic dysfunction of this year's tourney sites? The NCAA South
regional finals are in Texas (Austin). The NCAA West regional
finals are in (set ital) Detroit (end). ...
</P>
<P>
   - The 1999-2000 season is shaping up as the most wide-open of
recent memory. Many of the perennial powers have modest-looking
teams this season, and conferences like the ACC, Big East and Big
Ten aren't as deep as usual.
</P>
<P>
   There's only two ACC teams in the Top 25, in fact, Duke and
Maryland. The SEC seems to have the most good teams, and it
wouldn't be a shock if both Pac-10 powers, Stanford and Arizona,
made it to the Final Four. ...
</P>
<P>
   - The way things are shaping up in town, the Clippers and UCLA
could get into a bidding war for coach Larry Brown, who seems
poised to leave the 76ers and never burns his bridges. This assumes
North Carolina, on the NCAA bubble, doesn't beat them to him. ...
</P>
<P>
   - The Kings chances of moving beyond their recent slump and
earning a playoff spot is good. Once they get past a six-game road
trip this month that includes stops in Detroit and the Buffalo
Haseks, they will be a staple of Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   They play 12 of 16 games in March and April there, and only two
are against teams in the upper strata of the league. The downside
is that they still are longshots to win enough games to earn home
ice for first round, meaning a first-round match against a St.
Louis, Detroit or Dallas. ...
</P>
<P>
   - My new favorite commercial is Bud Light's ..
</P>
<P>
   - I can't think of any athlete who has turned around his image
as dramatically as Andre Agassi. Once feckless and inconsistent,
he's become thoughtful and dedicated, never moreso than playing in
the Davis Cup a week after winning the Australian Open, and doing
so Sunday despite a severe illness.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of illness, that was some Dick Vermeil-like moment U.S.
coach John McEnroe had after the Davis Cup win over Zimbabwe. Tears
from John McEnroe? He's obviously getting in touch with an inner
child we've never met before. ...
</P>
<P>
   - Will someone please explain why our local baseball teams are
being operated by former executives of the Montreal Expos, a team
with one playoff season on its resume, and that in the 1981 strike
season?
</P>
<P>
   Here's Kevin Malone signing Geronimo Berroa. Here's Bill
Stoneman signing, uhh, nobody. Here's Southern California baseball
fans burning their season tickets. ...
</P>
<P>
   - Former Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda reportedly in on a list
of managerial candidates for the U.S. Olympic baseball team, which
will be made up of young minor league stars not on major league
40-man rosters. ...
</P>
<P>
   - Not only is Heisman Trophy winner Ron Dayne not the first
running back listed in NFL mock drafts, but he's not even the first
player from Wisconsin. Tackle Chris McIntosh is getting more
attention. ...
</P>
<P>
   - There may be a shortage of good quarterbacks in the NFL, but
there's no shortage of available quarterbacks. Among the available
are Jeff Blake, Bubby Brister, Trent Dilfer, Jim Druckenmiller,
Jeff George, Erik Kramer, Rick Mirer, Scott Mitchell, Neal
O'Donnell and every quarterback in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The smart teams may be those that plan to keep two -- Buffalo
(Doug Flutie, Rob Johnson), Chicago (Cade McNown, Shane Matthews),
Detroit (Charlie Batch, Gus Frerotte), the New York Jets (Vinny
Testaverde, Richie Lucas) and the Rams (Kurt Warner, Trent Green).
...
</P>
<P>
   - Those close to Madame Ram, Georgia Frontiere, say her postgame
``This proves we were right to move to St. Louis'' chortle was
aimed at NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who extorted some of the
Rams' bounty in the move, and not anyone in Southern California.
Perhaps, but she had to know how it would sound. ...
</P>
<P>
   - Please pardon my tears, but I'm still choked up over the U.S.
not qualifying a boat for the America's Cup final. ...

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ With seven-tenths of a second left and the
Rockets a couple of free throws from finally being beaten, coach
Rudy Tomjanovich tried one more desperation move.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``One point two!'' he shouted to official Tim Donaghy, knowing
there was no way he could have gotten that extra half-second, and
knowing Donaghy knew just what he was up to.
</P>
<P>
   ``One point two!'' Tomjanovich said again, making sure Pistons
coach Alvin Gentry heard before smiling broadly to reveal the truth
behind his dastardly plan _ that he was going for the laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But as Detroit's Michael Curry sank two free throws with
seven-tenths of a second left Sunday night to finally put away a
109-105 Pistons win over the Rockets, the real shocker was that a
half-second could have mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting horribly against the league's most porous defense most
of the night, the Rockets fell behind by as many as 16 points in
the fourth quarter and trailed by 11 with just 1:48 left.
</P>
<P>
   But with a mix of players who before might never have shared a
court outside Westside Tennis Club _ Bryce Drew, Cuttino Mobley,
Devin Gray, Kenny Thomas and Kelvin Cato _ the Rockets rallied
within two. They needed just one more defensive stop to have a
chance to steal a game in which they had been outplayed for 47
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very impressed with it,'' Tomjanovich said of the
comeback. ``We have plenty of excuses to give up. These guys
haven't given up all year. I mean, they (the Pistons) played great,
and we still hung in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at it, and you wonder, `How the hell did we do
that?'''
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons, having scored so easily the rest of the night,
seemed to slow down short of the tape to consider the same
question.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were minus Steve Francis, out with a right knee
sprain, for the second consecutive game. By the time they reached
the midpoint of the final quarter, they had made just 29 of 70
shots. Grant Hill and Jerry Stackhouse, the NBA's most prolific
scoring duo, were lighting them up. The Rockets' frequent
equalizer, 3-point shooting, was horrible, the free-throw shooting
worse.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Pistons might have been ready to celebrate the
triumphant return of Hill _ who had missed five of the previous
seven games with a bruised hip _ the Rockets finally made their
move.
</P>
<P>
   With the clock under two minutes, Drew hit a tough fadeaway on
the baseline to cut the margin to nine. Christian Laettner threw
the ball away, and Drew passed to Thomas for a 3 that moved the
Rockets within six with 1:21 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons isolated Hill outside, but Gray stripped him of the
ball. And if that didn't conflict enough with everything the NBA
will sell on All-Star Weekend, Drew found Hill defending him on a
switch and promptly beat him off the dribble to cut the deficit to
103-99 with 49.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went for the head fake,'' Drew said. ``He thought I was
going to shoot over him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill inbounded, but Thomas came up with the steal. And after
Drew missed a 3, got his own rebound and missed the follow, Thomas
grabbed the rebound, drew a foul and moved the Rockets within
103-101 with 40.4 seconds remaining. The Rockets had rallied with a
9-0 run in the span of 68 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows no matter how far you're down, you can definitely
come back and have a chance to win,'' Drew said after his second
consecutive 20-point game filling in for Francis. ``If we won, we
definitely would have snuck one out, because they were in control
of the game for the most part. But I guess it was encouraging to
get close at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Another bright spot for the Rockets was Cato, who scored 23
points and matched a career high with 12 rebounds. They could not,
however, get another stop down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Rockets got within two, the Pistons immediately went
back to Hill. He had scored 34 points in the first three quarters,
but with Gray renewing their Clemson-Duke matchups against one
another, Hill had missed his only two shots in the fourth quarter
and had two turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   With 24.9 seconds left, however, Gray left just enough room for
Hill to launch a jumper from 17 feet that swished. He gave the
Pistons a 105-101 lead with too little time remaining for the
Rockets to do anything but foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played him through college,'' Gray said. ``We went against
each other for years. He's much better than he was in college, and
he was a hell of a player in college. When it counted, I let down.
The jumper, I think I could have played better `D.' I gave him a
chance to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons went 1-4 in games Hill missed with his injury. The
jumper and a 36-point, seven-rebound performance sufficiently
marked his return to the court and to form.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still hurts some,'' Gentry said. ``But I just think that
when he gets on the court, the adrenaline just takes over and he
plays himself through that. The guy is a great player, and when you
put him back on our team, it makes us pretty good.''

WOODRUFF SAVES US IN DAVIS CUP 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Andre and the Other Guy, Chris Woodruff,
escaped from Africa by the skin of John McEnroe's teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Levering, president of the US Tennis Association, was
breathing for the first time in five hours, as though she'd been
rescued from King Kong by the Other Guy.
</P>
<P>
   And Zimbabwe, a poor yet friendly and hospitable country
containing but three serviceable tennis players (two of them the
Black magic brothers, Byron and Wayne), had to settle for giving
the rich United States a big-time fright in a Davis Cup clash that
left everybody in City Sports Centre limp from tension,
exhilaration, and hopes dashed or fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   When the Other Guy, Knoxville, Tenn., native Woodruff,
catapulted his 15th ace past Wayne Black, he became a new season's
American lifesaver.
</P>
<P>
   An unlooked-for hero from the lost-and-found, he had been lost
in the delirium of a Cup coming-out mess Friday. By Sunday, he
found himself under the prodding of the new US captain to beat the
gallant younger Black, 6-3, 6-7 (2-7), 6-2, 6-4, in a match that
flip-flopped several times.
</P>
<P>
   That concluded three jittery, suspenseful, high-decibel days of
bedlam, and a rare revival for McEnroe's invaders. Their 3-2
victory in the best-of-five series, one of the more memorable tight
squeezes in US Davis Cup annals, sends the Yanks into the
quarterfinals against the Czech Republic at Los Angeles in April.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a near and perhaps lucky thing, as the bargain
basement Blacks (getting $5,000 apiece from their tennis
federation) tweaked the $100,000 payday visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi genuinely gutted it out _ vomiting on court in the
last minutes of his 6-2, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) triumph over Byron Black.
</P>
<P>
   A triple-whammy of heat, humidity, and altitude (5,510 feet)
struck Agassi. Could he have gone on had he lost the third set?
Agassi says yes.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Black wondered, ``When I saw Andre puking in the
tiebreaker I wished I hadn't lost those two minibreaks,'' which
lifted Agassi to 6-3. ``He might have been finished.'' But Agassi
hung on for two more points.
</P>
<P>
   The day had begun with the United States behind, 2-1, a dire
hole from which only four previous American teams have climbed to
victory: 1902, 1934, 1961, 1981. Agassi's win left it in the hands
of the Other Guy as Levering continued to wring her hands in
anxiety. She had selected the volatile McEnroe as captain against
the advice of many. And she had convinced Agassi to return to the
team, ending his yearlong feud with the USTA.
</P>
<P>
   But now her designs on the 2000 Cup were up to the Other Guy:
this afterthought, the last one asked to the dance, the one who
stepped on his own feet when he got there, losing to Byron Black on
opening day in straight, bewildering sets.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff was nobody's idea of second fiddler to No. 1 Agassi.
But Pete Sampras got hurt, Todd Martin was sick, and Jim Courier,
Michael Chang, and Vince Spadea looked shopworn. So the phone call
from a desperate McEnroe went out to No. 51 Woodruff. A
big-shouldered, 6-foot-2-inch down-home character who wrecked a
knee two years ago goofing around kicking field goals, he provided
the last kicks of the American weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the biggest honor of my life to be asked,'' said
Woodruff. He had just returned to Knoxville from losing to Sampras
at the Australian Open. After a day of his mom's cooking, he
boarded a plane, not quite sure where Zimbabwe is located.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so nervous Friday, and all the noise was not conducive
to tennis as I'd known it,'' he said. The drums, the precise
Zimbabwean cheering-and-dancing squad, the blizzard of flags
zombied him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``John (McEnroe) got me together. He told me to take Saturday
off, not hit a ball. By today I was calmed down. I knew what to
expect, and I wasn't too nervous. I was doing just fine _ and then
the altitude got me. My shots started flying again . . . I was out
of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Crunching his groundies, picking on Wayne Black's second serve
to get to the net, and serving huge, Woodruff was up a set and 3-1.
The gritty, diminutive Black caught him, but at 4-5 faced a set
point. Woodruff could taste a two-set lead as he whacked a monster
forehand inside-out beyond Black. But it missed the sideline by a
fraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``About then I hit the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   In the tiebreaker, the Other Guy got ahead by a mini to 2-1,
double-faulted, and began to spray balls, losing six successive
points. Before he knew it, the pandemonium level induced by the
4,000 fans was ratcheted up in the cramped, steaming arena, and
Woodruff was down, 2-0. There, Black faltered to lose serve. On the
changeover, McEnroe yelled at Woodruff ``to suck it up _ but not in
words that kindly,'' the captain said. ``He had to give more,
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``John really got into my kitchen,'' said Woodruff, ``and it was
what I needed to persevere. I got my second wind.'' Then he banged
his way to win the set and take a winning lead, 2-0, in the fourth.
Fracturing Black's declining serve with a roaring backhand to 3-2
in the third, Woodruff finished that set by winning 14 of the last
15 points and had seized 22 of 25 by the time he arrived at 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable runner and retriever, feeling somehow he could
still make it Zimbabwe's greatest sporting day, Wayne Black belied
his No. 130 ranking, battling for every point. But there wasn't
much left in a little guy who had qualified for the Australian, and
gone three rounds of singles, nearly beating Sampras, and six
rounds of doubles to the final. He was playing every day Down
Under, and every day here, and it wore him down so that he was
running on only the fumes of desire.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff, hardly the picture of style, manhandles balls, labors
on his serving motion, runs with effort (but gets there), and
sometimes seems the 900-pound gorilla on Levering's back. His
volleying, often awkward, paid off, nonetheless, as he
resourcefully charged in behind returns of Black's waning second
serves.
</P>
<P>
   Black's last gasp was a break point at 3-2 in the fourth.
Woodruff changed rackets and cracked a service winner. He was
submerged by teammates after the last swing of the series, a
blinding ace. In tears, McEnroe hugged his lifeguard, screaming,
``This is what it's all about, Chris. Welcome to Davis Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, McEnroe said, ``This may be corny, but it gets to me that
seven years ago today Arthur Ashe died. Great man. He was my
captain the last time we came back from 1-2, against Mexico in '81,
and I won the fifth match over Raul Ramirez.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 33 times in a century of Davis Cup has an American been
thrust into the sudden-death fifth match. Woodruff joins those
who've come through, such Hall of Famers as McEnroe, Don Budge,
Chuck McKinley, Frank Shields, Courier, and Agassi. He has his
place, no longer the Other Guy.

CELTICS SUCCUMB TO FINISHING FLOURISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They come at you in waves. We're not talking high tide
at Nauset Light Beach. We're talking `Endless Summer' here.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's game, Celtics assistant coach Jim O'Brien
said the first 10 players of the Portland Trail Blazers represented
the strongest team he'd seen in more than a decade. ``Their second
team could compete for the playoffs,'' he said. Their first team
ain't bad either.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers eventually wear out most everyone with their depth
and talent. Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, the Celtics became Victim No. 35 of this
outrageously gifted troupe, but not before making Portland go the
full 48.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics never led in the fourth quarter _ Portland is 31-2
when it leads after three _ but were still very much alive until a
Scottie Pippen trey with 82 seconds left. That made it 95-88 and
proved to be the fatal dagger, as Portland hung on for a 100-94
victory before the fifth sellout of the season at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the sixth in eight games for the Celtics, who
dropped to 21-26, tied with Orlando. Portland is an NBA-best 35-11,
which includes an impressive 19-8 on the road. (No team has played
more road games.) The Blazers are 14-4 against Eastern Conference
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Portland does present problems everywhere. This is a team that
brings Brian Grant off the bench, for goodness sakes. The only
figurehead on the roster is old friend Joe Kleine, who turned 38
last month and is along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, Portland Sunday &UR;  &LR; night had six players in double
figures, led by Steve Smith with 23. Grant (22 minutes) and
Jermaine O'Neal (13 minutes) each had eight rebounds as Portland
had a 42-35 advantage on the boards, including an 11-5 margin in
the fourth (six of them off the offensive glass).
</P>
<P>
   And, like so many teams these days, they made the Celtics pay at
the line, outscoring Boston by 10 points there. Portland attempted
39 free throws to the Celtics' 27. The Celtics had two more field
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of those nights,'' shrugged Kenny Anderson, who had 11
points and 10 assists. ``You almost have to play a perfect game to
beat that team. We didn't. And we don't want no moral victories,
either. We've got to win these games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics can look back at this one and see many lost chances.
Paul Pierce had 16 points, but missed three big free throws in the
fourth. Antoine Walker had five shots blocked _ he must lead the
league in that category _ and was 5 of 16 from the field. Boston's
biggest offensive weapon was Vitaly Potapenko, who had 19 points in
24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rick Pitino was upset about the pace of the game _ too
slow _ and the Celtics' rebounding _ too little. But what really
killed the Celtics was an inability in the first half to run away,
as Portland opened the second quarter by going scoreless for the
first 5:56 and basket-less for the first 6:48.
</P>
<P>
   All Boston could manage in that stretch was 8 unanswered points.
The Celtics missed 10 of 14 shots in that stretch and added a
couple of turnovers. You get a team like that in trouble, you
should pounce. The Celtics did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked kind of tired in the beginning,'' Anderson said.
``We just didn't keep up the tempo in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Pierce, ``We've got to get that rebound and get out and
run.''
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of a decent lead at the break, all the Celtics had
was a 45-42 advantage. Not good enough. The third quarter featured
nine lead changes until a Pippen trey made it 71-70 heading into
the fourth. That turned out to be the last of the 17 lead changes
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the fourth, the Blazers got a big lift from O'Neal, who
had 9 points, 5 rebounds, and a blocked shot in 7 active
fourth-quarter minutes. ``I can score,'' said O'Neal, who had 13
points and 2 blocks in his 13 minutes. ``But I don't have to.''
Portland eventually built the lead to 8 (87-79) only to see the
Celtics get back to within 87-83. Pierce was then fouled with 4:55
left. He missed them both.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics never got closer than 4 the rest of the way. But it
was still a 4-point game when Damon Stoudamire rolled a pass from
under the basket right out to Pippen (19 points, 7 rebounds.) He
calmly swished a trey to blow the lead to 7 and the Celtics were
officially cooked.

 PRO-AM-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ The story, so dominant in its focus early
in the week, was a virtual afterthought by midday, lost in the
glare of Hollywood stars and silenced by a parade of routine pars.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, continually frustrated by birdie putts that burned
the cup, shot a 4-under-par 68 Sunday in the third round of AT&AMP;T
Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, and while his attempt to win a sixth
straight PGA Tour event still has a pulse, it presents a challenge
that many consider too great even for his remarkable skills.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Harmon isn't one of them. ``If he putts well (Monday),''
said Woods's swing coach, ``he'll win this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods enters a rare Monday finish _ one necessitated by
Thursday's wash-out _ at 7-under 209, five shots behind a pair of
co-leaders who had to feel like they were intruders at an event
that is as much for Andy Garcia as it is for Sergio Garcia. Matt
Gogel, playing just his fourth tournament on the PGA Tour, shot 67
at the same course as Woods played, Pebble Beach, to finish 54
holes at 204, a figure that was matched by Mark Brooks (6-under 66
at Poppy Hills).
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Singh, the second-round leader, managed just an even-par
72 at the event's third course, Spyglass Hill, and is in third
place, one shot back. Notah Begay (72 at Spyglass) is fourth at
206, while Jimmy Green (68), Chris DiMarco (69), and the pride of
Trinity College in Hartford, Jay Williamson (69), shot themselves
into a share of fifth place at 208.
</P>
<P>
   The five-player group at 209 includes Woods and Jim Furyk, who
ripped off a 64 at Pebble on a day when the majestic layout was as
defenseless as it ever will be. Low wind, blue sky, warm
temperature. That he didn't take advantage of such pristine
conditions was frustrating, said Woods, who made five birdies but
hit it close enough all day to make twice that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that I have given myself a chance,'' said Woods, who
had been eight back through 36 holes in this high-profile pro-am
that does not match his golf-serious personality. Everyone may love
Raymond Romano, he of the TV series and 18-handicap, but try
playing in the group behind him for three days as you chase
history, something Woods had to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was . . . interesting,'' said Woods, though as he stood in
the fairway waiting to hit his second shot to the par 5 18th, Woods
probably had seen enough of Romano's hackings, not to mention Tommy
Smothers's comedy routine with the yo-yo. Alas, such activities
come with the territory here _ at least through three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   That changes Monday for those who made the cut, as the venue is
Pebble Beach for a serious round of golf. Woods's trademark red
shirt will be out. So, it is predicted, will the notorious Pebble
Beach weather, which does not bother Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's ugly out there,'' said Woods, ``then I'm in great
shape. But if it's calm, then it's going to be a tough task to make
that many birdies to catch them.''
</P>
<P>
   Calm was the order of business Sunday, but on a day when David
Duval inexplicably shot 75 and missed the cut and Woods struggled
to make birdies despite striping his irons, it was a PGA Tour
rookie (Gogel) and a PGA Tour veteran who hasn't been heard from
since winning the 1996 PGA (Brooks) who took advantage. Gogel,
playing Pebble's back first, bogeyed the difficult par-4 11th, then
ran off five birdies in his next nine holes to vault to the top of
the leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   That he was doing it with virtually no one other than his caddie
and playing partners watching, even when he birdied the par-5 sixth
to get to 12-under, speaks as much for Gogel's unheralded status as
it does Woods's immense star power. ``I don't think anybody ever
knows when it's their turn or time to win,'' said Gogel, a six-time
winner on the Nike Tour.
</P>
<P>
   If it is yet again Woods's turn to win, something he has done in
every PGA Tour-sanctioned event in which he has played since
September, it will come via his patented charge in harmony with
others collapsing. No one would come out and say so, but the
leaderboard _ save for Singh and Begay _ is loaded with players who
would need road maps to a PGA Tour winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the weather,'' said Woods, whose only miscue in
Round 3 came on the heels of a bizarre suspension in play. It was
bright and warm at Pebble, but as Woods stood on the eighth tee,
officials stopped play. Fog had enveloped Spyglass and ``we have to
play in the same conditions at the same time,'' explained PGA Tour
official Mark Russell.
</P>
<P>
   After a 30-minute wait, Woods immediately bogeyed the eighth
hole, though he had to breathe a sigh of relief. His second shot
over the famous cliff landed short of the green and was almost lost
in the hay. ``I could see the `R' in my name (on the ball). I
figured it could be my ball,'' said Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was, though he had to pull off a miraculous shot just
to get it to the green. He missed the par-save from 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been a lot worse,'' said Woods, for one slip and
he would have perhaps gone down a steep bank into the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   It also could have been better than his 68, though, as he
figures, but it was enough to get him into the picture. As if he is
ever out of it.

CAYARD GRACIOUS AFTER LOSING 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ If Italy's Prada beats New Zealand to
win the America's Cup, there is no way to overemphasize the debt it
owes Paul Cayard, who brought its national Cup aspirations to a
fever pitch in 1992, then raised its game this year through the
fiercest battle in challenger history.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at a news conference in the raucous aftermath of Prada's
Louis Vuitton Cup win Saturday, Cayard, who became a hero in Italy
when he led Il Moro di Venezia into the Cup final in '92, would not
rise to the bait.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by an Italian journalist if the nine-race series had been
about ``the student passing the teacher,'' Cayard, who skippered
AmericaOne's 5-4 loss, said, ``I would never say Francesco (de
Angelis, Prada's skipper) was my student. We are very different
people. We complement each other because we are so different. I am
happy for him that he is doing so well and wish him the best in the
America's Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Cayard stepped off the Cup stage, leaving it without
an American racing for the first time in its 149-year history. And
the analysts, who up until now had resisted, were left with this
explanation: Prada's Luna Rossa was slightly faster, the team
slightly smoother sailing, than AmericaOne.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Cayard worlds different from ``Baroni'' (the Baron)
de Angelis, the campaigns were a study in contrasts. Cayard, in
fact, believes the ``Prada model'' is the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   With an early start, two fast boats, and enough time and money
to develop its sailing program to near perfection on the Auckland
waterfront, Prada is, said Cayard, a ``leave-no-stone-unturned''
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, when Prada was first in Auckland in January 1998,
Cayard was sailing in the Whitbread around-the-world race _ which,
incidentally, he won in his rookie year.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Cayard, when his Whitbread entry, E F Language,
made its Auckland layover in winter 1998, the Prada team already
was here practicing.
</P>
<P>
   Distracted by the complexity of his sailing syndicate _ ``too
many things on my plate'' as boss and skipper of the Whitbread and
America's Cup campaigns two years apart _ Cayard admitted, ``I am
not the sailor I was in '92 (Louis Vuitton win) or '95 (Cup
defending skipper). I haven't spent as much time as I could have on
the sailing side to prepare for this.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It is not an insignificant coincidence that the
amount of money and time spent on these campaigns (shows in the
result). Prada was the model campaign, but we did a damn good job
with the time and money we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cayard's AmericaOne campaign did push Prada almost to the
breaking point. The first two races resulted in a split. Still
unresolved was the speed of the boats. But the Prada style was
clear. When it gets out in front, there's almost no stopping the
red-trimmed silver bullet, as its speed and smooth sailing team
stretches out most leads.
</P>
<P>
   Races 3 and 4 _ both Prada wins _ made it look like a blowout.
But trailing, 3-1, Cayard showed the strength of his team, which
fought back with aggressive starts and match-racing moves. Once
behind in a race and the series, Prada seemed shaken, unable to
react spontaneously. In fact, tactician Torben Grael admitted, ``We
have a plan that we follow for the first leg. We always stick to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   A stunned Cayard said he never could sail confined to a
prearranged plan. Cayard and his tactician, John Kostecki, mixed up
the attack, and the results showed on the course.
</P>
<P>
   Three straight wins _ of 34, 9, and 66 seconds _ put AmericaOne
on a roll, and Cayard liked his chances, saying, ``Let's see how
those boys handle the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   It was then that de Angelis, Grael, and the Prada team reached
down and found something new _ some street fighting moves similar
to AmericaOne's. Trailing, 4-3, in a must-win race, Prada came out
aggressively at the start and nearly tagged Cayard with a quick
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   A tactical mistake by AmericaOne and an aggressive move near the
end of the second leg sealed the race for Prada, as Cayard gybed
too close to leeward, drawing a penalty that took AmericaOne out of
the race.
</P>
<P>
   That set the scene for the excruciating finale. The race itself,
anticlimactic and rather unremarkable, showed more than any other
that the difference is boat speed. In 12-knot wind, Prada cruised
in the sunny turquoise wash of Hauraki Gulf to an easy but historic
49-second win.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, the what-if game will start among US camps:
</P>
<P>
   --What if New York Yacht Club's Young America had been launched
in Rhode Island early enough for the structural failures to be
detected and fixed at the Goetz yard a few miles away in Bristol?
</P>
<P>
   --What if the New York Yacht Club sailing team had included
Dennis Conner and Tom Whidden, which it had a chance to do two
years before the Cup?
</P>
<P>
   --What if Cayard had sailed for New York _ another onetime
possibility?
</P>
<P>
   ``We will miss having an American boat in the Cup,'' said New
York Yacht Club commodore Dooie Isdale, ``but watch out the next
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about matching the Prada model of a long campaign, Isdale
said a US challenger for the next Cup should start ``probably
today. I'm not being facetious. We are having many discussions
about all the possible scenarios. We'll be talking here with all of
us together.''
</P>
<P>
   Isdale agreed with Cayard that too many US challengers diluted
the resources. ``We have to talk about how to merge the clubs into
a mega-challenge,'' he said. ``We talked about it last time, but
there were too many egos. But we won't be ready to make any
announcement until after we know where the next Cup will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The best-of-nine final begins Feb. 19.

PIPPEN PIPES UP ON MANY TOPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You figure someone selected as one of the NBA's 50
greatest players would be a cinch for the All-Star Game. If
Portland Trail Blazers forward Scottie Pippen sought to make a name
for himself after playing second fiddle to Michael Jordan for years
in Chicago, surely this isn't what he had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be able to take the break, but of course there's
a sense of (disappointment) not being there,'' said Pippen, who
helped lead the Blazers to a 100-94 win over the Celtics
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be . . . something that messes with your ego,''
Pippen added, ``but I'm a veteran player. There are worse things
that can happen. Probably not the best thing, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to say that Pippen hasn't achieved some notice out of
Jordan's shadow. This season he is one of the leaders of a team
tied with the Los Angeles Lakers for the best record in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The only active player with six championship rings, Pippen
registered his 16,000th career point on Dec. 11 against the
Sacramento Kings and a month earlier grabbed his 6,000th rebound in
a win over the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Averaging 12.6 ppg (fourth on the team), 5.4 assists (second), 7
boards (second), and 1.54 steals (first), Pippen helped the Blazers
to a 13-3 mark in November (a franchise best) and an 11-3 record in
January, its best mark in that month since the 1989-90 team went
12-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to get tougher,'' said Pippen. ``We lose a bit
of our toughness sometimes and give up a lot of offensive rebounds.
We have a lot of areas where we need to step up offensively and we
could be more consistent defensively. And then, there are just a
few fundamental things where we could be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Pippen struggled in his first season away from the
Bulls. Traded to Houston in January of last year, he averaged 14.5
ppg (the lowest since his second season with the Bulls) and posted
a career low in field-goal percentage (43 percent).
</P>
<P>
   He was brought to Houston to help make them a title contender
again but had highly publicized feuds with Charles Barkley. The
Rockets were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a short season, and it was going to be a tough season
no matter how you look at it. My options were limited because of
the short period of time,'' said Pippen. ``But this is a great
situation for me. It gives me an opportunity to be a leader with
younger guys. I can give my court awareness in running the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Being the team leader is something he didn't have to worry about
when he played with Jordan. ``I feel like whatever this team does,
it's going to fall back on me, since I was brought in here to lead
this team to a championship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to understand I came in here not knowing many of
these guys, so I have to try to build relationships rather than
destroying them. I have to allow those relationships to develop
before I start making those leadership type of corrections.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen applauds Jordan's move to becoming part owner and general
manager of the Washington Wizards and wishes him the best but
added, ``I don't know . . . there's nothing he can do, really, from
his point of view to make the franchise turn around, but we just
have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the return of former Bulls teammate Dennis Rodman,
now with the Dallas Mavericks, Pippen said: ``I'm happy for him as
well. He's a great player, someone who knows his way around the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done some things that have sort of taken him away from
the game, and have put him in an at-risk situation where no one
wants to deal with him. But he's got a second chance and hopefully
he can take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Blazer to start all 47 games, Pippen tallied 19 points
on 7-for-13 shooting Sunday &UR;  &LR; night and added 7 boards and 3 assists
to offset 3 turnovers. He had two key treys at the end of both
quarters in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   His 24-foot baseline trey with 2.2 seconds left in the third
gave the Blazers a 71-70 lead they would not relinquish. His
24-foot trey with 1:22 left gave Portland a 95-88 lead, virtually
sealing it for the visitors.

BOURQUE AN APPROACHABLE STAR 
</HEADLINE>
 GAME-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ No one has said for sure, least of all the man
himself. But there are many indications that Bruins captain Ray
Bourque will retire at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   If that holds true, Bourque's appearance at Sunday's 50th
All-Star Game at the Air Canada Centre will have been his last. In
the 9-4 victory by the World Team, which scored four unanswered
goals in the third, Bourque logged 15 minutes 17 seconds of ice
time, had 12 shifts, and finished a plus-2 for the North Americans.
</P>
<P>
   He and Vancouver center Mark Messier each picked up an assist,
giving them each an All-Star-record 13 for their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the enjoyment of the weekend for the 39-year-old Bourque
was mentoring young players, something he has done during his
veteran years in the NHL. Sunday, he took time to encourage
promising rookie forward Scott Gomez of the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked to me before I went out there,'' said Gomez, 20.
``What he said really helped me out. He said, `Remember what got
you here and just go out there and have fun. If you don't forget
how you got here, you'll be in many more.' That was some good
advice.''
</P>
<P>
   And poignant considering this is likely Bourque's swan song.
Bourque, who also honored Gomez's request of a stick to take home
as a souvenir, said he never has taken these games for granted. He
remembers what it is like to be just starting out. He appreciated
it then, he said, and he appreciates it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started, I came to these games and there were guys like
Larry Robinson and Guy Lafleur that I grew up watching and kind of
were my idols,'' said Bourque. ``You just watch them and how they
go about their business. Any little thing that they tell you, it's
like, `Wow, he spoke to me.' It's pretty neat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there, so I know when certain young guys come around
you just make sure you go say your two cents and make them feel
comfortable. You come to these games and it can be pretty
intimidating your first time. So you just make sure they feel
comfortable and they're having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque said the opening ceremonies were moving, particularly
when Wayne Gretzky was honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up there at the beginning of the game, you look around and see
Gretzky come out and that whole thing, it was pretty neat,'' said
Bourque. ``You know you may not be here again. It's a pretty
special feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The game itself was an offensive spectacle as always. But not as
offensive as the North Americans and Bourque would've liked. When
Bourque talked about the team's problems in the goal department, he
could well have been talking about the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't put it in,'' said Bourque. ``Lack of scoring,
do you believe that? Guys couldn't finish. We were behind the whole
night. We got within one but couldn't score that next one. We came
out in the third and didn't do very much. We had a hard time
finishing out there. It's tough to say with all the scoring we have
in this room.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one penalty in the game and about as much physical
contact as you see in figure skating. Bourque said that's great for
the forwards but makes it hard on the defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough on everyone that plays somewhat of a physical game
or just plays hard,'' he said. ``Nobody is doing it, you just don't
want to be the jerk that goes out there and runs over somebody. You
just want to make sure you're in the right position . . .''
</P>
<P>
   And if this turns out to be his last, he said, he'll be glad he
was here no matter the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a special feeling,'' he said. ``You come in for an
All-Star Game not knowing if you're going to play in another one.
Obviously there are a few thoughts going through your mind. Before
the game, the introductions, that whole ceremony and when Wayne
came out. You just appreciate the moment.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
HONOLULU _ The next time someone tells you that no one cares about
the Pro Bowl, just tell them about Sunday's game at Aloha Stadium.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the 2000 Pro Bowl lacked the exciting finish of Super
Bowl XXXIV, 767 yards were generated and a record number of points
were scored in the NFC's 51-31 victory that left coach Tony Dungy
and quarterback Steve Beuerlein accusing AFC coach Tom Coughlin of
breaking the rules.
</P>
<P>
   There are specific rules against blitzing and double-covering
receivers in the Pro Bowl. Beuerlein said there was a message in
his 25-yard touchdown pass to Randy Moss with 1:05 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AFC was using questionable tactics the whole second
half,'' Beuerlein said. ``They were breaking a lot of rules. I
think it was a statement from our coaching staff to theirs, like,
`Look at the scoreboard, and here's another touchdown to think
about the next few months.'''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin, the Jacksonville Jaguars coach who came one game short
of reaching the Super Bowl, denied violating any rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beuerlein's out of control in that respect,'' Coughlin said.
``We didn't coach anything other than what the rules are. Before
they speak about what we're doing, they probably ought to look at
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Dungy, who is mild-mannered but highly respected, echoed
Beuerlein's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned about the safety of our players,'' Dungy said.
``We're supposed to have restrictions about what we can do
defensively, and we went over them. It was tough because we have a
set of rules for both teams, but one didn't always follow those
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we had the wrong rule book.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFC was penalized one time for breaking a rule. That came
when Jacksonville outside linebacker Kevin Hardy sacked Beuerlein
and was penalized 15 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an understanding, but, obviously, they didn't,'' Dungy
said. ``Our quarterbacks took some unnecessary hits. I don't think
it's good when the game's set up for no blitzing and then they
blitz. Someone could have gotten hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's Pro Bowl also will be known as the one in which the
game's Most Valuable Player didn't appear in his team picture.
</P>
<P>
   Moss, who caught nine passes for 212 yards and a touchdown, was
voted MVP one day after he threw a fit and refused to appear in the
team picture. Saturday was photo day at the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I wasn't in the team picture, but I'm not going to tell
you why,'' Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Moss was angry when stadium security wouldn't let
some of his friends onto the field because they didn't have passes.
``This is a different setup with a different set of rules,'' Dungy
said. ``That wouldn't happen in regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFC led from start to finish and scored a record number of
points. Dungy, who coaches the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, fired
offensive coordinator Mike Shula during the week. Quarterbacks
coach Clyde Christensen called plays for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   During the season, the Bucs finished 11-5 but scored more than
30 points only once. They had five games in which they failed to
score an offensive touchdown. Tampa Bay fullback Mike Alstott
scored three touchdowns Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what to say, except that 51 points is a
lot,'' Dungy said. ``And it's always nice to see the defense score,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona cornerback Aeneas Williams returned an interception 62
yards for the NFC's first touchdown, and Tampa Bay outside
linebacker Derrick Brooks returned an interception 20 yards for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The only NFC touchdown pass came when Beuerlein found Moss to
rub it in.
</P>
<P>
   AFC quarterbacks Peyton Manning, Mark Brunell and Rich Gannon
combined to throw five interceptions. The NFC suffered none.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules are set up a certain way, and we tried to take
advantage of them,'' Dungy said. ``Great players make coaching a
lot easier. Great players always want the ball.''

OLD GUARD IS OVERCOME 
</HEADLINE>
 SPEEDSKATING-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ They had been champions so often that most folks
figured they had retired the trophies. Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann of
Germany had won five straight world all-around speedskating titles
and eight of the last nine. Rintje Ritsma of the Netherlands had
won three of the last five. Sunday, both of them were toppled by
teammates halfway along the road to Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old Niemann-Stirnemann, the most dominant women's
skater of the last decade, was beaten by 27-year-old Claudia
Pechstein, runner-up the last four years. And the 27-year-old
Ritsma was taken down by the 26-year-old Gianni Romme, who led a
Dutch sweep of the medals ahead of two-time champ Ids Postma and
Ritsma, winning by a whopping margin of more than two points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible,'' said Romme, who was making his all-around
debut after winning both the 5,000 and 10,000 at the Olympics.
``The Olympics is one thing. But the all-around championship is the
biggest thing in speedskating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, as expected, were innocent bystanders in their
own oval. Derek Parra, KC Boutiette, and Jennifer Rodriguez all
missed the cut for the final race and finished out of the top 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only skate as fast as we can skate,'' shrugged Parra,
who has been fighting a respiratory infection and was coughing up
blood before he took the ice. ``We tried our best.''
</P>
<P>
   No US skater has won a world all-around medal since Eric Flaim
and Dave Silk went 1-3 in 1988. The Dutch own the men's side of the
sport and the Germans the women's. The only questions here were
whether distance king Romme could sprint fast enough to prevail and
whether Pechstein could unseat Niemann-Stirnemann after chasing her
for a quadrennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second place is a good place, but the first place is better,''
declared Pechstein, whose name means ``unlucky stone'' in German.
``Maybe I thought I could beat Gunda, but I didn't believe it
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Niemann-Stirnemann, who has skated for two countries (East and
reunified Germany) under three names, has been an icon for years
and is arguably the best female skater of all time. Her resume is
unparalleled _ eight world titles, eight Olympic medals (three of
them gold) at four Games, 16 world records, eight world
single-distance crowns.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the world has been catching up. Anni Friesinger,
another teammate, had beaten Niemann-Stirnemann at last month's
European championships, which Niemann-Stirnemann had been using as
a tuneup for the world meet. ``The goal for Gunda was here,'' said
Pechstein. ``But that was my goal, too.''
</P>
<P>
   After Pechstein had beaten her nemesis in Saturday's 3,000 and
finished four places ahead in the 500, she knew she was sitting
solid. When Pechstein edged Niemann-Stirnemann again in Sunday's
1,500, she needed only to stay within lassoing range in the 5,000
to claim her crown. ``I know Gunda can beat me,'' Pechstein said.
``I have this in my head when I race. But she has to beat me by
five seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   For half the distance, Pechstein stayed alongside her. Then
Niemann-Stirnemann opened the throttle and widened the gap to a
second, then two, then three. ``As an athlete, you always think you
can get there,'' she said. ``You must always hope, because you can
never tell what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Niemann-Stirnemann punished herself for the final two laps, legs
churning, face contorted, mouth agape. She finished in a humming
7:02.11, but Pechstein was only 3.76 seconds behind. ``I look at
the scoreboard for a time,'' said Pechstein. ``And when I see it is
not five seconds, now it is clear in my head that I am the
winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Romme didn't bother checking the math. After he'd skated a
respectable 500 (12th, but less than half a second behind Ritsma)
and blown away the field by 10 seconds in the 5,000, Romme only had
to keep from seizing up Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was only fourth in the 1,500, Romme still beat Ritsma
and all but dead-heated with Postma in his pair. All he needed do
in the 10,000 was put his arms behind his back and cruise _ and he
did. ``I thought, another 25 laps, this will be heavy,'' said
Romme, whose mother named him after Gianni Rivera, the old Italian
soccer player. ``But once I was racing, I wasn't tired. After half
the race, I knew I had it.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home, they stayed up until 1 in the morning to see what the
scoreboard said. The citizenry knew a Dutchman would win here. They
just wanted to see which name would go on the trophy.

 BALANCE MEET-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Johnny Gray had no intention of losing. He never does.
Especially not this time, when his 4x800-meter relay team was going
up against a foursome that included a couple of milers and a
hurdles guy. When you've held the 800-meter American outdoor record
(1:42.60) for 15 years and you're coming off a couple of big
early-season indoor wins that included the Millrose Games and
you're gunning for a world record, you feel pretty confident you
can handle a couple of milers and a hurdles guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we kind of underestimated the other team,'' said a
subdued Gray after his cooldown.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently so. In the final event of Sunday's fifth annual New
Balance Invitational, in front of 2,250 fans at the Reggie Lewis
Track &AMP; Athletic Center, the Global Athletics &AMP; Marketing team of
Joey Woody (400-meter hurdler), Karl Paranya (miler), Rich Kenah
(the only pure 800-meter guy), and David Krummenacker (another
miler) gathered for the first _ and probably last _ time to set a
world record in 7 minutes 13.94 seconds, knocking almost four
seconds off the 7:17.8 set by a Soviet Union team back in 1971. The
second-place Reebok Enclave squad (7:14:78) and the Gray-anchored
Santa Monica Track Club (7:16.59) also broke the old mark, becoming
the second- and third-fastest teams in history.
</P>
<P>
   Also clicking Sunday was Regina Jacobs, who set an American
record at 1,000 meters when her 2:35.29 easily slipped under the
2:37.6 set by Mary Slaney 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's way up there,'' declared the 36-year-old Jacobs, asked
where the record stands on a list of career accomplishments that so
far includes two silver medals at 1,500 meters at the outdoor World
Championships and three Olympic appearances. ``I never would have
imagined I would be running like this at this age.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, Jacobs demolished the mile field at Millrose
when she triumphed in 4:24.04, less than four seconds off another
Slaney record. ``Running Millrose and really going for it there
took a lot out of me,'' said Jacobs. ``The last 100, I had to
really dig in.''
</P>
<P>
   What was billed as a chase for the record actually turned into
quite a race when Toni Hodgkinson stunningly took it out from the
gun, leaving both Jacobs and the rabbit behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never raced the 1,000 before, so I just raced the 800
pace,'' said the New Zealand 800-meter Olympian. ``I was thinking
when she goes how hard it was going to be to hang on to her.''
Seeing Jacobs go through 800 in 2:03, her husband and coach, Tom
Craig, began to fear his wife was racing Hodgkinson rather than
watching the clock, and so with 180 meters left he yelled for her
to go. Now. She listened, and so takes back to Oakland, Calif., the
US record and the new Chevy Blazer that comes with it.
</P>
<P>
   In the relay, the new world-record holders will split a $50,000
bonus, and Gray said it was the hurdler who did the most to earn
it. Running the first leg for the GAM team, Woody, who finished
second at the 400-meter hurdles in last summer's national
championships, barely trailed Lubert Lewis of the Syracuse Chargers
when he handed off to Paranya, putting him in good position to take
a lead that Kenah and Krummenaker _ running anchor basically by
default after the others turned it down _ never lost. ``I didn't
think (Woody) would have the heart and guts to run that leg, and
that did it for them,'' said Gray. ``I think he was the reason they
won. Our guys didn't run under control; they kind of panicked.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAM team, meanwhile, ran remarkably even splits of 1:49.34,
148.31, 1:48.48, and 1:47.81. ``On paper it looked like this was an
easy record, but there's a reason it was around since 1971,'' said
Kenah. ``We were lucky we all clicked on the same day.''

US WOMEN GIVEN FRIENDLY BOOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ They are no longer invincible nor
unbeatable. And after a 3-2 loss to Norway Sunday, the image of the
US women's national team is bound to suffer, at least until it
meets the Norwegians in a rematch Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the rematch will be conducted behind closed gates at Florida
Atlantic University in Boca Raton. This defeat occurred before
12,031 spectators at Lockhart Stadium, plus a national television
audience.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a successful start to the April Heinrichs coaching
era, though Heinrichs emphasized the game as a stage to try out new
players rather than a must-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   Norway, though, played to win, and coach Per-Mathias Hogmo made
effective substitutions in the second half. The US team had taken a
2-1 lead as Kristine Lilly finished in a chaotic scramble near the
goal area in the 71st minute. But the US was becoming disorganized
and slightly wreckless, and the Norwegians capitalized, tying it on
a goal by Carla Overbeck 10 minutes later. Then, substitute Dagny
Mellgren launched a dramatic winner from 25 yards into the far
upper corner of the net over goalkeeper Saskia Webber a minute into
injury time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the players it's not where you start but where you
finish, whether it's this game or in life,'' Heinrichs said. ``We
lost but we learned. We played very dynamic, exciting, and it was
difficult to defend against our flank play. We got forward and sent
numbers forward. We were able to settle down the game with
possession. We were rusty, but we can take care of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the United States was capable of winning this match,
because of and despite the rawness of young players such as Nandi
Pryce, whose poor back pass led to Hege Riise's 19th-minute
penalty. But as Pryce, the 17-year-old sister of Denver Broncos'
Pro Bowler Trevor Pryce, improved and became more composed,
Heinrichs made so many changes that the United States began losing
its compactness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see willful players, how they would impact us for
winning,'' Heinrichs said. ``We don't want to give away a win. But
I wanted to see personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways to win, though, and the US failed to play
the possession game while holding the lead in the final minutes,
precisely when it was most judicious to do so. By then, the players
best suited to that tactic _ Julie Foudy, Mia Hamm, Shannon
MacMillan, and Tiffeny Milbrett _ had departed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always hate to lose, but it's the first game of the year
and we worked out some kinks,'' said MacMillan, whose dynamic play
on the right side led to Hamm's diving header in the 25th minute.
``Those young players are the future. We had a lot of different
looks and we have a lot of talent not even suiting up. You always
learn from losses more than wins. But this makes us mad and we will
be fired up Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lilly: ``We never want to lose, but we played a good game
and we want to win the next game. Give us a break _ it's early, and
we lost two to China last year. We don't mind these losses. It's
better now than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the United States hardly seemed like a beaten squad
afterward. This was its first defeat since a 2-1 loss against China
April 25, and there will be four more games against Norway this
year in preparation for the Sydney Olympics in September. And for
players such as Pryce, this is their Dream Team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing is never fun, but we are excited to build on this,''
Pryce said. ``It's a whole new atmosphere. I watched them win the
World Cup and everyone that watched that got chills because they
did it and because of the way they did it. I never, in my wildest
dreams, thought I would be playing with these players. But they
were great to me _ they told me everything would be all right.''

<P>
   Baylor: Might be.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling: What about him?

</P>
<P>
   Sterling: Cool. So what's the problem?
</P>

   Baylor: Nuthin', I guess. Just wondering...

<P>
   Sterling: What was that last question?
</P>
<P>
   Baylor: You wanna get together for a game of ``Clue'' later?
</P>
<P>
   Sterling: Can't. I'm off to a charity auction. We're trying to
raise money to get the homeless off the streets around my
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor: Well, you are the great humanitarian.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling: Oh, stop. I'm blushing.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor: And I'm flushing... We need to decide on a permanent
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling: There is no such beast in this business, lad. Go to

</P>
<P>

<P>
   Sterling: Aim low. No one expects us to win, right?
</P>
<P>
   Baylor: Right about now, no.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling: So your point is?
</P>
<P>
   Baylor: (Long pause) I want out of my contract.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling: You want to be the coach?
</P>
<P>
   Baylor: You hear me, I want out of this. This (begin

town is worse than the LAPD? And people here don't even (begin
ital)care!off! how messed up we are anymore. I'm laughed at
whenever I go to these GM meetings. I gotta hang out with Zeke so
people stop pointing their finger and start feeling sorry for me.
This has all gotta stop, man. You gotta invest some money, quality
money, into building this team. We've got millions worth of talent
waiting to make millions for you. I got the players. Now it's time
to go out and get a quality coach who can teach these kids how to
play on the big stage and keep them from leaving. DTS, you gotta
step aside and let people who know the game get this franchise out
of the gutter. We have a foundation here. We gotta stop being
looked at as clowns.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Baylor: Did you hear anything I just said?

SUNS CATCH OFF-AGAIN SONICS IN OLD FORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Like an age-old soap opera with repeating story lines,
the Sonics reverted to a familiar plot.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the team's shooting suffered a horrific death. The
Sonics' energy level and rebounding were on life support. And they
left betrayed by an official, who eventually ejected coach Paul
Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   Another episode of As The Sonics Turn _ from a team with a
contending look to one that is a ratings nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal's rare dismissal was about the only twist Sunday on a
night the Sonics were predictably inconsistent throughout a 105-93
loss to the Phoenix Suns at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shown how good we can be, but we're not doing it every
night,'' Westphal said. ``It comes down to effort. That shouldn't
be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The on-again/off-again Sonics lost for the sixth time in the
past nine games. They have dropped every other game in the past
week, this time losing to a team they had dominated Friday at
KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton out-dueled Phoenix point guard Jason Kidd in that
game with 23 points, a career-high 13 rebounds and seven assists.
Payton's turnaround Sunday characterized how the Sonics' struggled
offensively this time.
</P>
<P>
   He had 13 points, seven rebounds, seven assists and five steals,
but Payton missed 14 of his 18 shots. Kidd stole the show with 22
points on 7-for-12 shooting, 12 assists and seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Payton wasn't the only Sonics starter whose shooting was shabby.
Excluding Ruben Patterson (2-for-3, 10 points), the starting five
combined to shoot just 12-for-44.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker followed his 22-point, nine-rebound game Friday with a
paltry eight points and four rebounds in 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the guys might be tired,'' Payton said. `` ... We've
got to ride this out. We've got to suck it up. A lot of guys are
hurt and playing with it. So these four days (off) coming up for
the All-Star (break) are going to be pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Sonics must get through two more road games _ Tuesday
at San Antonio and Wednesday at Dallas _ before the midseason break
in the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The stated goal is to go into the All-Star weekend on a positive
note. For that to happen, the Sonics must break this disturbing
cycle. They came out flat against the Suns. And despite staying
within 46-45 at halftime, the Sonics never found the enthusiasm to
remain close.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns opened the third quarter with an 11-2 run that
separated them from the Sonics for good.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-pointer from Kidd capped the offensive barrage, and Phoenix
outscored the Sonics 31-17 in the period. Kidd, held to eight
points on 3-for-14 shooting in the first half, ignited the Suns in
that decisive period.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Kidd drove past Payton and threw down a one-hand
dunk before Baker could rotate to the basket for a block. Moments
later, Kidd stole the ball from Payton at midcourt, dodged a pair
of Sonic defenders on the fastbreak, and scooped a layup that
basket put the Suns ahead 70-58.
</P>
<P>
   They led 77-62 heading into the fourth. The Sonics never got any
closer than 13 points, and they forged that 103-90 score with just
1:23 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played aggressively,'' Payton said of Kidd. ``He made
shots. Friday he couldn't make a shot and he did today. ... And we
didn't have a lot of intensity out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal perhaps exhibited more fire in 30 seconds than his
players did in all of that decisive third quarter. With the Sonics
trailing 87-70 and 7:49 left in the fourth period, Westphal got
into a confrontation with referee Jack Nies.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal was upset that Shammond Williams did not receive a foul
after having his jumper blocked from behind. Westphal drew his
first technical almost immediately after he petitioned Nies.
</P>
<P>
   A surprised Westphal kept arguing and Nies wasted little time
issuing a second technical foul and automatic ejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no point in talking about it,'' Westphal said
afterward. ``I can't win. The more I think about it, I really
didn't have very many nice comments about the game. ... We were
very flat, and that contributed to my mood.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's bench was its only reprieve. Williams, Rashard Lewis,
and Jelani McCoy played extended minutes. Each played a big role in
the reserves shooting 18-for-38 and outscoring Phoenix's bench
46-32. Even so, the starters had dug a hole too deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play well as a team,'' Patterson said. ``Some nights
we come out with a lot of effort and some nights we don't. I don't
know what it is.''

LAPD SCANDAL COST MAY BE COLOSSAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH   AND BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The financial fallout of the LAPD Rampart scandal
will far exceed the city's preliminary, ``conservative'' estimate
of $125 million, according to interviews and documents obtained by
the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   At least 15 people who were arrested, detained or allegedly
abused by anti-gang officers from the Rampart Division already have
filed civil lawsuits against the city seeking hundreds of millions
of dollars in damages.
</P>
<P>
   At least 99 defendants whose rights were violated by former
Officer Rafael Perez, the key figure in the scandal, have been
identified by police, and the number of victims is widely expected
to reach at least 200, possibly 300 _ potentially escalating the
cost of the scandal and threatening many city services for years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks, dozens of lawsuits that are now being drafted
will be filed, according to private attorneys representing the
plaintiffs. And many others are likely as the investigation
expands.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the police corruption task force, who asked
not to be named, conceded the official $125 million estimate given
privately to the City Council last week is ``based upon speculation
that was based upon speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   The number is ``low'' and ``conservative,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Another high-ranking source said the estimate offered to the
council covers only potential damages for cases investigators have
looked at during their limited review.
</P>
<P>
   To calculate the preliminary liability, city attorneys have had
to rely on oral presentations and a list of 99 defendants in 57
tainted cases that was released Jan. 26 by Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't have a full picture,'' the source said, adding
the real bill will be ``overwhelming and daunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Deputy City Attorney Timothy B. McOsker would not confirm
any figures that have been reported. But he added: ``Any exposure
projections we'd share with (the council) would be based on facts
we know or can infer.''
</P>
<P>
   LAPD Cmdr. Dave Kalish said it's premature to come to any
conclusions about the final liability bill facing the city. Police
are cooperating fully with city attorneys, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the pending civil lawsuits include class-action
clauses that call for the court to notify yet unidentified victims
of the police thuggery. The cases estimate the universe of victims
at 4,000 people, but note the number could be larger.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights attorney Steve Yagman, who has filed five of the
civil cases against the city, said if the city is relying on risk
assessments associated with the cases identified so far by Parks,
it is deluding itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the council had a realistic assessment, it would be so
frightening to council members. They'd have nightmares, and who
wants to have nightmares? They can be lulled into complacency by
ignoring reality. That's what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Yagman has a list of more than 12,000 cases involving Rampart
officers who have been associated with other tainted cases. He said
the extent of the city's liability won't be known until the
District Attorney's Office and Public Defender's Office release
files needed by plaintiffs' attorneys seeking civil damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the apocalypse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The civil actions already filed charge that the unchecked police
corruption described to investigators by dirty-cop-turned-informant
Perez was not unusual, but typical of a larger policy, pattern and
practice by the city and police against primarily young Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   This was not about protecting the innocent, the cases charge.
This was about terrorizing people and inflicting an illegal,
vigilante-style justice on those considered guilty by sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scale of this is unprecedented,'' said Jody David Armour,
a nationally recognized criminal law and tort expert and a
professor at the University of Southern California Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Armour and several civil rights experts said it is certain that
the legal assault against the city will intensify as investigators
overturn more bogus convictions and Perez identifies additional
corrupt cops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anything in recent memory that compares with
this in terms of the substantial liability facing the city. The
$125 million estimate, a sizable sum, is not an exaggeration. It's
conservative,'' Armour said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have several city employees, police officers, who have
engaged in conduct that has wrongfully deprived a still unknown
number of citizens of their rights and freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits cast Rampart's paramilitary CRASH _ Community
Resources Against Street Hoodlums _ unit as a vicious gang.
</P>
<P>
   The civil actions accuse the officers of brutality, unjustified
shootings, racial profiling, excessive force, assaults,
intimidation, illegal search and seizures, torture, perjury,
falsification of evidence, and the filing of false police reports.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits also take aim at the city's ability to properly
train its police and attack the LAPD's infamous ``code of silence''
_ a misplaced loyalty system whereby cops who swore to uphold the
law stand by as their fellow officers maliciously break the law and
shame the city.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason that this is ignored and swept under the rug is
most of the actions are taken against people who are not model
citizens,'' said Connie Rice, a Los Angeles-based civil rights
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've given these cops a license to kill, a license to lie, a
license to fabricate evidence because we've asked them to do an
impossible job and contain of certain group of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we mount a war on drugs and tell the cops we have to win
this war even though it's not winable. We create a CRASH unit to
control hoodlums and the cops end up acting like the people they
are supposed to be controlling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cops really feel abused. That's why they look the other
way and act like cowboys. There is a wink and a nod because
politicians and voters don't care about how the problem is being
solved.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs who allege being abused by Rampart officers are
seeking damages for violations of their civil rights, as well as
emotional distress, medical bills, negligence, and other fees.
</P>
<P>
   Some civil actions call for the abolishment of the Rampart CRASH
Unit and accuse the anti-gang officers of running a racketeering
enterprise condoned by top officials. Several of the lawsuits seek
more than $200 million alone.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD's investigation into corruption at the Rampart Division
began last year when Perez agreed to turn over evidence to reduce
his sentence for stealing cocaine from an evidence room. He pleaded
guilty to the theft last September.
</P>
<P>
   Perez told investigators that from 1995-98, he routinely framed
innocent people, falsified documents, and committed perjury in
court to send his victims to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Most egregiously, Perez implicated himself and his former
partner Nino Durden in the shooting of an unarmed 19-year-old man.
After firing several bullets into Javier Francisco Ovando, Perez
said he and Durden planted a gun on Ovando and then testified in
court that he had attacked them.
</P>
<P>
   Ovando maintains he was handcuffed and then shot point blank in
the head by Perez. He was released from prison last September after
serving three years of a 23-year sentence. Late last year, he, his
2-year-old daughter, and her mother filed civil lawsuits against
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Among the potential costs not included in the city's preliminary
liability estimates are indirect costs associated with other cases
that may now be valued higher in the context of Rampart and cases
involving former Rampart officers now assigned elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The City Attorney's Office asked the council late last week to
allow it to hire an additional six attorneys and 10 administrators
to work on different aspects of the Rampart cases.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are expected to ask that convictions in up to three
dozen more cases be set aside during the next few weeks, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Schroeder, associate director of the American Civil
Liberties Union of Southern California, said verbal and written
complaints received and reviewed by the ACLU indicate the police
corruption scandal and city's liability could go well beyond
Rampart.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The task force investigators) have acted in secret. There has
been no good civilian oversight, no independent review,'' Schroeder
said. ``The police cannot police themselves.''

ANOTHER AWFUL NIGHT FOR CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _In an event that fetched memories of the ``down
with disco'' demolition, the scariest records in the NBA collided
Sunday at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hellish records that can't be fully depreciated until they're
spun backward.
</P>
<P>
   And when the warping was finished, the Chicago Bulls had
improved to a still-NBA-worst 10-35 by whipping the Clippers
(11-35), 100-90, before 12,973.
</P>
<P>
   Interim head coach Jim Todd's honeymoon record is love-2. The
squad's broken record includes 18 losses in the last 20 dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so bitter,'' Clipper rookie Lamar Odom said when
quadruple-teamed by reporters. ``I don't want to say anything. I'd
be a bad interview.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right.
</P>
<P>
   No problem; we still had Maurice Taylor, the team's go-to
interview and game-high scorer (23 points). Taylor was reading the
final stat sheet when the press arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same thing as everyone saw,'' Taylor said when asked what the
numbers suggested. ``An ass-kicking.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof: The beata-Bulls made 54 percent of their field-goal
attempts. After his team coughed up 10 turnovers in a
Clipper-dominated (29-13) first quarter, Toni Kukoc ripped the
Clips for 11 of his 20 points in the second quarter and helped
slice the deficit to 48-45 by intermission. Chicago pounded the
home team, 27-15, in the third and coasted in.
</P>
<P>
   Another disaster clue was the Clippers' 36-24 rebounding
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   The ballpark remedy?
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a sense of urgency on the defensive end,'' Taylor
said. ``Actually, we need that sense or urgency for the game,
period. Not just one aspect of the game. But our main problem is
our defense ... we don't play any.''
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, the Clips gained valuable ground leading up
to the May 21 draft-lottery showdown with the Bulls and any other
slackers. It should be noted that Kukoc's return from injury has
helped produce a relatively amazing eight victories in 17 games.
Chicago is threatening to louse up its shot at the No. 1 selection.
</P>
<P>
   On the Clippers' ``it figures'' side, there is no monster player
primed for plucking with this year's first pick.
</P>
<P>
   Of sidebar interest was the first on-court meeting between last
year's first pick, Bulls rookie Elton Brand, and the player most
sharpies had expected to be that pick, Odom.
</P>
<P>
   Odom, who was the fourth pick, must have been sufficiently
stoked to prove the Bulls wrong, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, not really,'' Odom said. ``They picked one of my best
friends, Elton Brand.''
</P>
<P>
   So there weren't any sour grapes and the matchup provided little
competitive juice. Brand, a power forward, had 21 points on 8-of-11
shooting and 8 rebounds. Odom, a small forward, had 4 points, 2
rebounds, 26 minutes and 4 participation-killing fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Also harpooning the Clipper cause was bad karma for Eric
Murdock, who turned his left ankle and left the game for good with
8:33 remaining in round one. Troy Hudson closed for Murdock,
supplying 19 points and 8 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Clips were up, 8-5, when Murdock left, but did increase
their lead to 27-11 when Tyrone Nesby dropped a pair of free throws
with 47 seconds left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Center Michael Olowokandi had 6 field-goal attempts and 10
points in the first quarter, but finished the game with 12 points
and 11 field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either they (Bulls) did a better job of defending him,'' Todd
said, ``or we did a bad job of getting the ball to him. It was
probably a little bit of both.''
</P>
<P>
   All Todd and the Clips need to do in preparation for Wednesday's
game at Portland is work on, well, everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing for us,'' Derek Anderson (12 points) said, ``is
to start a whole new training camp.''

Russian officials say. By Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   CROATIA-POLITICS (Zagreb, Croatia) _ Croatia votes on Monday for
only its second president in a tightening race that hinges more on
personality than on policy. But after the death in December of the
autocratic Franjo Tudjman, who ruled Croatia from its independence
in 1991, voters still seem likely to go for the man who has
presented himself as least ambitious and power-hungry, the
avuncular Stipe Mesic, 65. By Steven Erlanger.

   &UR; CAMPAIGN _ (Moved in ``p'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-CAMPAIGN (Washington) _ Bill Bradley said flatly Sunday
that he must win primaries in several states on the next big day of

powerfully to hard-core Democrats who streamed to Vice President Al
Gore in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. By Richard L.
Berke.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZ-MCCAIN (Phoenix) _ There is a long history in presidential
campaigns of candidates winning their home state primaries by hefty
margins, often by more than 40 percentage points. So Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, suddenly on a roll elsewhere, should have little
to worry about when this state holds its Republican primary on
February 22, right? But the fact is, McCain is running a bit scared
at home. By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.

<P>
   ELECTRONIC-BOOKS-MEDIA (New York) _ The demand for Arthur C.
Clarke's science fiction novel about a malevolent computer named
HAL has endured for three decades, but interest was rather tepid
for the author's six-page, double-spaced essay about ``TV's
Time-Travel Future.'' So last month the British author of ``2001 _
A Space Odyssey'' plunged into the infant market for electronic
books _ ignoring the risk to his prestige. By Doreen Carvajal
</P>
<P>
   VODAFONE-MANNESMANN (Undated) _ Interviews with executives on

</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-NEWYORK (New York) _ When the first people tried to
start Internet companies in New York in the mid-'90s, they had to

</P>
<P>
   GQ-TITILLATE-MEDIA (New York) _ Bowing to pressure placed on the

drug and alcohol abuse by the NBA twice in the early 1990s, once

TECHNOLOGY CENTER TO GIVE GRADUATES TOOLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Anderson School, UCLA's graduate school of
business management, is stepping into the new Internet and
e-commerce world by establishing a center dedicated to the
technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California, Los Angeles, Center for Management
in the Information Economy will combine research and real-world
experience, making it one of only a handful of universities across
the nation with a business program focused on technology. School
officials are expected to announce the new program today.
</P>
<P>
   The center will not offer a separate degree but will be a
resource for the Anderson School's degree candidates, said Uday
Karmarkar, the center's director.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' tech leaders said UCLA is filling a need for the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has changed, technologies are changing, and at the
heart of this is information technology,'' said Rohit Shukla, chief
executive officer of the Los Angeles Regional Technology Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Technology in general is much more important to management than
it was a decade ago, said Tim Walsh, vice president, international,
at Calabasas-based video game maker THQ Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology to me represents the ability to use more tools to
solve the problems you have,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's an intranet that links your sales staff with the
home office or a new telecommunications network that works more
efficiently, managers in any industry must know how to apply
technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't have to be in a technical environment, you could
be selling cookies,'' he said. ``If someone that's aspiring to be
in management uses tools like that, it really gives you a leg up on
your competition, and I think it gives you a leg up as a manager.''
</P>
<P>
   All managers must understand how to use technology in
management, Shukla said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer relegated to MIS departments,'' he said. ``From
the perspective of the preparation of the student, it's extremely
important.''
</P>
<P>
   An additional benefit of having such a center is that it builds
a loyal base of alumni, Shukla said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Endowments are where it's at, and UCLA has been very behind
the curve on that,'' Shukla said.
</P>
<P>
   The Westwood school joins academic leaders such as the
University of California at Berkeley, Stanford University, Harvard
University and MIT in addressing the mushrooming technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   One of the center's goals is to give MBA students real-world
experience with technology. To that end, the center has programs to
place its students in start-up companies, helping them develop
workable business or marketing plans.
</P>
<P>
   Shukla said he hopes to see that type of commitment inside the
classroom as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely vital that their graduates have real-life
exposure to the trends that are pushing those companies along,''
Shukla said.
</P>
<P>
   It will be important for the Anderson School to attract
knowledgeable professionals into its classroom to explain the
industry's latest developments to the students, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changes almost every month, if not every quarter,'' Shukla
said. ``It's a dynamically changing environment. They have got to
be able to make sure that dynamism is represented in the
instructional setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Anderson School's 360 MBA candidates, 120 have a special
interest in technology, Karmarkar said. The school's graduates
typically enter one of four fields: finance, marketing, consulting
or entrepreneurial ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that Los Angeles is increasingly going to be a
competitor to Silicon Valley in terms of entrepreneurial
activity,'' he said. ``It's a surprising, almost inexplicable thing
that we don't have a Silicon Valley type of experience already.''

   The Evanescence of Inevitability
</P>
<P>
   Surprise! Sen. John McCain's 19-point victory in New Hampshire
last week rudely knocked the crown of inevitability off Gov. George
W. Bush's head.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign contributions to McCain started pouring so fast it was
as if someone had turned on a tap: $1 million in under two days.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly insurgency, that politically musky word, was in the
air. McCain's crisp message of integrity and campaign reform,
combined with his war record, attracted independent voters in
droves. They could also help him in South Carolina, where
Democrats, with no primary of their own, can vote.
</P>
<P>
   McCain boasts that he's the first Republican presidential
candidate since Ronald Reagan who appeals to Democrats, and he is
also counting on support from South Carolina's 400,000 veterans, as
well as endorsements from the popular Reps. Lindsey O. Graham and
Mark Sanford on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bush has exhibited more strength with party fat cats
than with voters. His message is fuzzy and McCain has exploited
doubts about whether Bush has the gravitas to be president.
</P>
<P>
   Still, independents won't be able to vote in most other key
primaries, so McCain faces the challenge of prying core Republican
voters away from Bush in upcoming contests. History is against him;
no insurgent has won either party's nomination in almost a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has endorsements from the party's establishment and
from Republican governors like former Gov. David Beasley of South
Carolina and Michigan's John Engler. On the Democratic side, Vice
President Al Gore's narrow New Hampshire win means he faces
protracted, expensive, multi-state combat with former Sen. Bill
Bradley. Like Bush, Gore enjoys solid backing from his party's
establishment, as well as from the Democratic base, which will be
crucial in big, early primary states like New York, Michigan and
California.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic race, too, is getting meaner. Bradley's attacks
on Gore's honesty helped sway late-deciding voters in New
Hampshire. New questions arose about Gore's past statements on
abortion. But the Democrats don't go mano-a-mano again until the
all-important March 7 primaries.

   Primary Gazing in Moscow
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Americans weren't the only ones watching the New Hampshire
primary closely. The Russian leadership, it turns out, was focusing
on it just as closely as the State Department tracks the vagaries
of Russian electoral politics these days.
</P>
<P>
   The results were only a few hours old when Russia's acting
president, Vladimir Putin, greeted Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in his Kremlin office Wednesday morning to talk about arms
control, Chechnya and other items on their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Then came some political shop talk.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who is reported to have had a 15-year career in the KGB,
noted Sen. John McCain's victory in New Hampshire and, according to
accounts afterwards, appeared to be contemplating what a McCain
presidency would mean for Russia. From Moscow's point of view, it
seems, McCain is a military man who sends a signal of a return to
the past. His top foreign policy advisers, after all, include
Jeanne Kirkpatrick, the U.N. delegate under Ronald Reagan when he
labeled the Soviet Union the ``evil empire,'' and Zbigniew
Brzezinski, another hard-liner against the Soviets as Jimmy
Carter's national security adviser. (More recently, Brzezinski has
urged a strong Western stand against the Russian campaign to subdue
Chechnya.) One participant described Putin's assessments of the
primary as ``astute'' and presented in an affable manner.

   Good News Continues For the Booming Economy
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economic expansion became the longest on record at 107
months, surpassing the 1960s boom. As if to emphasize the point,
unemployment dropped again, to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Technology played a key role in the long run of prosperity by
making businesses more efficient and workers more productive.
President Clinton said his predecessors deserved some credit, but
added that his efforts to eliminate the federal budget deficit had
been critical.
</P>
<P>
   No one got more praise than Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the
Federal Reserve, who was confirmed by the Senate for a fourth term.
All the good news, though, was too much for the Fed, which pushed
interest rates up by a quarter of a point to keep the economy from
overheating.

   Puerto Rico agreed to let the Navy resume limited training on
the island of Vieques as part of a deal that includes up to $90
million in aid if residents of Vieques vote next year to allow
exercises with live ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The residents will be asked to choose between telling the Navy
to leave in three years or allowing it to stay and conduct
live-fire training. Last April, President Clinton ordered a
moratorium on all training on Vieques following the death of a
Puerto Rican civilian guard in a bombing accident.

Warner deal _ but as proof that hard-nosed takeover tactics have
migrated far beyond Wall Street. It also shows vividly the
cross-border thinking that has taken hold in corporate Europe.

   Illinois Halts Executions
</P>
<P>
   In a decision hailed by opponents of the death penalty, Gov.
George Ryan of Illinois ordered a halt to all executions in the
state, the first such moratorium in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, a moderate Republican, said that since 1977 Illinois had
sentenced 13 men to death for crimes they did not commit, calling
it a ``shameful record of convicting innocent people and putting
them on death row.'' Nationwide, 85 people have been released from
death row since 1973 after being exonerated by new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   88 Killed in Airline Crash
</P>
<P>
   For Alaska Airlines, the crash of Flight 261 into the Pacific
Ocean near Los Angeles was a family tragedy: more than a third of
the 88 people aboard, all of whom died, had some connection to the
airline itself.
</P>
<P>
   The search for floating wreckage was grimly familiar, but even
as mourners built memorials in the sand, investigators quickly
recovered the flight voice and data recorders.
</P>
<P>
   These could help explain why the plane spiraled upside down
after the flight crew reported trouble with its rear stabilizer and
struggled in vain to keep the MD-83 aircraft aloft.

   Diallo Jury Is Chosen
</P>
<P>
   A jury of four blacks and eight whites was chosen to decide the
fate of four New York City police officers charged with the murder
of Amadou Diallo, the West African street peddler who died in a
volley of 41 bullets as he stood, unarmed, in the lobby of his
Bronx apartment building a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The trial had been moved to Albany after defense lawyers argued
that a fair trial was impossible in the Bronx, where, they said,
there is a large minority population and great hostility toward the
police. But race quickly became an issue in Albany when defense
lawyers tried to remove several black women from the jury.

a bill last year that is even tougher on debtors, and lawmakers
will now meet to try to reach a compromise that President Clinton
is willing to sign. He has said both versions now are unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   In their bill, senators also increased the minimum wage by $1
over three years to $6.15 an hour. To soften the blow for
employers, the bill includes $76 billion in tax breaks.

<P>
   PARIS _ So here I am in Darty, a huge discount appliance store,
trying to buy a dishwasher. So far, it's going really well. I am
just another customer _ more important, just another French
customer _ and the saleswoman is eager to make a sale.
</P>
<P>
   Then it happens. I am talking about installation and I need to
say that my clothes dryer is in the way. Only I stumble. I can't
remember the name for a dryer. Did I ever know it? We never had one
when I was growing up here as a child.
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, I try ``a machine that dries clothes.'' Nope,
that's not it. I see it on the woman's face. That look of
suspicion. It's all over. The fact that she got me to buy a more
expensive model makes no difference. I'm a foreigner. I'm not one
of them. Her tone changes. She is suddenly brusque. I place my
order and leave, defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, yes, I did get my dishwasher. But that's not the point. The
thing about the French is that you're either one of them or you're
not, and they don't like being fooled. And for me, who as a child
used to make merciless fun of the way my American father spoke
French, being taken as an insider is a point of pride. No matter
that I have not lived here in 35 years. Being found out as less
than French in these small daily encounters is humiliating.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of moving here last fall, helpful American
expatriates were giving us tips and offering us books on how to
survive in France. Some of the practical information was about
which bilingual schools were good. But much of the advice was about
psychological survival: How to understand the French and not have
your feelings hurt when they treat you rudely because you are a
foreigner. Which phrases you might use to get a smile when you are
trying to buy a croissant. Why you would be considered a lout if
you brought a bottle of wine to the dinner party that you were
unlikely to get invited to anyway because the French take such a
long time to make friends. Whom you should kiss on both cheeks and
at what times of the day.
</P>
<P>
   I found all this very amusing. My mother is French. French was
my first language. I have relatives in Nice. I do not find the
French so mysterious. But we moved back to America when I was 8
years old and there are lots of gaps in my knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I know I can't play on the grass in the Luxembourg Gardens
_ that hasn't changed. And I know you have to pay for both the
beach chair and the umbrella and maybe even the mattress by the
pool. But I stood dumbfounded the first time I went into a
supermarket and realized that I needed to pay a 10 franc deposit to
push a  &UR; chariot &LR;  up and down the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I almost envy the American with a thick accent. It is
clear who he is. Instead, I lead an odd life of constantly being
discovered as a fake or treated like a moron. Perhaps this is worse
in Paris, where there is the usual big-city impatience. But you
find it all over. Who is this idiot who obviously speaks French but
has asked me for a booklet for her subway pass, when everyone knows
it's called a case? What is the matter with this middle-aged woman
that she would come into a curtain store to ask for curtain hooks,
when everyone knows they are sold at the Prisunic five-and-dime?
Isn't she far too old to be just discovering that fitted sheets for
twin beds come in three different sizes here?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the stuff written in those how-to-survive-France books
seems pretty ludicrous. If you believe it all, you would never want
to meet a French person, let alone gain acceptance. One guide says
the French never use bathrooms outside their homes and you
shouldn't ask to use their bathroom when you visit them.
</P>
<P>
   That's ridiculous. Who are all those people who are always in
the restaurant bathrooms when I want to use them? The French half
of me can't help but be partly offended. What would my aunt say to
such nonsense?
</P>
<P>
   Here is another one: the French don't waste smiles. Americans
walk down the street smiling, willy-nilly. But not the French. They
must have a reason, something must amuse them before they grin. I
test this one day. Smiles all over the place. Although there may be
some truth to it because I tried a smile on one of the guards in my
office building, and now he practically falls off his chair trying
to greet me every time I come in.
</P>
<P>
   But I have to agree that the French are not wild about
strangers. Some of the books point out that the French have been
invaded more times than anyone can count. Tourism is surely a form
of invasion, too. How many times have I sat with my relatives in
Nice watching some American tourist complaining that the French
version of a grilled cheese sandwich, a croque monsieur, isn't
toasted on the bottom. Or asking for cold milk with coffee,
something incomprehensible to the French.
</P>
<P>
   How we have laughed. Let them go back to their bologna
sandwiches, or better yet those chalky things they call
marshmallows, we have joked. Nowadays, however, I am often on the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's not the basic exchanges but the follow-up
questions that are my demise. I wanted my hair cut and highlighted,
for example, and called for an appointment. No problem, until the
receptionist asked me what kind of highlights. I caved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm American and I don't understand what you just said,'' I
said. The aggravation on the other side of the line was total.
``Never mind,'' she snapped. ``Just come in.''
</P>
<P>
   I know there is a whole part of France that I can not have just
yet because I don't know how things are done here. The butcher
shops, for instance. I don't even know what half the stuff hanging
from the ceiling is. I just know I'm headed for humiliation if I go
in there. So I don't, not yet. But I remember visiting my
grandmother when I was a teen-ager and how she would insist that I
go grocery shopping with her. Mr. Laiolo, the butcher, had known
the family for years. He would play his part. Oh, she is so big, he
would say. She is so beautiful. And my grandmother, who had been
widowed for years by then, would beam.
</P>
<P>
   It is nice when I am not discovered. When I'm taken for French,
I have all sorts of kindnesses to recount. The car rental agent who
gave me a big car at a discount and wished me ``bon courage''
because she knew I was going to a furniture discount store
notorious for crowds and long lines. The saleswoman who would not
sell me shoes with a slight flaw in them, even though I had not
noticed it. And the many waiters who have tried to deter me from
what they considered terrible choices.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the French even seem to sympathize with the burden of
dual nationality. After hearing me translate what my two daughters
wanted for lunch, one waiter smiled down at us and tsked over the
situation. ``Ah,'' he said. ``I see, a French mother with two
American children.''
</P>
<P>
   The children are catching on fast, though. The other day, they
insisted that I speak French to them as we walked down the street
so nobody would know they did not entirely belong here.

FLYING BLIND IN A DANGEROUS WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Consider the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ The CIA says there is so much nuclear black market activity in
the former Soviet Union that the agency cannot rule out the
possibility that Iran has acquired enough fissile material for a
nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   _ Satellite photographs show that in the past year Iraq has
rebuilt the Al Taji missile complex north of Baghdad and many other
military sites damaged by U.S. air strikes in late 1998. Officials
admit, however, that they don't know whether Iraq has reconstituted
its chemical and biological weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Clinton administration acknowledges that aid money to
Russia's civilian germ research may have been secretly diverted to
Biopreparat, a shadowy organization that once directed the Soviet
Union's germ warfare program.
</P>
<P>
   These developments, worrisome enough by themselves, have led
experts to a larger and still more troubling concern that U.S.
intelligence services may be incapable of monitoring the
proliferation of chemical, biological, and nuclear expertise and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony on Capitol Hill last week by George J. Tenet, the
director of central intelligence, was hardly reassuring. Now, more
than ever before, he glumly warned members of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence, ``we risk substantial surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   While the CIA and U.S. law enforcement officials have thwarted
plots by terrorist groups against U.S. targets in the past, Tenet
bluntly told the senators, ``I must be frank in saying that this
has only succeeded in buying time against an increasingly dangerous
threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie H. Gelb, president of the Council on Foreign Relations
and a former journalist and senior government official, agreed with
Tenet, noting that terrorists and rogue states were making it
harder for anyone to monitor them. ``People now commercially
encrypt sensitive communication and don't talk over cell phones,''
he said. Countries bury telephone lines and rely less on microwave
transmissions. ``A lot of what NSA used to get simply isn't
gettable now,'' Gelb said, referring to the National Security
Administration. ``And we don't know how to reacquire it.''
</P>
<P>
   The spread of so-called dual-use technology _ guidance and
control equipment, electronic test equipment and speciality
materials _ all of which can be used for legitimate and
illegitimate purposes, has also complicated matters. For example,
there is ``substantial overlap,'' says Tenet, between what is
needed to make a vaccine and a biological warfare agent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another area of concern is that the pool of skilled weapons
technicians is larger than ever, administration officials say. The
end of the Soviet germ warfare program alone left tens of thousands
of former employees in desperate financial straits, and tracking
their whereabouts is difficult, intelligence officials say. Iran,
for one, continues to recruit such talent with some success, U.S.
and Russian government officials agree.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Haass, the director of foreign policy studies at the
Brookings Institution and a former member of the Bush
administration, adds that proliferators are extremely ``tough
targets.'' Iraq's unconventional weapons programs, he said, ``were
in every sense of the word hidden.''
</P>
<P>
   Gathering information in countries with which the United States
lacks formal relations is also challenging. ``We have very few
people going in and out who can tell us things,'' Haass says. He
adds that American intelligence is now paying for ``years of
underinvesting in `humint,' '' _ intelligence collected by people
rather than by satellites or monitoring devices.
</P>
<P>
   Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former CIA analyst and writer, says, ``The
CIA's clandestine service, a highly bureaucratic, sclerotic
institution that still remains most at home on the diplomatic
cocktail circuit overseas, is structurally, culturally, and
linguistically ill-prepared to undertake the long-term,
unconventional work needed to place an agent inside a critical
weapons facility.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the agency came to depend on ``walk-ins'' who
freely come to the agency. But exceptional walk-ins _ ``the sources
of our finest espionage'' _ are rare, Gerecht said, ``which is why
our human intelligence on hostile weapons-of-mass-destruction
programs has always been, and probably will remain, poor if not
nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also blame the agency for withholding information
it does have. When two government agencies made grants between 1995
and 1997 that benefited Biopreparat, the Russian joint stock
company that the United States fears may still be tied to covert
Russian germ research, officials responsible for the grants said
they had not known that Biopreparat was under a cloud. But the CIA
had known about that entity ever since the defection of a key
Russian scientist in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, too, has helped to reduce America's intelligence
effectiveness. Over the past two years it cut nearly by half
funding for Russian scientists, whom the administration says have
provided invaluable insights into the Soviet Union's germ warfare
programs and the current status of those once involved in it.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the Clinton administration blameless. Senior officials,
citing their need for better information to assess whether Iraq is
reconstituting its unconventional weapons programs, in January
supported a new inspection program created by the U.N. Security
Council. But Daniel Byman, a policy analyst at the Rand Corp.,
writes in the latest issue of the journal ``Foreign Affairs'' that
the United Nations' system is so enfeebled that it will probably do
more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors themselves will most likely be an inexperienced
group, deprived of Security Council backing and a strong director,
Byman wrote. As such, the inspection agency will in all probability
find ``only what Saddam wanted them to.''
</P>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein could then claim Iraq is certifiably free of
weapons of mass destruction, which could ultimately cause sanctions
against his country to be lifted. At that point he could easily
import whatever he needed to rebuild his arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's acceptance of the impotent inspection
regime, meanwhile, is a timely reminder that the United States
usually comes to depend most upon the nighttime world of spies and
spying only after failing to pursue effective policies in broad
daylight.

   Saddam Hussein could then claim Iraq is certifiably free of
weapons of mass destruction, which could ultimately cause sanctions
against his country to be lifted. At that point he could easily
import whatever he needed to rebuild his arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's acceptance of the impotent inspection
regime, meanwhile, is a timely reminder that the United States
usually comes to depend most upon the nighttime world of spies and
spying only after failing to pursue effective policies in broad
daylight.

NOW WE CAN ENGINEER NATURE. BUT SHOULD WE?

   Just as 130 nations were meeting in Montreal recently to forge
the first global treaty regulating genetically modified crops,
Frito-Lay Inc. was telling its farmers in the United States not to
grow genetically engineered corn for use in Doritos chips and other
snacks. The problem, the company said, was not a risk to health
from the corn but a risk that consumers wouldn't want it.
</P>
<P>
   These two events reflect the unease with which genetically
engineered foods have been received. Science has reached what might
be the takeoff stage for a new green revolution. But it may instead
go the way of nuclear power _ a once-promising technology largely
rejected by society.
</P>
<P>
   The potential benefits of genetic engineering are huge. The use
of cotton with a gene allowing it to make its own pesticide has
already led to a reduction in the amount of chemical pesticides
being sprayed in fields. Bio-engineered plants might soon be used
to produce plastics and other substances now made using diminishing
supplies of petroleum in dangerous, polluting petrochemical plants.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, biotechnology could also make food healthier _
think tomatoes with cancer-fighting substances and cooking oils
lower in fats. And for the developing world it could offer the
promise of increased food output and of vaccines incorporated into
bananas rather than syringes, making them cheaper and easier to
deliver. Swiss researchers have already used genetic engineering to
develop a strain of rice with vitamin A, a lack of which now causes
millions of cases of blindness.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is no evidence that any of the genetically
engineered foods now on the market have harmed anyone, or have much
of an impact on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   But such engineering seems to conjure up images of mad
scientists playing God. Opponents have been quick to use the label
``Frankenfoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of biotechnology argue that mankind has long been
manipulating genes through conventional plant and animal breeding.
If anything, they say, genetic engineering is more precise because
it introduces just one or two known genes into a plant. With
conventional breeding, thousands of unknown genes are transferred
in order to get the one with the desired trait.
</P>
<P>
   But cross-breeding works only between plants or animals of the
same or closely related species. Genetic engineering allows species
barriers to be crossed in a new way _ to put bacterial genes in
corn or fish genes in tomatoes. Even biotechnology supporters
concede that genetic tinkering can have unanticipated results. It
is possible that unexpected toxins or allergens can be introduced
into crops through genetic engineering, though the Food and Drug
Administration insists all modified crops are now screened for
adequately.
</P>
<P>
   There is more evidence to support the possibility of negative
effects on the environment. A plant with a gene to fight off
insects might spread that gene through pollination, creating, say,
weeds that can no longer be controlled. Genetically improved fish
might drive native species to extinction. And a study has shown
that genetically altered corn plants can harm monarch butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   What is particularly worrisome is that because biological
systems reproduce, such genetic pollution cannot be cleaned up like
a chemical spill or recalled like a defective automobile. Once the
gene is out of the bottle, so to speak, it cannot be put back in.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, where opposition to genetically modified foods has
been strongest, other factors are also at play. There have been
food scares unconnected with genetic engineering, such as mad cow
disease and dioxin-contaminated chickens, which have contributed to
unease. It is also true that consumers do not yet see the benefits
of genetic modification. The products now out, such as
insect-resistant corn and Roundup Ready soybeans, which are
impervious to Monsanto's Roundup herbicide, are meant to help
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, while the developing world could benefit greatly from
a vitamin-A rice or plants that can tolerate drought, the current
products are seen as aimed mainly at wealthy farmers in developed
countries. ``Roundup Ready _ that doesn't solve any problems except
for the shareholders of Monsanto,'' said Dr. Ossama El-Tayeb, a
delegate from Egypt at the Montreal treaty talks.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives at bio-engineered seed companies say their
mistake was to regard the farmer and not the consumer as the
customer. With no apparent benefit, it is easy to shun even a
minuscule risk, just to be safe. That puts the industry in a
position of having to prove absolute safety, which is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, some food and beverage companies like Frito-Lay,
Seagram and Gerber are forgoing genetically modified crops so as
not to scare off consumers. So what started as protests from a tiny
group of activists has become a trend that is forcing farmers and
grain processors to segregate non-modified from modified grains.
This could ease the way toward labeling foods containing
genetically modified organisms, something the food industry fears
would be tantamount to a skull and crossbones.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is very early days in the bio-engineering era, and
genetically altered foods may well succeed. After all, society
accepts drugs made by putting human genes in hamster cells, even
though this crosses species barriers as much as agricultural
biotechnology does. The analogy is not perfect; drugs are targeted
to particular people who are willing to bear the risks, and indeed
may have no choice. Food, on the other hand, is sold to the whole
populations, which have alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, drugs are tested in advance for safety and efficacy
more thoroughly than food is. Nonetheless, it seems clear that the
way to acceptance of genetically engineered foods lies through the
creation of regulations that the public trusts and the delivery of
benefits the consumer sees and tastes.

THE WWF IS READY TO RUMBLE WITH THE NFL

   There's a foreign object in the ring!
</P>
<P>
   Just days after its Super Bowl-winning coach (Dick Vermeil)
retired and its second player in two months (Ray Lewis) was
arrested on murder charges, the National Football League now has to
grapple with this: The renegade World Wrestling Federation is
starting its own football circuit next February.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the barbarous, spandexed, testosterone-pickled theater of
professional wrestling is invading the barbarous, spandexed,
testosterone-pickled theater of professional football. The WWF
gleefully unveiled its plans for the XFL _ the X stands for
``xciting,'' ``xplosive'' and ``xtreme,'' naturally _ at a New York
press conference with onlookers grudgingly nodding that this thing
could actually work.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the WWF knows more about lowest common denominators
than Euclid.
</P>
<P>
   Having built its billion-dollar programming and merchandising
empire on sating fans' basest desires with cartoonish villains and
blood-soaked steel-cage matches, the WWF hopes to apply similar
rawness to the XFL.
</P>
<P>
   Outcomes will not be scripted, but looser rules will allow a
return to the finest traditions of ``smash-mouth football,'' as the
pugnacious WWF mastermind Vince McMahon called it. Meanwhile,
microphones and cameras will pummel fans into sensorial ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Fair catches will be discouraged so more runners get creamed on
punt returns. No in-the-grasp rule will protect ``lilly-white
quarterbacks,'' McMahon vowed. He didn't specify just what felony a
player will have to commit to get called for a personal foul,
merely saying, ``This will not be a league for pantywaists or
sissies.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameras inside helmets will let viewers experience huddles and
play-calling up close, and perhaps enjoy the vicarious pleasure of
being run over by a huge person wearing armor. Microphones will
deliver coaches' sideline diatribes live.
</P>
<P>
   At least one WWF fan is looking forward to the XFL: Bob
Kuberski, a 6-foot-4, 300-pound Philadelphian who happens to play
defensive tackle for the NFL's New England Patriots. ``I think it's
a good idea,'' Kuberski said. ``Go out there, cut it loose, see
what kind of interesting twists they can put on the game. It'll be
real physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about whether the WWF can run a legitimate football
league only widened McMahon's Cheshire-cat grin. ``May I never be
thought of as legit,'' he sighed. ``Anything but that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether hyped-up opponents will be encouraged to stage screaming
matches outside locker rooms remains to be seen. But asked later
whom he meant with his ``sissies'' remark, McMahon barked, ``I
think I'm looking at one now.''
</P>
<P>
   You go, Vince!

<TEXT>
<P>
   In late December, a small Silicon Valley law firm, tired of
losing lawyers to Internet start-ups, raised salaries for its
associates by a remarkable 40 percent. Within a few weeks, larger
firms in the Bay Area _ including some with offices in New York _
matched the raises. By last week, many prestigious New York firms
felt compelled to follow suit and pay first-year lawyers as much as
$140,000 a year before bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Stoking the fire was a group of chat boards on Yahoo!
(www.clubs.yahoo.com) known as Greedy Associates where lawyers
compare salary data. The boards include Unhappy Rich Associates
(dubbed ``A place to talk about golden handcuffs . . .''), Greedy
Kansas City (``Midwesterners love money as much as anyone'') and
Greedy New York Associates (``The greediest of all'').
</P>
<P>
   ``The associate grapevine is extraordinary,'' said Tower C. Snow
Jr., chairman of San Francisco-based Brobeck, Phleger &AMP; Harrison,
who said that ``without question'' the Greedy Associates sites have
played a role in the speed of the recent raises.
</P>
<P>
   The chat boards also give associates, disguised by nicknames
like Lady Greediva, a place to gripe about firms that pay new
lawyers only $100,000 a year and a forum to engage in often vulgar
banter _ none of it, of course, during billing hours.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from recent postings follow.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In late January, before the pay increases
became widespread, one exchange upbraided a New York firm that
planned to give raises only to its Bay Area offices. (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   A few associates have in fact given notice, and many more are
complaining in the most vivid of terms . . . A very significant
portion of the lumpenassociates (numbering several dozen) are
preparing, in concert, to demand a matching raise at that meeting .
. . There has even been talk of a work stoppage. . .
</P>
<P>
   Shoot, I think most of NYC associates should have a sympathy
work stoppage with them (it works for French truckers, after all) _
it is outrageous. . . . It is clear that the only solution to
restore order is a rapid apology and matching-or-better raise.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Not surprisingly, the general feeling is
that the New York firms had no excuse not to match. (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Do we demand that all NY firms pay up to the ((Silicon Valley))
standard? Do we cut the NY firms with ((per-partner profits)) lower
than $500,000 a little bit of a break? I would note, in passing,
that Burger King doesn't pay its flippers any less just because it
is less profitable than McDonalds.
</P>
<P>
   I like my job _ no, really _ but that lake house and the new
Yukon that I could have right now are constant temptations.
</P>
<P>
   My 2 cents (all I can afford, as my firm has yet to raise): . .
. I don't expect firms pulling in less than 750k to be able to take
the monstrous cuts to partner profits (or rather, I don't expect
them to choose to).
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Firms in other cities _ including Los
Angeles and Washington _ had yet to take action last week, and
lawyers there were none too happy. Even some New Yorkers started to
wonder how good they had it. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   If BIGLAW DC does not react with major raises, I guarantee you
that BIGLAW DC will face a brain drain. Come BIGLAW DC!!!!!!!! SHOW
ME THE MONEY OR I'LL SHOW MYSELF THE DOOR!!! Do any BIGLAW DC
partners really think that we associates (or at least 99 percent of
us) went to big firms for any other reason but the money?
</P>
<P>
   there is no point in being a dc attorney anymore.
</P>
<P>
   jobs, money, and prestige are all elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   I feel sorry for anyone too old to get out.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone else think that all these raises being announced by
NY firms are wishy-washy? . . . Telling me that you will pay me a
bonus is no good. I want to know what it will be.
</P>
<P>
   Top law students, like myself, in the Northeast are looking
Westward. NYC, DC and Boston firms are too cheap for our blood. We
feel bad for the East Coast recruiters that will be sitting in
empty rooms come next fall.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Occasionally, the more creative young
attorneys weigh in with new renditions of popular songs, like Bob
Dylan's ``The Times They Are A-Changin.''(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Come managing partners
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the land
</P>
<P>
   And don't criticize
</P>
<P>
   What you can't understand
</P>
<P>
   Your fungible units
</P>
<P>
   Are beyond your command
</P>
<P>
   Your old lockstep is
</P>
<P>
   Rapidly agin'.
</P>
<P>
   Please announce the new one
</P>
<P>
   and unclench your cash hand
</P>
<P>
   For the times they are a-changin'.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Once in while, when the blood stops
boiling, the musing becomes a tad more philosophical. (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   With an almost Hegelian aura of historical inevitability, the
bidding wars continue.
</P>
<P>
   We may pride ourselves on greediness, but let's not forget that
the partners are all former associates who have now seized the
brass ring. They put our greediness to shame.

   In late December, a small Silicon Valley law firm, tired of
losing lawyers to Internet start-ups, raised salaries for its
associates by a remarkable 40 percent. Within a few weeks, larger
firms in the Bay Area _ including some with offices in New York _
matched the raises. By last week, many prestigious New York firms
felt compelled to follow suit and pay first-year lawyers as much as
$140,000 a year before bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Stoking the fire was a group of chat boards on Yahoo!
(www.clubs.yahoo.com) known as Greedy Associates where lawyers
compare salary data. The boards include Unhappy Rich Associates
(dubbed ``A place to talk about golden handcuffs . . .''), Greedy
Kansas City (``Midwesterners love money as much as anyone'') and
Greedy New York Associates (``The greediest of all'').
</P>
<P>
   ``The associate grapevine is extraordinary,'' said Tower C. Snow
Jr., chairman of San Francisco-based Brobeck, Phleger &AMP; Harrison,
who said that ``without question'' the Greedy Associates sites have
played a role in the speed of the recent raises.
</P>
<P>
   The chat boards also give associates, disguised by nicknames
like Lady Greediva, a place to gripe about firms that pay new
lawyers only $100,000 a year and a forum to engage in often vulgar
banter _ none of it, of course, during billing hours.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from recent postings follow.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In late January, before the pay increases
became widespread, one exchange upbraided a New York firm that
planned to give raises only to its Bay Area offices. (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   A few associates have in fact given notice, and many more are
complaining in the most vivid of terms . . . A very significant
portion of the lumpenassociates (numbering several dozen) are
preparing, in concert, to demand a matching raise at that meeting .
. . There has even been talk of a work stoppage. . .
</P>
<P>
   Shoot, I think most of NYC associates should have a sympathy
work stoppage with them (it works for French truckers, after all) _
it is outrageous. . . . It is clear that the only solution to
restore order is a rapid apology and matching-or-better raise.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Not surprisingly, the general feeling is
that the New York firms had no excuse not to match. (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Do we demand that all NY firms pay up to the ((Silicon Valley))
standard? Do we cut the NY firms with ((per-partner profits)) lower
than $500,000 a little bit of a break? I would note, in passing,
that Burger King doesn't pay its flippers any less just because it
is less profitable than McDonalds.
</P>
<P>
   I like my job _ no, really _ but that lake house and the new
Yukon that I could have right now are constant temptations.
</P>
<P>
   My 2 cents (all I can afford, as my firm has yet to raise): . .
. I don't expect firms pulling in less than 750k to be able to take
the monstrous cuts to partner profits (or rather, I don't expect
them to choose to).
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Firms in other cities _ including Los
Angeles and Washington _ had yet to take action last week, and
lawyers there were none too happy. Even some New Yorkers started to
wonder how good they had it. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   If BIGLAW DC does not react with major raises, I guarantee you
that BIGLAW DC will face a brain drain. Come BIGLAW DC!!!!!!!! SHOW
ME THE MONEY OR I'LL SHOW MYSELF THE DOOR!!! Do any BIGLAW DC
partners really think that we associates (or at least 99 percent of
us) went to big firms for any other reason but the money?
</P>
<P>
   there is no point in being a dc attorney anymore.
</P>
<P>
   jobs, money, and prestige are all elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   I feel sorry for anyone too old to get out.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone else think that all these raises being announced by
NY firms are wishy-washy? . . . Telling me that you will pay me a
bonus is no good. I want to know what it will be.
</P>
<P>
   Top law students, like myself, in the Northeast are looking
Westward. NYC, DC and Boston firms are too cheap for our blood. We
feel bad for the East Coast recruiters that will be sitting in
empty rooms come next fall.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Occasionally, the more creative young
attorneys weigh in with new renditions of popular songs, like Bob
Dylan's ``The Times They Are A-Changin.''(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Come managing partners
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the land
</P>
<P>
   And don't criticize
</P>
<P>
   What you can't understand
</P>
<P>
   Your fungible units
</P>
<P>
   Are beyond your command
</P>
<P>
   Your old lockstep is
</P>
<P>
   Rapidly agin'.
</P>
<P>
   Please announce the new one
</P>
<P>
   and unclench your cash hand
</P>
<P>
   For the times they are a-changin'.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Once in while, when the blood stops
boiling, the musing becomes a tad more philosophical. (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   With an almost Hegelian aura of historical inevitability, the
bidding wars continue.
</P>
<P>
   We may pride ourselves on greediness, but let's not forget that
the partners are all former associates who have now seized the
brass ring. They put our greediness to shame.

FORGET THE KID. THE REAL CUSTODY FIGHT IS OVER AN ISLAND

<P>
   MIAMI _ While they have yet to appear in one of those pop-psych
quizzes that offer instant analyses of your home life, here are two
questions to see if your family problems have gone from domestic
dispute to full-blown dysfunction:
</P>
<P>
   Has Fidel Castro ever rallied thousands of people to denounce
you as a kidnapper while your nephew went on network television to
say he'd like to come to your hometown and break some necks?
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever enlisted a member of Congress to bestow honorary
citizenship on your nephew's son, saying he would be better off
with you than with his father in Cuba?
</P>
<P>
   If you answered yes to either question, chances are you and your
relatives suffer from a peculiar form of dysfunction that has
befallen the Gonzalez family of Cuba and Miami. And not just them.
</P>
<P>
   This syndrome involves a breakdown in an extended family that
includes all of Cuba and about half of Miami, not to mention much
of the political establishments in Washington and Havana. In fact,
it has come to mirror all the bitter political divisions and
dysfunction of the last four decades in the last confrontation of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The facts are familiar: Since November, the Gonzalez clans of
Miami, Florida and Cardenas, Cuba, have been waging a loud custody
battle over Elian Gonzalez and whether he should stay in Miami or
be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The father has said he would like to come to Miami with a rifle,
as well as ``break the necks'' of his relatives' political allies.
The relatives have crowed that Elian was ``more on this side than
on that side'' after his recent, brief meeting with his two
grandmothers, who returned to Cuba without him. Both sides mutter
about each other's failings, tossing out epithets ranging from
``criminal'' to ``Communist.''
</P>
<P>
   But how different is that from the potshots traded over the
years between Miami's exiles, Cuba's Communists, their supporters
on both sides and, for that matter, between the various bickering
camps within the Cuban exile community? The unraveling of Elian's
family ties is just the latest example of a bigger but just as
tortured relationship between the exile community and Cuba, and
between Washington and Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the emotions seen in the custody fight anything new. As
in family matters, denunciation rather than reconciliation is often
the goal in most exchanges between the Castro regime and its sworn
enemies in Miami. Castro has always manipulated such animosities
for political advantage. And with the political power that southern
Florida exerts, the tit-for-tat response of the Cuban exiles spills
over into American policy. Often reason loses out.
</P>
<P>
   Take one example: Several years ago, Cuba shot down exile planes
that had invaded its airspace while searching for rafters. The
Clinton administration, which had wanted to lower tensions, found
itself instead tightening America's trade embargo, which Castro
uses as an excuse for his excesses. The reason: the most vocal
Cubans here support the embargo as a weapon against Castro, even
though the people harmed most, it seems, are their own relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The animosity filters down into areas that would be apolitical
anywhere else. A few weeks ago, the organizers of the Latin Grammy
Awards bolted to California after their plans to stage the event in
South Florida fell through because of worries that the presence of
some wrinkled musicians from Cuba might spark protests. In past
years, exhibitions featuring Cuban artists have prompted bomb
threats from people intent on keeping America safe from offending
oils.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the issue at hand, the response is the same:
Name-calling replaces conversation. Fear that the other side may
get satisfaction blocks any chance to solve a problem. Each side
digs in its heels and hurls verbal thunderbolts. Communist!
Imperialist! Traitor!
</P>
<P>
   These vitriolic accusations have a ring very familiar to anyone
who has been listening in on the Gonzalez case. Or, for that
matter, to what happens every day in Family Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the family's laundry is aired in family cases,'' said
Bernard Perlmutter, the director of the Children and Youth Law
Clinic at the University of Miami. ``We have grandparents and
uncles who stand before the judge and they whine and they accuse
and they complain and they defend. The kinds of families that come
before family court judges are families that have broken down and
are almost irremediably dysfunctional. That's what we see playing
out on the world stage in Elian's case.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in more obscure custody cases, relatives often resort to
lawsuits or outright abduction. They try to sway the child with
gifts, or sour him on the other parent with whispered, disparaging
remarks. In a way, the child becomes a bystander in these fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``When adults fight with each other, they tend to forget how to
insulate the child from it and maintain a relationship with the
child while fighting,'' said Albert J. Solnit, the former director
of the Yale Child Study Center. ``In custody conflicts you often
see people fighting about getting even with each other and using
the child as the pawn.''
</P>
<P>
   In Elian's case, all this seems to have happened, and on an epic
scale.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-CUBA-U.S.-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; MIAMI: epic scale. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The demand that the boy be allowed to stay in Miami ``strikes to
the heart of what this community is about, that exile is a good
thing,'' said Lisandro Perez, the director of the Cuban Research
Institute at Florida International University. ``The early Russians
who were exiled by the Bolsheviks saw exile as the worst that could
happen. Cubans do not see it that way. They almost demand the
people become exiles.''
</P>
<P>
   But those demands have been met with equally loud, if more
orchestrated, responses in Havana, where the government has seized
the case to revive flagging revolutionary sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Even neighbors in Elian's hometown, while feeling for the
family, speak of the custody case as a showdown between capitalists
and Communists. ``The world knows that if a country is powerful
economically it is because it has been exploiting underdeveloped
countries,'' said Agustin Serrano. ``If those poor countries try to
protest and claim what is theirs, must they succumb? Must they die?
That is the case of Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian _ remember him? Solnit said the longer Elian is away from
his father, the more attached he will become to his Miami
relatives, making it all the more difficult to resume a normal
relationship with him. ``No country is perfect,'' Solnit said. ``I
prefer to live here. But I don't know if that makes much sense to a
child whose main country is really his parents.''
</P>
<P>
   That is pretty much the case the Clinton administration and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service have argued as a basis for
returning Elian to Cuba. But even they are part of a larger
struggle, and with the courts, Congress and Castro all involved, a
meeting of minds seems unlikely for now. Perhaps, Perlmutter
suggested, it is time for a third party to step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way of working out family problems is to rely on
alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation or
referring the family to counseling,'' he said. ``But I don't know
how you are going to psychoanalyze the Cuban family in this case
and mediate 40 years of enmity and anger that is so deep rooted.''

GAUGING MEDICAL MISADVENTURE: FIRST, COMMIT NO CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An obstetrician here lost his license last week for
carving his initials into the belly of a patient after he delivered
her first child.
</P>
<P>
   The incident and the actions taken afterward have raised ethical
questions about the responsibilities of American hospitals and
legal ones about when doctors should face criminal prosecution, and
not just malpractice suits.
</P>
<P>
   When Dr. Allan Zarkin cut his initials into Dr. Liana Gedz,
after her Caesarean section at Beth Israel Medical Center last
September, he set off an institutional chain of events: Beth Israel
promptly forced Zarkin, 61, to resign and reported him to the state
Health Department weeks later, citing ``grossly inappropriate
conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   But the language raised no red flags with the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department began an investigation, suspending Zarkin
three months later. During that time, the doctor worked as medical
director at a Queens abortion and prenatal clinic where witnesses
said he botched several procedures. Beth Israel officials also met
with him to discuss setting up a nurse-midwives program at the
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Concluding its investigation last week, the state Health
Department fined Beth Israel and the abortion clinic for many
medical missteps, including not properly monitoring Zarkin.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense, Zarkin's lawyers say he has a brain impairment
similar to Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars of biomedical ethics are suggesting that Beth
Israel should have called the police after the incident, saying it
could be construed as assault and battery. Such medical violations,
experts say, fall into the gray area between negligent malpractice
and criminality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor walked outside of whatever protection the medical
arena could provide him and put himself in the common arena where
he could be held to criminal charges,'' said Rosemarie Tong, a
professor of health care ethics at the University of North
Carolina-Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, several medical practitioners have been
criminally prosecuted, including dentists who have raped female
patients. Colorado prosecutors indicted three nurses for negligent
homicide after they wrongfully administered medicine to an infant
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last 50 years, most medical injury cases have gone
to court as civil malpractice suits rather than criminal or
intentionally wrongful injury cases. In part, malpractice suits
tend to be more lucrative than the others; plaintiffs collect money
from malpractice insurance. Courts also have tended to decide that
when doctors erred, it was without malice.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, a traditionally conservative group, often shun
interference from judicial and other governmental agencies, fearing
that it would destroy trust between doctors, patients and
hospitals. They also want to maintain patient confidentiality as
well as their own autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would make a mockery of the whole medical practice, the
fact that we are now asking the police to get involved in the
practice of medicine,'' said Dr. Enayat Hakim Elahi, chief of
women's health services at Elmhurst Hospital Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, biomedical ethicists have been looking at the
accountability of medical institutions in recent years, arguing
that hospitals should take more responsibility for their employees
in an era when institutions, not individuals, mediate health care.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital has a moral obligation, not just a legal one, to act
in the best interests of society, they say.
</P>
<P>
   In the Zarkin case, Beth Israel should have done more than just
suspend the doctor and inform health care authorities, said Larry
Churchill, a professor of social medicine at the University of
North Carolina School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose this fellow was to be delivering children in the next
several days,'' he said. ``You would think, `Oh my goodness, here's
a physician who could injure more patients.'''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Beth Israel officials said that the
hospital follows standard protocol when patients have been victims
of a crime, encouraging them to press charges. But ``if the patient
is unwilling to proceed,'' they say, ``we will not contact the
police over their objection, unless we believe that there is
imminent danger to the patient or others.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gedz did not press criminal charges, she and her
husband filed a $5.5 million lawsuit in November that named Beth
Israel, Zarkin and his former practice as defendants. Last week,
Gedz testified before a grand jury called by the Manhattan district
attorney's office, which recently launched a criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liana Gedz's position on the criminal prosecution is that it's
a giant waste of taxpayers' money,'' said her lawyer, Robert
Sullivan. ``As outraged as she is about what Zarkin did, it just
doesn't make sense. He's lost his license to practice medicine,
he's in his 60s and he's certainly not a danger to the community,
as long as he's not in an operating room with a scalpel.''

GAUGING MEDICAL MISADVENTURE: FIRST, COMMIT NO CRIME

<P>
   NEW YORK _ An obstetrician here lost his license last week for
carving his initials into the belly of a patient after he delivered
her first child.
</P>
<P>
   The incident and the actions taken afterward have raised ethical
questions about the responsibilities of American hospitals and
legal ones about when doctors should face criminal prosecution, and
not just malpractice suits.
</P>
<P>
   When Dr. Allan Zarkin cut his initials into Dr. Liana Gedz,
after her Caesarean section at Beth Israel Medical Center last
September, he set off an institutional chain of events: Beth Israel
promptly forced Zarkin, 61, to resign and reported him to the state
Health Department weeks later, citing ``grossly inappropriate
conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   But the language raised no red flags with the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department began an investigation, suspending Zarkin
three months later. During that time, the doctor worked as medical
director at a Queens abortion and prenatal clinic where witnesses
said he botched several procedures. Beth Israel officials also met
with him to discuss setting up a nurse-midwives program at the
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Concluding its investigation last week, the state Health
Department fined Beth Israel and the abortion clinic for many
medical missteps, including not properly monitoring Zarkin.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense, Zarkin's lawyers say he has a brain impairment
similar to Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars of biomedical ethics are suggesting that Beth
Israel should have called the police after the incident, saying it
could be construed as assault and battery. Such medical violations,
experts say, fall into the gray area between negligent malpractice
and criminality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor walked outside of whatever protection the medical
arena could provide him and put himself in the common arena where
he could be held to criminal charges,'' said Rosemarie Tong, a
professor of health care ethics at the University of North
Carolina-Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, several medical practitioners have been
criminally prosecuted, including dentists who have raped female
patients. Colorado prosecutors indicted three nurses for negligent
homicide after they wrongfully administered medicine to an infant
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last 50 years, most medical injury cases have gone
to court as civil malpractice suits rather than criminal or
intentionally wrongful injury cases. In part, malpractice suits
tend to be more lucrative than the others; plaintiffs collect money
from malpractice insurance. Courts also have tended to decide that
when doctors erred, it was without malice.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, a traditionally conservative group, often shun
interference from judicial and other governmental agencies, fearing
that it would destroy trust between doctors, patients and
hospitals. They also want to maintain patient confidentiality as
well as their own autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would make a mockery of the whole medical practice, the
fact that we are now asking the police to get involved in the
practice of medicine,'' said Dr. Enayat Hakim Elahi, chief of
women's health services at Elmhurst Hospital Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, biomedical ethicists have been looking at the
accountability of medical institutions in recent years, arguing
that hospitals should take more responsibility for their employees
in an era when institutions, not individuals, mediate health care.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital has a moral obligation, not just a legal one, to act
in the best interests of society, they say.
</P>
<P>
   In the Zarkin case, Beth Israel should have done more than just
suspend the doctor and inform health care authorities, said Larry
Churchill, a professor of social medicine at the University of
North Carolina School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose this fellow was to be delivering children in the next
several days,'' he said. ``You would think, `Oh my goodness, here's
a physician who could injure more patients.'''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Beth Israel officials said that the
hospital follows standard protocol when patients have been victims
of a crime, encouraging them to press charges. But ``if the patient
is unwilling to proceed,'' they say, ``we will not contact the
police over their objection, unless we believe that there is
imminent danger to the patient or others.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gedz did not press criminal charges, she and her
husband filed a $5.5 million lawsuit in November that named Beth
Israel, Zarkin and his former practice as defendants. Last week,
Gedz testified before a grand jury called by the Manhattan district
attorney's office, which recently launched a criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liana Gedz's position on the criminal prosecution is that it's
a giant waste of taxpayers' money,'' said her lawyer, Robert
Sullivan. ``As outraged as she is about what Zarkin did, it just
doesn't make sense. He's lost his license to practice medicine,
he's in his 60s and he's certainly not a danger to the community,
as long as he's not in an operating room with a scalpel.''

   TOKYO _ When Japan's largest newspaper recently refused
advertising from two of the country's most popular weekly
magazines, citing their sexually explicit content, it put Mizuho
Fukushima in a quandary.
</P>
<P>
   As a leading feminist here, she found the magazines' big
displays of women posing nude or engaging in sex acts deeply
troubling. But as a member of parliament, she found the coverage of
current events by these same weeklies indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women should take the initiative in eliminating the nudity
from these magazines,'' Fukushima said. ``But I must buy them
because they always carry stories on subjects that I need to know
about, subjects that the newspapers don't cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Fukushima's statement was a stinging indictment of Japan's huge
daily press, and one shared by growing numbers of readers in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Media critics here say that Japan, virtually alone among
advanced industrialized democracies, combines a lack of aggressive,
independent-spirited daily newspapers with a lack of commercially
successful weekly newsmagazines in the vein of Time, Newsweek, The
Economist or Der Spiegel.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's daily newspapers boast the highest circulation figures
in the world. In the 19th century they were an instrument of
nation-building and patriotism, and critics say they have evolved
in the postwar period into increasingly complacent entities that
routinely leave a large host of taboo subjects _ from the imperial
family to corruption in sumo _ untouched. Most other matters,
meanwhile, are reported in uncritical, gazette-like snippets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newspapers here don't write lies, but they avoid dealing with
uncomfortable truths,'' said Tatsuya Iwase, author of ``The Reason
Newspapers are not Interesting,'' a 1999 book. ``Japan has the
hardware of the Western press, but there is no software. The inside
is empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Iwase said Japanese newspapers have little more than a formulaic
recognition of the freedom of speech and ``disregard the readers'
right to know.'' The public, he said, would eagerly welcome a new
newspaper that carried feistier reporting and better analysis, but
the system, from the government to the advertising powers, would do
everything to prevent this.
</P>
<P>
   The textbook case illustrating the reluctance of Japan's
newspapers to dig up controversial or embarrassing stories dates to
the 1970s, when a reporter for Mainichi Shimbun produced a major
scoop about the United States' compensation to residents for
damages by the U.S. military in Okinawa. Rather than being
rewarded, the reporter was accused of having had an affair with a
source and was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's racy weeklies regularly plunge into this void with
gusto, revealing scandals in government and delving into many other
subjects that the dailies deem too controversial. Recently there
have been articles asserting that the government kept the victim of
a recent nuclear accident alive just long enough to get a new
nuclear safety bill passed. Other reports have detailed heavy,
behind-the-scenes pressures to produce an heir that were placed on
the crown prince's wife prior to her recent miscarriage, and
scandals within the finance ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We present articles that the newspapers should write, but
don't touch,'' said Tetsu Suzuki, editor in chief of Shukan Gendai,
which claims a weekly circulation of 930,000.
</P>
<P>
   But what news these magazines carry is buried among nude photos,
obscene comics, serialized fiction and titillating reports. For
many readers, the result is that no matter how serious an article
is _ and a good number are based on hard fact _ it is usually taken
with a large grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
   So the weeklies seem to serve more as pressure valves for
burdensome matters in a society that shuns open disputes and
confrontational debate, than they do as journalistic crusaders for
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Hall, a historian and author of ``Cartels of the Mind,'' a
powerful recent critique of Japan's intellectual closed-mindedness,
likened the role to the Japanese salaryman's ritual of drinking
after work with superiors. Once drunk, all manner of truths may be
safely spoken _ and are sure to be forgotten, or at least played
down, the morning after.
</P>
<P>
   Even seen in this light, Japan's pulp weeklies are somewhat less
than meet the eye. ``The taboos for newspapers involve anything to
do with power: the government, the parliament, justice,'' said
Yasunari Okadome, publisher and editor of Uwasa no Shinso, a
crusading monthly that refuses major corporate advertising. ``These
matters go to the weeklies. But the weeklies cannot be totally free
either, because they are afraid of Dentsu, and of the tax
investigators.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a growing body of press criticism says Japan's
mainstream dailies suffer from their cosseted relationships with
the government and other powerful institutions, while the fat,
glossy-covered weeklies pull some of their punches out of fear of
Japan's huge and omnipresent advertising agency, Dentsu, an
integral part of a deeply conservative establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Okadome and others say, Japanese journalism is
weakened by tax codes and other legal favors that inhibit
competition among newspapers and help keep them tame. But the most
important factor, many say, is the institution of the kisha clubs _
press clubs paid for by government agencies and private industries
for the mainstream reporters that cover them.
</P>
<P>
   These are typically the places of work of the reporters, who
often simply wait for news to be handed out to them and compare
notes before writing. Hall likened them to cartels: ``They keep out
the weeklies, they keep out the foreign press and they tamp down
embarrassing matters on behalf of their sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of Japanese newspapers admit that the kisha clubs pose
problems, but argue that critics who focus on them miss the point.
Culture, they say, more than anything else, divides Western
journalism from its Japanese counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Japan lacks the adversarial, fiercely independent spirit that is
the ideal in Western journalism, according to Yoshibumi Wakamiya, a
deputy managing editor at the daily Asahi Shimbun, who declared
himself unsatisfied with his country's journalism but aware that
another country's style cannot be easily transplanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japanese society, it is difficult to hold healthy
debates,'' he said. ``The person you are debating will feel their
personality is under attack, and will hold a grudge. That is
Japanese society, and we have to get information from our
politicians. If you ask sharp questions, you may end up being
isolated, even from other journalists.''

SUDDENLY, IT'S A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
(DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also sent with `p' code) 
(bl) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fresh from his victory rally in New Hampshire, Vice
President Al Gore boarded Air Force Two around midnight Tuesday and
headed for New York City, and on to Washington and Ohio, winding up
in Los Angeles for a town hall meeting that ended at 1:20 a.m.
Later that morning, Gore mingled with voters in Venice, Calif.,
flew to Olympia, Wash., for a labor event and returned home to
Washington around 4:30 a.m. on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   His challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley, also departed New
Hampshire after midnight Tuesday for a similarly punishing schedule
that took him to New York, San Francisco and Hartford, Conn., over
the same period. It was so grueling and the plane to the West Coast
grew so chilly that the normally placid Bradley roamed the aisles
cursing about another cold dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democrats may have been on adrenaline highs after the
New Hampshire primary, but their frantic _ and virtually sleepless
_ transcontinental hopscotch was driven by genuine political
imperatives: all the states they visited _ and 11 more _ have
Democratic contests March 7, a single day of voting so colossal
that candidates are calling it Titanic Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Never before have so many electoral powerhouses held so many
contests simultaneously. Rather than a traditional primary season,
voters are now faced with what is, in essence, a campaign that
resembles a general election. And as much as critics call it a rush
to judgment, Titanic Tuesday may turn out to be not so bad for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   More voters may have more influence over who gets the Democratic
and Republican nominations than they have had in many years.
Roughly one third of the delegates to the parties' nominating
conventions will be picked, meaning that more than one third of
eligible voters will get to participate. And the compressed
calendar could resemble a European-style election: a compact but
intense primary season where many voters pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially true because, for now at least, there are
unexpectedly competitive one-on-one contests in both parties, with
Gore vying with Bradley, and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas with Sen.
John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates must project messages that appeal to a broad national
audience, losing the flexibility of tailoring appeals to regional
or ideological interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dabbling in every region of the country,'' said Rhodes
Cook, a political analyst who has examined the 2000 calendar
closely. ``It's a national sampler, so candidates have to show
strength in every part of the country. It makes this year a fairer
test than in '92 or '96, when it was New Hampshire, Ohio, South
Carolina and then a block of states in the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, because the run up to March 7 will be the closest the
United States has come to a national primary, there will be less
incentive for candidates to try to pander to particular states or
regions. When the Democratic race turned south in 1992, for
example, Paul Tsongas ridiculed Bill Clinton as a ``pander bear''
for, among other things, his narrow appeals to the elderly in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   When candidates do appeal to narrow audiences, the new national
dynamic could beam that message much farther afield. When Bush
pounded a conservative message in a speech at Bob Jones University
in South Carolina last week, Bradley roundly criticized him for
appearing at the Southern Christian bastion, which lost its
tax-exempt status in the 1970s because it prohibited interracial
dating.
</P>
<P>
   While critics of the big primary day argue that each state on
that day will be competing for attention from the candidates _ and
smaller states like Maine, Maryland and Vermont might be neglected
_ it is also true that the sheer number of contests could stir up
even greater national interest and a bigger voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a tremendous amount of attention and focus for a
short amount of time,'' said Carter Eskew, one of Gore's top
strategists, ``and that might draw people into the process. It's a
critical mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Gina Glantz, Bradley's campaign manager, said it was a struggle
trying to figure out where her candidate should spend his time.
After campaigning 49 days in New Hampshire, for instance, he now
has 30 more days to make his pitch in 16 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many places you'd like to go and there are a
limited number of days,'' Glantz said. ``But you look to do things
to spark a national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-CAMPAIGN-PRIMARIES-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: national interest.'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, the dynamics are not quite as oriented
to a national campaign because there is an important primary in
South Carolina on Feb. 19, and a pair of crucial contests three
days later in Michigan and Arizona. But Bush has, for months,
painstakingly assembled organizations in many states that vote
March 7. And McCain is hoping that the shower of national attention
he is enjoying from his landslide upset in New Hampshire will allow
him to overcome Bush's towering organizational advantages.
</P>
<P>
   For all the allure of more states participating, many prominent
Democrats and Republicans are horrified about the glut of
primaries. They argue that the sprawling nature of the contests
will put so much pressure on candidates to be in so many places at
once that their campaigns will amount to little more than 30-second
television commercials and cameo drop-ins at airport tarmacs.
</P>
<P>
   As Haley Barbour, the former chairman of the Republican Party,
put it, ``You've taken down your Christmas tree and people want you
to decide who they should vote for president. It's bad for
presidential candidates and campaigns. It's bad for the body
politic. I unsuccessfully tried to do something about it as
chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the crush of early primaries was purely
accidental: several states moved up their contests in a play for
more influence. But this time, the public may be served. The voters
of Iowa and New Hampshire played their usual role of inspecting the
candidates up close, helping winnow the field and pressing upon the
candidates the need to be responsive and listen to voters. Now that
the candidates have been introduced to the public and bloodied a
bit it is time for a far broader electorate to have its say.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a Republican, does not
see the merits. ``It's the antithesis of what happens in New
Hampshire,'' Wilson said. ``It becomes this television
extravaganza. It is exhausting for the participants, the candidates
and the public, and can produce results that were not seen by the
framers of the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Wilson sees the barrage of talking heads on television
as negative, their messages may reach more voters. Even before they
left Manchester late Tuesday night, Gore and Bradley sat for round
after round of interviews with local television stations in states
that have contests on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, the campaigns are already plotting how best to
compete. The big question, obviously, is how they divide their
precious days _ a subject about which the campaigns are cagey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhere between a closely guarded secret and a
no-brainer,'' Eskew said. ``Obviously, we're going to spend time in
New York, Ohio, California and Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, McCain's aides are trying to settle on an East
Coast-West Coast shuffle. ``There are ways to make the time zone
work for you,'' said Mike Murphy, a strategist for McCain. ``You
start on the East Coast. You move with the time zone to California,
then you red-eye back to the East Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   In this tarmac-to-tarmac campaign, there is one constituency, at
least, that can't grouse about being neglected: voters who cool
their heels in the frequent flyer lounges.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fresh from his victory rally in New Hampshire, Vice
President Al Gore boarded Air Force Two around midnight Tuesday and
headed for New York City, and on to Washington and Ohio, winding up
in Los Angeles for a town hall meeting that ended at 1:20 a.m.
Later that morning, Gore mingled with voters in Venice, Calif.,
flew to Olympia, Wash., for a labor event and returned home to
Washington around 4:30 a.m. on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   His challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley, also departed New
Hampshire after midnight Tuesday for a similarly punishing schedule
that took him to New York, San Francisco and Hartford, Conn., over
the same period. It was so grueling and the plane to the West Coast
grew so chilly that the normally placid Bradley roamed the aisles
cursing about another cold dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democrats may have been on adrenaline highs after the
New Hampshire primary, but their frantic _ and virtually sleepless
_ transcontinental hopscotch was driven by genuine political
imperatives: all the states they visited _ and 11 more _ have
Democratic contests March 7, a single day of voting so colossal
that candidates are calling it Titanic Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Never before have so many electoral powerhouses held so many
contests simultaneously. Rather than a traditional primary season,
voters are now faced with what is, in essence, a campaign that
resembles a general election. And as much as critics call it a rush
to judgment, Titanic Tuesday may turn out to be not so bad for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   More voters may have more influence over who gets the Democratic
and Republican nominations than they have had in many years.
Roughly one third of the delegates to the parties' nominating
conventions will be picked, meaning that more than one third of
eligible voters will get to participate. And the compressed
calendar could resemble a European-style election: a compact but
intense primary season where many voters pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially true because, for now at least, there are
unexpectedly competitive one-on-one contests in both parties, with
Gore vying with Bradley, and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas with Sen.
John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates must project messages that appeal to a broad national
audience, losing the flexibility of tailoring appeals to regional
or ideological interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dabbling in every region of the country,'' said Rhodes
Cook, a political analyst who has examined the 2000 calendar
closely. ``It's a national sampler, so candidates have to show
strength in every part of the country. It makes this year a fairer
test than in '92 or '96, when it was New Hampshire, Ohio, South
Carolina and then a block of states in the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, because the run up to March 7 will be the closest the
United States has come to a national primary, there will be less
incentive for candidates to try to pander to particular states or
regions. When the Democratic race turned south in 1992, for
example, Paul Tsongas ridiculed Bill Clinton as a ``pander bear''
for, among other things, his narrow appeals to the elderly in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   When candidates do appeal to narrow audiences, the new national
dynamic could beam that message much farther afield. When Bush
pounded a conservative message in a speech at Bob Jones University
in South Carolina last week, Bradley roundly criticized him for
appearing at the Southern Christian bastion, which lost its
tax-exempt status in the 1970s because it prohibited interracial
dating.
</P>
<P>
   While critics of the big primary day argue that each state on
that day will be competing for attention from the candidates _ and
smaller states like Maine, Maryland and Vermont might be neglected
_ it is also true that the sheer number of contests could stir up
even greater national interest and a bigger voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a tremendous amount of attention and focus for a
short amount of time,'' said Carter Eskew, one of Gore's top
strategists, ``and that might draw people into the process. It's a
critical mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Gina Glantz, Bradley's campaign manager, said it was a struggle
trying to figure out where her candidate should spend his time.
After campaigning 49 days in New Hampshire, for instance, he now
has 30 more days to make his pitch in 16 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many places you'd like to go and there are a
limited number of days,'' Glantz said. ``But you look to do things
to spark a national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-CAMPAIGN-PRIMARIES-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: national interest.'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, the dynamics are not quite as oriented
to a national campaign because there is an important primary in
South Carolina on Feb. 19, and a pair of crucial contests three
days later in Michigan and Arizona. But Bush has, for months,
painstakingly assembled organizations in many states that vote
March 7. And McCain is hoping that the shower of national attention
he is enjoying from his landslide upset in New Hampshire will allow
him to overcome Bush's towering organizational advantages.
</P>
<P>
   For all the allure of more states participating, many prominent
Democrats and Republicans are horrified about the glut of
primaries. They argue that the sprawling nature of the contests
will put so much pressure on candidates to be in so many places at
once that their campaigns will amount to little more than 30-second
television commercials and cameo drop-ins at airport tarmacs.
</P>
<P>
   As Haley Barbour, the former chairman of the Republican Party,
put it, ``You've taken down your Christmas tree and people want you
to decide who they should vote for president. It's bad for
presidential candidates and campaigns. It's bad for the body
politic. I unsuccessfully tried to do something about it as
chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the crush of early primaries was purely
accidental: several states moved up their contests in a play for
more influence. But this time, the public may be served. The voters
of Iowa and New Hampshire played their usual role of inspecting the
candidates up close, helping winnow the field and pressing upon the
candidates the need to be responsive and listen to voters. Now that
the candidates have been introduced to the public and bloodied a
bit it is time for a far broader electorate to have its say.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a Republican, does not
see the merits. ``It's the antithesis of what happens in New
Hampshire,'' Wilson said. ``It becomes this television
extravaganza. It is exhausting for the participants, the candidates
and the public, and can produce results that were not seen by the
framers of the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Wilson sees the barrage of talking heads on television
as negative, their messages may reach more voters. Even before they
left Manchester late Tuesday night, Gore and Bradley sat for round
after round of interviews with local television stations in states
that have contests on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, the campaigns are already plotting how best to
compete. The big question, obviously, is how they divide their
precious days _ a subject about which the campaigns are cagey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhere between a closely guarded secret and a
no-brainer,'' Eskew said. ``Obviously, we're going to spend time in
New York, Ohio, California and Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, McCain's aides are trying to settle on an East
Coast-West Coast shuffle. ``There are ways to make the time zone
work for you,'' said Mike Murphy, a strategist for McCain. ``You
start on the East Coast. You move with the time zone to California,
then you red-eye back to the East Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   In this tarmac-to-tarmac campaign, there is one constituency, at
least, that can't grouse about being neglected: voters who cool
their heels in the frequent flyer lounges.

A MATTER OF IDENTITY: AUSTRIA THROWS EUROPE A CURVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl)

<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ In the basement of the History Museum of this
wistful city, the head of the Turkish grand vizier, Kara Mustapha,
is preserved. The public is no longer allowed to see this Austrian
trophy, a souvenir of the last Ottoman siege of Vienna in 1683. But
this severed head says much about European identity, Austrian
history and the vagaries of nationalism, the issues beneath the
rightist Joerg Haider's explosive intrusion on the politics of the
old continent.
</P>
<P>
   In the European psyche, Vienna is dense with symbolism. Behind
the waltzes-as-Muzak and the cozy cafes lies a darker reality on
which Haider has played. That reality includes Christian Vienna's
long rearguard action against the Turkish ``infidel,'' enthusiastic
Austrian support for Hitler and the historical distortion that long
portrayed Austria as the ``first victim of Nazi aggression.'' All
of this makes Europe uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   For the dawn of the new century finds Europe in a crusading
mood. The last hundred years saw a collective European suicide that
handed control of the world to the United States. Behind much of
the European slaughter lay various permutations of nationalist or
racist ideologies on which the postwar European Union has struggled
to turn the page, only to discover in the Balkans that old ghosts
do not die so easily.
</P>
<P>
   And now, just as European integration was going into overdrive
with the introduction of the euro, and the last war of Yugoslavia's
unraveling seems to have been fought, along comes slick, slim,
slippery Haider with his intermittently revisionist view of Hitler,
his distaste for immigrants, his anti-political-correctness and his
Austria-first fulminations to suggest that history does not
necessarily move in one direction. For him, the Turkish infidel is
back, no longer on horseback but in the form of the immigrant
``guest worker.'' No wonder Europe threw a fit. ``We have to draw
the line somewhere,'' said Michael Steiner, the chief diplomat in
the German Chancellery.
</P>
<P>
   But where? And how? And why exactly? As Haider's Freedom Party
took office in a right-wing coalition, and the European Union's 14
other nations moved to downgrade diplomatic relations with Austria,
and the United States studied similar measures, it was hard to
resist the view that some sort of subliminal compensation for past
Western failure to respond quickly to the rise of another
Austrian-born leader with a six-lettered name beginning with ``H''
was involved. ``The reaction has been absolutely overblown,'' said
Jonathan Eyal, a British foreign policy expert.
</P>
<P>
   True, there is real concern in Europe that acceptance of Haider
and his coalition with the conservative People's Party could
shatter the general consensus that center-right parties like the
French Gaullists or Germany's Christian Democrats do not go to bed
with the extreme right.
</P>
<P>
   But it is equally clear that Europe's mainly center-left leaders
saw an opportunity to flex their muscles on the cheap and embarrass
the right. And officials who favor a federalist Europe perceived a
unique chance to advance their cause through a new form of
interference in a member state's affairs. In all of this, the fact
that Haider's rise is also related to the stifling 30-year
dominance of the Social Democrats and their cronies was
conveniently overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, Europe is engaged in a unique
historical experiment involving an unprecedented voluntary
surrender of national sovereignty _ most recently the control of
currency. And as this integration continues, the question of what
``European identity'' is on a continent whose immigrant population
grows daily becomes more pressing. Which brings us back to the
grand vizier's head.
</P>
<P>
   In twice beating back the Ottoman Turkish armies at the gates of
Vienna, the Hapsburgs and their allies were defending ``Christian
Europe.'' Yet the Hapsburg Empire was also profoundly
multinational: Vienna was sometimes compared to ``Babel'' because
of its multitude of tongues. Then, of course, came the collapse of
empire, the rise of nation states, the unfurling of nationalism _
and much 20th-century ruin.
</P>
<P>
   On these ashes, the European Union has tried to build what
Churchill in 1946 called ``the United States of Europe.'' For a
long time, it was mainly a trade bloc. But it now is more than
that, a hybrid without a name and some characteristics of a
supranational state. Can it inspire European patriotism?
</P>
<P>
   Haider says no. With his statements that ``you are not at home
in your home any more'' because of the number of immigrants, his
odious posters of fair and red-cheeked Austrian girls representing
the essence of his country's goodness, his cultivation of the fears
of blue-collar workers over foreigners waiting to take their jobs,
he says identity is national and exclusive and, where possible,
blue-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his efforts to throw back the clock, Europe's
reality is another. About 1.5 million immigrants pour into the
European Union every year. Aging populations, low birth rates and
European reluctance to do many menial jobs make this influx
inevitable. Europe and its immigrants need each other.
</P>
<P>
   So, it seems, Europeans' sense of identity must change to
reflect growing political union and more mixed populations. But
European states have never really seen themselves as ``lands of
immigration.'' In recent years, Europe has seen assaults on Turks
in Germany, tension in France over the refusal of Muslim girls in
schools to remove headscarves and clashes between British police
and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-AUSTRIA-EUROPE-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; VIENNA: and minorities. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, for now, the main political thrust of several center-left
governments remains toward greater openness. The recent invitation
to Turkey to join the European Union reflects a broad push to make
Europeans see themselves differently, not in juxtaposition to a
vizier's head, but in acceptance of the common humanity of the
guest worker. The rise of Haider demonstrates, however, that the
battle for Europe's soul is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans do not even agree on the history that defines them. An
old joke says Austrians have convinced themselves that Hitler was a
German and Beethoven an Austrian. Certainly self-delusion and a
sense of being misunderstood are rampant in this city where Freud
uncovered the secret of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that 1 million Austrians fought beside
Hitler, many Austrians believe they fought nobly or at least
dutifully, Eichmann ran the Third Reich's racial pogroms from
Vienna and, after the war, the Allies for their own reasons led the
Austrians to think they were really victims of Hitler, and the
first ones at that.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, the son of virulent Nazis, has cleverly played on these
misgivings and resentments, so evident in the election of Kurt
Waldheim as president in 1986 despite his Nazi past. Haider has
intermittently offered a view of history still comforting to some
Austrians: that the Waffen SS saved Europe from communism and that
Hitler's labor policies succeeded because they put Germans to work.
</P>
<P>
   But those who foresee a unified Europe now have zero tolerance
for such outbursts. They want to make Europe's history clear in
order to make its identity clear. The European Union wants,
henceforth, to be on the side of liberty, democracy, human rights,
the rule of law and an end to ethnic persecution. It was for these
values that it says it went to war in Kosovo. Many Europeans
cheered. But Haider, while formally embracing this prevailing
ideology as he entered government, whispers another reality, as
does France's Jean-Marie LePen: the left-leaning, bleeding-heart,
tree-hugging, globalist bureaucrats have no monopoly on historical
truth.
</P>
<P>
   In another Viennese museum, the Army Historical Museum, are
displayed the clothes the Hapsburg crown prince was wearing in
Sarajevo when he was murdered, an assassination that ignited World
War I. Europe will not return to such trenches. But the battle for
a pan-European identity, able to accommodate both Christianity and
Islam, has only just begun.

A NOT-SO-BRAVE NEW WORLD: SCI-FI TV RUNS AGROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When television sprouted up in the living rooms of postwar
America it must have seemed like a techno-wonder straight out of
science fiction. In fact, television and science-fiction appeared
to be a match made in the heavens _ an imaginative literary genre
that had already excited the masses on radio (``War of the
Worlds,'' anyone?) could now be melded with pictures to give
audiences something truly new to think about.
</P>
<P>
   But for those expecting new horizons of literate entertainment
and provocative visions of the future, sci-fi television has
largely failed to live up to its promise.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, series like ``The Twilight Zone'' and ``The Outer
Limits'' effectively mixed social messages with simple special
effects. ``Star Trek'' combined space opera with memorable scripts
and flourished in syndication. With scripts that didn't pander to
audiences, these shows managed to pull early science-fiction
television away from pulpy stories about invading bug-eyed
monsters. Part of the magic may have been the times: the rocket
launches and moon missions of the era whetted a lot of appetites
for the possibilities of what might be Out There.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, channel surfers are more likely to
encounter fiction that has swapped ``science'' for ``sex'' to
attract viewers. Take ``Lexx,'' a cable series that began its
second season last month on the Sci-Fi Channel. The main character
is Xev, a voluptuous, scantily clad woman with a hyperactive libido
who travels around the galaxy with three male characters on a giant
bug that serves as a spaceship. In one recent episode, the crew
lands on a harmonious all-male world of gay space monks and
disrupts the society so badly that the planet blows up.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month NBC will roll out ``The 10th Kingdom,'' a
miniseries that draws on standard fairy-tale archetypes (think Snow
White) in a sci-fi/fantasy setting. Then there's ``Cleopatra
2525,'' a new syndicated series about three tightly dressed women
battling aliens. Even though the half-hour show weaves a bit of
ironic humor in with exposed midriffs, there's still far more eye
candy than brain benders on screen.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't exactly boldly going where no one has gone before.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be because the pace of scientific discovery has outrun
the human imagination. After all, 7 of the top 10 highest-grossing
films have had science-fiction themes, and new books in the genre
like Michael Crichton's recent ``Timeline,'' about century-hopping
Yalies, regularly land on best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about a golden age in retrospect, but there's been
very little intelligent science fiction on television, period,''
said Paul T. Riddell, a writer and columnist for Sci Fi magazine,
pointing to the space-ranger exploits of Captain Video and Flash
Gordon as evidence. ``Nobody takes science fiction seriously,'' he
added, noting that most network executives believe that sci-fi fans
``will watch  &UR; anything &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the budget for special effects or sets became
excessive,'' Riddell said, ``the natural tendency was to push for
that teen-age male audience, or to dumb things down to expand the
available audience at any given time.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Nicholls, in the ``Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' (St.
Martin's, 1993), writes that, ``the pressures toward conformity and
formula'' over the last 40 years have resulted in programming that
has ``never approached the intellectual excitement of the best
written s.f., or indeed the best s.f. in the cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   For straightforward action-oriented fare, television has
depended for years on adaptations of sci-fi literature, for series
like ``The Six Million Dollar Man'' and ``Logan's Run.'' But the
literary genre's more cerebral material doesn't seem to translate
well to the budgetary and mental constraints of the small screen.
Think about it: Could Ursula K. LeGuin's 1969 book, ``The Left Hand
of Darkness,'' about a society of hermaphrodites, possibly fly in a
medium that makes a big deal about Ally McBeal's unisex bathroom?
</P>
<P>
   Books and television are different forms of entertainment, of
course, and perhaps it is unfair to compare them too closely. ``If
a story has too much conversation or too much explanation in it,
it's not going to work for television,'' said Bonnie Hammer, the
executive vice-president and general manager of the Sci-Fi Channel.
``You have to be able to tell it through action, through the story
line and through characters. If you have to explain everything in
the dialogue, it's going to be a very slow hour.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harlan Ellison, an award-winning author who has written much
science-fiction, says sci-fi TV has lagged decades behind what is
happening in the literary world, ``because it is being done by the
same people who produce cop shows, doctor shows and game shows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And these are people who simply do not understand any of the
aspects or elements that make science fiction what it is,'' he
continued. What makes for good science fiction? ``A big idea that
deals with the human heart in conflict with itself and the effects
of science, the future or an imaginative idea on those people that
is rigorously logical within the terms of its own story,'' said
Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-TV-SCIFI-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: said Ellison. &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the human heart in conflict with itself is often a ploy
television uses to attract female audiences (and their valued
advertising dollars), sci-fi on the tube has had some trouble
putting down the laser pistols and showing its sensitive side.
There may be comfort in genre cliches, but the preponderance of
women in variations of the little silver space bikini helps keep
science-fiction TV in a state of arrested development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sci-fi vibrates at the key intersections of modernism and
postmodernism, with the macho sci-fi writers often reverting
subconsciously to essentialized gender identities and behaviors,''
says Dr. Christine Boese, an assistant professor in English at
Clemson University, who disliked the original ``Star Trek'' because
``it was all about men and posturing.''
</P>
<P>
   Boese, who wrote her doctoral dissertation on the cyber-culture
created by fans of the action-fantasy show ``Xena: Warrior
Princess,'' consumes a wide variety of science fiction and doesn't
seem to mind a few guilty pleasures. ``I like sorting through the
wacky theories and deciding for myself which part is utterly wacked
and whether a kernel of truth might be buried in the dung,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis isn't all bad. There are some ambitious shows on
the air these days, like the Sci Fi Channel's acclaimed
``Farscape,'' and shows with promise like CBS' ``Now and Again.''
Other programs that mix supernatural elements with clever dialogue
and sharp writing, like ``The X-Files'' and ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer,'' may not be pure science fiction but are entertaining
hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the show is produced and written well, it's all on the page
_ whether it's a book or a script,'' said Hammer. ``If it's not on
the page and it's not smart, it's not going to be there.''

A NOT-SO-BRAVE NEW WORLD: SCI-FI TV RUNS AGROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When television sprouted up in the living rooms of postwar
America it must have seemed like a techno-wonder straight out of
science fiction. In fact, television and science-fiction appeared
to be a match made in the heavens _ an imaginative literary genre
that had already excited the masses on radio (``War of the
Worlds,'' anyone?) could now be melded with pictures to give
audiences something truly new to think about.
</P>
<P>
   But for those expecting new horizons of literate entertainment
and provocative visions of the future, sci-fi television has
largely failed to live up to its promise.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, series like ``The Twilight Zone'' and ``The Outer
Limits'' effectively mixed social messages with simple special
effects. ``Star Trek'' combined space opera with memorable scripts
and flourished in syndication. With scripts that didn't pander to
audiences, these shows managed to pull early science-fiction
television away from pulpy stories about invading bug-eyed
monsters. Part of the magic may have been the times: the rocket
launches and moon missions of the era whetted a lot of appetites
for the possibilities of what might be Out There.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, channel surfers are more likely to
encounter fiction that has swapped ``science'' for ``sex'' to
attract viewers. Take ``Lexx,'' a cable series that began its
second season last month on the Sci-Fi Channel. The main character
is Xev, a voluptuous, scantily clad woman with a hyperactive libido
who travels around the galaxy with three male characters on a giant
bug that serves as a spaceship. In one recent episode, the crew
lands on a harmonious all-male world of gay space monks and
disrupts the society so badly that the planet blows up.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month NBC will roll out ``The 10th Kingdom,'' a
miniseries that draws on standard fairy-tale archetypes (think Snow
White) in a sci-fi/fantasy setting. Then there's ``Cleopatra
2525,'' a new syndicated series about three tightly dressed women
battling aliens. Even though the half-hour show weaves a bit of
ironic humor in with exposed midriffs, there's still far more eye
candy than brain benders on screen.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't exactly boldly going where no one has gone before.

   CAMPAIGN-PRIMARIES-REVIEW (Washington) _ After months in the
small states of Iowa and New Hampshire, the presidential campaign
turns national with an eye to March 7, a single day of voting so
big that candidates are calling it Titanic Tuesday. On this day,
more voters may have more influence over who is nominated than in
years. More than one-third of eligible voters will get to
participate. The compressed calendar resembles a European election:
a short but intense primary season where, candidates hope, voters
pay close attention. March 7 will be the closest thing America has
to a national primary. By Richard L. Berke. (Moved in the `a' and
`p' categories)
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRIA-EUROPE-REVIEW (Vienna) _ In the European psyche, Vienna
is dense with symbolism. Behind the waltzes-as-muzak and the cozy
cafes lies a darker reality on which Joerg Haider has played. That
reality includes Christian Vienna's long rearguard action against
the Turkish ``infidel,'' enthusiastic Austrian support for Hitler,
and the historical distortion that long portrayed Austria as the
first victim of Nazi aggression. All of this makes Europe uneasy.

   DOCTORS-ASSAULT-REVIEW (New York) _ The case of the doctor who
carved his initials into the flesh of an anesthetized patient
raises the question of assault vs. malpractice. The incident is one
of a range of medical violations, including sexual harassment of
patients, that experts say fall into a gray area between negligent
malpractice and criminality. By Edward Wong.
</P>
<P>
   GENETIC-FOOD-REVIEW (Undated) _ The paradox of genetically
engineered foods: science has reached what might be the takeoff
stage for a new green revolution. But it may go the way instead of
nuclear power _ a once promising technology largely rejected by
society. While its potential benefits are huge, genetic engineering
seems to conjure up images of mad scientists playing God and has

messages are excerpted. By David Leonhardt.

has come to mirror all the bitter political divisions and
dysfunction of the last four decades in the last, and seemingly

<P>
   JAPAN-PRESS-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ A politician recently denounced
several magazines for running sex photos while conceding that the
magazines perform a useful service in their innovative
investigative reporting on serious issues. The backhanded
compliment to the magazines was a stinging indictment of Japan's
huge daily press. Virtually alone among advanced industrialized

   BOSTON _ Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center has suspended its
remaining human gene therapy trial, citing growing concerns about
the safety of the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   BIDMC officials said they made the decision last week not
because of any known problems with the study, in which genetically
altered cells were implanted into patients with hemophilia, but
because the safety of all gene therapy research has come under
scrutiny following a death in a Pennsylvania trial last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are temporarily halting (the trial) because there is a
national discourse on this and we would like to benefit from it,''
said interim president Dr. Michael Rosenblatt.
</P>
<P>
   Announcement of the suspension occurred a week after it was
revealed that BIDMC halted a different gene therapy trial last
summer after three of the first six patients died and that those
deaths had not been properly reported to the National Institutes of
Health.
</P>
<P>
   BIDMC said that the reporting failure was inadvertent and that
researchers had informed another government agency, the Food and
Drug Administration, of the deaths as required. Officials at the
hospital also said an internal review had concluded that at least
two of the deaths were not related to the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Gene therapy, one of the most promising fields of medical
science, attempts to repair or replace broken genes in seriously
ill patients by transferring normal genes into the body. It could
be used to treat disorders as rare as cystic fibrosis or as common
as cancer, researchers contend.
</P>
<P>
   But the challenge has proved more difficult than expected. After
more than 300 human experiments in the past decade, there has been
no clear-cut success in gene therapy. Getting the foreign genes
safely into the body and maintaining their function for more than a
short time are two major hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   The death last September of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger at the
University of Pennsylvania triggered a government investigation,
the suspension of eight gene therapy trials there, and a Senate
hearing last week on regulation of the field. Senator William
Frist, Republican of Tennessee, said after the hearing that the
current regulatory system had failed and change was needed.
</P>
<P>
   Believing Gelsinger's case might not have been an isolated
event, the NIH asked hospitals and research facilities nationwide
for more detailed information on gene therapy and received almost
700 reports of serious adverse events during the experiments. They
had not been reported, as is required, to the NIH's recombinant DNA
advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the debate and the slow progress, scientists and drug
and biotech companies remain bullish that in the long term, gene
therapy will become a potent part of medicine's arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still enthusiastic and optimistic about it,'' said a
spokeswoman for Biogen, the Cambridge, Mass. biotech firm, which
invests in gene therapy research through Genovo, a Philadelphia
gene therapy firm.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Boston area is a hotbed of genetic science, area
researchers have been exceptionally cautious about beginning human
gene therapy, saying the field lacks a solid scientific foundation.
However, a number of trials are underway.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an official of Genzyme Science of Framingham said
last week that the company is conducting two gene therapy trials _
one aimed at growing new blood vessels in patients' legs affected
by blocked circulation and one in cancer _ and plans to begin
others shortly.
</P>
<P>
   The largest number of gene therapy trials in Boston are underway
at Dana-Farber Partners Cancer Care, a joint venture of Brigham and
Women's Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute, said Greg Koski, head of human research affairs
for Partners Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths at BIDMC all involved terminally ill cancer patients
undergoing gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining clinical trial at the medical center involved
patients with hemophilia, the inherited bleeding disorder. They
received implants into their abdomens of laboratory-grown cells
fitted with a gene that makes the anticlotting protein, Factor
VIII. Hemophiliacs do not make sufficient Factor VIII.
</P>
<P>
   Six of a planned 12 patients received the implants over the past
two years, said Dr. Richard Selden, founder and president of
Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. of Cambridge, which sponsored the
trial. He said there had been one ``serious adverse event'' during
the trial, but it was because of ``the underlying condition'' of
the patient, not the therapy itself.
</P>
<P>
   A BIDMC spokeswoman said the event was an abnormal heart rhythm
eight months following the treatment and that the patient was
briefly hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt, the interim president, stressed that the episode was
properly reported and that the FDA had recently given the study
approval.
</P>
<P>
   The gene therapy community is struggling with issues of ethics,
informed consent, and regulation. Scientists say the field still
lacks some of the basic tools _ namely, safe and effective gene
transporters, called ``vectors,'' to carry genes into patients'
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Many vectors are modified viruses, and it was such a virus that
triggered a fatal reaction in Gelsinger, who died Sept. 17 at the
University of Pennsylvania. He had volunteered for the trial to
test the potential treatment for a rare liver disease. Gelsinger
had the disease, but was doing well on conventional treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Other vectors, both viral and nonviral, all have their drawbacks
_ some are thought riskier, some cannot carry a very big gene, some
can take genes only into cells that are dividing.
</P>
<P>
   Even when genes can be transferred into patients' cells, they
often function only temporarily then fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back to a lot of those old questions that were with us
at the very beginning,'' said Dr. Theodore Friedmann, director of
human gene therapy at the University of California at San Diego,
one of the early gene therapy researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned a lot, but we are still in the position of not
knowing the best vectors'' to use or which diseases to be targeted
first.
</P>
<P>
   The first authorized gene therapy experiment was conducted a
decade ago, when government scientists took immune cells from two
young girls and added genes to make a key protein the girls lacked.
Because of a genetic defect, the girls had almost no immunity
against infection. The gene-altered cells were put back into their
blood streams, in hopes that they would produce the missing enzyme,
which is necessary to build normal immune defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Although the girls did well, they also received a conventional
treatment, and the overall results were ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, gene therapy has been tried for cystic fibrosis,
hemophilia, many forms of cancer, a rare children's disease called
Canavan disease, sickle cell anemia, and others. The attempts to
treat cystic fibrosis by having patients inhale a mist of
gene-carrying viruses ran afoul of the body's stout defenses: the
immune system erupted in an inflammatory response that destroyed
the viruses and could have been harmful to the patients.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Too quick to judge Austria?
 &HT;    (For release Feb. 9, 2000.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Servicez
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are mixed signals on the swelling Austria crisis: Some
want to isolate that country as a result of its government
acceptance of members of the far-right Freedom Party; others wonder
if the crisis really is a crisis or something blown far out of
proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Only time can clear the air. The question: How much time will it
take?
</P>
<P>
   In this world of instant communication _ and demands for equally
sudden reaction _ Austria became a pariah, not within days but
within hours.
</P>
<P>
   Joerg Haider, the Freedom Party master, has said things in the
past that have come to haunt both him and the people he said them
about. He has alienated immigrants, Jews and many others by his
softness on some of Adolf Hitler's programs _ although he has not,
to my knowledge, uttered a public word in defense of the Holocaust
or any other crimes Hitler perpetrated on the remainder of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The platform of the Freedom Party is without complexity: It
wants a homogeneous society. This is not fully unlike the ambitions
of other Western European nations including France, Germany and the
United Kingdom, all three inundated with immigrants. What makes the
Freedom Party of Austria different is that it took the issue to the
voters, and rather than be ostracized for such provincial thought,
it won 27.3 percent of the Austrian vote last October. The People's
Party took 26.9 percent and the Social Democrats 33 percent; no
clear-cut consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the word ``Nazi'' has been tossed about in relation
to Haider and his party, principally because Haider has expressed
respect for the Nazi SS hoodlums and for certain of Hitler's
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Haider has since apologized for those remarks, but so did
baseball's John Rocker for the verbal trash he unloaded on a
sportswriter last fall. It is obvious that if the hurt is deep
enough, no apology will do. Neither have been forgiven by those
they offended.
</P>
<P>
   As always, there are comparisons. And this is where Patrick
Buchanan comes in. Frankly, I think Haider's speeches were stolen
from Buchanan's manuscripts that included calls for bans on
immigration and cottony references to Hitler and German war
criminals who faced deportation from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   And Buchanan is running for president of the United States!
</P>
<P>
   In the very unlikely occurrence that Buchanan would be elected
president, would the world's nations retreat from its friendship
with the U.S.? Withdraw ambassadors? Cut economic ties?
</P>
<P>
   Not likely. But that is what is happening with Austria. In an
emotional moment, I can warrant it. After all, Austrians threw
flowers in the path of Austrian-born Hitler when he marched in in
1939. This also is the country that elected Kurt Waldheim president
in 1986 after documents revealed that he was an officer in a German
army unit during World War II that killed thousands of Yugoslavians
and deported Greek Jews to concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is a history. So, you do have to be wary of
Austria and its attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   But should we already be close to a political and economic
rebuffing of Austria?
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Party is attempting to distance itself from the
image of a Nazi-like party while not retreating on its immigration
platform. Haider, himself, will not be a part of the new
government. Should this placate the rest of us? Or is this the trap
that befell Neville Chamberlain, who is remembered as the British
prime minister who appeased Hitler, thus allowing the dictator to
become even more brazen?
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, a British foreign relations expert was quoted
as saying the breakneck world reaction to the Austrian situation is
being blown far out of proportion. Hopefully, this is so.
</P>
<P>
   You can live with a few far-right or far-left wingers in any
government (we have them) so long as the remainder steer a straight
and amenable course. I'd like to wait a while before judging
Austria's internal politics. The remainder of the world certainly
is strong enough to stop anything that goes beyond that.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A South without kudzu?
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As they say, be careful what you wish for. You might get kudzu.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeastern states did, starting in the 1930s. Looking for
a carefree ground cover to stop erosion, the region harkened to the
advice of the U.S. Soil Conservation Service and took up with an
obscure ornamental vine.
</P>
<P>
   The South has been trying to get away from it ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Kudzu was slipped into the country for the garden that Japan
contributed to the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia and
didn't spread, socially, much beyond similar discreet uses for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   But then a well-meaning nation, appalled by the arid horror of
the Dust Bowl, unleashed kudzu on the South to prevent similar
devastation. The Civilian Conservation Corps planted it. Farmers
were paid $8 an acre to cover unused fields with it.
</P>
<P>
   Well-mannered in its native Asia, kudzu turned profligate in the
Southeastern climate, partying across the region with Dionysian
abandon, a herbal hedonist on an eternal toot. It spreads at a slow
walk. (Well, actually a foot a day, but that's in every direction.)
There are tales of grazing cows being overtaken and lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   Kudzu overwhelms trees, snakes up fence posts, races down
gullies. (Oddly, it seems to balk at billboards, which ought to
tell us something about billboards.) Guns can't kill it. Tanks
can't kill it. Strong herbicides can, but it takes at least four
years, sometimes as many as 10.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Tuskegee University have found that Angora goats
can eat kudzu to a standoff, but not everybody wants Angora goats.
In fact, almost nobody wants goats of any sort.
</P>
<P>
   So it must be good news in the Southeast that scientists have
found that a common fungus, Myrothecium verrucaria, can kill kudzu
dead within hours, and without harming other plants.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes and no it's good news.
</P>
<P>
   Kudzu is a pest all right, and worse. It can waste whole forests
by blocking sunlight. When it goes dormant in the winter, it drapes
the countryside in an ugly grey pall.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also sort of like having a crazy uncle living in the
attic. You'd rather he'd go away, but at least he gives everybody
something to talk about and he does lend the place a certain
peculiar distinctiveness. And OK, he's crazy but, hey, he's OUR
crazy uncle.
</P>
<P>
   And in season, verdurous to excess, kudzu landscapes tease the
idle mind _ improvised topiary that arranges itself into fabulous
shapes, abstract or evocative: vast green undulations or, if you're
lucky, a castle right out of Sir Walter Scott, complete with a
mounted knight compounded of a couple of kudzu-invested shrubs and
a tilted lance made of an entwined guy wire. (Or maybe just a
chickie or a ducky. We all have our off days.)
</P>
<P>
   Now that we apparently can, do we really want to kill off the
kudzu? If it goes, it will take its menace with it, but also those
surprising roadside dinosaurs, pirate ships and dancing maidens.
And we'd be left alone with all those billboards.

 &HT;    A slipperly ride was par for the course
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ The day of the first storm of winter
started out pleasantly enough, with a plate of heuvos rancheros,
beans and tortillas, washed down with a strong cup of coffee and a
tall glass of milk at a Mexican restaurant in downtown Buda, a
charming little town about 15 miles south of Austin. Outside, it
finally felt like a Texas winter _ 35 degrees and raining, wind
whipping a gray band of clouds from the west. My prediction: Winter
came in like a lamb and will go out like a lion this season. Blame
La Nina.
</P>
<P>
   I met my brother in Buda to discuss our aborted plan to play
golf at a new course a few miles away, where he had a free
membership taken in trade for designing some brochures. Looks like
golf is out, I said, and he nodded but I could tell he wasn't quite
ready to give up just yet. He was decked out in a waterproof
windsuit and kept telling me that the lessons he had taken were
making a difference. I was wearing blue jeans, a sweatshirt and a
windbreaker, none of which repelled water. He has been bitten with
the golf obsession, a phase I have passed through. Now I avoid
playing if the temperature is lower than my age or if it's raining.
I don't read golf magazines, never practice and am content to
remain at a comfortable level of mediocrity. Eventually, he will
get over the obsession, too.
</P>
<P>
   We dawdled in the cafe for an hour, reading the Austin paper and
talking politics. He kept going to the window and peeking outside.
Slacked off, he said, and it looks lighter in the west. Believe
it's blowing through. Want to take a ride out and look over the
course, meet the owners?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, why not, I said. Then I can get back on the road to East
Texas and beat the ice storm I was reasonably sure was coming out
of the plains of Oklahoma and north Texas, headed hard toward the
Pine Curtain.
</P>
<P>
   We drove out, met the owners and the club pro, who had plenty of
time to chat, since we were the only ones out there. One of the
owners said it was supposed to blow through any time now. After
about 30 minutes, I could tell my brother was holding fast to the
idea of hitting the rock, so I relented. The pro shook his head and
told us we could walk the course with pull carts; it was too wet
for a cart. Idiots, I could sense him thinking.
</P>
<P>
   It rained steadily but softly for the first four holes, the wind
hitting upward of 30 mph. Pretend you're in Scotland, my brother
said, playing St. Andrews. I was more interested in pretending I
was sitting in front of a fire in the clubhouse, sipping on a hot
toddy.
</P>
<P>
   On the fifth hole, the skies opened, the wind whipped up and we
were stuck probably a mile from the clubhouse in a deluge. In
seconds I was soaked to the bone. I couldn't feel my ears, hands or
feet. We hiked back. After a while, I began to believe we weren't
going to make it back, that this was how my life would end, frozen
to death on a golf course or drowned in a flash flood.
</P>
<P>
   We survived, of course, the pro shaking his head as we trudged
back and began shedding clothes. I luckily had a spare, dry set of
clothes, and a cup of coffee at my brother's home restored me
somewhat. Soon I was driving back east propelled by a tail wind
that whipped the back end of my rental pickup to and fro. Still,
the heater worked well, I drank coffee or cappuccino nonstop, and I
sang along with the country music stations from small town to town.
</P>
<P>
   Then I hit the ice just east of Crockett. Soon I was approaching
every bridge with my breath held and my knuckles white on the
steering wheel as the pickup skated across the pavement even at 40
mph.
</P>
<P>
   It was snowing in Alto. That's been a running joke in the
newsroom in the 10-plus years I've been back here. Every winter
storm that comes through, somebody calls and says it's snowing in
Alto. I'm a witness that, as this storm blew through, it truly was
snowing in Alto, so maybe we newsroom cynics have been, well, too
cynical.
</P>
<P>
   The worst moment came when three unloaded bobtail pulpwood
trucks tailgating each other roared past from the opposite
direction as I crossed an icy bridge. Three men bent on suicide or
getting home in time to watch ``Wheel of Fortune,'' I guess. I had
to stop and let my heartbeat slow down after that near-death
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The ice ended just outside of Nacogdoches. My feet were still
frozen, my hands were shaking from caffeine overload, and I was
seriously considering suing my brother for mental anguish, though
he doesn't have any money, and I'm afraid he'd try to stick me with
one of his dogs in the asset settlement _ the mean one who promptly
bit me on the foot (luckily it was shod) as soon as I walked in the
door.
</P>
<P>
   But that's another story.

   LUFKIN, Texas _ Think you just have to be born between World War
II and the 1960s to qualify as a baby boomer? According to this
e-mail I received, there's a qualifying exam to take before you can
become a full-fledged boomer. While not as complicated as the Mensa

points off for wrong answers.

(Admittedly, this came along before boomers were born. But it was

</P>
<P>
   8 ``Hey kids, what time is it?''
</P>
<P>
   9. Post-baby boomers know Bob Denver as the Skipper's ``little
buddy.'' But boomers know that Bob Denver is actually Dobie's
closest friend. Name him.
</P>
<P>
   10. Superman fights a never-ending battle for truth, justice,
and ...
</P>
<P>
   11. Your children probably recall that Peter Pan was recently
played by Robin Williams, but Peter was most memorably played by
whom?
</P>
<P>
   12. In 1962, a dejected politician chastised the press after
losing a race for governor while announcing his retirement from
politics. ``Just think, you won't have (who?) to kick around
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Finish these familiar sayings.
</P>
<P>
   13. ``You'll wonder where the yellow went ...''

   24. ``Every morning, at the mine, you could see him arrive; He
stood 6-foot-6, weighted 245. Kinda' broad at the shoulder, and

</P>
<P>
   25. In a movie from the late sixties, Paul Newman played Luke, a

 &HT;    McCain's honesty tactic a novel concept that just might work
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ At his 100th or so town meeting in New Hampshire,
GOP presidential candidate John McCain said a woman stood up to
make a statement rather than ask a question.
</P>
<P>
   Her statement impressed McCain so much that he started including
it in all his public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't think it is any coincidence that so many independents
and mainline Republican men and women moved to support him after he
started using the woman's remarks in his speeches.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the woman rose to tell him that what she wanted more
than anything was a politician who always told the truth.
</P>
<P>
   McCain accepted the woman's statement at face value. He figured
if she was fed up with politicians who duck, weave, spin, dodge and
flip flop, then so were other voters.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons behind his romping, stomping victory over
George W. Bush on Tuesday, McCain felt, was his statement to New
Hampshire voters that they could count on him to never lie to them.
</P>
<P>
   The size of McCain's victory over Bush was startling because
Bush worked hard and spent big in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush stuck to his themes of big tax cuts, compassionate
conservatism, education, home, family, morality and the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also didn't make any flubs in his debates. This was such an
important goal in New Hampshire that Bush went into hiding from the
national press to lessen his chances of making an embarrassing
blunder.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also emphasized the usual issues that he felt would appeal
to women voters.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the New Hampshire campaign, Bush brought in his
mother and father.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, Bush had all the Republican heavyweights and
party machinery in his oversized hip pocket that also contained
enough cash to pay for a first-class ticket to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing worked for Bush. McCain got the women's vote. McCain got
the Republican vote. McCain got the independent vote. McCain got it
all by an 18-point margin, 49 percent to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The same issue that McCain believes helped him beat Bush may
have played an important role in the New Hampshire Democratic
primary race between presidential contenders Al Gore and Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore administered such a whipping to the soft-spoken Bradley in
Iowa a few days earlier that the likelihood of Bradley continuing
after New Hampshire appeared slim.
</P>
<P>
   After his lopsided loss in Iowa, Bradley began to hit Gore's
honesty. He reminded voters that candidates who don't tell the
truth before the election are not likely to tell the truth after
the election.
</P>
<P>
   After Bradley began to question Gore's truthfulness, he gained
voter support and just barely lost the New Hampshire primary in a
nip-and-tuck race.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley left New Hampshire with reinvigorated
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   It would be great for American politics if the message coming
out of New Hampshire is that the voters are fed up with politicians
who spin, shade, split hairs, parse, mislead or outright lie.
</P>
<P>
   American democracy will receive a needed boost if voters begin
demanding the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth from
their politicians.
</P>
<P>
   It's past time for American voters to support politicians who
speak their minds and tell the truth. Voters should spurn
politicians who attempt to win support with public opinion polls,
focus groups and misleading marketing ploys. Politicians willing to
tell people whatever polls show they want to hear are false
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Americans should reject false leaders and demand politicians
with outspoken personal principles.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, the New Hampshire primaries will cause politicians at
all levels to compete with straight talk and unvarnished truth.

 &HT;    Full blown glass craze
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN CITY, Ore. _ I don't live here but I do come to visit
every so often just to see what these folks on the coast are up to.
It's always something. They're real different from us
Midwesterners.
</P>
<P>
   Back in northwest Ohio where I live in a tiny village called
Gibsonburg, my neighbors are mostly successful German farmers who
have worked long and hard to keep the land they inherited from
their fathers productive. They've never had much time for creative
stuff, except the time Orton Schmidt got snockered and painted the
wheels on his tractor sunny orange.
</P>
<P>
   The house I live in is on the corner behind a hedge, about a
block-and-a-half from the dime store. The funeral home is directly
across the street.
</P>
<P>
   We have five churches, a snow plow, and every third Saturday
night there's karaoke at Hoy's Bar. Watching Jon Younker change the
letters on the Lions Club sign from HAPPY MILLENNIUM to THINK
SPRING, is just about as exciting as it gets around here.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it strikes me as more than a little odd this morning
when I look out Gail's front window and spot a crowd of people down
there on the beach in a driving rain, jabbing sticks around in the
sand. I ask her what those fools might be doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for millennium floats,'' my old friend
answers, sounding kind of like I should have been able to figure
that out on my own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' I remind her, ``remember where I live? It isn't often
we look out our windows and spot a herd of tourists with
flashlights strapped to their hats, wandering around the village in
a freezing drizzle poking holes in the dirt with sharp sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail doesn't get it. She's been out here too long.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, I explain, back in Gibsonburg, the only beach most of
us see is in the National Geographics down at the library, and even
then we're kind of careful not to look too long at certain pages
just in case a neighbor might spot us eyeballing a half-naked
native and get the wrong idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``What,'' I insist, ``is a millennium float?'' Gail fills me in.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, folks living on the Pacific shores, particularly in
the northwest and Alaska, have been harvesting the colorful glass
floats that occasionally break loose from Japanese fishing boats
and float up on shore. They're not rare. Antique shops up and down
the coast sell them to visitors for about 20 bucks apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Then last summer a local entrepreneur with time on his hands
came up with the bright idea of millennium floats _ 2000
jewel-hued, blown-glass balls to be scattered along the 14-mile
stretch of Lincoln City beaches for tourists to
</P>
<P>
   discover in the sand and exclaim: OOH! LOOK-Y THERE MABEL! IT'S
A COLORFUL GLASS BALL IN THE SAND! I THINK I'VE DISCOVERED A
MILLENNIUM FLOAT.
</P>
<P>
   The idea caught on and the place is going nuts. Beaches are
being combed 24-hours a day for the freebies, and art galleries are
moving these balls in and out so fast the glass hardly has time to
cool. With price tags starting at $42 and ranging up to $200, the
blowers, who usually close up between December and March, are
working through the winter. Top production is about 36 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Gail works part-time in a gallery that, like all of the others
in town, can't keep up with the demand. One day she sold a dozen
balls in 17 minutes. In the past two months she's bought 27 of them
herself and has them hanging all over the house.
</P>
<P>
   But all is not wonderful in the land of west coast Oz. Obsession
has struck and Lincoln city is finding itself in the midst of a
full-blown, blown-glass crime wave. Folks are stealing each other's
floats. Just the other night three
</P>
<P>
   motels and a bed and bath shop were knocked over by ball thieves
who carried off their stashes.
</P>
<P>
   It's insanity out here folks. It'll be good to get home. I'm
leaving Thursday . . . or as soon as I can find a box to pack my
floats in.

 &HT;    A decade of stock market foreboding
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA, Fla. _ This is an old joke. A really old joke. About a
300-year-old joke:
</P>
<P>
   Two Puritans meet on a bright and lovely New England spring day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lovely weather, Caleb,'' says one, by way of greeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aye,'' responds Caleb. ``And we'll pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   They pause for a moment to observe the beauty about them and
shudder inwardly.
</P>
<P>
   I think about this chestnut every time I read a news story about
the current economic expansion. Last week was a record-breaker. The
nation entered its longest period of uninterrupted economic growth
since, well, if not from the time Caleb joined the choir invisible,
then at least since the government has been keeping records.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the expansion is amazing. Many people in the work
force have never known a downturn in their working life. People my
age shudder at the vague memory of something called ``stagflation''
_ stagnant growth coupled with inflation _ but a serious downturn
is, for most of us, the stuff of history class.
</P>
<P>
   The image of stockbrokers flinging themselves from windows is no
more than a quaint cartoon conceit _ like single-palm desert
islands _ dating from a far-off era when stockbrokers worked in
buildings with windows that opened.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean we all are happy and thank the stock-market gods
for being born at the right time?
</P>
<P>
   Not a bit. The 1990s stock-market rally barely began before its
death was predicted. The tax increase in the first years of the
Clinton administration was supposed to bring a loss of jobs and
recession. The increase in the minimum wage was supposed to lead to
loss of jobs and recession. The economic might of Japan was
supposed to lead to loss of jobs and recession. The economic
weakness of Japan was supposed to lead to loss of jobs and
recession. Each free-trade agreement was supposed to lead to
</P>
<P>
   loss of jobs and recession.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the business shelf of any larger used-book store is a
doleful experience. You see titles like: ``The Stock Market Crashes
of 1998 and 1999: The Asian Crisis and Your Future'' (1998), ``The
Great Depression of 1990'' (1989), and ``America in Depression: The
Coming Economic Collapse'' (1993).
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to sense that many economic writers aren't merely
bears; they are scaredy cats.
</P>
<P>
   Never has a time of economic expansion and prosperity been so
little enjoyed. It is as though, like the Puritans in the old joke,
experts see brewing retribution every time a record shatters.
</P>
<P>
   I slept though much of my economics classes, but I don't recall
an economic counterpart to Newton's Third Law of Motion, that for
every action there is an opposite and equal reaction. Big highs
don't always mean big lows.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing close is a sensible, if unscientific, law of
Universal Karma and Economic Motion _ what goes up, must come down.
We are up now. We shall be down sometime.
</P>
<P>
   When? Tomorrow, say pop economists. The Y2K-fear books are
stacked on the remainder table to make room for new and scarier
titles. ``At the Crest of the Tidal Wave: A Forecast for the Great
Bear Market,'' ``Beat the Millennium Crash: Survive and Thrive in
the Coming Financial Cataclysm'' and ``The Return of Depression
Economics'' ...
</P>
<P>
   It's not as though there are no grounds to question the
permanance of the dot-com economy. But it seems that much of the
economic hand-wringing over the booming economy is not based on
charts and formulae. It comes from a sense that we just don't
deserve this. People are partying too hard and the next knock on
the door is bound to be the cops.
</P>
<P>
   There are critics out there who think the invisible hand of
economics is on the side of virtue and about to slap down a people
who are getting too arrogant, fat and silly. A beautiful economy
and, aye, we'll pay for it in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Yet sometimes the sun shines on people who don't deserve it. We
should be grateful for this and not freak out. As economist John
Maynard Keynes said: ``Long run is a misleading guide to current
affairs. In the long run, we are all dead.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too nice a day for long-run analysis.

 &HT;    Custom CDs, easy as pie
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The idea of mixing pizza and pop music is a
no-brainer. College students, the cooking-impaired and the just
plain lazy have kept takeout pizza joints in business for decades.
</P>
<P>
   So the promotional offline/online marriage of Pizza Hut and
CDNow draws attention not just to CDNow, an online purveyor of
music and music-related products, but to the world of custom CDs.
Everyone knows what pizza is, but this promotion just might send a
few pizza lovers online to make their own personalized CDs, which
is one of the cooler things you can do on the Web. It's 100 percent
legal and a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   The deal works like this: If you buy a certain type of pizza
from Pizza Hut, you get a code number to access a special area on
CDNow. Within that area, you'll be able to put together your own CD
that can include tracks from some pretty big stars including the
Red Hot Chili Peppers, Britney Spears, B.B. King and Dave Matthews
to name but a few.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Pizza Hut clearly see this as an opportunity to get
people to buy the pizza it sells instead of pizza from Domino's or
Papa John's. They know the young, hungry and wired crowd is
probably eating pizza while listening to CDs in their CD-ROM drives
while surfing the Web anyway. It's a stroke of marketing genius.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most exciting promotions Pizza Hut has ever
undertaken,'' Pizza Hut President Randy Gier said in a statement
that really isn't hype. ``Because it combines our national reach
and marketing power with CDNow's revolutionary custom music
technology to create a unique reason to bring new customers into
our restaurants. This promotion is also a great way for us to
provide our customers with a fun and free way to experience some of
the coolest, most advanced online music technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Gier has it exactly right. It is exciting, and it will bring
customers into Pizza Hut through the end of February to buy pizza
just so they can make a free CD.
</P>
<P>
   For CDNow, it's an opportunity to draw people to the site. Even
though CDNow was one of the first music sites on the Web, it now
faces stiff competition from a variety of sources, including
Amazon.com, various record stores and even the record labels
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   CDNow isn't the only Web site that offers users the opportunity
to make custom CDs, but the current promotion offers the best
selection of big-time artists. While the promotion offers you the
opportunity to make a free CD, if you happen to be a music fan who
doesn't like pizza, you can still go online and make your own
personalized CD.
</P>
<P>
   Custom CDs have been around on the Web for a while. Along with
CDNow and Tower Records' Web site, there are two sites,
Musicmaker.com and Customdisc.com, that let users choose from a
selection of songs from a variety of artists ranging from Frank
Sinatra to Nirvana. You can fill up your disc with at least 70
minutes of music for a manufacturing fee plus a charge (usually
under a dollar) for each song you select. You also get to play
record producer by arranging the order of the songs and then giving
your CD a title _ and in some cases you even get to pick out what
kind of cover design you'd like. The sound quality is also good.
</P>
<P>
   The other cool thing about building your own custom CD is you
can listen to each song before you decide to add it to your disc.
It's possible to sit and listen to music all day long and not buy a
thing.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to make a custom CD, the cost is usually about
$25.99 _ more than you'd probably pay for a CD on sale at the mall,
but then again it isn't customized to suit you and only you.
</P>
<P>
   Custom discs are compact discs that you can play on any CD
player in your home, car or office. They have nothing to do with
MP3, Liquid Audio or any other type of digital download technology.
Your disc comes in the mail several weeks after you place your
order, ready to play. Way back in the '80s, retail stores tried
offering consumers the opportunity to mix their own cassette tapes,
but it was far too labor-intensive for employees, and users would
spend hours in front of the machines sampling songs.
</P>
<P>
   There are some companies that want to bring the custom CD
concept to bricks-and-mortar record stores, but right now the Web
is the only place where music fans can compile their own CDs from a
variety of artists and songs for a pretty reasonable price. For
music lovers who want to make their dream desert island disc,
custom CD sites are definitely worth a visit, whether or not you
buy a pizza.

 &HT;    We've got a bone to Pika
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It was one of the hottest toys of the Christmas
season and now it takes its place as the Annoying Gadget of the
Week. It's Hasbro's Interactive Pikachu Plush. If you haven't
experienced this toy, consider yourself lucky. If you have
experienced this toy, you know how cute it is at first. The rotund
yellow toy's cheeks glow red and it coos Pika, Pika ... chuuuuuu!
or Pikachu! or Pika?Chu? Pikachu! This continues until you go
insane or rip the stuffing out of everyone's favorite Pokemon
character. You can find the Interactive Pikachu Plush in little
children's hands all across America. The critters have been seen in
restaurants, on buses and in movie theaters. My advice to anyone
who sees those little red, glowing cheeks or hears the cursed
Pikachu!: Run, run for your life.

 &HT;    Sound of success: Speakers no longer have to be massive and
expensive to get the job done
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No matter how much you invest in receivers, DVD
machines or digital recordings, nothing enhances the sound better
than choice speakers.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the speakers, collectively, amounted to
the lion's share of the cost of a good sound system. Today,
speakers that make a true difference are cheaper proportionally
than they were many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, experts say they last longer, because they are
manufactured from materials like polypropylene rather than the
fiber likely to be found in vintage speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The really good news is that the efficiency of speakers _ their
ability to work well with less raw power from the amplifiers _ has
improved, making speakers today smaller.
</P>
<P>
   That means speakers are more easily movable and can be located
in spots unthinkable just several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers that perform like the familiar towers of blessed memory
now can be mounted on bookshelves, on pedestals, or even hung from
ceilings and walls, leaving more space for the growing number of
machines for sound and video.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, it means that speakers can be used in ensembles
or systems _ not just the familiar enthusiast's setup with two
mountainous $2,000 Klipsch speakers, weighing about 50 pounds
apiece, topped off with a cute little tweeter horn atop each.
</P>
<P>
   Now the new standard, for music and so-called home theater,
involves five or six speakers. Manufacturers as diverse as Boston
Acoustic, JBL, Klipsch and others are producing such ``matched''
sets of speakers for less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrangement usually features three speakers across the
front and two rear speakers, with a powered subwoofer tucked away
almost anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The subwoofer is run by its own electrical power source and is
not a ``slave'' like the other speakers, which draw their power
directly from the amplifier. Because low frequencies are not
directional, the subwoofer can be put in a corner. It has always
taken more electrical power to produce the ground-shaking bass
notes than others, and that's why a separate power supply is used.
And that's also why the remaining speakers, mostly not bearing so
much of the bass responsibility, can be smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the apportioning of the sound production among the
six speakers means that each can carry out specific assignments,
behaving more like a team or an audio chorus surrounding the
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, where DVD is concerned, the system has to reproduce a
huge range of sounds ranging from crashes and crunches to whispers
and the tinkling of glasses. The speaking voices come from the very
important center channel speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, that speaker should have broad tonal range, but it
does not have great responsibility for bass.
</P>
<P>
   In one nice touch, a Bose center channel speaker, the VCS 10 for
$199 at Circuit City, looks terrific. It's has a long, low
silhouette that turns the head. It reminds us, especially the
old-timers, of the days when speakers were furniture, meant to
enhance the room. Now, function's mostly the thing.
</P>
<P>
   The two rear speakers and the front corner speakers should be
lively, eloquent in producing high notes and discerning in
separating the other sounds, giving what audio lovers call a
transparent sound.
</P>
<P>
   SPECIFICATIONS SIMILAR
</P>
<P>
   The odd thing about speakers is that they all tend to have
nearly the same numerical specifications, the numbers that show how
many cycles per second the speaker can reproduce. A zillion
kilohertz or cycles represent the high notes, and a kilohertz range
under 100, sometimes in the 25 to 30 range, represents the lows.
</P>
<P>
   But numbers aside, how do they sound?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is they sound different. Some speakers, like the old
reliable DCM TimeWindows and the newer JBL and Boston Acoustic
speakers, can produce a mellow sound that seems especially suited
to subtle music, like jazz and classical music, and crooning _
either in solos and in choruses.
</P>
<P>
   But the vibrant modern sounds, including movie soundtracks, come
across dramatically in speakers like the Klipsch set that I enjoyed
one day.
</P>
<P>
   The Klipsch Micro Quintet gets by with four speakers no larger
than alarm clocks, combined with a center channel speaker not much
larger, and a hefty subwoofer. But the little package fills a room
as home theater.
</P>
<P>
   There are other systems I like better for straight music, but
it's a matter of taste _ and you have to listen and compare.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that given the double mission of producing
home theater and the best in serious musical sounds, the priority
should be to plunk down the lion's share of investment across the
front with emphasis on the two front side speakers.
</P>
<P>
   When the theater is closed at the end of the day, and you want
to spend another mellow hour with Grieg, or Robert Shaw's
choristers or Sinatra or Miles Davis' ``Kinda Blue,'' the two
classically situated dual stereo speakers must keep the candle
glowing.
</P>
<P>
   That means speakers with good range and accurate but not
overbearing playback. What we used to call high fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   In this area, you get what you pay for, and few are better than
the Boston Acoustics floor standing towers with built-in powered
woofers, and similar machines by Mirage, JBL, Klipsch and others,
mostly in the range of $1,500 to $3,500 a pair.

 &HT;    Nyko components put the dream in Dreamcast
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE:
</P>
<P>
   Nyko has just released its total Dreamcast control and memory
system, and we're happy to report, it's a dream (get it?). For the
Sega system, the company introduced Dreammaster, Thunder Pak and
Jumbo Memory Pak 2x ($25, $15 and $35; www.nyko.com). The
Dreammaster is really an advance on the Sega controller. It feels
better in the hand and looks great with its purple, translucent
shell. The Thunder Pak does exactly what the Sega unit does but at
$10 cheaper. The icing on the Nyko cake is the Jumbo Memory Pak 2x.
Much has been written about the Dreamcast memory unit's memory _
the Sega memory unit saves very little and isn't worth the price.
The Nyko unit has two times the memory and is priced right. The
Jumbo Memory Pax 2x stores 400 blocks and allows you to save your
position in more than one game, which is a huge advance.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP:
</P>
<P>
   Squaresoft's Final Fantasy series has pushed the envelope on
console systems with great storylines, fantastic animation and
great adventures. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the PC
translation, especially their latest release, Final Fantasy VIII.
The game is an exact translation of last year's Playstation title,
which isn't all bad _ the game boasts some of the best
computer-generated animations in a game _ ever. It also has an epic
storyline that includes great battles and even greater romances,
and has a lengthy play life worthy of its five-CD package.
Unfortunately, the game does nothing to improve on the Playstation
version. You get menus that look like they belong on a console
system, graphics that actually look worse than on the Playstation
(even with a high-end video card), and controls that just aren't as
tight. And if you want flawless gameplay, you'd better have a fast
computer, or you'll be viewing the action in a quarter-screen,
low-resolution window just to keep the audio and video from
stuttering. Final Fantasy VIII isn't a nightmare, but like a lot of
console-to-PC ports, this one instead plays out like a mildly
diverting daydream.

 &HT;    Solving problems doesn't require knowing what's wrong
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My best lessons are the most unpleasant ones. Last
weekend I learned a lot. My home computer _ which has been so
reliable that I seldom give it a thought _ had a nervous breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Something wasn't wrong with it. Everything was wrong with it.
The cursor would freeze. It would lose track of modems and printers
and reinstall them every time I turned it on. Then I'd restart and
it would work for a while and stop again.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it just stopped working. It was an icy weekend and I
was stuck at home anyway, so I tried to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to follow the advice I give so often here. I played
detective and tried to remember the last big change I had made.
That's always a good place to start. I had recently added a better
video card, so I removed the new card and reinstalled the old one.
Things worked fine for a while and _ just when my arm was getting
sore from patting myself on the back _ the computer started showing
the same old symptoms again.
</P>
<P>
   So the first lesson is that when you have trouble, the chief
suspect should be the last device you put in or the last program
you installed.
</P>
<P>
   The second lesson is that the first lesson is sometimes wrong.
Life would be great _ for newspapermen, computer repair guys and
cops _ if the most logical suspect was always guilty.
</P>
<P>
   So, once again I dived into the computer. I removed and
reinserted every card. I remembered that when there is a big change
in temperature (and my house surely qualified since I just had a
three-day period without electricity because of an ice storm),
accessory cards such as those for video, modem, sound and the like
can expand and contract enough to unseat themselves a little from
the slot. That will cause an intermittent connection that can cause
a computer to act as odd as my Aunt Vera Mae.
</P>
<P>
   I tried that. Again, things seemed to work fine for a while and
then freeze up. (That's why it's important to wait a while between
changes when you are trying to fix a computer; some problems take a
while to pop up). Anyway, I put my detective hat back on and
remembered that there have been scattered trouble reports involving
the power-saving feature in Windows that powers down the monitor
and even the hard disk after a long period of inactivity. That's
it, I thought. So I went into the Control Panel, found the icon for
Power Management and told the computer never to shut off.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help. But at least I was getting a refresher course in
computer hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I decided to check the Web to see if there were newer and
better drivers for my new video card. A driver is a tiny software
program that lets the device communicate with the computer and vice
versa. That's a good idea with any new device. Manufacturers _
especially with a device that is new to the market (and my video
card is) _ are constantly finding bugs in early versions of
software and fixing them. No help this time.
</P>
<P>
   Finally I threw up my hands and decided to use the equivalent of
the atomic bomb. I backed up the information on my computer and
reformatted the hard disk. And I reinstalled Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Things worked beautifully after that.
</P>
<P>
   So what was wrong with my computer?
</P>
<P>
   Danged if I know. I'll never know now. But that's fine. The
object of this exercise was to fix my computer. And I did.
</P>
<P>
   So, keep the final and best lesson in mind when you have
troubles at home. Ask any computer repair person and they'll tell
you that reinstalling Windows _ especially if you go to the trouble
(and it is trouble) of a clean installation with a reformatted hard
disk _ cures most problems. And keep your sights set low. Unless
you are a hobbyist, you don't have to be able to explain the
problem. It's quite enough to fix it.

 &HT;    Sites detail how to survive Valentine's Day encounters
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's an art to Valentine's Day. The Web can help
but not in the way you might expect.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you could go to Blue Mountain's e-card site at
www1.bluemountain.com
</P>
<P>
   /eng/valentine/index.html and select from what seems to be
hundreds of choices for the day. There are animated cards,
schmaltzy cards, friendship cards, funny cards, about any kind of
electronic greeting card you can imagine. But if you go to the next
site on our Valentine's Day tour you may decide to skip Blue
Mountain altogether.
</P>
<P>
   It's called How to Avoid a Valentine's Day Massacre and is
located at www.menshealth
</P>
<P>
   .com/noframes/features
</P>
<P>
   /everyman/sex/rm7.html. The idea behind this site is to give
solid advice on what to give _ and, more importantly, what not to
give _ your valentine to avoid a massacre.
</P>
<P>
   So, let's take a look. There's no advice about e-cards, but
here's the advice you'll find for printed Valentine's Day cards:
</P>
<P>
   The gift: A Hallmark card. What you see: A last-minute remedy
for almost forgetting the holiday. What she sees: Another guy.
Strategy: Don't bother.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a gift the site recommended, on the other hand.
</P>
<P>
   The gift: A professional massage. What you see: A way to pass
the back-rub buck. What she sees: A man who knows what a woman
wants. Strategy: Give it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. Some people just aren't good at romance. And
that's the notion behind the site called Love Poems at www
</P>
<P>
   .seductionpalace.com
</P>
<P>
   /library/poems/poems.html. Not only will you find poems here,
you'll also get computerized help in selecting just the right one
to fit your particular circumstances. For instance, you can click
on categories such as: for a secret love, to the love of your life,
a marriage proposal, to a lover you fear may be leaving you, or to
rekindle old passion. The site will then find just the right words
to fit the situation.
</P>
<P>
   There are links at the same site that will provide suggestions
for music, recipes and gifts.
</P>
<P>
   All this may leave you wondering about the holiday itself.
There's help on the Web for that, too. The Catholic Encylopedia at
www.newadvent.org
</P>
<P>
   /cathen/15254a.htm will give you information on the history of
the day and about the real St. Valentines.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Valentines. There were three of them, all of them
martyrs according to Catholic doctrine. One is described as a
priest at Rome, another as bishop of Interamna (modern Terni) and a
third Saint Valentine, a rather obscure saint who suffered in
Africa with a number of companions, according to the encylopedia
and of whom it says ``nothing further is known.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the niftiest Valentine's Day sites on the Web this year
was produced by Atlanta's CNN. It's called Welcome to the Love Zone
and can be found at www
</P>
<P>
   .cnn.com/EVENTS/valentine/.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, you'll be presented with a series of links that
offer choices depending on your mood or situation. For instance,
you can press the link called ``She Loves Me'' and you'll find
poetry as well as a collection of news stories that play off that
theme. Press the link called ``She Loves Me Not'' and you'll get
sympathy _ ``So you're left with a tattoo that says, `Rita Forever'
and a bag of hacked up bits that was your heart'' _ as well as
another collection of news stories that play off that sadder theme.
</P>
<P>
   There also is a list of Valentine's Day links as well as some
musical recommendations: ``Embraceable You,'' Billie Holiday;
``L-O-V-E,'' Nat King Cole; ``I Fall to Pieces,'' Patsy Cline;
``Let's Stay Together,'' Al Green; and ``Crazy Love,'' Van
Morrison.

 &HT;    Overhauling operating system an ambitious move for Apple
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apple is preparing to embark on its most ambitious new
product since the introduction of the original Mac 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's called OS X (pronounced ``ten''), and this operating system
software introduces technologies that change not only the look but
the way your Mac will work.
</P>
<P>
   The change is a huge gamble for Apple. The company is moving
from a proven system, beloved by millions, to an unknown
replacement that will require Mac users to relearn much of how they
use their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Why take such a risk? In part, the answer is that Apple has no
choice. While it remains the easiest computer system to use, the
Mac OS is dated. Windows has not only incorporated most of the
Mac's original innovations but has added significant ones of its
own.
</P>
<P>
   To distinguish itself as the Windows alternative and retain its
mantle as the innovator, Apple has to make a big move.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: The Mac has lost a lot of its stability through
years of tinkering. Now many of the features cobbled onto the
original system will become an integrated part of OS X.
</P>
<P>
   So what is new in OS X? For starters, the system introduces
something called memory protection. What it does is put every
running application in a box. If one goes down, it doesn't take
everything else down with it. That new scheme should help Macs'
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Macs are crash-prone is that the current
operating system can't effectively handle the big memory
requirements of graphic programs such as Photoshop. Apple believes
it has licked this problem in OS X.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the current operating system, OS X automatically
allocates the right amount of memory needed by every application,
which should prevent the snafus that caused the previous system
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   While important, advanced memory management and protection are
invisible to most Mac users. What they'll notice is the zoomy new
look of their Macs, which some have likened to colorful bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   You'll still find the Mac's familiar motif of windows, menus,
buttons and icons. But they won't look much like what they used to.
</P>
<P>
   Icons will have the sharpness of photos. Menus are transparent
and cast shadows. Windows have rounded corners, and the buttons are
colorful little bubbles that resemble drops of water.

   There'll be something called the dock running along the bottom
of the screen. Think of it as a Windows start menu on steroids. It
will display sharply rendered icons that represent documents and
applications. These icons shrink proportionally as new items are
added to the dock, so that it always fits along the bottom of the
screen. Pass the mouse over an small icon, and it magnifies to a
preset size for legibility.
</P>
<P>
   These a just a few of the many design changes. I'll discuss
these changes at more length in future columns. For information and

 &HT;    Smut in the office?
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ First John Rocker, now this.
</P>
<P>
   A study by NetPulse shows that Southerners are more likely than
people from any other region to download pornography at work while
on break.
</P>
<P>
   If the recent peek into the mind of the Atlanta Braves relief
pitcher didn't make Southerners look bad enough, this might.
</P>
<P>
   The Web study was paid for by the folks at Pogo.com, a Web site
devoted to online versions of offline games like backgammon, euchre
and poker.
</P>
<P>
   But a solid 2 percent of the polled _ roughly 20 people _ were
bold enough to download porn on the boss's bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   Southerners were three times as likely to download porn as folks
from the East Coast, and apparently it would be twice as easy to
find a porn-looker at a workplace in the South than it would on the
West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The tendency to hunt for online pictures of naked people is
found most often in white-collar workers, defined as people earning
more than $75,000 a year, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Unmarried employees were four times as likely as their
spoken-for co-workers to enjoy looking for X-rated material while
at work.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, male porn fans outnumbered females 20 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   NetPulse is a weekly survey that polls a panel of 1,000 people
who are weighted by age, gender and region to represent Internet
users.
</P>
<P>
   JOINING TV, NET
</P>
<P>
   You might have seen the ads during the Super Bowl in which ABC
was trying to steer viewers toward its ``enhanced TV'' function,
which blends television show with Web site. But is anyone really
sitting there, mouse in one hand, clicker in the other?
</P>
<P>
   According to Cyber Dialogue, some are.
</P>
<P>
   The Web research firm found that 10 million people visit Web
sites and watch TV at the same time. Of those, one of every four is
doing it during a sporting event. The next most commonly watched
and surfed events are situation comedies and news magazines, each
of which attracted 13 percent of those polled. General news, games
and product information sites also attracted visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people polled, 66 percent, were not taking full
advantage of enhanced television's features. About two-thirds of
the people polled were online and just had the television on in the
background, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Dialogue's survey included interviews with 1,000 Internet
users and 1,000 nonusers. The survey has been conducted every three
months since 1994. Cyber Dialogue is an Internet customer
relationship management company that offers data and services that
help businesses target online consumers.

   HOT DOG SITE A REAL WIENER
</P>
<P>
   The hot dog is the cockroach of foods. Upton Sinclair couldn't
kill it early last century with his literary expose on the
meat-packing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of jokes about what exactly goes in them has not
dampened people's taste buds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, we ate 20 billion hot dogs, 7 billion between
Memorial Day and Labor Day. That's roughly 73 hot dogs for every
American. A new Web site is devoted to the study and appreciation
of our love of encased pork and beef byproducts.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.hot-dog.org/, is sponsored by the National Hot Dog
and Sausage Council and the American Meat Institute. It is
apparently designed to counter negative perceptions about wieners.
The material sounds a little defensive. For example, the site
includes ``the real story'' of how hot dogs are made:
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of hot dogs and sausages consist of the same
high-quality meats that shoppers buy straight out of their grocer's
meat case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confused about what goes into processed meat products like
sausage and hot dogs? You are probably not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``For literally centuries, hot dogs and sausages have suffered
from more than their fair share of misperceptions about their
content and manufacture.''
</P>
<P>
   The site includes recipes for such things as sausage pancake
puffs, sausage stir-fry and sausage pie.

 &HT;    Time line a nice feature of Grolier's encyclopedia
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A year or so ago, after my annual examination of new
editions of the electronic encyclopedias, I got an e-mail from a
gentleman scolding me for failing to warn him that the encyclopedia
he was about to buy didn't even mention his favorite war.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot remember which war that was; suffice it to say it was a
very old one. This reader was very put out with my tendency to
compare such frippery things as flamenco and didgeridoo while
utterly ignoring military history.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember which encyclopedia it was, either, although I
certainly would have whacked it a good one for failing to include
some mention of any European war. I don't blame the fellow for
being incensed about that.
</P>
<P>
   But it's no good expecting someone like me to go hunting for
obscure 13th century conflicts since I'm not interested in them,
know nothing about them and wouldn't even notice if one were
overlooked. Thus are the vagaries of critical reviews; the reviewer
who does not stick with what he knows, however peculiar and useless
that may be, is going to get into big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   So with that windy preamble, we take up the portentously named
Year 2000 Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   As with nearly all the electronic encyclopedias, it is aimed at
the younger students.
</P>
<P>
   Its most outstanding feature, I think, is a historic time line
that can be viewed in a couple of ways. The time line gives the
viewer a brief look at each century of the past millennium in terms
of major events, science and technology, religion and philosophy,
literature and art.
</P>
<P>
   The more common sort of time line, breaking history into smaller
increments, includes a host of concurrent lines _ for India, China,
Europe and Russia, and three others, usually devoted to the
Americas but sometimes broken into other categories such as science
and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Grolier's article on flamenco is very brief but surprisingly
accurate, in comparison to most. There is no audio example, and the
accompanying photo shows a couple dancing sevillanas, which is not
exactly flamenco. The article on bullfighting is also satisfactory,
and it gets three illustrations, two of them most unfortunate. The
color photo shows El Cordobes performing one of his uncommonly
awkward and ugly passes, and another shows Manolete placing
banderillas, which is essentially beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   As with all the other encyclopedias save Microsoft's, music is a
mixed bag. Why bother to adorn the article on Jimmy Rodgers with a
clip from ``Mule Skinner Blues'' if it's going to be performed on
the synthesizer? He's a singer, for goodness sake. Let's hear him
sing.
</P>
<P>
   Among classical selections, you never know what you're going to
hear. A good deal of the orchestral music is really played by an
orchestra, some of the recordings very recent and full-bodied,
others sounding as if they were taken off an old 78. Then you come
up against something like Bruch's G minor concerto rendered on the
synthesizer.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose all this musical ducking and dodging is an attempt to
save money by avoiding royalties, and of course MIDI files don't
take up as much room. With these encyclopedias, now all expanding
to two discs, going for cheap, I suppose it can't be helped.
</P>
<P>
   As for my old correspondent's interests, I cannot offer advice.
Under ``war'' in the list of articles, we have War, War and Peace,
War Crimes, War of 1812, War of the Worlds and War on Poverty.
However, one can summon a subdivision of either European History or
Military History. The latter, at least, seems pretty exhaustive,
right down to a paragraph on Hereward the Wake, an 11th century
Anglo-Saxon rebel who fought the Normans under William I and sacked
Peterborough Abbey.
</P>
<P>
   Grolier's is a perfectly serviceable encyclopedia for primary
and secondary school students. It has easily used online links to a
number of other research sources. Its suggested retail price is
$60.

 &HT;    We've got a bone to Pika
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It was one of the hottest toys of the Christmas
season and now it takes its place as the Annoying Gadget of the
Week. It's Hasbro's Interactive Pikachu Plush. If you haven't
experienced this toy, consider yourself lucky. If you have
experienced this toy, you know how cute it is at first. The rotund
yellow toy's cheeks glow red and it coos Pika, Pika ... chuuuuuu!
or Pikachu! or Pika?Chu? Pikachu! This continues until you go
insane or rip the stuffing out of everyone's favorite Pokemon
character. You can find the Interactive Pikachu Plush in little
children's hands all across America. The critters have been seen in
restaurants, on buses and in movie theaters. My advice to anyone
who sees those little red, glowing cheeks or hears the cursed
Pikachu!: Run, run for your life.

 &HT;    Nyko components put the dream in Dreamcast
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE:
</P>
<P>
   Nyko has just released its total Dreamcast control and memory
system, and we're happy to report, it's a dream (get it?). For the
Sega system, the company introduced Dreammaster, Thunder Pak and
Jumbo Memory Pak 2x ($25, $15 and $35; www.nyko.com). The
Dreammaster is really an advance on the Sega controller. It feels
better in the hand and looks great with its purple, translucent
shell. The Thunder Pak does exactly what the Sega unit does but at
$10 cheaper. The icing on the Nyko cake is the Jumbo Memory Pak 2x.
Much has been written about the Dreamcast memory unit's memory _
the Sega memory unit saves very little and isn't worth the price.
The Nyko unit has two times the memory and is priced right. The
Jumbo Memory Pax 2x stores 400 blocks and allows you to save your
position in more than one game, which is a huge advance.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP:
</P>
<P>
   Squaresoft's Final Fantasy series has pushed the envelope on
console systems with great storylines, fantastic animation and
great adventures. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the PC
translation, especially their latest release, Final Fantasy VIII.
The game is an exact translation of last year's Playstation title,
which isn't all bad _ the game boasts some of the best
computer-generated animations in a game _ ever. It also has an epic
storyline that includes great battles and even greater romances,
and has a lengthy play life worthy of its five-CD package.
Unfortunately, the game does nothing to improve on the Playstation
version. You get menus that look like they belong on a console
system, graphics that actually look worse than on the Playstation
(even with a high-end video card), and controls that just aren't as
tight. And if you want flawless gameplay, you'd better have a fast
computer, or you'll be viewing the action in a quarter-screen,
low-resolution window just to keep the audio and video from
stuttering. Final Fantasy VIII isn't a nightmare, but like a lot of
console-to-PC ports, this one instead plays out like a mildly
diverting daydream.

 &HT;    Solving problems doesn't require knowing what's wrong
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My best lessons are the most unpleasant ones. Last
weekend I learned a lot. My home computer _ which has been so
reliable that I seldom give it a thought _ had a nervous breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Something wasn't wrong with it. Everything was wrong with it.
The cursor would freeze. It would lose track of modems and printers
and reinstall them every time I turned it on. Then I'd restart and
it would work for a while and stop again.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it just stopped working. It was an icy weekend and I
was stuck at home anyway, so I tried to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to follow the advice I give so often here. I played
detective and tried to remember the last big change I had made.
That's always a good place to start. I had recently added a better
video card, so I removed the new card and reinstalled the old one.
Things worked fine for a while and _ just when my arm was getting
sore from patting myself on the back _ the computer started showing
the same old symptoms again.
</P>
<P>
   So the first lesson is that when you have trouble, the chief
suspect should be the last device you put in or the last program
you installed.
</P>
<P>
   The second lesson is that the first lesson is sometimes wrong.
Life would be great _ for newspapermen, computer repair guys and
cops _ if the most logical suspect was always guilty.
</P>
<P>
   So, once again I dived into the computer. I removed and
reinserted every card. I remembered that when there is a big change
in temperature (and my house surely qualified since I just had a
three-day period without electricity because of an ice storm),
accessory cards such as those for video, modem, sound and the like
can expand and contract enough to unseat themselves a little from
the slot. That will cause an intermittent connection that can cause
a computer to act as odd as my Aunt Vera Mae.
</P>
<P>
   I tried that. Again, things seemed to work fine for a while and
then freeze up. (That's why it's important to wait a while between
changes when you are trying to fix a computer; some problems take a
while to pop up). Anyway, I put my detective hat back on and
remembered that there have been scattered trouble reports involving
the power-saving feature in Windows that powers down the monitor
and even the hard disk after a long period of inactivity. That's
it, I thought. So I went into the Control Panel, found the icon for
Power Management and told the computer never to shut off.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help. But at least I was getting a refresher course in
computer hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I decided to check the Web to see if there were newer and
better drivers for my new video card. A driver is a tiny software
program that lets the device communicate with the computer and vice
versa. That's a good idea with any new device. Manufacturers _
especially with a device that is new to the market (and my video
card is) _ are constantly finding bugs in early versions of
software and fixing them. No help this time.
</P>
<P>
   Finally I threw up my hands and decided to use the equivalent of
the atomic bomb. I backed up the information on my computer and
reformatted the hard disk. And I reinstalled Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Things worked beautifully after that.
</P>
<P>
   So what was wrong with my computer?
</P>
<P>
   Danged if I know. I'll never know now. But that's fine. The
object of this exercise was to fix my computer. And I did.
</P>
<P>
   So, keep the final and best lesson in mind when you have
troubles at home. Ask any computer repair person and they'll tell
you that reinstalling Windows _ especially if you go to the trouble
(and it is trouble) of a clean installation with a reformatted hard
disk _ cures most problems. And keep your sights set low. Unless
you are a hobbyist, you don't have to be able to explain the
problem. It's quite enough to fix it.

 &HT;    Sites detail how to survive Valentine's Day encounters
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's an art to Valentine's Day. The Web can help
but not in the way you might expect.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you could go to Blue Mountain's e-card site at
www1.bluemountain.com
</P>
<P>
   /eng/valentine/index.html and select from what seems to be
hundreds of choices for the day. There are animated cards,
schmaltzy cards, friendship cards, funny cards, about any kind of
electronic greeting card you can imagine. But if you go to the next
site on our Valentine's Day tour you may decide to skip Blue
Mountain altogether.
</P>
<P>
   It's called How to Avoid a Valentine's Day Massacre and is
located at www.menshealth
</P>
<P>
   .com/noframes/features
</P>
<P>
   /everyman/sex/rm7.html. The idea behind this site is to give
solid advice on what to give _ and, more importantly, what not to
give _ your valentine to avoid a massacre.
</P>
<P>
   So, let's take a look. There's no advice about e-cards, but
here's the advice you'll find for printed Valentine's Day cards:
</P>
<P>
   The gift: A Hallmark card. What you see: A last-minute remedy
for almost forgetting the holiday. What she sees: Another guy.
Strategy: Don't bother.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a gift the site recommended, on the other hand.
</P>
<P>
   The gift: A professional massage. What you see: A way to pass
the back-rub buck. What she sees: A man who knows what a woman
wants. Strategy: Give it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. Some people just aren't good at romance. And
that's the notion behind the site called Love Poems at www
</P>
<P>
   .seductionpalace.com
</P>
<P>
   /library/poems/poems.html. Not only will you find poems here,
you'll also get computerized help in selecting just the right one
to fit your particular circumstances. For instance, you can click
on categories such as: for a secret love, to the love of your life,
a marriage proposal, to a lover you fear may be leaving you, or to
rekindle old passion. The site will then find just the right words
to fit the situation.
</P>
<P>
   There are links at the same site that will provide suggestions
for music, recipes and gifts.
</P>
<P>
   All this may leave you wondering about the holiday itself.
There's help on the Web for that, too. The Catholic Encylopedia at
www.newadvent.org
</P>
<P>
   /cathen/15254a.htm will give you information on the history of
the day and about the real St. Valentines.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Valentines. There were three of them, all of them
martyrs according to Catholic doctrine. One is described as a
priest at Rome, another as bishop of Interamna (modern Terni) and a
third Saint Valentine, a rather obscure saint who suffered in
Africa with a number of companions, according to the encylopedia
and of whom it says ``nothing further is known.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the niftiest Valentine's Day sites on the Web this year
was produced by Atlanta's CNN. It's called Welcome to the Love Zone
and can be found at www
</P>
<P>
   .cnn.com/EVENTS/valentine/.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, you'll be presented with a series of links that
offer choices depending on your mood or situation. For instance,
you can press the link called ``She Loves Me'' and you'll find
poetry as well as a collection of news stories that play off that
theme. Press the link called ``She Loves Me Not'' and you'll get
sympathy _ ``So you're left with a tattoo that says, `Rita Forever'
and a bag of hacked up bits that was your heart'' _ as well as
another collection of news stories that play off that sadder theme.
</P>
<P>
   There also is a list of Valentine's Day links as well as some
musical recommendations: ``Embraceable You,'' Billie Holiday;
``L-O-V-E,'' Nat King Cole; ``I Fall to Pieces,'' Patsy Cline;
``Let's Stay Together,'' Al Green; and ``Crazy Love,'' Van
Morrison.

 &HT;    Overhauling operating system an ambitious move for Apple
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apple is preparing to embark on its most ambitious new
product since the introduction of the original Mac 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's called OS X (pronounced ``ten''), and this operating system
software introduces technologies that change not only the look but
the way your Mac will work.
</P>
<P>
   The change is a huge gamble for Apple. The company is moving
from a proven system, beloved by millions, to an unknown
replacement that will require Mac users to relearn much of how they
use their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Why take such a risk? In part, the answer is that Apple has no
choice. While it remains the easiest computer system to use, the
Mac OS is dated. Windows has not only incorporated most of the
Mac's original innovations but has added significant ones of its
own.
</P>
<P>
   To distinguish itself as the Windows alternative and retain its
mantle as the innovator, Apple has to make a big move.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: The Mac has lost a lot of its stability through
years of tinkering. Now many of the features cobbled onto the
original system will become an integrated part of OS X.
</P>
<P>
   So what is new in OS X? For starters, the system introduces
something called memory protection. What it does is put every
running application in a box. If one goes down, it doesn't take
everything else down with it. That new scheme should help Macs'
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Macs are crash-prone is that the current
operating system can't effectively handle the big memory
requirements of graphic programs such as Photoshop. Apple believes
it has licked this problem in OS X.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the current operating system, OS X automatically
allocates the right amount of memory needed by every application,
which should prevent the snafus that caused the previous system
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   While important, advanced memory management and protection are
invisible to most Mac users. What they'll notice is the zoomy new
look of their Macs, which some have likened to colorful bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   You'll still find the Mac's familiar motif of windows, menus,
buttons and icons. But they won't look much like what they used to.
</P>
<P>
   Icons will have the sharpness of photos. Menus are transparent
and cast shadows. Windows have rounded corners, and the buttons are
colorful little bubbles that resemble drops of water.
</P>
<P>
   There'll be something called the dock running along the bottom
of the screen. Think of it as a Windows start menu on steroids. It
will display sharply rendered icons that represent documents and
applications. These icons shrink proportionally as new items are
added to the dock, so that it always fits along the bottom of the
screen. Pass the mouse over an small icon, and it magnifies to a
preset size for legibility.
</P>
<P>
   These a just a few of the many design changes. I'll discuss
these changes at more length in future columns. For information and
snapshots of OS X, check out Apple's promotion Web site at
www.apple.com/macosx.

 &HT;    Custom CDs, easy as pie
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The idea of mixing pizza and pop music is a
no-brainer. College students, the cooking-impaired and the just
plain lazy have kept takeout pizza joints in business for decades.
</P>
<P>
   So the promotional offline/online marriage of Pizza Hut and
CDNow draws attention not just to CDNow, an online purveyor of
music and music-related products, but to the world of custom CDs.
Everyone knows what pizza is, but this promotion just might send a
few pizza lovers online to make their own personalized CDs, which
is one of the cooler things you can do on the Web. It's 100 percent
legal and a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   The deal works like this: If you buy a certain type of pizza
from Pizza Hut, you get a code number to access a special area on
CDNow. Within that area, you'll be able to put together your own CD
that can include tracks from some pretty big stars including the
Red Hot Chili Peppers, Britney Spears, B.B. King and Dave Matthews
to name but a few.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Pizza Hut clearly see this as an opportunity to get
people to buy the pizza it sells instead of pizza from Domino's or
Papa John's. They know the young, hungry and wired crowd is
probably eating pizza while listening to CDs in their CD-ROM drives
while surfing the Web anyway. It's a stroke of marketing genius.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most exciting promotions Pizza Hut has ever
undertaken,'' Pizza Hut President Randy Gier said in a statement
that really isn't hype. ``Because it combines our national reach
and marketing power with CDNow's revolutionary custom music
technology to create a unique reason to bring new customers into
our restaurants. This promotion is also a great way for us to
provide our customers with a fun and free way to experience some of
the coolest, most advanced online music technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Gier has it exactly right. It is exciting, and it will bring
customers into Pizza Hut through the end of February to buy pizza
just so they can make a free CD.
</P>
<P>
   For CDNow, it's an opportunity to draw people to the site. Even
though CDNow was one of the first music sites on the Web, it now
faces stiff competition from a variety of sources, including
Amazon.com, various record stores and even the record labels
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   CDNow isn't the only Web site that offers users the opportunity
to make custom CDs, but the current promotion offers the best
selection of big-time artists. While the promotion offers you the
opportunity to make a free CD, if you happen to be a music fan who
doesn't like pizza, you can still go online and make your own
personalized CD.
</P>
<P>
   Custom CDs have been around on the Web for a while. Along with
CDNow and Tower Records' Web site, there are two sites,
Musicmaker.com and Customdisc.com, that let users choose from a
selection of songs from a variety of artists ranging from Frank
Sinatra to Nirvana. You can fill up your disc with at least 70
minutes of music for a manufacturing fee plus a charge (usually
under a dollar) for each song you select. You also get to play
record producer by arranging the order of the songs and then giving
your CD a title _ and in some cases you even get to pick out what
kind of cover design you'd like. The sound quality is also good.
</P>
<P>
   The other cool thing about building your own custom CD is you
can listen to each song before you decide to add it to your disc.
It's possible to sit and listen to music all day long and not buy a
thing.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to make a custom CD, the cost is usually about
$25.99 _ more than you'd probably pay for a CD on sale at the mall,
but then again it isn't customized to suit you and only you.
</P>
<P>
   Custom discs are compact discs that you can play on any CD
player in your home, car or office. They have nothing to do with
MP3, Liquid Audio or any other type of digital download technology.
Your disc comes in the mail several weeks after you place your
order, ready to play. Way back in the '80s, retail stores tried
offering consumers the opportunity to mix their own cassette tapes,
but it was far too labor-intensive for employees, and users would
spend hours in front of the machines sampling songs.
</P>
<P>
   There are some companies that want to bring the custom CD
concept to bricks-and-mortar record stores, but right now the Web
is the only place where music fans can compile their own CDs from a
variety of artists and songs for a pretty reasonable price. For
music lovers who want to make their dream desert island disc,
custom CD sites are definitely worth a visit, whether or not you
buy a pizza.

 &HT;    Sound of success: Speakers no longer have to be massive and
expensive to get the job done
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No matter how much you invest in receivers, DVD
machines or digital recordings, nothing enhances the sound better
than choice speakers.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the speakers, collectively, amounted to
the lion's share of the cost of a good sound system. Today,
speakers that make a true difference are cheaper proportionally
than they were many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, experts say they last longer, because they are
manufactured from materials like polypropylene rather than the
fiber likely to be found in vintage speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The really good news is that the efficiency of speakers _ their
ability to work well with less raw power from the amplifiers _ has
improved, making speakers today smaller.
</P>
<P>
   That means speakers are more easily movable and can be located
in spots unthinkable just several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers that perform like the familiar towers of blessed memory
now can be mounted on bookshelves, on pedestals, or even hung from
ceilings and walls, leaving more space for the growing number of
machines for sound and video.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, it means that speakers can be used in ensembles
or systems _ not just the familiar enthusiast's setup with two
mountainous $2,000 Klipsch speakers, weighing about 50 pounds
apiece, topped off with a cute little tweeter horn atop each.
</P>
<P>
   Now the new standard, for music and so-called home theater,
involves five or six speakers. Manufacturers as diverse as Boston
Acoustic, JBL, Klipsch and others are producing such ``matched''
sets of speakers for less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrangement usually features three speakers across the
front and two rear speakers, with a powered subwoofer tucked away
almost anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The subwoofer is run by its own electrical power source and is
not a ``slave'' like the other speakers, which draw their power
directly from the amplifier. Because low frequencies are not
directional, the subwoofer can be put in a corner. It has always
taken more electrical power to produce the ground-shaking bass
notes than others, and that's why a separate power supply is used.
And that's also why the remaining speakers, mostly not bearing so
much of the bass responsibility, can be smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the apportioning of the sound production among the
six speakers means that each can carry out specific assignments,
behaving more like a team or an audio chorus surrounding the
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, where DVD is concerned, the system has to reproduce a
huge range of sounds ranging from crashes and crunches to whispers
and the tinkling of glasses. The speaking voices come from the very
important center channel speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, that speaker should have broad tonal range, but it
does not have great responsibility for bass.
</P>
<P>
   In one nice touch, a Bose center channel speaker, the VCS 10 for
$199 at Circuit City, looks terrific. It's has a long, low
silhouette that turns the head. It reminds us, especially the
old-timers, of the days when speakers were furniture, meant to
enhance the room. Now, function's mostly the thing.
</P>
<P>
   The two rear speakers and the front corner speakers should be
lively, eloquent in producing high notes and discerning in
separating the other sounds, giving what audio lovers call a
transparent sound.
</P>
<P>
   SPECIFICATIONS SIMILAR
</P>
<P>
   The odd thing about speakers is that they all tend to have
nearly the same numerical specifications, the numbers that show how
many cycles per second the speaker can reproduce. A zillion
kilohertz or cycles represent the high notes, and a kilohertz range
under 100, sometimes in the 25 to 30 range, represents the lows.
</P>
<P>
   But numbers aside, how do they sound?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is they sound different. Some speakers, like the old
reliable DCM TimeWindows and the newer JBL and Boston Acoustic
speakers, can produce a mellow sound that seems especially suited
to subtle music, like jazz and classical music, and crooning _
either in solos and in choruses.
</P>
<P>
   But the vibrant modern sounds, including movie soundtracks, come
across dramatically in speakers like the Klipsch set that I enjoyed
one day.
</P>
<P>
   The Klipsch Micro Quintet gets by with four speakers no larger
than alarm clocks, combined with a center channel speaker not much
larger, and a hefty subwoofer. But the little package fills a room
as home theater.
</P>
<P>
   There are other systems I like better for straight music, but
it's a matter of taste _ and you have to listen and compare.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that given the double mission of producing
home theater and the best in serious musical sounds, the priority
should be to plunk down the lion's share of investment across the
front with emphasis on the two front side speakers.
</P>
<P>
   When the theater is closed at the end of the day, and you want
to spend another mellow hour with Grieg, or Robert Shaw's
choristers or Sinatra or Miles Davis' ``Kinda Blue,'' the two
classically situated dual stereo speakers must keep the candle
glowing.
</P>
<P>
   That means speakers with good range and accurate but not
overbearing playback. What we used to call high fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   In this area, you get what you pay for, and few are better than
the Boston Acoustics floor standing towers with built-in powered
woofers, and similar machines by Mirage, JBL, Klipsch and others,
mostly in the range of $1,500 to $3,500 a pair.

 &HT;    Smut in the office?
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ First John Rocker, now this.
</P>
<P>
   A study by NetPulse shows that Southerners are more likely than
people from any other region to download pornography at work while
on break.
</P>
<P>
   If the recent peek into the mind of the Atlanta Braves relief
pitcher didn't make Southerners look bad enough, this might.
</P>
<P>
   The Web study was paid for by the folks at Pogo.com, a Web site
devoted to online versions of offline games like backgammon, euchre
and poker.
</P>
<P>
   But a solid 2 percent of the polled _ roughly 20 people _ were
bold enough to download porn on the boss's bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   Southerners were three times as likely to download porn as folks
from the East Coast, and apparently it would be twice as easy to
find a porn-looker at a workplace in the South than it would on the
West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The tendency to hunt for online pictures of naked people is
found most often in white-collar workers, defined as people earning
more than $75,000 a year, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Unmarried employees were four times as likely as their
spoken-for co-workers to enjoy looking for X-rated material while
at work.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, male porn fans outnumbered females 20 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   NetPulse is a weekly survey that polls a panel of 1,000 people
who are weighted by age, gender and region to represent Internet
users.
</P>
<P>
   JOINING TV, NET
</P>
<P>
   You might have seen the ads during the Super Bowl in which ABC
was trying to steer viewers toward its ``enhanced TV'' function,
which blends television show with Web site. But is anyone really
sitting there, mouse in one hand, clicker in the other?
</P>
<P>
   According to Cyber Dialogue, some are.
</P>
<P>
   The Web research firm found that 10 million people visit Web
sites and watch TV at the same time. Of those, one of every four is
doing it during a sporting event. The next most commonly watched
and surfed events are situation comedies and news magazines, each
of which attracted 13 percent of those polled. General news, games
and product information sites also attracted visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people polled, 66 percent, were not taking full
advantage of enhanced television's features. About two-thirds of
the people polled were online and just had the television on in the
background, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Dialogue's survey included interviews with 1,000 Internet
users and 1,000 nonusers. The survey has been conducted every three
months since 1994. Cyber Dialogue is an Internet customer
relationship management company that offers data and services that
help businesses target online consumers.

   HOT DOG SITE A REAL WIENER
</P>
<P>
   The hot dog is the cockroach of foods. Upton Sinclair couldn't
kill it early last century with his literary expose on the
meat-packing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of jokes about what exactly goes in them has not
dampened people's taste buds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, we ate 20 billion hot dogs, 7 billion between
Memorial Day and Labor Day. That's roughly 73 hot dogs for every
American. A new Web site is devoted to the study and appreciation
of our love of encased pork and beef byproducts.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.hot-dog.org/, is sponsored by the National Hot Dog
and Sausage Council and the American Meat Institute. It is
apparently designed to counter negative perceptions about wieners.
The material sounds a little defensive. For example, the site
includes ``the real story'' of how hot dogs are made:
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of hot dogs and sausages consist of the same
high-quality meats that shoppers buy straight out of their grocer's
meat case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confused about what goes into processed meat products like
sausage and hot dogs? You are probably not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``For literally centuries, hot dogs and sausages have suffered
from more than their fair share of misperceptions about their
content and manufacture.''
</P>
<P>
   The site includes recipes for such things as sausage pancake
puffs, sausage stir-fry and sausage pie.

 &HT;    Time line a nice feature of Grolier's encyclopedia
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A year or so ago, after my annual examination of new
editions of the electronic encyclopedias, I got an e-mail from a
gentleman scolding me for failing to warn him that the encyclopedia
he was about to buy didn't even mention his favorite war.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot remember which war that was; suffice it to say it was a
very old one. This reader was very put out with my tendency to
compare such frippery things as flamenco and didgeridoo while
utterly ignoring military history.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember which encyclopedia it was, either, although I
certainly would have whacked it a good one for failing to include
some mention of any European war. I don't blame the fellow for
being incensed about that.
</P>
<P>
   But it's no good expecting someone like me to go hunting for
obscure 13th century conflicts since I'm not interested in them,
know nothing about them and wouldn't even notice if one were
overlooked. Thus are the vagaries of critical reviews; the reviewer
who does not stick with what he knows, however peculiar and useless
that may be, is going to get into big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   So with that windy preamble, we take up the portentously named
Year 2000 Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   As with nearly all the electronic encyclopedias, it is aimed at
the younger students.
</P>
<P>
   Its most outstanding feature, I think, is a historic time line
that can be viewed in a couple of ways. The time line gives the
viewer a brief look at each century of the past millennium in terms
of major events, science and technology, religion and philosophy,
literature and art.
</P>
<P>
   The more common sort of time line, breaking history into smaller
increments, includes a host of concurrent lines _ for India, China,
Europe and Russia, and three others, usually devoted to the
Americas but sometimes broken into other categories such as science
and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Grolier's article on flamenco is very brief but surprisingly
accurate, in comparison to most. There is no audio example, and the
accompanying photo shows a couple dancing sevillanas, which is not
exactly flamenco. The article on bullfighting is also satisfactory,
and it gets three illustrations, two of them most unfortunate. The
color photo shows El Cordobes performing one of his uncommonly
awkward and ugly passes, and another shows Manolete placing
banderillas, which is essentially beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   As with all the other encyclopedias save Microsoft's, music is a
mixed bag. Why bother to adorn the article on Jimmy Rodgers with a
clip from ``Mule Skinner Blues'' if it's going to be performed on
the synthesizer? He's a singer, for goodness sake. Let's hear him
sing.
</P>
<P>
   Among classical selections, you never know what you're going to
hear. A good deal of the orchestral music is really played by an
orchestra, some of the recordings very recent and full-bodied,
others sounding as if they were taken off an old 78. Then you come
up against something like Bruch's G minor concerto rendered on the
synthesizer.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose all this musical ducking and dodging is an attempt to
save money by avoiding royalties, and of course MIDI files don't
take up as much room. With these encyclopedias, now all expanding
to two discs, going for cheap, I suppose it can't be helped.
</P>
<P>
   As for my old correspondent's interests, I cannot offer advice.
Under ``war'' in the list of articles, we have War, War and Peace,
War Crimes, War of 1812, War of the Worlds and War on Poverty.
However, one can summon a subdivision of either European History or
Military History. The latter, at least, seems pretty exhaustive,
right down to a paragraph on Hereward the Wake, an 11th century
Anglo-Saxon rebel who fought the Normans under William I and sacked
Peterborough Abbey.
</P>
<P>
   Grolier's is a perfectly serviceable encyclopedia for primary
and secondary school students. It has easily used online links to a
number of other research sources. Its suggested retail price is
$60.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _Q: My neighbor and I
<TEXT>
have a friendly wager; if he wins I mow his lawn, and if I win he
mows my lawn. The question: Since 1970, which team has had more
college football players drafted into the NFL, Ohio State or
Nebraska? P.S. I am from Nebraska ... Go Big Red!!! P.P.S. Where
does Texas rank?? _ Mark Brewster
<P>
   A: How about comparing Nebraska and the University of Texas?
Neither Ohio State nor the NFL could provide stats for the
Buckeyes. Since 1970, the University of Nebraska has had 206 NFL
drafts and Texas, 133. Looks like you may get a free mow.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter had an attorney through Legal Aid represent her
in a divorce. Her husband got the house. He now tells her that she
and their small children must be out in two weeks. He told her that
if she doesn't leave on time, he will bring the sheriff to put them
all out. Who can we call to file a complaint against her attorney?
_ C.T.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Without knowing the language of the divorce decree it is
difficult to advise someone,'' says Karen Kretschman, an attorney
board-certified in family law, ``but I am not surprised by the
two-week time period.'' Did your daughter agree to these terms,
receive a divorce decreed by a judge or by default, and was there a
trial? In any case, the sheriff does not enforce divorce decrees.
He enforces eviction notices. Your ex-son-in-law may need one to
force your daughter out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently saw a book on Martin Luther King Jr. that showed
pictures of the inside of his home. On one wall was a framed
photograph of Mahatma Gandhi. I would love your help in locating a
photograph of Gandhi suitable for framing. Peace.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   A: The M.K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence, founded by
grandson, Arun Gandhi, sells Gandhi paraphernalia such as
photographs. Proceeds go to the Institute, which promotes the
principles of nonviolence. They have a variety of picture sizes.
Prices begin at $6. The contacts? The M.K. Gandhi Institute for
Nonviolence, Christian Brothers University, 650 East Parkway South,
Memphis, TN 38104, orwww.cbu.edu/Gandhi/ or (901) 452-2824.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Most weather forecasters on local television stations refer
to the average temperature as the ``normal'' temperature for a
date. Wouldn't it be more accurate to use the word ``average?''
``Normal'' insinuates the high and low temperatures are the same
from year to year, while we all know that the weather forecasters
are simply giving us an ``average'' of temperatures recorded
through the years. What do you think?
</P>
<P>
   _Tommy Ryan
</P>
<P>
   Q: The normal is an average, an average that is recomputed every
10 years. Mark Murray, a meteorologist, says, ``When we give the
normal high, low and rainfall, we're using a 30-year average for
the years 1961-1990. These normals are updated every 10 years.''
Next year, those averages will be updated to reflect 1971-2000.
Murray expects that since the 1990s have been such a warm decade
(1999 was the warmest ever for Austin), normal temperatures will
rise. ``Record'' highs, lows and rainfall are based on the entire
period of record (1942 for Bergstrom and 1897 for Camp Mabry).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Lately, I have not been able to find a product by Revlon
called Color-Lock, a tube eyeshadow base. I've been using it since
I was 16! It really keeps your eyeshadow on all day. See what you
can find out. _Leslye Allen
</P>
<P>
   A: Time for a change. Revlon has discontinued Color-Lock. The
eyeshadow gurus at Revlon recommend Ultima II Fade Not Crease Not,
which is available at JCPenney's. Q: My daughter got gum on a pair
of black stretchy pants. We did the ice thing and got most of it
out. The gum seems to be in the weave. What's the next step? I'm
afraid to use a hot iron on it because it looks to be part Lycra or
spandex. _Cindy Austria
</P>
<P>
   A: Oops. Use a piece of brown paper or plastic to remove the gum
once it has been softened with a hair dryer. Some readers have luck
blotting with a pre-wash before laundering. Here is a novel
approach from Jeff Bredenberg's ``Clean it Fast, Clean it Right'':
Heat the residue with a hair dryer and use a plastic sandwich bag
to blot up the gum. Use fresh areas of the bag. Repeat. Then use
some Ben-Gay rub to break the hold the gum has on the fabric. Blot
with plastic bag.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, before you use anything, test for colorfastness in an
unobtrusive area.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a 1953 bottle of Piper-Heidsieck champagne. It was
produced and bottled by Kunkelmann &AMP; Co. in France. Would
appreciate help with a value. _ Dave Stamy
</P>
<P>
   A: You are not going to like this answer: 1953 was a good, not
great year, for champagne. But this bottle is ``over the hill,''
according to Greg Steiner of Grape Vine Market. In the 1950s
Piper-Heidsieck bottled champagne to be consumed within 20 years.
Current production should be consumed within eight years. So what
has happened to your champagne? After many years, the acidity
breaks down, and the bubbles may even be gone. Interestingly, the
British have developed a taste for these ``less bright''
champagnes, but in the States this bottle is virtually valueless,
concludes Steiner.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My name is Lauren Lucas. I am in the fifth grade at Brushy
Creek Elementary School in Round Rock. As a school assignment, I
have to write a letter of persuasion. I want to write a letter to
Dominique Moceanu, and ask for her autograph. But first, my dad
told me to write this letter of persuasion to you, requesting Ms.
Moceanu's address. Can you please help me get Ms. Moceanu's
address? Thank you for your help. _ Lauren Lucas
</P>
<P>
   A: Pretty persuasive. Moceanu, the youngest member of the 1996
Gold Metal Olympic Gymnastic team, finished ninth in the all-around
competition. Write to her in care of USA Gymnastics, Pan American
Plaza, Suite 300, 201 S. Capitol Ave., Indianapolis, Ind. 46225, or
her home, 17911 Fall River Circle, Houston, TX 77090. Good luck
with your project. Q: I am in the process of buying a home, but do
not know whether to buy a one- or a two-story home. Which one is
likely to settle faster and start showing signs of cracks
throughout the house? Where can I obtain some information? _ O.G.
Herrera
</P>
<P>
   A: A good foundation is a good foundation, regardless of the
number of stories, says Tim Atkinson of Atkinson Engineering. When
you purchase a home, a licensed real estate inspector will check to
see if the foundation is adequate for the home and its location.
While looking at the home, consider how its foundation performs its
intended purpose (serviceability, in engineer-speak). Some cracking
is not objectionable. ``In general, if no foundation problems arise
in a home after five years, there probably won't be any,'' adds
Atkinson. For more tips, visit www.atkinsonusa.com. Contact Jane
Greig at P.O. Box 670, Austin, TX 78767; (512) 445-3697; e-mail

inquiries, not all questions can be answered.

 &HT;    For this reunion, Moore is less
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Some memories are best left alone. Nostalgia is
fine, but people should resist the urge to act on it every time the
mood strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Take Mary Richards. We remember her as the independent but
slightly insecure producer at WJM in Minneapolis. She could turn
the world on with her smile and often did. She could even toss her
hat into the air in the middle of traffic without getting squashed.
</P>
<P>
   Now here she is three decades later _ recently widowed, losing
her spunk, sparring with her college-age daughter and trying to
persuade twenty-something executives to hire a sixtysomething
woman. The only bright spot in her life comes when she bumps into
long-lost best friend Rhoda Morgenstern, who used to be the whiny
one but now is brimming with optimism. Thank God for small favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary &AMP; Rhoda,'' which aired Monday, ABC's reunion movie based
on CBS's Emmy-laden series, was turned down by CBS. Network chief
Leslie Moonves commissioned the script but then backed off the
project, telling Moore he was afraid the update would ``cast a
shadow'' on the beloved original. Wise move, Les.
</P>
<P>
   So ABC snapped it up and even toyed with the notion of using the
movie as a pilot to launch a new series. Thankfully, that's not
much of a serious consideration _ unless the ratings shoot through
the roof. The movie would have to be a whole lot funnier to spawn a
sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that ``Mary &AMP; Rhoda'' is terrible. It's a
soul-searching look at the late midlife crises of two interesting
women. But it's not even remotely similar in tone to ``The Mary
Tyler Moore Show.'' In the classic sitcom, Mary was the anchor of a
sailboat full of zanies. We counted on guaranteed chuckles from
gruff news director Lou Grant, dimwit newsman Ted Baxter,
quick-witted writer Murray Slaughter and man-hungry feature
contributor Sue Ann Nivens. At home, Mary enjoyed frequent visits
from wisecracking neighbor Rhoda and high-strung landlady Phyllis.
</P>
<P>
   The famous ensemble is but a memory (and a fine one at that).
The reunion narrows its focus to the title women _ perhaps because
the others had the good sense to say no.
</P>
<P>
   When the story begins, Mary is returning home to New York after
spending a few months in Italy mourning the death of her
congressman husband. He left her penniless, so she decides to go
back to work. (Since the movie wound up on ABC, we learn that Mary
used to work for ABC News.) Her daughter Rose (Joie Lenz) is
threatening to drop out of college and become a stand-up comic.
</P>
<P>
   Hailing a taxi one day, Mary bumps into Rhoda, who has just
ditched her philandering French husband and decided to become a
professional photographer. Instead, she winds up fetching coffee
and bagels for a pushy fashion photographer. Her daughter Meredith
(Marisa Ryan) wants to drop out of pre-med and reconsider her life
goals. Rhoda is on a spiritual quest, which she describes to Mary
as ``somewhere between Jewish and Shaker _ so I can make my own
furniture and sell it retail.'' It's the only funny line in the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the plot concerns Mary's age discrimination at work
and her crusade to get a meaningful story about a teen-age murderer
on the air at a station that would rather show mayhem than meaning.
At every turn she comes up against her jerk-of-a-boss Jonah (Elon
Gold).
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing is dreary and a little sad _ not what fans of
the 1970-77 sitcom expect. In the old show, Mary was a constant
source of amusement and inspiration to the new breed of single,
working women in the '70s. Even in reruns, she can make us laugh.
Not long ago I saw the famous ``Chuckles the Clown's Funeral''
episode and marveled at how well it holds up. When Mary is seized
with the giggles, viewers can't help howling and snorting along
with her.
</P>
<P>
   Memories of favorite shows are sustained in reruns but shattered
in reunions. Nobody wants to see Archie Bunker in a wheelchair or
Jerry Seinfeld and pals on a Club Med singles cruise. It's not that
aging is a bad thing, but TV characters need to stay frozen in
time, the way they were when the shows went off the air. Digging
them up just seems macabre, sort of like grave robbing. Leave 'em
alone.

 &HT;    McCain picks up steam
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Republican presidential candidate John McCain scored
an important victory last week. He won the New Hampshire primary
with about 49 percent of the vote. George W. Bush garnered about 31
percent. For McCain's win, he earns 17 of the 1,033 delegates that
a candidate needs to clinch his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The largest benefit of the New Hampshire win for McCain is that
he has momentum leading into the South Carolina, Michigan and
Arizona primaries. When a candidate wins an important primary, it
helps convince people that he could go all the way to the White
House. People will donate more money and their time to a candidate
they have confidence in.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina primary will be Feb. 19 and Michigan and
Arizona follow on Feb. 22. Be sure to keep track of who wins each
primary and how many delegates are awarded.
</P>
<P>
   WORLD WORRIED ABOUT AUSTRIA
</P>
<P>
   Many countries are upset about the new Austrian government that
was sworn in last week. The world leaders fear some of the new
cabinet members' beliefs are similar to those of the Nazi party.
The Nazi party was led by Adolph Hitler in Germany during the 1930s
and 1940s. The racist Nazi party supported the killing of 6 million
Jews during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Finland cut off ties with Austria, and Israel withdrew its
ambassador last week. About 5,000 Austrians demonstrated to protest
the new government.
</P>
<P>
   Austria is a small European country situated north of Italy and
east of Germany. (If you've seen ``The Sound of Music,'' you've
seen some of Austria.)
</P>
<P>
   COMMUNISTS PULL PLUG ON PORKY PIG AND GANG
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government said ``That's all, folks'' and blocked
the satellite feed of the Cartoon Network last week. The channel
was never available to Chinese citizens, but was broadcast to the
country's tourist hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the move is unknown. But it is a reminder that
U.S. culture is still tightly controlled in China. Only about a
dozen Hollywood films are allowed each year in movie theaters
there.
</P>
<P>
   China's leadership has been trying to kick-start its own
animation industry by restricting Western cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   Disney characters, such as Mickey Mouse and Goofy, are still
commonly seen in China on videos and magazine stands. Chinese
youngsters often stick U.S. cartoon characters to their backpacks
and jackets.

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ For the past half-century and

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ LINCOLN CITY, Ore. _ For decades, folks living
on the Pacific shores, particularly in the northwest and Alaska,
have been harvesting the colorful glass floats that occasionally
break loose from Japanese fishing boats and float up on shore.
They're not rare. Antique shops up and down the coast sell them to
visitors for about 20 bucks apiece. Then last summer a local
entrepreneur with time on his hands came up with the bright idea of
millennium floats _ 2000 jewel-hued, blown-glass balls to be
scattered along the 14-mile stretch of Lincoln City beaches for
tourists to discover in the sand and exclaim: OOH! LOOK-Y THERE

Buda, a charming little town about 15 miles south of Austin.

 &HT;    3 families struggle with homelessness
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In recent weeks, metro Atlanta kids got a taste of
hardship similar to what some poor people face. The ice storms left
many homes without heat and lights for days.
</P>
<P>
   But imagine living without heat and power _ in a car. That's
right: no home, no bathroom, no television. You wake up in a car,
and go to sleep in a car.
</P>
<P>
   That's what life was like for Heartents Maples and her four boys
in October. After moving to Atlanta from Chicago, the family became
so poor they had to live in their car for days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not fun,'' said her son Michael Neal, who is 8 years
old. ``It was cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael slept in the back seat. To pass the time, the kids would
sing along with the car radio. They played ``Rock, Paper,
Scissors.'' If they had to go to the bathroom, their mother would
take them to a restaurant to use the restroom. That's also where
she would wash them.
</P>
<P>
   Since they had no closet in the car, their clothes were kept in
plastic bags in the trunk. At night, their mother would park in a
motel parking lot, and they would sleep in the car. Four people
sleeping in a car was uncomfortable. Sometimes they slept sitting
up. Sometimes they had trouble sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Other poor people also sleep in cars sometimes. LaShawn Coleman
and her three kids slept in a car for two weeks in December. They
had hardly any money for gas or food. Kendall Coleman, who is 7
years old, would do his homework in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes poor people in metro Atlanta have an apartment but
cannot afford to pay their power bills. So the heat and electricity
are turned off. When that happened to Edith Parks and her two kids
last winter, they had to live in a dark and cold apartment.
</P>
<P>
   They all stayed in one room and slept in the same bed. They
snuggled and used their body heat to keep each other warm. They lit
candles for light. Sometimes Marcus Hamilton, who is 7, and his
sister Catina Parks, who is 4, would cry and complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too cold and too dark and too scary,'' Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   Now these three families live in places called shelters in
Atlanta. These shelters allow people who are poor to live there
temporarily for free. The families receive food, heat and beds. The
parents also receive help finding jobs so they can make money and
move into their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   HOW CAN KIDS HELP OTHERS?
</P>
<P>
   Several shelters and other services for the needy allow children
to help out. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Children's Restoration Network _ This is an agency that
provides goods and services to more than 60 women's and children's
shelters in the metro area. Children age 12 and above can tutor
younger children in math and English. Children under 16 should be
accompanied by an adult. For more information, call 770-649-7117.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Atlanta Union Mission _ Children can help serve meals or
help other children with reading. In some cases, adult supervision
is required. Call 404-588-4000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Children can also help the poor by collecting food and
clothing at their schools and churches.
</P>
<P>
   Write to News for Kids at nfk(at)ajc.com, and tell us how you
are going to make a difference in the lives of less-fortunate
children. We'll publish how classes and individual kids are going
to help.

<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a jungle beat in spring fashion with a Deborah Harry
vibe.
</P>
<P>
   It's exotic skins _ from pony to python _ cut with an '80s edge
and an attitude that's pure rock 'n' roll. Think of Blondie, Joan
Jett and Poison ... even Guns 'N Roses, and you get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, babe, leopard isn't ladylike anymore. Wild spots and
stripes are showing up in luxe fabrics like pashmina, satin and
leather, cut up and down the body for maximum exposure, then bound
in neon color and accented with black leather.
</P>
<P>
   The skin-on-skin look has already leaped off the pages of
fashion mags and onto the backs of numerous celebs, including
Christina Aguilera, Pamela Anderson Lee and Mary J. Blige, who all
favor leopard and cheetah. Meanwhile, Claire Daines, Heather Graham
and A.J. McLean have partied in zebra stripes.
</P>
<P>
   But cold-blooded python prints are the next big thing. According
to Hot Kiss designer Tonya La Barrie, ``Zebra was hot for the
holiday season, but python print is more toned down and will appeal
to a wider range of customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bella Dahl designer Kym Lubell, who takes credit for starting
the embellished jeans craze, agrees, calling snakeskin
sophisticated enough to go from day into night. She thinks it's a
keeper, much like leopard spots, while the pony print is a trend
that will ride out of town by the end of summer.
</P>
<P>
   Subtle and sophisticated, yes. But the real reason the python
has snaked its way back into fashion, says designer Eduardo Lucero,
is the upbeat economy.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lucero, whose clients include Drew Barrymore and
Alicia Silverstone, ``We've come out of a somber mood in fashion
and women are now feeling flamboyant, much like they did in the
'60s and again in the '80s. Two seasons ago we started doing animal
prints, but leopard was their only interest. Now _ can you believe
it _ our best seller is red python print pants.''
</P>
<P>
   But he knows it's not for everybody. Leopard is the safest,
kindest-to-the-figure print, while zebra stripes aren't so
flattering to many women's hips. If you like the black-and-white
impact of zebra, buy a purse or pair of shoes, he suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and don't wear all your wild kingdom prints at once, Lucero
says, or you'll end up looking like Jimi Hendrix in a purple haze.
And that's a whole different fashion story. &QL;

<P>
   Alex, age 23, and Griffin, age 4, are hell on decor. Thanks to
them, the laboratory-cum-home of these impish African Grey parrots
looks as if a miniature tornado has blown through.
</P>
<P>
   Strewn about are pieces of fruit from discarded snacks, mangled
toys and a huge mound of cardboard cartons demolished with great
relish by Alex.
</P>
<P>
   Animal behaviorist Irene Pepperberg, the birds' caretaker,
tolerates her two charges, partly because they have richly rewarded
her serious scientific inquiry into the intelligence of animals.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, her research has implicitly challenged
the idea that humans alone are capable of real thought and real
communication. In a series of experiments, Alex and Griffin have
shown themselves intelligent enough to comprehend and juggle
abstract images of the objects that make up their world _ skills
once thought to be the exclusive property of humans.
</P>
<P>
   Under Pepperberg's tutelage, the parrots have learned to speak
English so clearly they'd delight even a fussy speech expert.
</P>
<P>
   But the value of this work goes far beyond experiments in voice
training. These parrots associate specific words with specific
objects, and they have learned to identify a number of different
colors, shapes and materials.
</P>
<P>
   Until Pepperberg began this research in the 1970s, few
scientists had studied intelligence in parrots, and few do today.
Most inquiries have instead focused on monkeys, chimpanzees,
gorillas and dolphins, all of which are much more difficult to
raise, feed and handle.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperberg especially likes parrots because, like humans,
they're smart, long-lived (often up to 50 years), social animals
that depend on communication for survival.
</P>
<P>
   And, best of all, to communicate with people, parrots don't need
devices built with buttons to push, and they don't need to be
taught sign language: They can learn to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Although Irene Pepperberg has always loved animals, she chose
chemistry as her field in graduate school at Harvard University.
There, in the early 1970s, she happened to see a TV documentary
about how animals learn. She became fascinated by the question of
just how smart animals are and whether they can learn to
communicate with humans.
</P>
<P>
   While finishing up her chemistry degree, she began taking
courses in animal behavior, psychology and communication. In 1977
she acquired 1-year-old Alex. He became the center of her research
in a small lab at Purdue University.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the animal-intelligence research of that era ultimately
foundered before an onslaught of skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy to overinterpret when you have a bird that says,
`I'll see you tomorrow,''' Pepperberg says. ``I've got enough
anecdotal data like that to fill a book. But what's really
referential?''
</P>
<P>
   What, in other words, constitutes proof that the bird knows what
it is saying?
</P>
<P>
   The history of science is littered with animals that seemed to
be displaying extraordinary brainpower but were just responding to
unconscious prompts from owners and trainers.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such pitfalls, Pepperberg designs experiments with the
care of a hard-nosed skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when an experiment demands that Alex learn a new
word like ``none,'' Pepperberg waits until the parrot's
pronunciation is so unambiguous that different observers agree 90
percent of the time on what he's saying. That ensures that an
experimenter eager for Alex to succeed won't mishear a slurred
random utterance as a correct answer.
</P>
<P>
   She also strives to avoid the possibility that a correct
response is merely conditioned _ automatic behavior generated by
the anticipation of a reward. So experimenters vary their
repertoire of questions to make sure that Alex is responding to the
content of the question and making intelligent discriminations.
</P>
<P>
   And to avoid the possibility that the experimenter's body
language might be prompting Alex's answers, students who test Alex
are never the same ones who taught him the words and concepts
involved.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Pepperberg's work has won accolades for its
persuasiveness from the likes of Oxford University animal
behaviorist Marian Stamp Dawkins, an authority on animal
consciousness and a skeptic about many studies in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, human error offers the birds an opportunity to show
how smart they are. Roughly 5 percent of the time, for example,
student questioners slip up and scold Alex with a ``No!'' when he
has in fact given the correct answer. When this occurs, Alex tends
to stick to his guns and repeat the correct answer. Eventually the
examiner comes to her senses, and Alex gets the reward he deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperberg's training technique is interactive, using a
model/rival mode. And it is simple: Both animals and people learn
more readily when they can observe and even compete with others
learning at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The best results come if the pupil watches a tutor coaching
someone else. The pupil learns by noting that the teacher rewards
the student for correct answers and gives rebukes for wrong ones.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, pioneered by Dietmar Todt at the University of
Freiburg, Germany, in the 1970s, worked quickly when Pepperberg
tried it with Alex. He caught on rapidly as she taught the
undergraduate who served as a model. Alex began competing with the
student for Pepperberg's attention and approval.
</P>
<P>
   The model/rival strategy worked so well for Alex that it has
been successfully adapted for helping developmentally disabled
children learn.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, Alex had learned the names of more than 50
different objects, five shapes and seven colors. He'd also learned
what ``same'' and ``different'' mean _ a crucial step in human
intellectual development. Show Alex two objects of different shape,
color and material, and then ask him, ``What's same?'' He'll
answer, ``None!''
</P>
<P>
   Thus he appears to understand not only similarities and
differences but also an even more abstract concept _ absence.
</P>
<P>
   Alex has become so skilled that, in one of Pepperberg's
projects, he has been promoted to the position of tutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see if Alex can work as a tutor for Griffin,''
Pepperberg explains. ``Partly we got Griffin to replicate our work
with Alex, to prove he wasn't some kind of avian Einstein.''
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate, Justin, one of Pepperberg's undergraduate
assistants, instructs Griffin and Alex to hop up on the work perch.
</P>
<P>
   But things get off to a balky start. Griffin seems cranky,
insistently croaking, ``Wanna go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin displays a ring and asks: ``What toy, Griffin?'' Griffin
answers ``Wood!'' and Alex unhelpfully pipes up with ``Rock! Rock!
Rock!'' A couple more trials follow, in which Griffin correctly
identifies cork, wood and wool. Alex sits taciturnly by.
</P>
<P>
   As the experimental session progresses, both Alex and Griffin
seem to slide into the spirit of things, falling almost naturally
into the model/rival mode.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperberg's research is forcing psychologists to rethink the
boundaries between animals and humans. The thought processes of
Alex and Griffin may approximate our own a lot or a little,
Pepperberg says, but it's getting well-nigh impossible to deny
their intelligence. &QL;

   Under Pepperberg's tutelage, the parrots have learned to speak
English so clearly they'd delight even a fussy speech expert.
</P>
<P>
   But the value of this work goes far beyond experiments in voice
training. These parrots associate specific words with specific
objects, and they have learned to identify a number of different
colors, shapes and materials.
</P>
<P>
   Until Pepperberg began this research in the 1970s, few
scientists had studied intelligence in parrots, and few do today.
Most inquiries have instead focused on monkeys, chimpanzees,
gorillas and dolphins, all of which are much more difficult to
raise, feed and handle.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperberg especially likes parrots because, like humans,
they're smart, long-lived (often up to 50 years), social animals
that depend on communication for survival.
</P>
<P>
   And, best of all, to communicate with people, parrots don't need
devices built with buttons to push, and they don't need to be
taught sign language: They can learn to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Although Irene Pepperberg has always loved animals, she chose
chemistry as her field in graduate school at Harvard University.
There, in the early 1970s, she happened to see a TV documentary
about how animals learn. She became fascinated by the question of
just how smart animals are and whether they can learn to
communicate with humans.
</P>
<P>
   While finishing up her chemistry degree, she began taking
courses in animal behavior, psychology and communication. In 1977
she acquired 1-year-old Alex. He became the center of her research
in a small lab at Purdue University.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the animal-intelligence research of that era ultimately
foundered before an onslaught of skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy to overinterpret when you have a bird that says,
`I'll see you tomorrow,''' Pepperberg says. ``I've got enough
anecdotal data like that to fill a book. But what's really
referential?''
</P>
<P>
   What, in other words, constitutes proof that the bird knows what
it is saying?
</P>
<P>
   The history of science is littered with animals that seemed to
be displaying extraordinary brainpower but were just responding to
unconscious prompts from owners and trainers.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such pitfalls, Pepperberg designs experiments with the
care of a hard-nosed skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when an experiment demands that Alex learn a new
word like ``none,'' Pepperberg waits until the parrot's
pronunciation is so unambiguous that different observers agree 90
percent of the time on what he's saying. That ensures that an
experimenter eager for Alex to succeed won't mishear a slurred
random utterance as a correct answer.
</P>
<P>
   She also strives to avoid the possibility that a correct
response is merely conditioned _ automatic behavior generated by
the anticipation of a reward. So experimenters vary their
repertoire of questions to make sure that Alex is responding to the
content of the question and making intelligent discriminations.
</P>
<P>
   And to avoid the possibility that the experimenter's body
language might be prompting Alex's answers, students who test Alex
are never the same ones who taught him the words and concepts
involved.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Pepperberg's work has won accolades for its
persuasiveness from the likes of Oxford University animal
behaviorist Marian Stamp Dawkins, an authority on animal
consciousness and a skeptic about many studies in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, human error offers the birds an opportunity to show
how smart they are. Roughly 5 percent of the time, for example,
student questioners slip up and scold Alex with a ``No!'' when he
has in fact given the correct answer. When this occurs, Alex tends
to stick to his guns and repeat the correct answer. Eventually the
examiner comes to her senses, and Alex gets the reward he deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperberg's training technique is interactive, using a
model/rival mode. And it is simple: Both animals and people learn
more readily when they can observe and even compete with others
learning at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The best results come if the pupil watches a tutor coaching
someone else. The pupil learns by noting that the teacher rewards
the student for correct answers and gives rebukes for wrong ones.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, pioneered by Dietmar Todt at the University of
Freiburg, Germany, in the 1970s, worked quickly when Pepperberg
tried it with Alex. He caught on rapidly as she taught the
undergraduate who served as a model. Alex began competing with the
student for Pepperberg's attention and approval.
</P>
<P>
   The model/rival strategy worked so well for Alex that it has
been successfully adapted for helping developmentally disabled
children learn.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, Alex had learned the names of more than 50
different objects, five shapes and seven colors. He'd also learned
what ``same'' and ``different'' mean _ a crucial step in human
intellectual development. Show Alex two objects of different shape,
color and material, and then ask him, ``What's same?'' He'll
answer, ``None!''
</P>
<P>
   Thus he appears to understand not only similarities and
differences but also an even more abstract concept _ absence.
</P>
<P>
   Alex has become so skilled that, in one of Pepperberg's
projects, he has been promoted to the position of tutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see if Alex can work as a tutor for Griffin,''
Pepperberg explains. ``Partly we got Griffin to replicate our work
with Alex, to prove he wasn't some kind of avian Einstein.''
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate, Justin, one of Pepperberg's undergraduate
assistants, instructs Griffin and Alex to hop up on the work perch.
</P>
<P>
   But things get off to a balky start. Griffin seems cranky,
insistently croaking, ``Wanna go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin displays a ring and asks: ``What toy, Griffin?'' Griffin
answers ``Wood!'' and Alex unhelpfully pipes up with ``Rock! Rock!
Rock!'' A couple more trials follow, in which Griffin correctly
identifies cork, wood and wool. Alex sits taciturnly by.
</P>
<P>
   As the experimental session progresses, both Alex and Griffin
seem to slide into the spirit of things, falling almost naturally
into the model/rival mode.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperberg's research is forcing psychologists to rethink the
boundaries between animals and humans. The thought processes of
Alex and Griffin may approximate our own a lot or a little,
Pepperberg says, but it's getting well-nigh impossible to deny
their intelligence. &QL;

<P>
   Over the past few years, astronomers have spotted signs of
ancient coastlines on Mars, the remnants of a vast, possibly
life-harboring ocean. But those Martian seashores now seem to be a
hopeful illusion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor snapped more than
1,000 pictures of the Red Planet. Geologist Ken Edgett and
geomorphologist Michael Malin of Malin Space Science Systems in San
Diego scrutinized 14 images containing purported shorelines.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists saw no wave-cut cliffs or sediment shaped by
waves. Instead, they found boundaries between lava flows and
highlands, or disconnected features that looked continuous in
earlier, poorer images.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the real Mars is still plenty interesting. Pictures
from the Global Surveyor show evidence of giant floods, including
boulders that ended up stacked on top of one another when the
waters receded.
</P>
<P>
   All being well, the Polar Lander that reached Mars last month
will dig for remnants of that water buried frozen in the soil,
monitor clouds, and send back sounds of the Martian winds. If the
past is any guide, Mars has more surprises in store.

   The fourth most popular kind of cosmetic surgery among men is _
surprise! _ breast reduction.
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics compiled by the American Society of
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, 9,023 of these operations were
performed in 1998, more than double the figure for 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Solomon, a Philadelphia plastic surgeon whose clientele
includes many men, points to the growing number of bodybuilders
downing anabolic steroids to increase muscle bulk. The drugs can
trigger breast growth when the body converts them into estrogenlike
compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Reproductive endocrinologist Claude Hughes of Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center in Los Angeles says poor diet and lack of exercise
help send men to surgeons as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our population is more obese than it's ever been, and it's
reasonable to think that would increase demand for this
procedure,'' he observes.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a more sinister possibility. Many common pollutants,
including some PCBS, also mimic the effect of estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Could these compounds cause men to develop breasts?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a plausible hypothesis,'' says Hughes, who studies
environmental estrogens.
</P>
<P>
   To test it, he suggests examining fat tissue removed during male
breast reduction and comparing its levels of estrogen-mimicking
contaminants to those of fat removed from men undergoing a neutral
operation, such as cardiac surgery.

<P>
   Alex, age 23, and Griffin, age 4, are hell on decor. Thanks to
them, the laboratory-cum-home of these impish African Grey parrots
looks as if a miniature tornado has blown through.
</P>
<P>
   Strewn about are pieces of fruit from discarded snacks, mangled
toys and a huge mound of cardboard cartons demolished with great
relish by Alex.
</P>
<P>
   Animal behaviorist Irene Pepperberg, the birds' caretaker,
tolerates her two charges, partly because they have richly rewarded
her serious scientific inquiry into the intelligence of animals.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, her research has implicitly challenged
the idea that humans alone are capable of real thought and real
communication. In a series of experiments, Alex and Griffin have
shown themselves intelligent enough to comprehend and juggle
abstract images of the objects that make up their world _ skills
once thought to be the exclusive property of humans.
</P>
<P>
   Under Pepperberg's tutelage, the parrots have learned to speak
English so clearly they'd delight even a fussy speech expert.
</P>
<P>
   But the value of this work goes far beyond experiments in voice
training. These parrots associate specific words with specific
objects, and they have learned to identify a number of different
colors, shapes and materials.
</P>
<P>
   Until Pepperberg began this research in the 1970s, few
scientists had studied intelligence in parrots, and few do today.
Most inquiries have instead focused on monkeys, chimpanzees,
gorillas and dolphins, all of which are much more difficult to
raise, feed and handle.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperberg especially likes parrots because, like humans,
they're smart, long-lived (often up to 50 years), social animals
that depend on communication for survival.
</P>
<P>
   And, best of all, to communicate with people, parrots don't need
devices built with buttons to push, and they don't need to be
taught sign language: They can learn to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Although Irene Pepperberg has always loved animals, she chose

`I'll see you tomorrow,''' Pepperberg says. ``I've got enough
anecdotal data like that to fill a book. But what's really
referential?''
</P>
<P>
   What, in other words, constitutes proof that the bird knows what
it is saying?
</P>
<P>
   The history of science is littered with animals that seemed to
be displaying extraordinary brainpower but were just responding to
unconscious prompts from owners and trainers.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such pitfalls, Pepperberg designs experiments with the
care of a hard-nosed skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when an experiment demands that Alex learn a new
word like ``none,'' Pepperberg waits until the parrot's
pronunciation is so unambiguous that different observers agree 90
percent of the time on what he's saying. That ensures that an
experimenter eager for Alex to succeed won't mishear a slurred
random utterance as a correct answer.
</P>
<P>
   She also strives to avoid the possibility that a correct
response is merely conditioned _ automatic behavior generated by
the anticipation of a reward. So experimenters vary their
repertoire of questions to make sure that Alex is responding to the
content of the question and making intelligent discriminations.
</P>
<P>
   And to avoid the possibility that the experimenter's body
language might be prompting Alex's answers, students who test Alex
are never the same ones who taught him the words and concepts
involved.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Pepperberg's work has won accolades for its
persuasiveness from the likes of Oxford University animal
behaviorist Marian Stamp Dawkins, an authority on animal
consciousness and a skeptic about many studies in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, human error offers the birds an opportunity to show
how smart they are. Roughly 5 percent of the time, for example,
student questioners slip up and scold Alex with a ``No!'' when he
has in fact given the correct answer. When this occurs, Alex tends
to stick to his guns and repeat the correct answer. Eventually the
examiner comes to her senses, and Alex gets the reward he deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperberg's training technique is interactive, using a

answer, ``None!''

   Thus he appears to understand not only similarities and
differences but also an even more abstract concept _ absence.

<P>
   Alex, age 23, and Griffin, age 4, are hell on decor. Thanks to
them, the laboratory-cum-home of these impish African Grey parrots
looks as if a miniature tornado has blown through.
</P>
<P>
   Strewn about are pieces of fruit from discarded snacks, mangled
toys and a huge mound of cardboard cartons demolished with great
relish by Alex.
</P>
<P>
   Animal behaviorist Irene Pepperberg, the birds' caretaker,
tolerates her two charges, partly because they have richly rewarded
her serious scientific inquiry into the intelligence of animals.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, her research has implicitly challenged
the idea that humans alone are capable of real thought and real
communication. In a series of experiments, Alex and Griffin have
shown themselves intelligent enough to comprehend and juggle
abstract images of the objects that make up their world _ skills
once thought to be the exclusive property of humans.
</P>
<P>
   Under Pepperberg's tutelage, the parrots have learned to speak
English so clearly they'd delight even a fussy speech expert.
</P>
<P>
   But the value of this work goes far beyond experiments in voice
training. These parrots associate specific words with specific
objects, and they have learned to identify a number of different
colors, shapes and materials.
</P>
<P>
   Until Pepperberg began this research in the 1970s, few
scientists had studied intelligence in parrots, and few do today.
Most inquiries have instead focused on monkeys, chimpanzees,
gorillas and dolphins, all of which are much more difficult to
raise, feed and handle.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperberg especially likes parrots because, like humans,
they're smart, long-lived (often up to 50 years), social animals
that depend on communication for survival.
</P>
<P>
   And, best of all, to communicate with people, parrots don't need
devices built with buttons to push, and they don't need to be
taught sign language: They can learn to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Although Irene Pepperberg has always loved animals, she chose
chemistry as her field in graduate school at Harvard University.
There, in the early 1970s, she happened to see a TV documentary
about how animals learn. She became fascinated by the question of
just how smart animals are and whether they can learn to
communicate with humans.
</P>
<P>
   While finishing up her chemistry degree, she began taking
courses in animal behavior, psychology and communication. In 1977
she acquired 1-year-old Alex. He became the center of her research
in a small lab at Purdue University.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the animal-intelligence research of that era ultimately
foundered before an onslaught of skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy to overinterpret when you have a bird that says,
`I'll see you tomorrow,''' Pepperberg says. ``I've got enough
anecdotal data like that to fill a book. But what's really
referential?''
</P>
<P>
   What, in other words, constitutes proof that the bird knows what
it is saying?
</P>
<P>
   The history of science is littered with animals that seemed to
be displaying extraordinary brainpower but were just responding to
unconscious prompts from owners and trainers.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such pitfalls, Pepperberg designs experiments with the
care of a hard-nosed skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when an experiment demands that Alex learn a new
word like ``none,'' Pepperberg waits until the parrot's
pronunciation is so unambiguous that different observers agree 90
percent of the time on what he's saying. That ensures that an
experimenter eager for Alex to succeed won't mishear a slurred
random utterance as a correct answer.
</P>
<P>
   She also strives to avoid the possibility that a correct
response is merely conditioned _ automatic behavior generated by
the anticipation of a reward. So experimenters vary their
repertoire of questions to make sure that Alex is responding to the
content of the question and making intelligent discriminations.
</P>
<P>
   And to avoid the possibility that the experimenter's body
language might be prompting Alex's answers, students who test Alex
are never the same ones who taught him the words and concepts
involved.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Pepperberg's work has won accolades for its
persuasiveness from the likes of Oxford University animal
behaviorist Marian Stamp Dawkins, an authority on animal
consciousness and a skeptic about many studies in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, human error offers the birds an opportunity to show
how smart they are. Roughly 5 percent of the time, for example,
student questioners slip up and scold Alex with a ``No!'' when he
has in fact given the correct answer. When this occurs, Alex tends
to stick to his guns and repeat the correct answer. Eventually the
examiner comes to her senses, and Alex gets the reward he deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperberg's training technique is interactive, using a
model/rival mode. And it is simple: Both animals and people learn
more readily when they can observe and even compete with others
learning at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The best results come if the pupil watches a tutor coaching
someone else. The pupil learns by noting that the teacher rewards
the student for correct answers and gives rebukes for wrong ones.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, pioneered by Dietmar Todt at the University of
Freiburg, Germany, in the 1970s, worked quickly when Pepperberg
tried it with Alex. He caught on rapidly as she taught the
undergraduate who served as a model. Alex began competing with the
student for Pepperberg's attention and approval.
</P>
<P>
   The model/rival strategy worked so well for Alex that it has
been successfully adapted for helping developmentally disabled
children learn.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, Alex had learned the names of more than 50
different objects, five shapes and seven colors. He'd also learned
what ``same'' and ``different'' mean _ a crucial step in human
intellectual development. Show Alex two objects of different shape,
color and material, and then ask him, ``What's same?'' He'll
answer, ``None!''
</P>
<P>
   Thus he appears to understand not only similarities and
differences but also an even more abstract concept _ absence.
</P>
<P>
   Alex has become so skilled that, in one of Pepperberg's
projects, he has been promoted to the position of tutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see if Alex can work as a tutor for Griffin,''
Pepperberg explains. ``Partly we got Griffin to replicate our work
with Alex, to prove he wasn't some kind of avian Einstein.''
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate, Justin, one of Pepperberg's undergraduate

</P>
<P>
   But things get off to a balky start. Griffin seems cranky,
insistently croaking, ``Wanna go back.''

answers ``Wood!'' and Alex unhelpfully pipes up with ``Rock! Rock!
Rock!'' A couple more trials follow, in which Griffin correctly

   Marine diseases are best documented among commercially important

   ``Our fish populations are being seriously affected. The trends
are very striking,'' says aquatic ecologist JoAnn Burkholder of

</P>
<P>
   By far the most dramatic crisis is the pandemic of coral
bleaching. According to marine ecologist James Porter of the
University of Georgia in Athens, 70 percent of the coral reefs in
the Indian Ocean have whitened and died in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Reefs are rich stores of biodiversity and sensitive measures of
environmental health. Elevated sea temperatures trigger the
bleaching, which makes Porter suspicious about the timing.

he says. ``The most viable hypothesis to explain coral bleaching is

   Over the past few years, astronomers have spotted signs of
ancient coastlines on Mars, the remnants of a vast, possibly
life-harboring ocean. But those Martian seashores now seem to be a
hopeful illusion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor snapped more than
1,000 pictures of the Red Planet. Geologist Ken Edgett and
geomorphologist Michael Malin of Malin Space Science Systems in San
Diego scrutinized 14 images containing purported shorelines.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists saw no wave-cut cliffs or sediment shaped by
waves. Instead, they found boundaries between lava flows and
highlands, or disconnected features that looked continuous in
earlier, poorer images.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the real Mars is still plenty interesting. Pictures
from the Global Surveyor show evidence of giant floods, including
boulders that ended up stacked on top of one another when the
waters receded.
</P>
<P>
   All being well, the Polar Lander that reached Mars last month
will dig for remnants of that water buried frozen in the soil,
monitor clouds, and send back sounds of the Martian winds. If the
past is any guide, Mars has more surprises in store.

   The fourth most popular kind of cosmetic surgery among men is _
surprise! _ breast reduction.
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics compiled by the American Society of
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, 9,023 of these operations were
performed in 1998, more than double the figure for 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Solomon, a Philadelphia plastic surgeon whose clientele
includes many men, points to the growing number of bodybuilders
downing anabolic steroids to increase muscle bulk. The drugs can
trigger breast growth when the body converts them into estrogenlike
compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Reproductive endocrinologist Claude Hughes of Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center in Los Angeles says poor diet and lack of exercise
help send men to surgeons as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our population is more obese than it's ever been, and it's
reasonable to think that would increase demand for this
procedure,'' he observes.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a more sinister possibility. Many common pollutants,
including some PCBS, also mimic the effect of estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Could these compounds cause men to develop breasts?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a plausible hypothesis,'' says Hughes, who studies
environmental estrogens.
</P>
<P>
   To test it, he suggests examining fat tissue removed during male
breast reduction and comparing its levels of estrogen-mimicking
contaminants to those of fat removed from men undergoing a neutral
operation, such as cardiac surgery.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO breached international law in its air attacks
on Yugoslavia last year, a respected human-rights body says in a
report issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by Human Rights Watch, is particularly critical of
the use of cluster bombs. The United States stopped using the
munitions halfway through the war, but Britain continued using
them, raising serious issues about the British government's concern
for civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   NATO killed at least 500 civilians during the Kosovo conflict,
the report concludes after visits to the sites of many of the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human Rights Watch has found no evidence of war crimes,'' it
says. But, it adds, ``the investigation did conclude that NATO
violated international humanitarian law.''
</P>
<P>
   The report says that NATO may have breached the Geneva
Convention in five areas: it conducted air attacks using cluster
bombs near populated areas; attacked targets of questionable
military legitimacy; did not take adequate measures to warn
civilians of strikes; took insufficient precautions to identify the
presence of civilians when attacking mobile targets; and caused
excessive civilian casualties by not taking sufficient measures to
verify that targets did not have concentrations of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the attacks resulted from missing military targets. But
``nine incidents were a result of strikes on nonmilitary targets
that Human Rights Watch believes were illegitimate,'' including
Serb Radio and Television in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   At least one-fifth of those who died were killed by cluster
bombs, which spray bomblets over a wide area. ``Overall,
cluster-bomb use by the United States and Britain can be confirmed
in seven incidents throughout Yugoslavia (another five are possible
but unconfirmed),'' the report says. ``Some 90 to 150 civilians
died from the use of these weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   It reveals the United States stopped using the weapons after a
hitherto secret presidential order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Widespread reports of civilian casualties from the use of
cluster-bombs and international criticism of these weapons as
potentially indiscriminate, in effect, led... to an unprecedented
U.S. executive order in the middle of May to cease their further
use in the conflict,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House issued the order only days after civilians
were killed by NATO cluster bombs in the city of Nis on May 7.''
But Britain, according to the RAF's own reports, continued to use
the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cluster bombs should not have been used in attacks in
populated areas, let alone urban targets, given the risks,'' it
says. ``Nevertheless, the (RAF) continued to drop cluster bombs,
indicating the need for universal, not national, norms regarding
cluster-bomb use.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also says there is ``some evidence'' Yugoslav forces
used civilians as human shields.
</P>
<P>
   The body calls on NATO to ``establish an independent and
impartial commission... that would... consider the need to alter
targeting and bombing doctrine to ensure compliance with
international humanitarian law.'' &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ NATO breached international law in its air attacks
on Yugoslavia last year, a respected human-rights body says in a
report issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by Human Rights Watch, is particularly critical of
the use of cluster bombs. The United States stopped using the
munitions halfway through the war, but Britain continued using
them, raising serious issues about the British government's concern
for civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   NATO killed at least 500 civilians during the Kosovo conflict,
the report concludes after visits to the sites of many of the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human Rights Watch has found no evidence of war crimes,'' it
says. But, it adds, ``the investigation did conclude that NATO
violated international humanitarian law.''
</P>
<P>
   The report says that NATO may have breached the Geneva
Convention in five areas: it conducted air attacks using cluster
bombs near populated areas; attacked targets of questionable
military legitimacy; did not take adequate measures to warn
civilians of strikes; took insufficient precautions to identify the
presence of civilians when attacking mobile targets; and caused
excessive civilian casualties by not taking sufficient measures to
verify that targets did not have concentrations of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the attacks resulted from missing military targets. But
``nine incidents were a result of strikes on nonmilitary targets
that Human Rights Watch believes were illegitimate,'' including
Serb Radio and Television in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   At least one-fifth of those who died were killed by cluster
bombs, which spray bomblets over a wide area. ``Overall,
cluster-bomb use by the United States and Britain can be confirmed
in seven incidents throughout Yugoslavia (another five are possible
but unconfirmed),'' the report says. ``Some 90 to 150 civilians
died from the use of these weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   It reveals the United States stopped using the weapons after a
hitherto secret presidential order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Widespread reports of civilian casualties from the use of
cluster-bombs and international criticism of these weapons as
potentially indiscriminate, in effect, led... to an unprecedented
U.S. executive order in the middle of May to cease their further
use in the conflict,'' the report says.
</P>

   The body calls on NATO to ``establish an independent and

THE END OF TV ADVERTISING AS WE KNOW IT?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
 
 
By MARLA MATZER ROSE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can call them personal video recorders, PVRs or by brand
names such as Tivo and Replay. The advertising industry has another
word for these set-top devices that make it easier than ever for
you to control your TV viewing: ad-killer boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that allows me to fast-forward through programming I
don't want to see is bad for us,'' said Allen Banks, executive
media director for Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi North America and chairperson
for the media policy committee of the American Association of
Advertising Agencies. Banks reasons, ``These things are designed to
save you time. You do that by skipping through programming, whether
it's a show or a commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   PVR manufacturers know consumers don't want to sit through
commercials. Replay in particular has highlighted its ability to
``zap'' through them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit QuickSkip and you jump forward 30 seconds instantly. With
ReplayTV, you spend more time watching what you want to, less time
watching what you don't,'' read newspaper ads for the gadget. Tivo
hasn't played up this capability _ having decided to court favor
among networks and advertisers _ and now Replay has backed off
advertising the feature, too. But both still allow you to
fast-forward with ease through commercials.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't watch their commercials, advertisers are wasting
the millions of dollars they spend on them. How immediate a concern
is this for them, for the networks that make their money by selling
ad time _ and what will it mean for you? The answers, in order:
immediate; sooner than they may think; and you'll be getting ads in
more personalized and sneaky ways than before.
</P>
<P>
   Commercials certainly won't go away. If anything, ads will
become more targeted to specific consumer groups and will be more
embedded in programming. ``Are we going to find ways around
(skipping through commercials)? Yeah, we will,'' said Russ Booth,
managing director of science and technologies with MediaCom, Grey
Advertising's media planning and buying arm. Said Booth, ``It's all
about relevance. People will watch commercials if they're
entertaining, or interspersed throughout programming in some
longer-form way.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as makers of tennis shoes and soft drink have found more
places to stick their logos on TV, other advertisers will strike
deals that gain them placement on TV shows. This is within FCC
regulations if the company is credited with ``promotional
consideration'' at the end of the program.
</P>
<P>
   You may have already noticed how ads are becoming more
entertaining, through the use of popular songs and by reviving
classic ad icons such as Mr. Whipple and Charlie the Tuna. Now, PVR
customers who supply their companies with information about their
favorite shows and other lifestyle preferences will be shown ads
directed at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you're a bachelor,'' explained Sean Badding, vice
president of the Carmel Group research firm. ``With Tivo, General
Motors, instead of showing you a minivan commercial, can show you
one for a sports car.''
</P>
<P>
   The networks will also find ways to keep advertisers happy.
``They'll integrate ads into programming through things like
product placement and banner advertising, which is like a ticker
across the bottom of the screen,'' said Josh Bernoff, principal
television analyst for the Forrester Group research firm. ``(The
potential loss of viewers for ads) is a really big problem if
you're a free broadcast network. It's extremely easy to skip
commercials; based on our projected levels of penetration (for
PVRs), there will be an 8 percent reduction in ad viewing within
five years, and 50 percent within 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect PVRs to take years to reach the market
penetration of the ubiquitous videocassette recorder: Bernoff's
projection is for PVRs to be in 900,000 homes by the end of next
year, compared to nearly 90 million homes that currently have VCRs.
</P>
<P>
   But by 2005, that number is expected to leap to 14 million,
which would make the PVR ``the fastest-growing consumer electronic
product in history... surpassing satellite TV and DVD players,''
Bernoff says.
</P>
<P>
   A key reason analysts believe PVRs will take off is their
ability to be combined with other essential electronics gadgets.
Many families already have a snarl of hardware attached to their
TVs: cable box, VCR, DVD player, video game console _ no desire for
more boxes there. Within the next year, you'll see PVR boxes
combined with satellite and possibly cable boxes, giving you more
functionality and less clutter for an attractive price compared to
$500 or more for a stand-alone PVR.
</P>
<P>
   Stil, there are so-called ``early adopters'' who are already
buying PVRs. Advertisers are keenly aware that these folks are
among their most desirable target market: They tend to be younger,
upper-income consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The big winners in the short run: consumers who can afford to
pay for a PVR, along with premium TV networks such as Showtime and
HBO. Viewers get more control than ever; they can record and replay
programs with ease, and even have the box automatically record
their favorite show every week or suggest other shows that they
might want to catch.
</P>
<P>
   For the pay TV channels, it's also a win-win. Since they don't
take advertising, they don't stand to lose money should advertisers
balk at paying the same rates for fewer viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Showtime, we look at things in three categories: more,
better and different,'' said Mark Greenberg, executive vice
president of corporate strategy and communications for Showtime
Networks, which has struck partnership agreements with both Tivo
and Replay. ``We look at (PVRs) as better and different. It doesn't
provide us with more viewers, but it gives us a new way to interact
with them. And for us,'' added Greenberg, ``the 30-second `bleep'
button doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   A raft of other basic and premium cable networks, as well as the
major broadcasters, have also partnered with Tivo and Replay. Tivo
has all the big three networks as investors: ABC, CBS and NBC. The
deals are often structured with the network taking an equity stake
in the PVR firm in exchange for getting ways to promote their own
programming to viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime is one of several networks that has partnered with both
Tivo and Replay. Explained Greenberg, ``This isn't a hardware or
software supply issue, like VHS vs. Betamax (the two competing
video formats in the early 1980s). This is about benefits. I
believe there is a marketplace for both to exist, and it's good for
the consumer, ultimately.''
</P>
<P>
   The one downside, if you're already feeling crunched for time:
You're likely to end up watching more TV. Research by Replay
Networks indicates that, with Replay, people watch more recorded
TV, less live TV _ and more TV overall. The networks and the
advertisers seem to be making peace with PVRs because they see that
more can be better, in the end, for everyone. &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, DEL. _ A newly ``retooled'' George W. Bush _ the term was
used by his campaign _ flew into the small East Coast state of
Delaware Monday, intent on finishing off his pesky challenger,
Steve Forbes, and simultaneously banishing the memory of his
chastening defeat in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   With his presidential bid appearing suddenly vulnerable and less
than two weeks to go before the key primary in South Carolina, Bush
is having to treat Tuesday's Delaware primary as a serious test.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware may be small _ it has only 750,000 inhabitants and
elects only one member of the U.S. House of Representatives _ but
as the first state to ratify the Constitution, it enjoys a certain
cachet.
</P>
<P>
   It also has two highly experienced senators and wields
disproportionate legislative clout, thanks to its relative wealth
and its prowess in banking and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Its liberal tax laws have attracted many corporations to site
their headquarters here, among them some of Bush's most generous
donors.
</P>
<P>
   Which is one reason why he is campaigning here in person: among
supporters in the miniature state capital, Dover; among servicemen
at the nearby Air Force Base (one of the major shipping points for
aid to Kosovo last year); and among big corporate sponsors in the
state's business powerhouse, the city of Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is the billionaire publisher, Steve Forbes, whose
own base lies just to the north, in the state of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Forbes may not look the greatest threat to Bush's
presidential prospects. That honor currently goes to Senator John
McCain, who trounced him by 18 points in New Hampshire and has
drawn level in opinion polls in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the big money of either a Bush or a Forbes, however,
McCain has picked his contests carefully, choosing to disregard
Delaware, as he did the Iowa caucuses two weeks ago. He is applying
all his effort to South Carolina, and the primary shortly
thereafter in the northerly state of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In his newly aggressive campaign mode, Bush scorned his rival's
tactics. McCain's absence, though, leaves him in a straight fight
with Forbes _ who actually won the Delaware primary four years ago,
beating the party favorite, Robert Dole, into second place.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Dole had chosen, like McCain this year, not to campaign
in Delaware, but the notion persists that Delaware is Forbes's sort
of state, and he has campaigned here as though that were so.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, election day, he will have spent four full days
here, breaking only last Friday to speak at a state party gathering
in California.
</P>
<P>
   Often an awkward campaigner, Forbes has nonetheless gone from
town hall to town hall, spreading his message of tax reform and
presenting himself in the guise of ``independent outsider'' that
has proved so successful for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Just north of Dover, in the small town of Smyrna _ a town whose
commercial heart has been comprehensively killed by the nearby
shopping center _ Forbes found a typical standing-room-only crowd
of around 200 waiting for him in the fire station hall.
</P>
<P>
   They were small business people and pensioners mostly, none of
them wealthy, and not all of them loyal. The name John McCain was
on many lips, even though he had not deigned to campaign in their
state.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush appeared to be widely disliked, except by the dozen
or so young pickets who stood on the pavement outside with large
Bush placards.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has some good lines. He compares the length of the
Gettysburg Address, the Declaration of Independence and even the
Bible with the 7 million plus words of the U.S. tax code.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests that redundant taxmen could usefully be redeployed
shovelling away some of the snow piled up beside Delaware's roads.
</P>
<P>
   And to all those in Washington who say we cannot scrap the tax
code? ``Well, hello guys! Whose country is this?''
</P>
<P>
   In the televised Republican debates, it was clear that there is
little love lost between the stolid Forbes and the smooth George W.
And rumors abound that the Republican Party has urged Forbes to end
his bid so that Bush can take on McCain without lesser
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Bush needs is another poor primary showing. But
Forbes has the money (his own) to fight on, and he might not be
averse to diluting Bush's effort.
</P>
<P>
   At least as of Monday, the Forbes camp was adamant: ``We are in
this to the end.'' &QL;

<P>
   DOVER, DEL. _ A newly ``retooled'' George W. Bush _ the term was
used by his campaign _ flew into the small East Coast state of
Delaware Monday, intent on finishing off his pesky challenger,
Steve Forbes, and simultaneously banishing the memory of his
chastening defeat in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   With his presidential bid appearing suddenly vulnerable and less
than two weeks to go before the key primary in South Carolina, Bush
is having to treat Tuesday's Delaware primary as a serious test.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware may be small _ it has only 750,000 inhabitants and
elects only one member of the U.S. House of Representatives _ but
as the first state to ratify the Constitution, it enjoys a certain
cachet.
</P>
<P>
   It also has two highly experienced senators and wields
disproportionate legislative clout, thanks to its relative wealth
and its prowess in banking and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Its liberal tax laws have attracted many corporations to site
their headquarters here, among them some of Bush's most generous
donors.
</P>
<P>
   Which is one reason why he is campaigning here in person: among
supporters in the miniature state capital, Dover; among servicemen
at the nearby Air Force Base (one of the major shipping points for
aid to Kosovo last year); and among big corporate sponsors in the
state's business powerhouse, the city of Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is the billionaire publisher, Steve Forbes, whose
own base lies just to the north, in the state of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Forbes may not look the greatest threat to Bush's
presidential prospects. That honor currently goes to Senator John
McCain, who trounced him by 18 points in New Hampshire and has
drawn level in opinion polls in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the big money of either a Bush or a Forbes, however,
McCain has picked his contests carefully, choosing to disregard
Delaware, as he did the Iowa caucuses two weeks ago. He is applying
all his effort to South Carolina, and the primary shortly
thereafter in the northerly state of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In his newly aggressive campaign mode, Bush scorned his rival's
tactics. McCain's absence, though, leaves him in a straight fight
with Forbes _ who actually won the Delaware primary four years ago,
beating the party favorite, Robert Dole, into second place.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Dole had chosen, like McCain this year, not to campaign
in Delaware, but the notion persists that Delaware is Forbes's sort
of state, and he has campaigned here as though that were so.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, election day, he will have spent four full days
here, breaking only last Friday to speak at a state party gathering
in California.
</P>
<P>
   Often an awkward campaigner, Forbes has nonetheless gone from
town hall to town hall, spreading his message of tax reform and
presenting himself in the guise of ``independent outsider'' that
has proved so successful for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Just north of Dover, in the small town of Smyrna _ a town whose
commercial heart has been comprehensively killed by the nearby
shopping center _ Forbes found a typical standing-room-only crowd
of around 200 waiting for him in the fire station hall.
</P>
<P>
   They were small business people and pensioners mostly, none of
them wealthy, and not all of them loyal. The name John McCain was
on many lips, even though he had not deigned to campaign in their
state.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush appeared to be widely disliked, except by the dozen
or so young pickets who stood on the pavement outside with large
Bush placards.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has some good lines. He compares the length of the
Gettysburg Address, the Declaration of Independence and even the
Bible with the 7 million plus words of the U.S. tax code.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests that redundant taxmen could usefully be redeployed
shovelling away some of the snow piled up beside Delaware's roads.
</P>
<P>
   And to all those in Washington who say we cannot scrap the tax
code? ``Well, hello guys! Whose country is this?''
</P>
<P>
   In the televised Republican debates, it was clear that there is
little love lost between the stolid Forbes and the smooth George W.
And rumors abound that the Republican Party has urged Forbes to end
his bid so that Bush can take on McCain without lesser
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Bush needs is another poor primary showing. But
Forbes has the money (his own) to fight on, and he might not be
averse to diluting Bush's effort.
</P>
<P>
   At least as of Monday, the Forbes camp was adamant: ``We are in
this to the end.'' &QL;

   When most people meet her, Sigourney Weaver says, in her erudite
way, they expect her to be ``a butt-kicker.'' She is, after all, 6
feet tall, and her alter ego, Warrant Officer Ellen Ripley of the
four ``Alien'' movies, is one of the screen's all-time
take-no-prisoners broads.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I am the least like a butt-kicker of anyone I know,''
Weaver says crisply.
</P>
<P>
   And sitting opposite her in a back room of L.A.'s Smashbox
Studios, it's easy to believe her. She is long, lithe and seemingly
hipless in black Celine pants, her delicate cheekbones and skinny
lips tweaked by a tinge of ladylike makeup. She looks like a strong
wind could blow her over _ and she never raises her voice beyond an
audible but polite whisper.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, there is a new excitement about Weaver's career,
which, over the course of 28 film roles in 20 years, has had its
natural ebbs and flows. But now she finds herself in three vastly
diverse roles: as an airhead sitcom actress in space in ``Galaxy
Quest,'' as a Midwestern mother experiencing meltdown in ``A Map of
the World'' and as a '50s housewife in Doug McGrath's bizarre
comedy, ``Company Man.''
</P>
<P>
   But diversity isn't new to her. Weaver has had an enviable
screen career, earning three Oscar nominations and starring in
everything from blockbuster comedies such as ``Ghostbusters'' to
critically acclaimed films like ``Working Girl'' and ``Gorillas in
the Mist.'' Still, it's Ripley of the ``Alien'' movies she's best
known for _ and, according to her, least like.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver (who was named Susan, but picked the name Sigourney from
the pages of ``The Great Gatsby'') went to Stanford and got her
master's degree at Yale in 1975. Then she struggled through a long
maze of New York showcases and acting coaches, despite being the
daughter of Pat Weaver _ who was president of NBC in the '50s _ and
actress Elizabeth Inglis.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver's first major film role, 1979's ``Alien'' (she had a
brief six-second scene before that in ``Annie Hall'') sent her
career into the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, it's luck that got me to the `Alien' audition,''
Weaver says. The actress didn't have any desire to make a
futuristic action movie. Her upbringing had led her to an acting
agenda of Mike Nichols and Woody Allen-style urbane comedies.
</P>
<P>
   She cared so little about playing Ripley that she was almost
snippy with director Ridley Scott. Somehow, it paid off, and he
hired her. By the fourth installment, ``Alien: Resurrection'' in
1997, her paycheck was $11 million. That's more than the budget of
most Woody Allen movies.
</P>
<P>
   The tight shots in ``Alien'' of Weaver in BVDs didn't hurt when
she went up for the part opposite Mel Gibson in ``The Year of
Living Dangerously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to play small, act petite,'' she says mysteriously.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, ``Ghostbusters'' sealed her fate as a star with
box-office clout, and the contrast of her keen intelligence with
her sense of the absurd earned her ``Working Girl'' and ``Dave.''
</P>
<P>
   When Roman Polanski offered her a challenging role in 1994's
``Death and the Maiden,'' it was her husband, director Jim Simpson,
who convinced her to take it on.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver met Simpson in the summer of 1983 when she was starring
in a production of Harold Pinter's ``Old Times,'' with Dianne Wiest
and Edward Herrmann, at the Williamstown Theater Festival, and
Simpson was directing a smaller production on the non-Equity stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several months later, I was giving a big Halloween party,''
she remembers. ``I found Jim's number from the summer contact sheet
and called him up. His machine said, `Leave a number for Dave, Jim,
Mike or Debbie.' I thought, great, is he with Mike, Dave or Debbie?
Turns out, he wasn't with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   They decided to get married three months later and have been
married 15 years. The couple and their 9-year-old daughter live in
New York, and Weaver tries to work near the city as much as
possible, ``A Map of the World'' being a recent exception.
</P>
<P>
   The movie took her to rural Wisconsin, where author Jane
Hamilton lives and sets her novels. It's probably Weaver's most
grueling role to date, though she calls it ``without a doubt, the
most fulfilling.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver plays Alice Goodwin, who experiences a nightmarish fall
from grace when a friend's daughter drowns while she's looking
after her. Spiraling downward in grief, Goodwin, the school nurse,
doesn't fight back when a student subsequently accuses her of
sexual abuse. She eventually winds up in jail, forced to sell her
dairy farm to pay legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Director Scott Elliott says he cast Weaver against type.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had loved Sigourney in `The Ice Storm,''' he says, ``and we
usually see her play tall and strong, because that's what she is.
But I suspected she had the fragility I wanted for Alice _ and I
knew she did once I saw her with her daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   To research the role, Weaver not only visited dairy farms, where
she learned to milk goats, but she also stopped by the local jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them to book me,'' she says. ``Surprisingly, they took
me very seriously, even though they hadn't read the novel.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Hamilton remembers accompanying Weaver to the jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I expected at the jail was to see my character
realized, right there, in the cell block,'' Hamilton says, ``but
Sigourney became Alice before my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``A Map of the World'' sounds heavy, ``Galaxy Quest'' is
light as air. Weaver says she made it so her daughter could finally
watch one of Mom's movies. She plays aging sex-symbol actress Gwen
DeMarco, shaking her cat-suited booty along with a big fake mane of
blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   Director Dean Parisot was incredibly pleased, but very
surprised, by her extreme transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept asking her, `Are you sure that wig isn't on too
tight?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great for me, coward that I am, to finally play someone
who's afraid all the time,'' Weaver says. ``To play the babe and to
look like such a babe is really enjoyable. It's such a
traditionally womanly image _ nothing intimidating. It was nice to
be un-angular.
</P>
<P>
   ``And by the way,'' she adds, no doubt referring to those
juttingly angular women she played in ``The Ice Storm,'' ``The Year
of Living Dangerously,'' ``Copycat'' and ``Jeffrey,'' ``those
angular women still care about the way they look.'' &QL;

<P>
   How far is too far?
</P>
<P>
   John Galliano is finding out. The furor over the couture
collection he showed recently for Christian Dior, inspired, he
said, by the ``wet world'' of tramps and hobos he discovered while
jogging around the Seine, just won't go away. In terms of
controversy, it's the biggest thing to hit fashion since Heroin
Chic.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jan. 23, two of The New York Times' most high-profile
columnists have addressed the issue _ Maureen Dowd, who compared
the collection to Rudolph Giuliani's street-sweep of the homeless,
and Cathy Horyn, in a piece on the power of spin.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy took yet another turn on Jan. 27, when riot
police were called in to fend off a small but vocal group of
homeless activists in front of the Dior headquarters and store on
the Avenue Montaigne.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Le Figaro, Dior chairman Bernard Arnault went
on the record about the whole affair for the first time. He
defended the collection vigorously, calling it ``the strongest
presentation since John started at Dior.'
</P>
<P>
   Galliano, he said, ``had transcended his status as a couturier,
and had shown that he was a veritable artist. A gust of genius blew
through the room.''
</P>
<P>
   However, by the end of the day, Galliano himself seemed to
retreat from his defiant stance, when he said that his critics are
``bourgeois people, condescending and smug.'' At the time, Galliano
refused to apologize for anything about the collection, saying, ``I
really, really saw nothing wrong with it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 27, Dior issued a more conciliatory statement, in which
Galliano said, ``I never wanted to make a spectacle of misery, nor
did I intend to do a sociological collection that would be a
documentary of poverty in the street. In no way did I mean it to be
offensive to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   This collection is but the latest of many examples in which a
designer or the industry at large has been accused of tossing out
responsibility in pursuit of hype.
</P>
<P>
   Did Galliano go too far? Many would say no, since one of the
roles of fashion is to provoke and unsettle.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man coming to Paris with his first collection, Yohji
Yamamoto recalled, his point was ``to break the rules, to question
traditional beauty,'' and certainly, there has always been a
faction, usually those on the avant-garde edge, which has continued
to do that.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, with media such a focus and so all-pervasive, the
ante has been increased. And anyone who goes the shock route who
claims a lack of interest in potential publicity can be accused of
being either delusional or disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, some high-profile brouhahas have broken
out on the fashion front. Everybody's all-time favorite, Heroin
Chic, wound up with President Clinton chastising the fashion
industry on the front page of The New York Times. Remember Calvin
Klein and kiddie porn? Now there's Benetton and its merry band of
murderers.
</P>
<P>
   Other designers have caused stirs with their runway themes _
Alexander's McQueen with his ``Highland Rape,'' for example, or
Jean Paul Gaultier and his Hasidic collection.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Rei Kawakubo's fall '95 men's collection for
Comme des Garcons, presented on the 50th anniversary of the
liberation of Auschwitz, for which she was accused _ but denied _
dressing gaunt-looking models to resemble concentration-camp
prisoners. And the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The king of controversy himself, Calvin, thinks that the market
should decide the boundaries of taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make a comparison between John Galliano and Rudolph Giulani
is just nonsense,'' Klein said, referring to Dowd's column. ``One
is a very creative, artistic fashion designer, and the other, a
public servant. Creative people find inspiration in everything
around them, and to have the courage to explore that and show it to
the world _ I applaud John. He's not making a political statement.
He's looking at an unfortunate situation in the world as an artist
and is inspired by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see nothing wrong with someone putting his work out there
for the world to see,'' Klein continued. ``People have the freedom
to express themselves. And this is a business that targets a
market. If John goes in a direction that no one understands, the
company might suffer the consequences in terms of business,
although I would add that all this coverage is probably creating
business for Dior.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, says Galliano's LVMH compatriot Marc Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand them,'' Jacobs said of the collection's
critics. ``I'm not one for the story-telling school of fashion.
Inspiration doesn't make a good piece of clothing. I didn't see the
show, but it sounds very `Let them eat cake' to me, and they cut
off (Marie Antoinette's) head over that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion isn't art. I'm pretty open-minded; I don't take
offense easily. But I think that, whenever you touch on someone's
misfortune or seem to be caricaturing their culture, you're likely
to be misconstrued. Gaultier made the Hasidic Jews furious. Comme
des Garcons made the concentration-camp survivors furious. Wasn't
it Chanel who made the Muslims furious over some sacred writing on
a dress?
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspiration is a personal thing; you can find it anywhere. The
danger is not in being inspired by a group of people, the danger is
in boasting about the inspiration, unless you're putting it to a
charitable pursuit. Once you start talking about it, it becomes
exploitation, and I don't think that's right. You don't go around
parading on other people's plight.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, underscoring the whole debate is that the venue was
couture, creating the juxtaposition of unimaginable wealth against
unimaginable poverty. That's a tough one to get past, no matter how
much respect one has for Galliano's brilliance. And there's no
question, ``let them eat cake'' is alive and well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt John was honoring the homeless,'' said Mouna Ayoub,
currently couture's most editorial client. Ayoub purchased five of
the collection's looks for her personal wardrobe, and bought one _
the ``burnt coat'' made to look, Galliano said, as if the wearer
had ``gotten too near a fire'' _ for her couture collection. She
will house it in a 12-room Paris apartment she has converted into a
veritable museum, just for her own collection of haute couture.
</P>
<P>
   ``By bringing the homeless on the podium, it's an homage. He
brought them on the podium, and we cannot forget them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayoub then turned to Galliano's critics. ``If they took one
close look at these dresses, everyone would understand. They didn't
see these dresses close up like I did. The workmanship is
fantastic. Chapeaux off to the seamstresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, not everyone would agree with Ayoub.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Cohen, president and ceo of the Partnership for the
Homeless in New York, believes that an olive branch can be wielded
more effectively than a sword.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to extend an invitation to John Galliano,'' he said.
``Let's use this as an opportunity to raise some funds, support our
programs, work with the Partnership, putting an end to all this
uproar. Use this as an opportunity to raise public awareness about
how homelessness devastates lives the lives of men, women and
children on the streets, especially now in this bitter cold. I'd
love to work with John Galliano and put together an event.'' &QL;

<P>
   How far is too far?
</P>
<P>
   John Galliano is finding out. The furor over the couture
collection he showed recently for Christian Dior, inspired, he
said, by the ``wet world'' of tramps and hobos he discovered while
jogging around the Seine, just won't go away. In terms of
controversy, it's the biggest thing to hit fashion since Heroin
Chic.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jan. 23, two of The New York Times' most high-profile
columnists have addressed the issue _ Maureen Dowd, who compared
the collection to Rudolph Giuliani's street-sweep of the homeless,
and Cathy Horyn, in a piece on the power of spin.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy took yet another turn on Jan. 27, when riot
police were called in to fend off a small but vocal group of
homeless activists in front of the Dior headquarters and store on
the Avenue Montaigne.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Le Figaro, Dior chairman Bernard Arnault went
on the record about the whole affair for the first time. He
defended the collection vigorously, calling it ``the strongest
presentation since John started at Dior.'
</P>
<P>
   Galliano, he said, ``had transcended his status as a couturier,
and had shown that he was a veritable artist. A gust of genius blew
through the room.''
</P>
<P>
   However, by the end of the day, Galliano himself seemed to
retreat from his defiant stance, when he said that his critics are
``bourgeois people, condescending and smug.'' At the time, Galliano
refused to apologize for anything about the collection, saying, ``I
really, really saw nothing wrong with it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 27, Dior issued a more conciliatory statement, in which
Galliano said, ``I never wanted to make a spectacle of misery, nor
did I intend to do a sociological collection that would be a
documentary of poverty in the street. In no way did I mean it to be
offensive to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   This collection is but the latest of many examples in which a
designer or the industry at large has been accused of tossing out
responsibility in pursuit of hype.
</P>
<P>
   Did Galliano go too far? Many would say no, since one of the
roles of fashion is to provoke and unsettle.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man coming to Paris with his first collection, Yohji
Yamamoto recalled, his point was ``to break the rules, to question
traditional beauty,'' and certainly, there has always been a
faction, usually those on the avant-garde edge, which has continued
to do that.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, with media such a focus and so all-pervasive, the
ante has been increased. And anyone who goes the shock route who
claims a lack of interest in potential publicity can be accused of
being either delusional or disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, some high-profile brouhahas have broken
out on the fashion front. Everybody's all-time favorite, Heroin
Chic, wound up with President Clinton chastising the fashion
industry on the front page of The New York Times. Remember Calvin

<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, DEL. _ A newly ``retooled'' George W. Bush _ the term was
used by his campaign _ flew into the small East Coast state of
Delaware Monday, intent on finishing off his pesky challenger,
Steve Forbes, and simultaneously banishing the memory of his
chastening defeat in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   With his presidential bid appearing suddenly vulnerable and less
than two weeks to go before the key primary in South Carolina, Bush
is having to treat Tuesday's Delaware primary as a serious test.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware may be small _ it has only 750,000 inhabitants and
elects only one member of the U.S. House of Representatives _ but
as the first state to ratify the Constitution, it enjoys a certain
cachet.
</P>
<P>
   It also has two highly experienced senators and wields
disproportionate legislative clout, thanks to its relative wealth
and its prowess in banking and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Its liberal tax laws have attracted many corporations to site
their headquarters here, among them some of Bush's most generous
donors.
</P>
<P>
   Which is one reason why he is campaigning here in person: among
supporters in the miniature state capital, Dover; among servicemen
at the nearby Air Force Base (one of the major shipping points for
aid to Kosovo last year); and among big corporate sponsors in the
state's business powerhouse, the city of Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is the billionaire publisher, Steve Forbes, whose
own base lies just to the north, in the state of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Forbes may not look the greatest threat to Bush's
presidential prospects. That honor currently goes to Senator John
McCain, who trounced him by 18 points in New Hampshire and has
drawn level in opinion polls in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking the big money of either a Bush or a Forbes, however,
McCain has picked his contests carefully, choosing to disregard
Delaware, as he did the Iowa caucuses two weeks ago. He is applying
all his effort to South Carolina, and the primary shortly
thereafter in the northerly state of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In his newly aggressive campaign mode, Bush scorned his rival's
tactics. McCain's absence, though, leaves him in a straight fight
with Forbes _ who actually won the Delaware primary four years ago,
beating the party favorite, Robert Dole, into second place.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Dole had chosen, like McCain this year, not to campaign
in Delaware, but the notion persists that Delaware is Forbes's sort
of state, and he has campaigned here as though that were so.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, election day, he will have spent four full days
here, breaking only last Friday to speak at a state party gathering
in California.
</P>
<P>
   Often an awkward campaigner, Forbes has nonetheless gone from
town hall to town hall, spreading his message of tax reform and
presenting himself in the guise of ``independent outsider'' that
has proved so successful for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Just north of Dover, in the small town of Smyrna _ a town whose
commercial heart has been comprehensively killed by the nearby
shopping center _ Forbes found a typical standing-room-only crowd
of around 200 waiting for him in the fire station hall.
</P>
<P>
   They were small business people and pensioners mostly, none of
them wealthy, and not all of them loyal. The name John McCain was
on many lips, even though he had not deigned to campaign in their
state.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush appeared to be widely disliked, except by the dozen
or so young pickets who stood on the pavement outside with large
Bush placards.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has some good lines. He compares the length of the
Gettysburg Address, the Declaration of Independence and even the
Bible with the 7 million plus words of the U.S. tax code.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests that redundant taxmen could usefully be redeployed
shovelling away some of the snow piled up beside Delaware's roads.
</P>
<P>
   And to all those in Washington who say we cannot scrap the tax
code? ``Well, hello guys! Whose country is this?''
</P>
<P>
   In the televised Republican debates, it was clear that there is
little love lost between the stolid Forbes and the smooth George W.
And rumors abound that the Republican Party has urged Forbes to end
his bid so that Bush can take on McCain without lesser
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Bush needs is another poor primary showing. But
Forbes has the money (his own) to fight on, and he might not be
averse to diluting Bush's effort.
</P>
<P>
   At least as of Monday, the Forbes camp was adamant: ``We are in
this to the end.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The tightening of the Republican race this week
following John McCain's spectacular victory in the New Hampshire
primary plunged into the spotlight two women who had hitherto done
their best to remain in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, wife of George W. for the past 22 years, and Cindy
McCain, married to John for almost 20 years, were both at their
husband's side in the last days of campaigning and again at their
post-campaign speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush, unaccustomed to hearing her husband concede defeat,
stood stoically beside him at the microphone, with their
17-year-old twins _ the very picture of blonde, cheerleading young
womanhood - behind.
</P>
<P>
   A teacher and librarian before she met and married George W.,
Mrs. Bush, 53, has done the traditional thing as first lady of
Texas, devoting herself to good works _ children's literacy above
all _ and what Americans call ``homemaking'' (being a housewife).
</P>
<P>
   Dressed most often in trousers and cardigan, she exudes an air
of capable common sense and wifely loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Present or absent, she always features at the start of her
husband's standard stump speech: Marrying Laura, he says, was the
best decision he ever made, then he habitually draws a laugh by
adding ``though it may not be the best decision she ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   He also claims that a pre-marriage pledge to her that she would
not have to make speeches is the ``only promise I have ever
broken.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mrs. Bush has made relatively few solo appearances on
her husband's behalf and sometimes seems sullen when traipsing
after him in public.
</P>
<P>
   She gave a rare glimpse of relaxed domesticity last week when
she watched her husband reveal himself as a dab hand with a spatula
during a pancake-tossing contest.
</P>
<P>
   Absent or demurely submissive during campaigning, Mrs. Bush is
quite capable of speaking for herself. But when she does, she
wisely keeps to homely subjects, as she did in a pre-Christmas
television interview, where she appeared jointly with her
formidable mother-in-law, Barbara Bush, beside the family Christmas
tree.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking extempore, she comes across as surprisingly strident
and broadly Texan, suggesting another side to her that could be a
liability to her husband when the campaign trail goes fully
national.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Hensley, 45, became John McCain's second wife in 1980,
several years after he divorced his first wife _ a divorce for
which he takes abject responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   After appearing utterly terrified by the razzmatazz and the
crowds at the start of his presidential campaigning, she has
recently relaxed a little and frequently appears solo, deputizing
for her husband when Senate duties keep him from fulfilling
campaign engagements.
</P>
<P>
   In his 18 years as a congressman and senator, she has hardly
come to Washington at all, staying with their family in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter of a wealthy Arizona family and _ like Laura Bush _ a
teacher by training, Mrs. McCain founded a children's medical
charity in 1988 that works in war zones and regularly travels with
its missions, most recently to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, she started a second children's charity that
works in Arizona and neighboring states. The McCains have four
children, and one adopted _ a child she brought back from one of
her charity trips to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   She tells how, when she arrived at the airport, he was there to
meet her and asked where the child would stay. ``With us,'' she
replied, to which he responded: ``I thought so,'' _ just like that.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCain, who is strikingly good-looking and always
impeccably dressed and coiffed in a suburban American way, brought
a skeleton out of her closet early by admitting last spring that
she had been addicted to painkillers, even to the point of stealing
the drugs from shipments intended for her charity.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, for his part, went on the record to regret that he
had been perhaps ``wrapped up too much in Washington and my
ambitions'' to notice her problem until a very late stage. The
sting thus drawn, reporters have left the subject alone. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The tightening of the Republican race this week
following John McCain's spectacular victory in the New Hampshire
primary plunged into the spotlight two women who had hitherto done
their best to remain in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, wife of George W. for the past 22 years, and Cindy
McCain, married to John for almost 20 years, were both at their
husband's side in the last days of campaigning and again at their
post-campaign speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush, unaccustomed to hearing her husband concede defeat,
stood stoically beside him at the microphone, with their
17-year-old twins _ the very picture of blonde, cheerleading young
womanhood - behind.
</P>
<P>
   A teacher and librarian before she met and married George W.,
Mrs. Bush, 53, has done the traditional thing as first lady of
Texas, devoting herself to good works _ children's literacy above
all _ and what Americans call ``homemaking'' (being a housewife).
</P>
<P>
   Dressed most often in trousers and cardigan, she exudes an air
of capable common sense and wifely loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Present or absent, she always features at the start of her
husband's standard stump speech: Marrying Laura, he says, was the
best decision he ever made, then he habitually draws a laugh by
adding ``though it may not be the best decision she ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   He also claims that a pre-marriage pledge to her that she would
not have to make speeches is the ``only promise I have ever
broken.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mrs. Bush has made relatively few solo appearances on
her husband's behalf and sometimes seems sullen when traipsing
after him in public.
</P>
<P>
   She gave a rare glimpse of relaxed domesticity last week when
she watched her husband reveal himself as a dab hand with a spatula
during a pancake-tossing contest.
</P>
<P>
   Absent or demurely submissive during campaigning, Mrs. Bush is
quite capable of speaking for herself. But when she does, she
wisely keeps to homely subjects, as she did in a pre-Christmas
television interview, where she appeared jointly with her
formidable mother-in-law, Barbara Bush, beside the family Christmas
tree.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking extempore, she comes across as surprisingly strident
and broadly Texan, suggesting another side to her that could be a
liability to her husband when the campaign trail goes fully
national.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Hensley, 45, became John McCain's second wife in 1980,
several years after he divorced his first wife _ a divorce for
which he takes abject responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   After appearing utterly terrified by the razzmatazz and the
crowds at the start of his presidential campaigning, she has
recently relaxed a little and frequently appears solo, deputizing
for her husband when Senate duties keep him from fulfilling
campaign engagements.
</P>
<P>
   In his 18 years as a congressman and senator, she has hardly
come to Washington at all, staying with their family in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter of a wealthy Arizona family and _ like Laura Bush _ a
teacher by training, Mrs. McCain founded a children's medical
charity in 1988 that works in war zones and regularly travels with
its missions, most recently to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, she started a second children's charity that
works in Arizona and neighboring states. The McCains have four
children, and one adopted _ a child she brought back from one of
her charity trips to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   She tells how, when she arrived at the airport, he was there to
meet her and asked where the child would stay. ``With us,'' she
replied, to which he responded: ``I thought so,'' _ just like that.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCain, who is strikingly good-looking and always
impeccably dressed and coiffed in a suburban American way, brought
a skeleton out of her closet early by admitting last spring that
she had been addicted to painkillers, even to the point of stealing
the drugs from shipments intended for her charity.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, for his part, went on the record to regret that he
had been perhaps ``wrapped up too much in Washington and my
ambitions'' to notice her problem until a very late stage. The
sting thus drawn, reporters have left the subject alone. &QL;

SWIMMING WITH LEONARDO DICAPRIO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Note italics below) 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAPALUA, Hawaii _ If Leonardo DiCaprio can't go anywhere in the
world without being recognized, that's because there isn't anywhere
in the world his mug hasn't been seen. And not just seen but
adored, splashed across giant-size posters, newspapers and magazine
covers, the subject of countless television profiles.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Boyle, director of the Friday-opening ``The Beach,'' the
first film DiCaprio has made since the ``Titanic'' refused to go
down, says, ``You'd meet these really old Thai ladies who lived in
the middle of nowhere and spoke no English but they knew the words
`Jack Dawson.' You realize that the way that film went around the
world was absolutely frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beach,'' very casually adapted from the Alex Garland best
seller, stars DiCaprio as Richard, a bored thrill-seeker in
Thailand who comes upon a mysterious map promising an Edenic
paradise. Recruiting the requisite eye candy (Virginie Ledoyen) and
disposable boyfriend (Guillaume Canet) to accompany him on the
trek, Richard lands at a compound run with a velvet sledgehammer by
the eccentrically enigmatic Sal (Tilda Swinton). Its inhabitants,
it seems, have only dipped their toes into the concept of going
native: Many of them would still rather peer into the small screen
of a GameBoy than drink in the gorgeous island scenery. Traditional
Western narrative codices dictate that things subsequently go
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   (Virginie Ledoyen, on how she'd respond if handed such a map:
``I would think it's just bulls--t.'')
</P>
<P>
   So, can the world handle another round of Leo-mania? Relax. The
guy at Ground Zero of all the hoopla says it ain't gonna happen.
</P>
<P>
   The hype, DiCaprio says, ``really has (waned), actually. Not in
the sense that I'm probably just as recognizable as I always was,
but the sort of fever that came after `Titanic' _ which I had no
control over or no input into and literally no involvement with. It
wasn't me, you know what I mean? That has died down. I knew that
after `Titanic' faded down, that that would fade down, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He harbors a blank equanimity toward his
getting-screamed-at-wherever-he-goes-by-teen-age-girls lot in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There're days that you sometimes enjoy being a recognizable
person, but most of the time you'd rather have your anonymity and
private life. But there're pros and cons to anything.'' He offers
the usual observations of fame _ unwanted responsibilities but
great opportunities, etc. _ and mentions all the usual suspects _
family, friends _ that help keep him, as they say, grounded.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old actor has come to talk in standard-issue Young
Hollywood attire: Black T-shirt, baggy jeans that'd be more secure
around his rib cage or his hips than his waist, sneakers
camouflaged as brown bowling shoes, a wisp of a goatee and
insouciantly moussed hair that can't just look that roguishly
tousled by happy accident; it must be fussed over.
</P>
<P>
   DiCaprio is right in one respect: ``Titanic'' was both a
blessing and a curse for him. Before, he was an interesting young
actor with one Oscar nomination already under his belt (for
``What's Eating Gilbert Grape'') and some intriguing little movies
(``The Basketball Diaries,'' ``Marvin's Room,'' ``Total Eclipse'')
that no one bothered to see but which had earned him some serious
indie credibility. ``Titanic,'' following on the heels of the
hyper-hysterical poseur's updating of ``Romeo and Juliet,'' turned
him into a heartthrob, pure and simple.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, DiCaprio didn't seem awfully grateful to ``Titanic''
director James Cameron. Rumors of a rift reached their apex when
DiCaprio blew off the Oscars the night Cameron christened himself
``King of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of misconceptions about (our
relationship),'' DiCaprio says. ``It takes that type of personality
to be able to command that type of film. You need that presence
amongst thousands of people doing hundreds of different jobs
simultaneously to bring that movie together.'' Well put and highly
diplomatic, but DiCaprio throws it all away with the next question:
Compare and contrast Cameron with his latest director, Boyle. ``He
and Danny are polar opposites. Danny is an inherently sweet,
genuine person who's really sensitive,'' DiCaprio says. ``They're
really different.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``Titanic'' induced enough teen-age tears to make Kleenex
stock soar higher than an Internet startup, DiCaprio spent a couple
of years globe-trotting and getting copiously mentioned in gossip
columns _ those who complain that ``youth is wasted on the young''
should meet this guy _ before hitting ``The Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beach'' producer Andrew MacDonald conceded that in the large
wake of ``Titanic,'' a ``credibility factor'' question dangles over
DiCaprio's head. And many of the liberties taken with Garland's
book _ transforming him from an irresolute, abstinent Brit to a
hot-dogging American who beds two women _ seemed cynical ploys to
cash in on the superstar's pinup status. It also meant DiCaprio
hip-checked Ewan MacGregor, a longtime Boyle-MacDonald collaborator
(``Trainspotting,'' ``A Life Less Ordinary''), out of a role the
latter hungered for. ``People in London didn't like the fact that
he was going to be in it _ my wife, actually,'' MacDonald admits.
``Ewan was ... upset that he didn't get to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald does allow that DiCaprio is hardly appeasing his
``Titanic'' fans. ``Leo wants to do it for a different audience;
the studio would've preferred `T2,''' he says. ``If we had made it
for $10 million, we would have made it darker.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyle, on the other hand, embraced the changes DiCaprio brought
to the project. ``In the book, he's (BEGIN ITAL)so(END ITAL)
British, he just keeps looking at this French girl and thinking how
beautiful she is, and he never tells her,'' Boyle says, exasperated
at the very thought. ``He sits there wistfully _ he's very
repressed _ and never says what he's feeling. And the first thing
we decided was, `Well, we've got to get rid of that. He's got to
get on with the French girl _ it's a movie, for Christ's sake, it's
all about contact.' And if it's a good decision, other things roll
on from that. It became part of Richard's character _ he's very
passive in the book, and he's much more a conqueror in the film.''
</P>
<P>
   For DiCaprio, ``The Beach'' represented a good compromise
between art film and blockbuster. ``It's not true that I just want
to make smaller films _ I want to try everything,'' he says.
``Before `Titanic,' I did do smaller films, because that was really
what was available to me. And `Titanic' was actually a break from
the norm for me. It was something that I tried that was different.
This is getting back to what I did before that. I'm young. I'm
still experimenting. Whatever genre of film it is, I don't want to
get stuck into one sort of a mold. I want to diversify myself as an
actor and try as many different characters and styles of filmmaking
as I can.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wasn't in the position I'm in, it certainly wouldn't be
the same (film), but just because there's more money involved
doesn't mean you can't make an experimental, subversive film.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``The Beach'' is subversive, DiCaprio believes. ``I love
what it said,'' he says. ``Without speaking for a generation, it
just talks about how we've been so desensitized in a lot of ways.
We're so influenced by the media, and everything nowadays is even
more and more prepackaged and predigested and prethought-out for
us. This character goes in search of something tangible and real,
emotional _ a real experience that he can connect with. And he goes
traveling in Thailand and ends up finding this piratelike utopia,
which seems to be the answer to all his problems. And in the end,
he eventually realizes that paradise is essentially a false
concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, the studio wasn't as interested in being so
subversive. ``They would've liked for him to stay with the girl to
be more romantic,'' Boyle remembers, ``but we were absolutely
adamant _ the whole point is that the thing seems to be the perfect
ingredients, and it twists and turns in the second half.'' Boyle
adds that the studio would have preferred for Richard not to have
been the impetus for what is basically the whole third act of the
film. Asked how they presumed to change things, he merely smiles
and shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even more than that, and this is what we found really
interesting, they didn't like that he lies to the girl,'' Boyle
adds. ``He lies a few times in the film, and he lies not for the
greater good, just to save his own skin. And they found that
really, really difficult. And I said, `Look, people lie! The
president lies!' and they said to us, `Yeah, but this is a movie.'
I think the difference between viewing a film in Britain and
viewing it in America is that when they identify with a lead, they
invest in that character their trust. It's really weird.''
</P>
<P>
   While filming in Thailand, DiCaprio experienced one of those
negatives associated with fame: Environmental groups attacked him
personally in an effort to call attention to the ecological
problems in that country. Their thinking may have been cloudy _
Leo's shooting in nature, therefore Leo's directly responsible for
ruining the environment _ or they may have been crazy like foxes.
</P>
<P>
   As Boyle puts it, ``Their protest was an attempt through his
fame to raise the profile of the environment in Thailand, which I
think is actually a very good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCaprio may see things differently. ``It's something that I
have no control over,'' he says. ``I have no control over what
people say about me, or what they attach me to. For example, with
the environmental thing, I was used as a sort of figurehead for
what was going on with the studios' relationship with the forestry
department in renting the island. Unfortunately, we got caught in
the middle and were used as a test case for the propaganda that was
going on there with the government and the forestry department and
the environmentalists, and meanwhile we had done absolutely nothing
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCaprio is returning to work more quickly this time _ after
all, inducing whispers for activities like hitting the bar with
buddy Tobey Maguire while lounging here in Maui has to grow
tiresome after a while. His next project is Martin Scorsese's
``Gangs of New York.'' And he's being talked up as a teen-age
Anakin Skywalker in George Lucas' next ``Star Wars'' flick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll see when I read the script,'' is all DiCaprio will say.
``I thought the first one was interesting. There was more that
could be done, though.''
</P>
<P>
   If the script matched the quality of the last film, would he be
interested?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he says as diplomatically as possible. ``I
can't make that assumption.'' But his eyes roll around in their
sockets, flashing playfully an unspoken message: ``Don't get me
into trouble!''
</P>
<P>
   Producer MacDonald notes that MacGregor, who lost the ``Beach''
role to DiCaprio, would also be in the next ``Star Wars'' film. He
enthuses, ``I'd like to see that light-sabre fight!'' &QL;

BIG FITNESS GAINS BEGIN (AND CONTINUE!) WITH BABY STEPS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHIL DAVIS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first thing Van Nuys running coach Patrick Connelly tells
his students is not to even think how it will feel to run the L.A.
Marathon _ even though that's their ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of running up and down L.A.'s famous hills for 26.2
miles is enough to make even a seasoned athlete throw in the towel.
It seems almost impossible, endless. The same overwhelming feeling
a 300-pound coach potato might feel on the first day at the gym.
But Connelly still manages to transform 1,500 bench warmers into
marathoners in six months.
</P>
<P>
   His strategy is simple: Focus on small, attainable goals that
increase slightly each week.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for couch potatoes is Connelly's motivational
formula works on just about any tough task _ even if you don't plan
on running a marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Need to lose 100 pounds? Shoot for 10 pounds at first. Want to
quit smoking? Cut the number of cigarettes smoked in a day by 10
percent. Want to get in shape? Start with short walks instead of
plunging right into running or joining a fitness club.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to success is setting goals _ no matter how small _
that can be reached. America's multibillion-dollar fitness industry
shows there's no shortage of motivation out there, but statistics
also show more than half of all Americans are overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Call them exercise dropouts.
</P>
<P>
   They drowned in good intentions somewhere between signing up for
that fitness club membership and actually reaching the point where
fitness becomes a pleasure instead of a chore. Just as problems get
worse on the way down, things get better on the way up. Really.
</P>
<P>
   Jerald Jellison, a professor of psychology at the University of
Southern California, points to a study on fitness club membership.
Researchers found that while most people initially joined to lose
weight, the majority of people who renewed their membership cited
stress reduction as the main reason. An external or extrinsic goal
_ looking better _ became an internal or intrinsic goal, ridding
the body of stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear this phrase all the time: `You can't make people want
to do something,''' Jellison said. ``Well, it turns out that's not
true. You can make people want to do things if you arrange it in
small, easy stepswhere they can succeed. Give them rewards to help
them through the difficult initial phase, then they will want to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people fail to reach that plateau because they set their
expectations too high, or count on some marketing promise of a
quick fix _ ``thin thighs in 30 days'' videos,
eat-whatever-you-want diets or exercise equipment promising the
body of Suzanne Somers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's advertised as a quick fix,'' said Dr. David Feinberg, a
psychiatrist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and
author of ``Don't Let Your HMO Kill You'' (Rutledge; $14.95). ``We
all want quick results. We want to look like the guy in the
brochure, but that's totally unrealistic. Most of us have neither
the time nor the physical ability to achieve those kinds of
results. But to just exercise to where we're at a normal body
weight with the ability to climb stairs, almost anybody can do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, people are so transfixed by the hype _ miracle diet,
film at 11 _ they forget that fitness can be fun, said Joanie
Greggains, host of TV's ``Morning Workout'' and author of ``Fit
Happens'' (Villiard; $19.95). Maybe boot camp-style aerobics or
karaoke spinning might be fun for some, but it's sure to send some
people straight back to the couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fitness is not an obligation,'' Greggains said. ``Nobody ever
says, `OK, it's time to go out and ride your bike so you can get
thin thighs in 30 days.' We can make choices. So, face the facts,
if it's not fun, if you're not going to enjoy it, you're not going
to do it ... you're going to be an exercise dropout. You're going
to start every program, order every tape, and none of it's going to
stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Greggains is a firm believer in ``whatever works.'' One caller
to her radio show lost 40 pounds on an exercise regimen that began
with only five minutes on an exercise machine. She worked out
during her favorite soaps and, ultimately, increased increments
until she was working out for two full hours.
</P>
<P>
   The woman started out small, and was able to increase
incrementally just as Connelly's marathoners add miles to their
workout each week. Only the pace was different.
</P>
<P>
   The final key to successful motivation is good cheerleading. It
feels good when people notice a few dropped pounds. Jellison said
it's crucial to recruit a good cheerleading squad early on. They
provide the little rewards that make it easier to keep going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, you're going to have someone encouraging you along
the way,'' he said. ``That's one of the values of doing it with a
group of people or having a partner. But it can even simply be a
spouse who says, `How'd it go at the gym today?' They're showing
they care that you're doing it. I'm doing it right now for a friend
who has smoked for 50 years. I call her once or twice a day and
say, `How's it going? Good for you.' I'm a cheerleader. That's what
helps people get through the tough parts.''
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, there will be tough parts. There is no gain without a
little pain. And when it hurts, Connelly said, it helps to reflect
on the ultimate goal _ feeling good.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand you're going to advance your quality of
life,'' said coach Connelly, slipping easily into the role of
cheerleader. ``You're going to be living every day to the fullest.
You're going to lose weight, you're going to look better _ you're
going to have a sparkle in your eye.'' &QL;

   STEAL OF THE MILLENNIUM? _ In its ``Persons of the Century''
edition, Time magazine made a big blunder, writes columnist TIm
Giago. ``Under the heading, `Steal of the Millennium,' Time
announced, ``On Aug. 10, 1626, the Canarsee Delaware Indians agreed
to sell the 22-square-mile Manhattes island at the mouth of the
Hudson River to Dutch settlers under Peter Minuit. The price: cloth
and trinkets. At the end of the 20th century, Manhattan was
estimated to be worth at least $143 billion.''' But Indian tribes
do not sell their land. ``Every tribe considers the Earth to be
their mother, and one does not sell their mother,'' Giago writes.
The truth: Settlers usually moved on to the Indian land, set up
housekeeping, and when the landlords protested, offered to pay a
price to continue living on the land. In this commentary, Giago
debunks this longstanding myth about the sale of Manhattes island.

   A MISSING CHAPTER. For years, children's literature has sat on
the backburner of publishing, the forgotten child in world of
``real literature,'' writes columnist Amy Wu. But thanks to J.K.
Rowling's creation of a child wizard in the ``Harry Potter''
series, children's literature is experiencing a renaissance. Wu
believes that the spotlight on Harry Potter does not make up for
the real void in children's literature _ the lack of true diversity
and, even more disturbing, the lack of debate about it. ``There is
a real need for stories that reflect America's changing face and
that dispel the myths about different people,'' Wu writes. ``And
there is room to tell these stories in a creative way.''
</P>
<P>
   AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE KEY TO CAMPAIGN 2000. Regardless Of who
gets elected as our next president, Campaign 2000 will be notable
for two breakthroughs that have received very little attention: Two
African-Americans _ a Democrat and a Republican _ have scaled the
campaign hierarchy of white candidates and hold positions that
blacks have never held before. As national chairman of GOP
candidate Steve Forbes' campaign, Ken Blackwell is the first black
to oversee the presidential campaign of a prominent white
candidate. As Vice President Al Gore's campaign manager, Donna
Brazile is the first black woman to run the day-to-day operations
of a major presidential contender. A report by Kevin Merida.

   KENNEWICK MAN'S PAINFUL JOURNEY CONTINUES. Clues to America's
past lie within the bones of a 9,200-year-old skeleton found in a
Pacific Northwest river more than three years ago. This prehistoric
man lived more than nine millennia ago. The significance of these
bones is that they may lend credence to a scientific theory that
people other than American Indians are the real First Americans. In
the three years since his resurgence, Kennewick Man, so called
because he was discovered in the Columbia River near Kennewick,
Wash., has been caught in a philosophical chasm between
evolutionists and Native-American creationists. ``I see and
understand both sides,'' writes columnist Karen Lincoln Michel.
``But my thoughts are with ... an ancient man who lost his life
along the Columbia River. As Kennewick Man is probed for more
clues, it seems his painful journey continues.''
</P>
<P>
   ELIAN, IN HIS OWN WORDS. Since 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez was
found clinging to an inner tube in the Florida straits, he has been
caught in a battle between Cuba and the United States, between his
father and his U.S. relatives. It seems as though everyone has
spoken for young Elian except the child himself. ``So far, we've
heard from his lawyers, a swarm of politicians and practically
every one of the boy's relatives. But what does Elian have to
say?'' asks columnist James Garcia. In this imaginary interview,
Garcia asks young Elian whether or not he would like to go home.

AUGUST WILSON'S `JITNEY' RUNS VERY WELL, INDEED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The velvety timbre of Marvin Gaye, soaring through the Mark
Taper Forum, is our first clue that August Wilson's ``Jitney'' is a
period drama pitched at the midpoint between hope and resignation,
dreams and disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gaye, after all, whose keening pop-soul protest anthems
of the early `70s echoed the waning black power movement and helped
define the ambivalent state of black America in the post-Vietnam
years.
</P>
<P>
   In Wilson's native Pittsburgh and similar Rust Belt enclaves,
the growing gap between expectation and reality had by then become
painfully obvious to many African-Americans. Which, in response,
was the proper course of action: Run for your life, or stand and
fight the power?
</P>
<P>
   This is the setting, and the resounding ethical dilemma, that
shapes Wilson's coming-out play, which is receiving a first-tier
production at the Taper from director Marion McClinton and an
ensemble cast as virtuous and harmoniously emphatic as a
rock-steady r&AMP;b unit.
</P>
<P>
   Written and originally produced in 1978, before Wilson had
imprinted his rumbling, lyrical baritone on the American theater,
``Jitney'' is relatively compact by Wilsonian standards, just over
two hours. Though lacking the full-throttle poeticism of his later
works, it's as solidly assembled as a Buick, with high-octane
passion to burn. Wilson apparently has reworked the play
extensively in recent years, and its only obvious remaining flaw is
that it needs a conventional Oedipal key to jumpstart its fairly
simple plot.
</P>
<P>
   That key is the fractured relationship between Becker (Paul
Butler), the owner of a jitney, or taxi service, in Pittsburgh's
decaying Hill District, and his 39-year-old son, Booster (Carl
Lumbly).
</P>
<P>
   A church deacon and towering moral figure, Becker is a strict
but fair employer, who keeps order among a motley crew of four
jitney drivers and a hanger-on or two.
</P>
<P>
   All beautifully performed, they include Shealy (Willis Burks
II), a gap-toothed numbers runner; Youngblood (Russell Hornsby), a
Vietnam veteran constantly in dutch with his girlfriend (Michole
Briana White); and, best of all, the gossipy, mischief-making
Turnbo, played by Stephen McKinley Henderson as a kind of
inner-city Sir John Falstaff. Set to the staccato rhythm of the
jitney station's constantly ringing phone, the play makes ample
room for their funny, stirring personal stories.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Jitney'' begins, Butler is awaiting Booster's imminent
release from the local penitentiary, where he has spent 20 years
for murdering his rich, white college girlfriend after she falsely
accused him of raping her.
</P>
<P>
   We can sense the coming showdown between the upstanding,
play-by-the-rules father, who blames Booster for throwing away his
life, and the son who only wanted to stand tall in his father's
eyes by repaying a racist slap.
</P>
<P>
   While Wilson later revisited father-son conflict in ``Fences''
(1986), there's a raw, compelling edge to his treatment of it here,
abetted by the two dynamic actors' fiery chemistry. Lumbly makes
Booster's tortured integrity shine through his handsome features,
while Butler's imposingly righteous presence gives ``Jitney'' its
steel-frame backbone. We can easily see why his fellow drivers
would rally round Becker when he opts to resist the white
bureaucrats who want to tear down the block and build housing.
</P>
<P>
   In their different ways, all the play's characters are, as
Booster puts it, ``warriors'' combating a common enemy. Typically
of this urbane playwright's empathic vision, ``Jitney'' doesn't
crudely label that enemy. Rather, it invites us to see that
self-respect, like moral justice, is a two-way street, where a soul
must always prepare itself for the long haul. &QL;

<P>
   In the latest frontier for on-line investing, do-it-yourselfers
with as little as $20 to $50 to regularly put into the market can
buy shares in companies such as Kmart and Microsoft on the
Internet, for as little as $2 per transaction.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of corporations, including Allstate, Campbell
Soup, Caterpillar, Merck, Nokia, and Tandy, allow direct stock
purchases on line, through either their own Web sites or other
sites, such as www.netstockdirect.com and www.stockpower.com.
</P>
<P>
   These on-line programs are typically extensions of a company's
existing dividend reinvestment program (DRIP) or direct stock
purchase program (DSP) _ ways of investing that predate the
Internet and usually require ownership of at least one share of the
stock already, or a minimum of a few hundred dollars to open an
account. Additional purchases at as low as $25 to $50 can be made,
with low or no fees.
</P>
<P>
   But two of the newest investing sites for small
do-it-yourselfers _ www.buyandhold.com and www.sharebuilder.com _
open up thousands of other companies to individual investors,
whether or not they have a DRIP or a DSP. That means folks can get
into companies such as Microsoft, Dell Computer, and America Online
with a low or no-minimum investment, and with fees ranging from $2
to $2.99 per purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advent of the Internet is facilitating the creation of
more and more do-it-yourselfers,'' said Charles B. Carlson, editor
of the DRIP Investor newsletter and author of such popular books as
``Buying Stocks Without a Broker.''
</P>
<P>
   Both buyandhold.com and sharebuilder.com came on line within the
last three months and are privately owned. Buyandhold.com, based in
New York, has Carlson on its board of directors, while
sharebuilder.com, based in Washington state, is part of the company
that owns the netstockdirect.com Web site, which Carlson used to be
involved with.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike traditional brokerages, neither site offers stock
recommendations, on-line research, or financial planning advice,
but they do offer education about the wealth-building capacity of
regularly investing a little bit at a time, the power of
reinvesting dividends, and the advantage of holding for the long
term.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're completely revolutionizing how people are going to
interact with the market,'' said Peter E. Breen, chief executive of
buyandhold.com and formerly a partner with Shareholder
Communications Corp. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The site currently sells 1,300 stocks and has about 35,000
subscribers, according to Breen, who said that in buyandhold.com's
first month and a half, a little over $7 million in assets was
invested.
</P>
<P>
   Among buyandhold.com's features: Open an account on line and
make purchases of as little as $20; a $2.99 transaction fee for
purchase or sale of stock, which is executed twice a day, morning
and afternoon; dividends reinvested at no charge; electronic
transfers from your bank account to fund purchases; and on-line
account statements.
</P>
<P>
   Sharebuilder.com operates under the same basic concept of
empowering the little guy and also offers on-line account
statements and electronic transfer of funds, but it differs in some
of the details: no minimum to open an account on line or make a
purchase; a $2 fee to buy shares ($1 for custodial accounts for
minors) on a once-a-week basis, and a $19.95 fee to sell or buy
shares on a real-time basis at current market prices; free account
for the first 12 months and then $11.95 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Sharebuilder.com currently offers more than 2,000 stocks but is
not disclosing how many accounts have been opened or how much in
assets it currently has.
</P>
<P>
   With sharebuilder.com, ``you have a very easy to use, very cheap
way to accumulate stocks in over 2,000 companies,'' said Jeff
Seely, president and chief executive of Netstock Direct Corp., and
a former investment banker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great vehicle for parents or grandparents wanting to
save money for their kids.''

CAREER PEAK: BOTTOM RUNG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN TRAUSCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; People think Steve Hoffman must have burned out, or messed up,
or just plain flipped. Why else would a 47-year-old guy with a
family walk out on a six-figure-plus income at a prestigious Boston
law firm to become an assistant district attorney at $28,000 a
year?
</P>
<P>
   It's a joke, right? It's like that old Bob Newhart routine where
Newhart does Abe Lincoln's press secretary, coaching the great man
on how to give the stump speech: ``No, Abe _ first a rail splitter,
then an attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hoffman isn't kidding. Hoffman is rich, and not just in
terms of an investment portfolio that allows him financial
maneuvering space. He is rich in the best way a person can be rich:
He is doing the work he loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is here for the money,'' says Hoffman, sitting at a
shabby table in the drab Marlborough District Court cafeteria (his
office has no room for visitors). He's been an assistant DA for
Middlesex County since last September, when he left a
21-year-career at Sugarman &AMP; Sugarman, where he was a personal
injury and liability attorney _ as well as partner _ to drop back
down to what's considered the first rung of his profession.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because he wanted to do public service law, and wanted to
work for Middlesex District Attorney Martha Coakley, who took a
similar leap in her career, when she left Goodwin, Procter &AMP; Hoar
for the DA's office.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hoffman enjoyed the intellectual challenges of the law
firm, he says he was always drawn to the rough-and-tumble world of
``pure public service.'' When Coakley became DA, the idea ``went
from the back of my mind to the front.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his new job, he says: ``I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might ask: What's to love? For where he once enjoyed the
more contemplative pace of civil case work, he is now in the legal
equivalent of triage, ``learning to deal with a lot of stuff at
once and keep my wits about me.'' Roughly 50 to 75 criminal cases
come through the court in a day, so he and his colleagues must read
papers fast and make instant decisions: whether to ask for bail,
whether to ask that a batterer or substance abuser or a drunk
driver be held. They work 10- and 12-hour days. They make calls
through the dinner hour to line up witnesses. They sweat the
nerve-racking business of getting battering victims on board to
testify against their husbands and partners; they lose many of
those women back to their abusers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the ones you lose sleep over,'' he says, adding that
a good day is getting a ``guilty'' verdict and knowing that ``if I
take one drunk driver off the road I may save a life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman focuses on the basics. He and his wife Sally, who is an
English and reading tutor at Massasoit Community College, never
bought into the conspicuous consumption that is a rite of passage
for so many people in this sizzling economy. While the roaring
stock market is helping them deal with a drastic cut in salary,
they and their two teenage daughters weren't living lavishly
before, so the shift doesn't hurt a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live a solid middle-class lifestyle,'' says Hoffman, a
Newton resident. He doesn't play golf, belong to a country club,
own a vacation home or a boat, and has never wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a nice home, live in a safe community, and have
enough money to put the kids through college, and that's it. What
else do you need?'' he asks. ``What's important to me is that my
kids see their parents do meaningful work.''
</P>
<P>
   Basics. Not exactly Thoreau on the pond, but there is a fresh
simplicity to this tale of one household budget in the suburbs that
makes a person want to sit down at the kitchen table, figures in
hand, and find the literal bottom line of happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Below all the buzz about money, money, money, and the pressure
to make the financial killing because everybody else is, some
people are discovering something more important: human worth, the
treasure trove that gives meaning to a person's days and peace of
mind through the night. Steve Hoffman found his gold in a room
without a view at the bottom of the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Where's yours? The quest should be easier in this era of
mega-fortunes, and yet for many people, the perceived need to make
more and more becomes a trap that ties them to a grind rather than
setting them free. ``Sometimes,'' says Hoffman, ``the traps are all
up here in your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he sees himself as a hero, for he knows that the fat
years enabled him to make his choice. Headed for hours of paperwork
and another late night, he says with a smile: ``I'm in a privileged
position.''

GRANITE STATE VOTERS CAN BLIP RATHER THAN BOUNCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who gets the benefit of the ``bounce'' on the Democratic side
this year?
</P>
<P>
   A trick question, that. If there's one at all, it will probably
be only what the Wall Street wise guys call a ``dead cat bounce.''
That is (with apologies to the feline community for a thoroughly
distasteful metaphor), the sort of minimal rebound an expired tabby
might make if dropped from a tall building onto a paved street.
</P>
<P>
   Although both Vice President Al Gore, who got 50 percent of the
New Hampshire Democratic primary vote, and Bill Bradley, who got 46
percent, say their tallies helped them, the outcome there won't
change the overall contest in any important way.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the New Hampshire results are important not for the
delegates selected but for the momentum imparted. And in this case,
the message is mixed because of the shifting expectations that have
characterized the Democratic contest.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, any challenger who ran within 4 points of a sitting
vice president could claim _ and would be awarded _ an important
symbolic victory.
</P>
<P>
   But sadly for Bradley, that's not the case this time. He led the
polling for much of the fall and into the winter, and it's a common
conclusion that, had he run a better campaign, he could have beaten
Gore, thereby delivering a stunning blow.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Gore's January comeback had seemed to position him
to win the sort of decisive victory that would have effectively
ended Bradley's campaign. That didn't happen either.
</P>
<P>
   So call the results inconclusive, a story of two candidates who,
at different times, both battled back from adversity, but without
either being able to close the deal.
</P>
<P>
   With both men well financed, the race for the Democratic
presidential nomination will go forward with the question of
momentum delayed until a later contest.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run, that benefits the vice president. A 4-point
victory isn't much, but if Gore, with his vast lead in
super-delegates, keeps winning even narrowly, he will be the
nominee. In that respect, the Democratic results resemble
accidental incumbent Gerald Ford's 50 to 48.6 percent win over
challenger Ronald Reagan in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   And since the better-known Gore can rely on the party
establishment to help him in the demanding array of contests ahead,
the campaign is also now moving toward his strength.
</P>
<P>
   In that light, what the New Hampshire results mean is that,
though Bradley lives to fight another day, his candidacy hardly got
the liftoff he needs if he is to beat Gore.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, the question is this: If not in New Hampshire, then
where? The road ahead only gets steeper, which makes the
opportunity he squandered loom larger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley had victory in the palm of his hand and he let it
slip through his fingers,'' says Democratic consultant Mary Anne
Marsh. ``He needed to be side by side with John McCain on every TV
show, every magazine cover. Money can't buy the kind of publicity
that John McCain is going to have this week _ and Bradley is not
going to get it.''

WHAT IS A N.H. VICTORY REALLY WORTH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Catch a New Hampshire wave, and you're sitting on top of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   That's the position John McCain enjoys coming off his
astonishingly large win over George W. Bush Tuesday, for a victory
in the nation's first presidential primary can transform a
candidate from dark horse to national force almost overnight.
</P>
<P>
   But if history proves the benefit of a so-called New Hampshire
``bounce,'' it also tells a cautionary tale about those who caught,
but couldn't ride, the political tsunami triggered there.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state likes to boast that only one man, Bill
Clinton, has won the presidency without first winning the New
Hampshire primary, plenty of others have won that contest without
ever going on to claim even their party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Still, under the right conditions, this primary can boost an
underfinanced insurgent into a storied realm of resources,
recruits, receptivity, and resonance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of people don't start paying attention until New
Hampshire,'' says Emmett Buell Jr., a professor of political
science at Denison University who has analyzed the New Hampshire
effect in past campaigns. ``If you have an upset win in New
Hampshire by a big magnitude, it is attended by so much vast
publicity that that wave is going to travel a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   One effect is that money suddenly starts pouring in, says Nelson
W. Polsby, a professor of political science at the University of
California, Berkeley, and co-editor of the book ``Media and
Momentum: The New Hampshire Primary and Nomination Politics.'' A
second is that the media suddenly frames the contest in a way much
more favorable to the victor.
</P>
<P>
   All that makes for alchemy that can change an underdog's
single-state effort into a bona fide national campaign with solid
prospects for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Senator McCain will need to benefit from such a
transmutation if he's to beat Texas Governor Bush in South Carolina
on Feb. 19, and again in Arizona and Michigan the following week,
crucial steppingstones to the explosion of primaries on March 7.
Indications are that it's starting to happen: McCain raised $1
million in the two days following New Hampshire and new polls now
show him essentially tied with Bush in crucial South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   One can see the transformative effect in past campaigns by
comparing a winner's standing in national polls before and after
New Hampshire. Start with the astounding events of 1964, when Henry
Cabot Lodge, then US ambassador to Vietnam, benefited from a
seemingly quixotic write-in candidacy engineered by a quartet of
Massachusetts political novices out on a merry lark.
</P>
<P>
   Before the New Hampshire results, Lodge, who was neither a
declared candidate nor even in the country, had scored 12 percent
in a Gallup Poll to 20 percent for Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater.
But when Lodge finished first with 36 percent of the Republican
primary vote, his political stock soared.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup's next national survey showed Lodge at 42 percent, while
Goldwater had dropped to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Before New Hampshire, Lodge couldn't even be called a dark
horse, says David Goldberg, one of the four who organized the Lodge
effort. ``He went from no horse to front-runner, and the amazing
thing is that he was never a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   For another huge bounce, fast-forward 20 years. In 1984, when
Colorado Senator Gary Hart ran in a field that included Walter
Mondale, he was hardly a blip in the polls, while the former vice
president was a prohibitive front-runner supported by the
Democratic Party establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In early February, Gallup had Hart at just 3 percent, while
Mondale was the choice of 49 percent of Democrats. But once his
distant second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses put Hart on the
launching pad, New Hampshire rocketed him into national orbit. One
week after Hart beat Mondale 37 percent to 28 in the Granite State,
the challenger had risen 27 points, to clock in at 30 percent in
Gallup's next national poll, while Mondale was at 33 percent, a
drop of 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave our candidacy an enormous lift,'' recalls Gerry
D'Amico, a Massachusetts state senator then and a member of Hart's
inner circle. ``He had front-page stories in all the major papers.
He really was hot as a pistol for those first few months.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Paul Tsongas, out of the US Senate for seven years and
little known, also found the stir he made in New Hampshire reaped
him a national whirlwind.
</P>
<P>
   A national poll two weeks before the primary put Tsongas at only
5 percent, while Bill Clinton was at 45 percent. But when scandal
and controversy hobbled Clinton, Tsongas surged from behind to beat
him, 33 percent to 24. And suddenly the unlikely candidate from
Massachusetts had become a bona fide national sensation. Gallup's
next survey put Tsongas at 31 percent to Clinton's 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made a huge difference,'' said Dennis Kanin, who managed
Tsongas's campaign. After New Hampshire, ``We got as much money in
one day as we had in several months in 1991. And Tsongas became the
counter to Clinton, whereas Bob Kerrey had been.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent bounce beneficiary has been conservative
commentator and columnist Pat Buchanan, running as a Republican in
1996. Less than three weeks before the New Hampshire primary,
Gallup had Buchanan at 7 percent, and Bob Dole, the Senate majority
leader and GOP front-runner, at 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But after New Hampshire handed the conservative insurgent a 37
to 26 percent victory, the next Gallup poll showed Buchanan at 27
percent to Dole's 41.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one need not be too keen a student of political history to
note that none of those New Hampshire victors gave the acceptance
speech at their party conventions later that summer.
</P>
<P>
   In Lodge's case, he never did campaign for the nomination.
Nelson Rockefeller, an active candidate, ended the Lodge boom by
beating him in Oregon, where he used the slogan ``He Cares Enough
to Come'' to considerable effect against the absent ambassador.
Goldwater eventually won the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   More often, campaign-trail jounce follows Granite State bounce.
Sometimes a lesser-known contender finds his victory has landed him
astride a runaway horse that eventually throws him. Often, the
insurgent's limited campaign infrastructure simply isn't up to
coping with the chaotic demands of a national campaign. Or with the
sudden scrutiny a New Hampshire victory brings. ``The victor is
often not ready for the victory, and when it falls in his lap, it
crushes him,'' says Buell.
</P>
<P>
   Hart's inexperienced campaign simply couldn't overcome the
institutional advantages Mondale enjoyed as a former vice president
and longtime party stalwart. Tsongas's overextended effort
collapsed when the campaign moved south and Dixie rescued Clinton,
the regional favorite. As for Buchanan, he made the odd decision to
hoist a rifle and turn sharply right after New Hampshire, rather
than trying to broaden his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But those failures notwithstanding, what a New Hampshire win
imparts is a real chance for an underdog to take his challenge
national against the party front-runner. As D'Amico puts it: ``The
guys who are the insurgents get one or two shots at taking down the
front-runners, but after awhile it becomes a matter of organization
and resources.''
</P>
<P>
   And other candidates have been able to parlay a defining New
Hampshire moment into momentum they sustained all the way to the
nomination. One was Jimmy Carter, whose 1976 campaign pitted him,
in one primary or the other, against such initially better-known
candidates as Henry Jackson, Mo Udall, Birch Bayh, Frank Church,
Jerry Brown, and George Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   A month before New Hampshire, Carter stood at only 4 percent
nationally to, for instance, Wallace's 20 percent. But in New
Hampshire, Carter scored 29 percent of the vote, outpacing his
nearest rival, Udall, by 6 percent. In the days immediately
following, Carter's national standing rose to 16 percent, firmly
establishing him as the front-runner, a position he never
relinquished, despite a number of primary losses.
</P>
<P>
   So what does it all mean for McCain, the size of whose 49 to 30
percent victory over Bush in New Hampshire stunned almost everyone?
</P>
<P>
   ``He will get a big wave of attention,'' says William Mayer, a
political science professor at Northeastern and editor of ``In
Pursuit of the White House 2000,'' a book about the nominating
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't surprise me if he ends up on the cover of Time and
Newsweek. It really opens up new possibilities _ but for the effect
to linger, he has to sustain it in the very next round of
primaries.''

<P>
   Anthony Tesselaar International has introduced the fourth in its
series of Flower Carpet easy-care groundcover roses. Red Flower
Carpet, which blooms from spring through fall and has a natural
resistance to black spot and mildew, joins pink (introduced in
1995), white (1997) and appleblossom (1998) varieties.
</P>
<P>
   The red, single 2-inch blossoms have prominent golden stamens
and glossy green foliage. The ruffled blooms cascade over the pot
or along the ground. And unlike most other roses, Red Flower Carpet
doesn't require routine dusting or spraying, tricky pruning,
dead-heading or special handling, just water, fertilizer and a good
cutback in late winter or early spring.
</P>
<P>
   A well-fed, well-watered, mature bush can produce up to 2,000
flowers in a season. Look for it to be priced between $12 and $16
at home and garden centers.

`DRUG WAR' MAKES THE US A SINISTER CIVIL WAR ALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANA CARRIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's proposed $1.6 billion in new military aid
for Colombia, expected to go before Congress this week, is a
radical policy departure with potentially grave regional
implications.
</P>
<P>
   Packaged in the rhetoric of ``counter-narcotics'' and support
for a civilian government in trouble, this aid to the failed
Colombian Army for its counterinsurgency fight against that
country's guerrillas threatens to draw the United States into the
vortex of a 40-year civil war whose chief target is the civilian
population. It also threatens to destroy a delicate peace process
that has, finally, just gained traction.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress debates the aid package, 85 percent of which is
slated for the army and security forces, lawmakers should be aware
of three things:
</P>
<P>
   First, the war into which the administration is dragging the
United States is not about drugs. It is about a failed political
system, sustained for half a century by state terrorism and
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Second, this war is fueled by deep political, social, and
economic causes that predate the appearance of Colombian coca by
more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Third, this aid package is not designed to deal with the true
and urgent needs in Colombia. Rather, it is a Democratic strategy
to claim action on drugs in this election year.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the New England delegation will lead the fight
against the measure. Senators Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and
Patrick Leahy of Vermont have already written to Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright opposing military aid as a violation of human
rights. Representative William Delahunt of Massachusetts, the only
member of Congress to personally visit the Colombian rebels, will
spearhead opposition in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The aid package is intended to finance 63 attack helicopters and
two 950-member, US-equipped and trained counter-narcotics
battalions. A third Special Forces-trained battalion is already on
duty in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   By year's end these 3,000 fresh troops are to be deployed in
what US officials refer to as ``the southern campaign,'' to drive
the guerrillas _ known by the acronym FARC, for Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia _ out of territories they have controlled for
more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Albright assert that the aid is solely to counter
the narcotics trade. But the plan's chief architect, US drug czar
General Barry McCaffrey, says bluntly that its purpose is to help
the Colombian Army ``recover the southern part of the country,
currently under guerrilla control.''
</P>
<P>
   This military incursion portends broader dangers. As the war
escalates in response to Washington's investment, refugees will
flee across Colombia's porous borders, pursued by their enemies,
and followed by drug traffickers seeking less contested territories
in which to operate. From Panama to northern Brazil, from Venezuela
to Peru and Ecuador, Colombia's neighbors will be unable to
insulate themselves from the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Today, FARC _ the Western hemisphere's largest surviving
1960s-style guerrilla group _ controls some 40 percent of Colombian
territory, increasingly populated by peasants displaced by the war.
Deprived of all legal means of livelihood by a global market that
rejects their traditional products _ coffee, bananas, rice, beans _
instead they grow coca and poppies under FARC protection. This
qualifies their crops for McCaffrey's flagship program, aerial
eradication.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying peasants' fields in faraway places to ``eradicate drugs
at the source'' enjoys bipartisan congressional support. It is the
centerpiece of the US drug war.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton authorized the first flight by an American spray
plane in 1994, the United States has spent billions to spray
millions of gallons of herbicide on Colombia's coca fields. It has
not been money well spent. Between 1992 and 1999, coca cultivation
soared from 81,000 acres to 222,000 acres, and so has poppy
cultivation. By contrast, aerial eradication has succeeded in
recruiting for the FARC. They too have also almost trebled their
forces in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas, who come out shooting when US planes fly in to
fumigate the fields, tax the drug crops and extort protection fees
for drug labs and airstrips. McCaffrey and the Republicans say
these activities have turned the FARC into narco-guerrilla drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Their view is not shared by the Drug Enforcement Administration
or the Colombian government. Eradicating coca production manually,
with FARC collaboration, and investing in crop substitution
programs for peasant farmers, has long been at the center of
President Andres Pastrana Arango's peace process. ``They are
willing to fight drugs,'' Pastrana has said of FARC.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is not listening. Officials are silent, too, about
how alternative development funds, included in the aid package,
might ever reach farmers trapped in the middle of a battlefield.
This is not surprising since _ unlike the World Bank and the United
Nations Drug Control Program, who are working in FARC territory
with the government in alternative crop projects _ administration
policy prohibits investment in territory not under government
control.
</P>
<P>
   The human rights implications of the new policy are ominous. The
administration's creation of ``new'' battalions vetted for human
rights abuse ostensibly complies with US law prohibiting aid to
units that abuse rights. Yet absent any mechanism to isolate these
battalions from corrupt colleagues and senior commanders, or from
military intelligence agents linked by government investigators to
death squad activities, the entire exercise could quickly become an
end-run around the law.
</P>
<P>
   Claims by Clinton officials that the Colombian Army has severed
links with paramilitaries who butcher civilians, traffic drugs, and
are accounted responsible for 80 percent of the counterinsurgency
savagery lack all credibility. Administration and Colombian denials
to the contrary, the army-paramilitary alliance, once centered in
the north, now operates virtually countrywide. Unless strict human
rights conditions are enforced, this aid package will render the
United States complicit in the rampant impunity that has shredded
the rule of law and threatens the last vestiges of civilian
governance.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia, and the stability of the region, should not have to go
down this desolate road just as peace prospects are brightening.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, the Colombian government and FARC negotiators
announced a six-month deadline to discuss the first four items on
an agreed-upon 12-point peace agenda. This weekend _ with support
from UN Secretary-General Kofi Anan's recently appointed special
adviser to Colombia, Norwegian diplomat Jan Egeland _ FARC leaders
and government negotiators traveled secretly to Stockholm so the
rebels might spend 10 days studying Scandinavia's social and
economic models. Those who justify military aid to Colombia by
questioning the rebels' desire for peace might want to think again.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States is serious about solving the Colombian drug
crisis, instead of financing a failed strategy that will have
minimal effect on drug production and will comfort the enemies of
peace, it should support a diplomatic offensive to rally
international support and investment behind the peace process and
alternative development. It should also help arrange massive,
sustained financial support to improve and strengthen Colombia's
shattered judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   If invested in development and peace _ instead of ordnance and
pesticides _ Clinton's $1.6 billion could achieve miracles in
Colombia's south.

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... says Miller.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Unless you're in the business, this all sounds like a lot of
money, but it can be worth it,'' she says. ``Take the case of a
makeup artist who can make someone look so incredible that you
don't have to spend thousands of dollars covering up a pimple when
you do postproduction.''
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't begin to cover the cost of special effects done
on postproduction computers called by such trade nicknames as ``The
Flame,'' ``The Smoke,'' and ``The Henry.'' Some of these cost $700
an hour _ and may be needed for hundreds of hours.
</P>
<P>
   Other costs include paying professional dancers (a must for
Ricky Martin and Madonna videos) and hiring fire chiefs for safety
purposes, and tutors for underage children on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artists are often the ones who push the expenses,'' says
Miller, ``because they think, `Oh, I've only got one or two shots
to get on the air.' And some artists, if you don't spend enough,
will say, `It looks like you're not supporting us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This leads to a ``disconcerting drama between artists and record
labels,'' says Ron Shapiro, executive vice president and general
manager of Atlantic Records. But it's hard to put brakes on the
process _ and Shapiro says it's also due to what today's young
video viewers expect.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In my room
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, I could go into my room with two albums and play
them and read the liner notes all night and be content with that,''
Shapiro says. ``But kids are now raised in a 200-channel
remote-control environment where the visuals have to blow their
minds. They also go on line and play computer games and have
Nintendo and Sony Playstations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the reason that video costs are so high _ you've got
kids with clickers who have seen everything and will click you off
if you don't impress them right away.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Shapiro differs from other executives because he has
set a ceiling for video spending at his label _ no more than
$500,000 for a single clip. ``I think for any video, as soon as you
hit $400,000, you're talking an obscene amount of money,'' he says.
``At Atlantic, we're still trying to carry the flag for the power
of the song.''
</P>
<P>
   Some popular video artists are on Atlantic _ such as Brandy and
Kid Rock _ but all their videos have been made for $500,000 or
less, Shapiro says.
</P>
<P>
   A major problem cited by the record labels is that MTV is now in
a ``passive'' mode and tends to play a video only after the song
has become a hit on the radio and has begun selling in the stores.
MTV is not taking many chances and not breaking many acts anymore,
label executives say.
</P>
<P>
   MTV's Calderone disputes that charge, noting that MTV broke Kid
Rock and hopes to do the same with pop singer Coco Lee. ``I
strongly disagree that we do not break new music,'' says Calderone.
``Can we take credit for Britney Spears, for example? We can't take
full credit, but we were definitely a part of her plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, tensions are mounting. And no one is exactly sure what to
expect in the future, particularly with the Internet's impact. The
labels are at least hoping to recoup some of their losses by
offering downloadable videos, just as they're now offering
downloadable music.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet will offer more outlets, which should ease reliance
on MTV, which is currently being investigated by the Justice
Department as a possible monopoly. (MTV's Greg Baldwin simply says
the network is cooperating with the investigation.)
</P>
<P>
   And the Internet should become a way of digging out all the
videos from the past and giving them another whirl in the
marketplace. That might be a scary thought, but then, ``classic
rock'' radio has done the same for rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when you look at the AOL/Time Warner merger, you
can see what might happen in the future,'' says Capitol's Miller.
``Videos are a big content source and they've been requested on the
Internet by many people. . . . In the past, videos often just sat
on the shelves when their time ran out. Some labels thought, `Well,
we can sell them as home videos,' but that didn't work out. They
sold poorly. But on line, there may be requests for, say, the old
Madonna videos and the hair-band rock videos from the '80s. A lot
of videos that people no longer see may come back this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty soon, all these Web sites will become channels,''
Miller says, ``and if you're just showing pictures on your Web
site, you'll be a Model T.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, if labels can make some money off catalog video sales,
they might not be quite as desperate to spend so much on current
videos in hopes of scoring a lucky hit.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, stay tuned.

NEW SYNDICATED FARE IS TYPIFIED BY BAWDIER, BOLDER CONTEST SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON BARNHART  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think today's crop of daytime TV shows is unfit for human
consumption? Wait until you see what's coming this fall. How about:
</P>
<P>
   - A show where a single woman interviews three single guys and
then chooses one _ as her husband?
</P>
<P>
   - A show where people who think their spouses are cheating can
have them followed by a private investigator?
</P>
<P>
   - A dating game in which hormone-addled teens talk about having
premarital sex while their parents listen in horror offstage?
</P>
<P>
   These were among the dozens of syndicated shows TV executives
were biting on at the recent gathering of the National Association
of Television Program Executives in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The syndication cycle basically plays out in four acts. First a
concept is pitched to a TV studio, which signs the producers to
shoot a pilot episode of the show. Next, the studio's sales force
shops the pilot to TV stations covering as much of the country as
possible. Depending on how many stations agree to carry it, the
show is either abandoned or gets the green light (or ``firm go'')
to begin production, with a launch usually timed to the new fall
season.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the NATPE convention some shows had already
gotten the firm go. Some, like the new relationship program
starring radio shrink Dr. Laura Schlessinger, sold themselves, with
bidding wars between TV stations in some cities for the right to
carry the show. Others weren't quite there yet but were hoping to
do enough deals in New Orleans to put them over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Among the daytime hopefuls were eight more reality-based
courtroom shows, still more talk shows and a revival of the old
game show ``To Tell the Truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ones that created the most buzz at New Orleans were a
new breed that featured a little bit of everything: the intrigue of
a dating show, the spice of a soap opera, the high jinks of a game
show.
</P>
<P>
   And the one that took the cake _ the wedding cake, that is _ was
``Wed at First Sight,'' which audaciously proposes to hitch a bride
and groom before a studio audience, following a one-hour courtship.
</P>
<P>
   If this scenario sounds a little familiar, that's because it
happened two years ago in that weird dimension known as the real
world. A Minneapolis bachelor who had tired of the dating scene
asked his friends to help him find a wife. The nationwide
``Campaign to Elect a Mrs. David Weinlick'' attracted hundreds of
proposals, plenty of media coverage _ and a lucky winner, who
married Weinlick at the Mall of America before 3,000 onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked with Dave Weinlick and his wife, Elizabeth,'' said
Pat Finn, the executive producer of ``Wed at First Sight.''
``They're still together a year and half later and still happy. He
gave me some advice on how his friends made the recommendation.''
</P>
<P>
   Because daytime TV draws mainly female viewers, ``Wed at First
Sight'' will at first have only prospective brides choosing their
Mr. Right. Each contestant will be aided by the ``wedding party'' _
friends, parents and anyone else whose advice she trusts _ as well
as the Web site matchmaker.com, which bills itself as ``the leading
online community enabling secure connections between people with
similar interests and needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Before each taping, the show's producers will cull a list of
potential grooms who have filled out elaborate surveys at the Web
site. From a cut of 10 bachelors, the bride will reduce the field
to three. Then the wedding party interrogates the three finalists,
a process that's videotaped with portions played back during the
show.
</P>
<P>
   The taping itself is the final mating ritual between the woman
and the men _ not just the usual round of ``Dating Game''-styled
questions but also ``compatibility games,'' half-serious attempts
to see if she and he agree on sushi over steak, or boxers over
briefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a relationship show? Or is it a game show? It's really a
blend of both,'' Finn said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the moment of reckoning arrives, and the bride chooses
bachelor number one, two or three. The fellow gets down on one knee
to propose and then ... the show goes to commercial.
</P>
<P>
   During the break _ Finn said taping will cease for about an hour
_ the two parties consult with family and friends and decide
whether to go through with it.
</P>
<P>
   And if they say yes?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we do the ceremony!'' Finn said. ``There's an officiant
standing by.''
</P>
<P>
   (The couple in the pilot episode, in fact, said ``I do.'' They
were last spotted on the convention floor, smiling and posing for
snapshots with TV executives.)
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt ``Wed at First Sight'' was an easier show to
pitch to a TV studio because of the media coverage surrounding
Weinlick's real-life courtship. But it was also made possible by
the free-wheeling, almost-anything-goes attitude of today's daytime
TV environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience of the last 10 years is that people will do
anything on the air,'' said Tim Brooks, senior vice president of
research for the Lifetime cable network.
</P>
<P>
   That trend actually started 20 years ago with Phil Donahue's
boundary-pushing talk show. As soap operas got steamier, talk shows
began to borrow elements of the soaps and incorporate them into
``relationship'' shows, starting with Ricki Lake and veering off
into Jerry Springer-land.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, the phenomenal success of Judy
Sheindlin's ``Judge Judy'' has touched off a wave of courtroom
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was only a matter of time before some inventive TV
producer figured out that court shows, talk shows, soap operas and
game shows had all progressed to the point that pieces of each
could be assembled in ever-daffier combinations.
</P>
<P>
   That's the thinking, for example, behind another daytime show
that was being shopped around at the convention. ``Cheaters'' pairs
the tawdriness of ``Jerry Springer'' with the authenticity of a TV
investigative team. In ``Cheaters,'' spouses who think their mates
are fooling around on the side can send a detective on their trail.
If the gumshoe confirms the adultery, the unlucky philanderer is
brought onto the show and confronted.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``First Date,'' a program clearly meant to get
teen-agers watching and parents squirming.
</P>
<P>
   The program works pretty much like ``The Dating Game,'' except
that Mom and Dad watch from backstage while their child interviews
prospective dates. In the five-minute preview tape shown to TV
executives, we see the adults' jaws literally drop when their
teen-age daughter dares three boys to tell her they're still
virgins at their advanced age.
</P>
<P>
   Steam practically comes out of the ears of two other parents
when they hear one boy named Edwin brag that the first thing he
looks for in a girl is ``a nice round butt.''
</P>
<P>
   In a later sequence, the parents emerge ... and they/) get to
interview the prospects. (Dad, in particular, has a few things to
say to Edwin.)
</P>
<P>
   When it comes time to choose a date, there's an incentive: If
the teen-ager's choice matches her parents' pick, she gets extra
spending money.
</P>
<P>
   Really, now. What would Dr. Laura say?

MONEY KILLED THE VIDEO STAR 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lost in the wake of the recent media mergers of AOL with Time
Warner, and Time Warner with the EMI Group, is a darker corporate
story about the decline of music videos _ once hailed two decades
ago in the way that downloadable music is hyped today. Videos are
under attack and their costs are spiraling ``out of control,'' say
many artists and record executives, who note that even an average
video now costs $200,000 to $300,000 to make, while many exceed
$1,000,000 for superstar acts.
</P>
<P>
   All this money is being spent in the hope of getting played on
fewer and fewer available slots on cable channels, though the
Internet may soon provide alternative sites and the promise of
lower-budget, less slick videos with the advent of faster broadband
cable access. But is it a case of too little, too late? Right now,
video is an overripe medium _ and strictly a rich person's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge millstone around a band's neck,'' Counting Crows
singer Adam Duritz says of the current situation, in which bands
and their labels try to outspend each other and compete for space
on MTV, VH1, BET, the Box, and the occasional local video show
(though there are far fewer of those these days).
</P>
<P>
   ``Videos are expensive and there's no guarantee that they're
going to get played _ or maybe MTV will just play them for a week
or two,'' adds Duritz. ``I made a movie once and it cost a third of
what videos cost today.''
</P>
<P>
   Videos were a populist touchstone when MTV began in 1981 with
the airing of the Buggles' ``Video Killed the Radio Star.'' The
video channel changed the way Americans perceived music and has
since boosted many careers, from Duran Duran (the British popsters
who rode impossibly
</P>
<P>
   VIDEOS, Page N6 &QL;

<P>
   corny videos to stardom) and Dire Straits (whose clarion call
was ``I want my MTV!''), to Michael Jackson (who made the first $1
million video, for ``Thriller''), up through Madonna, Mariah Carey,
Puff Daddy, Korn, and Kid Rock.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the thrill is waning.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The bloated world
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Videos are a pain, an extensive pain,'' says singer Gavin
Rossdale of the band Bush. ``Videos are the last bastion of the
'80s. There's nothing as bloated as the whole video world. . . .
Sometimes I feel sick and immoral doing them. I just don't think
money should be spent like that. I find it really hard to justify
when it's more expensive than the record you make.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, that happens frequently. The Boston band Godsmack
made its self-titled debut album for just $5,000, but the video for
its single, ``Voodoo,'' which featured an extensive cast, topped
$300,000. Says singer Sully Erna: ``I doubt we'll ever do that
again. That is a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Videos continue, in theory, to be promotions for bands _ or,
increasingly, for soundtracks, such as Hole's new clip for ``Be a
Man,'' featuring footage from Oliver Stone's ``Any Given Sunday''
woven in.
</P>
<P>
   But due to the escalating costs, fewer videos are being made _
and fewer rock acts, especially, are making them because MTV often
shuns rock bands and instead caters to the bubblegum pop of Britney
Spears and the Backstreet Boys, or the urban/hip-hop of Puff Daddy,
TLC, and Will Smith, who have all made $1 million-plus videos.
</P>
<P>
   Some musicians are declining to make them at all _ Pearl Jam,
with one exception, stopped making videos after its first album in
1991; and Tom Petty, once hailed as a video pioneer, said recently
that he may not make another, period.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, skepticism is replacing excitement in the video world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't watched MTV in a while,'' says singer Fiona Apple,
``but I was just astonished when I tuned in recently. Everybody was
in a computer-generated suit and using dancers in blocked-off city
streets. It's a little ridiculous. It's no longer about looking at
an artist singing a song, which is what it should be. It's now:
`Look at my new style, look at what we can do, and look at how much
money we have, because we're so successful that we can make this
kind of video.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Making fewer, spending more
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird arithmetic, isn't it?'' says John Beug, senior vice
president for film, video marketing, and programming for Warner
Bros. ``We're making fewer videos, but we're spending much more on
them. Will the cycle ever get back to making more videos? Probably,
when the Internet is up and running _ and you can stream something
in high quality and real time, which is not far away. But right
now, you can really take a bath when a video is not played.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. tries to place ``between 60 and 70 percent'' of its
videos on the major cable outlets, Beug says, but can still pay a
heavy price by not getting the rest of them aired.
</P>
<P>
   In the industry, that's called a ``dead investment'' and it's
not uncommon at a time when the music cable stations, hurt by low
ratings for videos, add more nonmusic programming to their
schedules. That's especially the case at MTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is still the core of our channel, but we're packaging
videos differently,'' says Tom Calderone, MTV senior vice president
of music and talent. ``Now we have shows like the `Beat Suite,' the
`Hot Zone,' and `Total Request Live.' . . . That's where you'll see
videos by Korn, Dr. Dre, Fatboy Slim, and Britney Spears. It's an
inclusive program, versus the niche-specific programming of our
other shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Calderone defends the increased costs of videos, saying ``the
costs represent a need to compete with your contemporaries. . . .
These are not expenses based on excess. They're based on making
great TV.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar thought is expressed by VH1's Wayne Isaak, a vice
president at that channel. ``Are labels spending more money on
videos? I guess they are, compared to two or three years ago. But
the goals and aspirations for videos are higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the prices are going through the roof. Devo, a
popular new band in the '80s, pioneered video as an art form and
made its ``Whip It'' and ``Beautiful World'' videos for a
relatively meager $17,000 and $26,000, respectively. Band member
Jerry Casale has since directed videos for Soundgarden, Foo
Fighters, Mint Condition, and Silverchair.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paying the price
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today, Casale says, a ``lot of people who don't know what
they're doing are creating an amazing amount of chaos'' in video
production. Bands are put at a disadvantage because they don't own
the copyrights to their videos, yet they're paying half the costs
out of their own record royalties, he says. The labels, which
typically choose the director and the concept for the video, pay
the other half, but are often confronted by angry bands that later
wonder where their royalties went.
</P>
<P>
   ``An act may owe $250,000 to $400,000 right out of the box for a
video,'' says Casale. ``They're going to have to sell another
200,000 records to make up for that. When you're a Top 20 artist,
that might be no problem. But for other artists, the economics are
ridiculous. You'll pay and pay for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   More specifics come from Kate Miller, the vice president of
video production for Capitol Records. A video director typically
gets 10 percent of the cost of the video, she notes _ a sizable sum
given that the average video is shot in one to three days, though
there's also pre- and postproduction.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise driving up costs are what she calls the ``glam squads''
_ the hair, makeup, and wardrobe designers who earn up to $5,000 a
day and all have assistants making $300 to $500 daily. ``The
fashion costs are especially high for urban-market videos, where
you have to have the latest clothes,'' says Miller.

 UNDATED: ... says Miller.

<P>
   ``Unless you're in the business, this all sounds like a lot of
money, but it can be worth it,'' she says. ``Take the case of a
makeup artist who can make someone look so incredible that you
don't have to spend thousands of dollars covering up a pimple when
you do postproduction.''
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't begin to cover the cost of special effects done
on postproduction computers called by such trade nicknames as ``The
Flame,'' ``The Smoke,'' and ``The Henry.'' Some of these cost $700
an hour _ and may be needed for hundreds of hours.
</P>
<P>
   Other costs include paying professional dancers (a must for
Ricky Martin and Madonna videos) and hiring fire chiefs for safety
purposes, and tutors for underage children on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artists are often the ones who push the expenses,'' says
Miller, ``because they think, `Oh, I've only got one or two shots
to get on the air.' And some artists, if you don't spend enough,
will say, `It looks like you're not supporting us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This leads to a ``disconcerting drama between artists and record
labels,'' says Ron Shapiro, executive vice president and general
manager of Atlantic Records. But it's hard to put brakes on the
process _ and Shapiro says it's also due to what today's young
video viewers expect.
</P>

<P>
   ``Years ago, I could go into my room with two albums and play
them and read the liner notes all night and be content with that,''
Shapiro says. ``But kids are now raised in a 200-channel
remote-control environment where the visuals have to blow their
minds. They also go on line and play computer games and have
Nintendo and Sony Playstations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the reason that video costs are so high _ you've got
kids with clickers who have seen everything and will click you off
if you don't impress them right away.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Shapiro differs from other executives because he has
set a ceiling for video spending at his label _ no more than
$500,000 for a single clip. ``I think for any video, as soon as you
hit $400,000, you're talking an obscene amount of money,'' he says.
``At Atlantic, we're still trying to carry the flag for the power
of the song.''
</P>
<P>
   Some popular video artists are on Atlantic _ such as Brandy and
Kid Rock _ but all their videos have been made for $500,000 or
less, Shapiro says.
</P>
<P>
   A major problem cited by the record labels is that MTV is now in
a ``passive'' mode and tends to play a video only after the song
has become a hit on the radio and has begun selling in the stores.
MTV is not taking many chances and not breaking many acts anymore,
label executives say.
</P>
<P>
   MTV's Calderone disputes that charge, noting that MTV broke Kid
Rock and hopes to do the same with pop singer Coco Lee. ``I
strongly disagree that we do not break new music,'' says Calderone.
``Can we take credit for Britney Spears, for example? We can't take
full credit, but we were definitely a part of her plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, tensions are mounting. And no one is exactly sure what to
expect in the future, particularly with the Internet's impact. The
labels are at least hoping to recoup some of their losses by
offering downloadable videos, just as they're now offering
downloadable music.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet will offer more outlets, which should ease reliance
on MTV, which is currently being investigated by the Justice
Department as a possible monopoly. (MTV's Greg Baldwin simply says
the network is cooperating with the investigation.)
</P>
<P>
   And the Internet should become a way of digging out all the
videos from the past and giving them another whirl in the
marketplace. That might be a scary thought, but then, ``classic
rock'' radio has done the same for rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when you look at the AOL/Time Warner merger, you
can see what might happen in the future,'' says Capitol's Miller.
``Videos are a big content source and they've been requested on the
Internet by many people. . . . In the past, videos often just sat
on the shelves when their time ran out. Some labels thought, `Well,
we can sell them as home videos,' but that didn't work out. They
sold poorly. But on line, there may be requests for, say, the old
Madonna videos and the hair-band rock videos from the '80s. A lot
of videos that people no longer see may come back this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty soon, all these Web sites will become channels,''
Miller says, ``and if you're just showing pictures on your Web
site, you'll be a Model T.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, if labels can make some money off catalog video sales,
they might not be quite as desperate to spend so much on current
videos in hopes of scoring a lucky hit.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, stay tuned.

<P>
   ``This is not your house, and these are not your walls,'' my
instructor intoned as I sat on bleachers outside the Woodland Hills
Home Depot store on a recent Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what you might think, this wasn't an invitation to
take up graffiti as a hobby. Instead, a few of us hardy souls were
braving the chilly night air (and munching store-provided
doughnuts) to learn how to install, well, bathroom fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   In front of us sat a prototype bathroom about twice the size of
(and much cleaner than) my own back home.
</P>
<P>
   Then the instructor added the words we all wanted to hear: ``So
make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about an invitation! Mistakes? Sure, I can do that. I'm
even good at them. That's the really comforting part about Home
Depot University, a series of hands-on, two-hour classes designed
to teach participants a given home-improvement or decorative skill.
You make the mistakes before going home and playing around for real
on your own walls or furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The classes are free and are taught by Depot employees. The
instructors are experts in their topic and patient enough to keep
the un-handy _ like myself _ from either hurting ourselves or from
flinging a tool into the parking lot in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday classes are part of a four-week series devoted to a
given area of the house such as the bathroom or the kitchen, but
since the classes vary from location to location, you can probably
always find a new way to damage/fix/decorate whatever part of your
home needs it.
</P>
<P>
   That night I learned to put in towel racks, toilet paper holders
and the rather challenging recessed medicine cabinet. How hard
could it be to put up a soap dish?
</P>
<P>
   OK, so I'm not Bob Vila, but for some of my other classmates it
(BEGIN ITAL)was(END ITAL) a snap.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Schaaf, a computer consultant from Woodland Hills, even told
me that the skills taught during the class were already so familiar
to him that, at a convenient interval, he pulled aside our
instructor, Scott Riding, and learned how to install a shower
safety bar.
</P>
<P>
   Extra credit! Why didn't I think of that?
</P>
<P>
   Schaaf was right, though. Many of the skills were pretty basic,
and the instructors don't let you do anything dangerous without
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   What they don't tell you is that things that should be easy
typically aren't. Take that nasty little wall-mounting bracket, the
sole purpose of which is to hold up all the bathroom fixtures.
Using an eyeglass repair-kit screwdriver to tighten the bracket's
set screw can be tricky when you have to maneuver said screwdriver
with your hand flush up against a wall (unless you possess the
dexterity of a watchmaker). Despite my best efforts, I couldn't get
the fixture to catch and hold securely over the bracket.
</P>
<P>
   My instructors were patient. They didn't take over until they
were absolutely certain my effort was futile. Then they gave me a
second chance. And a third.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I _ and the fixtures _ caught on, my classmates had
moved on to the evening's final and most difficult activity _
installing the recessed medicine cabinet. Which involved new tools:
a stud finder and a drywall saw.
</P>
<P>
   At HDU, the procedure is demonstrated on the floor, not on the
wall. If I actually intend to saw into my bathroom wall back home,
I would need to _ hello! _ shut off the power to avoid accidentally
tapping into an electrical wire. Careful measurements are another
must. Otherwise, I might have to shore up the cabinet with a couple
of pieces of board to make sure it fits into the recessed space.
Which, during the demonstration, is exactly what instructor Paul
Koch had to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you do something, the more confident you get,''
agreed my classmate Louis Duvand, a draftsman from Woodland Hills.
``And if I goof, I can come here and ask someone what to do next.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for him to say. He got the bracket mounted on the first
try.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days later, I checked out a free how-to clinic at
North Hollywood's Home Depot. On Saturdays and Sundays at any Home
Depot location, visitors can learn about installing a thermostat or
the ins and outs of water filters. Unlike the HDU sessions, the
weekend demonstrations are always the same, regardless of which
location you visit.
</P>
<P>
   My selection, installing Pergo flooring, wasn't a popular
choice; in fact I was the only one there. Nevertheless, my
instructor, Jorge Mora, pulled out all the materials and set up the
display. He showed me the Pergo panels, the padding, glue, putty
and straps used to hold the newly glued Pergo in place. In an ideal
world, assembling Pergo would be just like connecting blocks. But I
figured improperly gluing your floor would be a pretty nasty faux
pas, and I wasn't about to risk it. For flooring needs, I
concluded, I'll go to the Yellow Pages.
</P>
<P>
   My final HDU class _ on decorative paint techniques _ encouraged
creativity. And even messiness. I was in Glendale this time, but
there again were the outdoor bleachers sitting next to a table
crammed with cans of paint, primer, buckets, rags and sponges.
Present also was the prototype room with walls prepared in advance
for decorative paint.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, mistakes were allowed, and I quickly learned why.
Goofs are relatively easy to erase when one works with a latex
(water-based) instead of an oil-based paint. A little soap and
water cleanrs it right up.
</P>
<P>
   In this class, we worked with paint-saturated rags, sponges _
and even the edge of a feather to create veining effects. Frank De
Jesus and Sindee Gomez, the evening's co-instructors, demonstrated
each technique. Then it was our turn to don Home Depot aprons
(which we got to keep) and latex gloves and start painting
decoratively.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good tune-up for my classmate Kimberly Gifaldi who,
back at her home in Burbank, had a hallway waiting for a decorative
paint job. She envisioned a mixture of goldenrod and green.
</P>
<P>
   Gifaldi had the right idea. You'll benefit greatly from HDU
classes if you're working on a specific project to which your newly
learned home skills can be applied. The more specific the questions
you have, the more you'll gain.
</P>
<P>
   Project-deficient interlopers like me can benefit, too (beside
the doughnuts, of course). I now plan to install Pergo floors in my
faux-finished, accessory-filled bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   All I need is for my landlord to give me the OK. &QL;

WHEN IS RETIREMENT FEASIBLE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. I am 49 and my wife is 47. Combined we earn about $110,000
a year. I am currently unemployed and no longer contributing to my
401(k), and there is no guarantee that my next employer will have
one. My wife has been contributing $1,040 a year, or 3 percent of
her salary, to her 401(k). I estimate that we will need $50,000
annually upon retirement. At what age would our financial resources
be sufficient to retire? What changes should be made in our
investment strategy?
</P>
<P>
   K.B., East Greenwich, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A. It's almost impossible to make a sensible projection, based
upon two factors.
</P>
<P>
   One, of course, is the uncertainty about what you will be able
to save in the remaining years before retirement. The other is the
great uncertainty involved in projecting growth for your very
aggressive port- folio.
</P>
<P>
   If I just plug in the numbers and assume the 10 percent
long-term growth rate I normally apply to a diversified stock
portfolio, including only your wife's relatively minimal
contributions, you would have $1,127,963 at age 60 and $1,821,959
at age 65.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain a standard of living equivalent to $50,000 in
today's dollars, you would need $72,993 in 11 years, and $86,699
after 16.
</P>
<P>
   If you retired at age 60, such a nest egg could be relied upon
to provide your income stream, but without much left over to build
a significant hedge against inflation. The figures at age 65 would
be much more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, everything will be much improved once you get a
new job and resume saving, whether in a 401(k) or in other
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But overall I am very uncomfortable with any projection, based
upon your particular investments. Your Janus Aspen Aggressive
Growth fund takes a very aggressive stance, holding the same kind
of stocks you have in your IRA account. These have provided some
wonderful rewards, such as the 124.3 percent return last year for
Janus Aspen.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, I tally a bit more than 54.4 percent of your
retirement assets in such holdings. If you stick with this, you're
likely to end up either a big winner or a big loser; obviously,
some of these issues are going to end up as the big victors in the
new economy, and just as obviously others are going to lose the
technological wars and fade away, taking their stock prices with
them.
</P>
<P>
   I would be much more comfortable if you limited the
technology-dominated segment of your retirement portfolio to about
30 percent, or $116,400, replacing the rest with more standard
retirement fodder _ a diversified portfolio made up of index funds
focusing on various market sectors, equity income funds, balanced
funds, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, I'm also betting you won't, or won't until a market
jolt convinces you that you are indeed assuming a lot of risk.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a retiree, 83 years old. My wife is 75. We are
reasonably healthy and live an active life, budgeting about $60,000
a year for expenses. With the market past 11,000 I am scared stiff
to put my nest egg in stocks, although I know I should. We live on
Social Security and the income from our investments. I would like
to invest these funds to produce an offset for our expenses, but
find it hard to approach with a three- to five-year time horizon.
Do you have any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   F.J., Rio Verde, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   A. You don't make it clear how much of your income Social
Security is providing, but whatever the level, I can say fairly
confidently there is no prudent way you can invest this $600,000 of
assets so that it will reliably produce the entire budgeted income
stream. Attempting that would involve either stocks or low-grade
bonds, and I agree with you about the current market.
</P>
<P>
   The best course would be to make some fairly minor moves,
designed to take your portfolio average from its current level,
which I estimate at about a 5.5 percent portfolio average, to a
little better than 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, I'd move about three-quarters of the money market
funds to investments such as your GNMA certificates and unit
investment trusts, where you could expect income levels in the
range of 6.5 percent. Leaving $100,000 in the money market accounts
for emergencies, that would boost the income to about $37,500.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the shortfall is between that $37,500 plus your Social
Security benefits, I'd simply withdraw the money from your
principal and not worry about it. You're right: If the market was
scary at 9,000, which I thought it was, it's terrifying at current
levels.
</P>
<P>
   This also isn't a good time for the bond markets, since it
appears that more rate increases are in the pipeline. But following
your current practice of outright ownership of bonds and unit
investment trusts, you can focus on the yield and not worry about
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I own some stock in Vanguard Windsor II. Within
the past year it has dropped about 30 percent. We contribute $200
per month to this fund. Our ages are 72 and 64. Also, our children,
ages 41 and 31, have the same fund, and contribute $100 a month.
Should we sell or hang on to this fund?
</P>
<P>
   D.S., Port Arthur, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, 1999 _ and the beginning of 2000 for that matter _
hasn't been a good time for shareholders of Windsor II, or most
other value-oriented funds. But it hasn't been that bad. For 1999,
the fund lost 5.8 percent, and it is off 6.01 percent for 2000 as
this is written.
</P>
<P>
   Has it suddenly become out of date? No, it's just operating as
it always has, in a conservative segment of the market, which is
pretty thoroughly out of fashion. If you look at its market
concentrations _ very heavily invested in utilities, energy stocks,
and durable manufacturers; very light on health and technology
stocks _ you'll understand why.
</P>
<P>
   It's a disciplined fund, with a low annual turnover rate of 31
percent, so it basically is sticking with the kind of issues that
have brought it to its very solid long-term record. Over a decade,
the fund has average annual returns of 13.80 percent, and 17.90
percent for five years. Even over three years, despite the last 13
months of losses, it can claim average returns of 9.98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The only solace investors in Windsor II can take at this point
is that market fashions change, and betting on stocks such as
telephone companies, money-center banks, and oil companies is
likely to pay in the long run. Whether the so-called dot-com mania
that's been propelling the recent market will hold up is anybody's
guess, but with Windsor II you won't have to worry about it.
</P>
<P>
   Since you have been continuing to add to your Windsor II
position, I am presuming that you view this as a long-term
accumulation, designed to help you deal with inflation in your
later years, provide for emergencies, and become a part of your
estate. If that is correct, I suggest you hang in there with
Windsor II, and of course the suggestion would be the same for your
children.

CATCHING UP WITH THE BULLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market news of the second blares onto Franklin Street
in front of the Boston Stock Exchange as eager investors gather
around at lunchtime. It's just another day in the life of the
nation's longest-ever bull market and economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Lai Chan, 53, who works in accounting at a bank down the street,
peers through the exchange's big picture window at TV monitors
flashing the latest data.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a small investor,'' says Chan, bundled up against the
wintry weather while spending part of his lunch break in front of
the exchange's street-level data wall. ``I have to see whether my
stock is up or down'' _ even though he knows he's in for the long
haul.
</P>
<P>
   From Main Street to Wall Street to Franklin Street, folks such
as Chan are feeling fortunate to be part of a bull market that
seems to have no end in sight, despite a mixed reaction last week
to the Federal Reserve's raising of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new Federal Reserve survey on consumer finance,
though, more than 50 percent of US families have been on the
sidelines, with no stock holdings whatsoever, not even through
mutual funds or retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too late for them to get into the market? And would even
those already in the market who are accustomed to double-digit
annual returns be able to stomach a double-digit drop?
</P>
<P>
   No one should be denied the right to be particular about where
they put their money. Some people are penny pinchers, with every
cent in certificates of deposit; others are gung-ho day traders,
turning over stock positions with a click of a mouse. But financial
advisers say experience and statistics show that long-term
ownership of stock is a critical way of building net worth, for
everything from retirement to paying for college educations for
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are your choices? You only have stocks, bonds, and cash.
Cash _ there's a place for it, but not for your long-term money or
your retirement money,'' said Deborah Maloy, a certified financial
planner whose Neiman-Maloy Financial Group of Wakefield, Mass.
``You need some stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Long-term, through ups and downs, stocks have averaged more than
10 percent return a year, while bonds have averaged about 5
percent, and certificates of deposit barely keep pace with
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Some people worry about losing money in the stock market and
keep everything in CDs, but they often forget to consider the risk
of losing buying power by failing to keep ahead of inflation,
financial advisers say.
</P>
<P>
   Their advice for those who have shied away from the market and
kept everything in certificates of deposit, or think they have too
little to get started:
</P>
<P>
   Take a deep breath and tiptoe into the market by investing as
little as $25 to $100 a month. And don't worry about whether the
market is going to crash the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time's a good time to invest,'' said Jonathan Pond, a
Boston-based financial adviser and commentator on both public radio
and public television.
</P>
<P>
   The key, he said, is to have a long-term horizon, to diversify,
and to invest systematically by, for example, having money
automatically deducted from a bank account and put into mutual
funds. This strategy _ buying into funds regularly, at a variety of
high and low prices _ is known as dollar-cost averaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may think that the train has left the station and you're
standing on the platform,'' Pond said. But ``one could have said
that seven years ago, five years ago, or last year.''
</P>
<P>
   And for those who have been on board the gravy train and think
it will continue full steam ahead forever, personal finance
specialists caution that occasional declines in the market are
inevitable. Don't sell in a panic, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear people saying they were very disappointed with their
portfolio last year; it made only 20 percent. That's a horrendous
expectation to keep up. Part of my job is lowering expectations,
making people aware of what can happen,'' said Maloy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember bad markets. It wasn't that long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   This month marks the longest economic expansion ever in US
history _ 107 months _ with the trough of the last recession way
back in March 1991, according to the National Bureau of Economic
Research, a Cambridge, Mass. nonprofit that tracks business cycles.
The current bullish market dates back even further.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are those such as Harvard professor of economics N.
Gregory Mankiw who remind people that the stock market has dropped
by as much as a third, sending the country into recession, as in
the late 1960s and early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people ask the question, `Are we ever going to see a
recession again?' _ I'm sure. When, I don't know,'' said Mankiw.
</P>
<P>
   And when people seek his advice, Mankiw tells them to ``buy a
diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, something they'll feel
comfortable with for the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   Mankiw defines long term as 20 years and longer, while Maloy
suggests at least five years. Pond says at least a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Mankiw paraphrases billionaire Warren Buffett: ``The optimal
holding period is forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Mankiw tries to apply that buy-and-hold-forever strategy to his
own portfolio of individual stocks. He also has mutual funds and
inflation-adjusted US Treasury securities in his tax-deferred
retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Chan, who watched his stake in America Online drop in value, in
response to fears about the interest rate hike, said his long-term
investment horizon is at least 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a small investor, it's hard to own short-term,'' he said.
Chan is keeping his eye on other stocks to buy if the price is
right. He also holds mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   For the beginner with no large sum of money to plop down, stock
mutual funds with low minimums and monthly automatic investment
programs are a good way to ease into the market.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to use dollar-cost averaging, you can arrange to
have your mutual fund or brokerage firm automatically deduct a
specified amount of money from your savings or checking account and
invest it regularly. You buy more shares when the price is low and
fewer shares when the price is high, thus leading to a lower
average purchase price than if you bought everything at the top of
the market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``Spread your money around and you'll do quite
fine,'' Pond said.

THE DIABOLICAL CASE OF THE DEADLY DOCTOR 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYDE, England _ John Shaw ran a one-man taxi business out of his
small apartment, using his Volvo to ferry the ladies of Hyde into
the town center, often to the office of a kindly general
practitioner named Dr. Harold Shipman.
</P>
<P>
   One day in January 1994, after one of his customers, 82-year-old
Joan Harding, unexpectedly died in Shipman's office, Shaw made a
list of other customers who had suddenly died after seeing the
doctor. As he stared at the list, Shaw came to a chilling
conclusion: Shipman was killing them.
</P>
<P>
   But for more than four years, Shaw shared his suspicions only
with his wife, who begged him not to go to the authorities. Kathy
Shaw told her husband he would be made a laughingstock, and perhaps
thrown in jail, if he sullied the reputation of the town's beloved
family doctor on the flimsiest of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw reluctantly agreed, kept his mouth shut, and over the next
four years, his list of dead customers ballooned to 24. His
business in this Manchester suburb was slowly being killed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a taxi driver,'' said Shaw, 64, a big, gentle man
with thick eyeglasses. ``Doctors are like gods.''
</P>
<P>
   Others more prominent and learned than Shaw, even some doctors,
harbored similar suspicions, but they, too, were slow to point a
finger.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 31 Shipman was convicted of murdering 15 female patients,
most of them elderly, by injecting them with pure heroin,
apparently for the thrill of it. After his conviction, prosecutors
said that they plan to charge Shipman with at least 23 more
murders, and police said they believe he killed more than 100
others. Some investigators say he killed hundreds over a medical
career that spanned 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   If the police are right, the 54-year-old Shipman, a
mild-mannered father of four, is the world's worst serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   The police describe Shipman as a cold, calculating murderer, but
he was known here as a warm, dedicated doctor. His unsolicited
house calls, during which he killed most of his victims, made him a
pillar of this old mill town of 35,000 just south of Manchester. He
was a throwback to the days of the family doctor whom everyone
knew, who was always on call, who never said no to a patient in
need.
</P>
<P>
   One of 10 residents in Hyde was a patient of Shipman's. There is
hardly a family here that does not count one or more of his victims
as a relative or close friend. When he arrived at the aptly named
Strangeways prison Monday night to begin his life sentence, two
guards had to be put on indefinite leave because Shipman is
suspected of killing their mother.
</P>
<P>
   The realization that one of the community's most valued and
trusted members was actually murdering its most vulnerable
residents is still sinking in. And while the authorities debate why
Shipman killed so many, the more disturbing question is how he was
able to get away with it for so long.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to reassure the public, the British government has
launched an investigation and has vowed to tighten the regulation
of doctors. But the real answers lie in the narrow streets and the
humble row houses of this gray town. Shipman hid behind his status
in a place where doctors and other authority figures, especially
men, are deferred to and seldom questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hyde is a place where people inherently trust professionals,''
said Dr. Raj Patel, one of the doctors in a clinic across the
street from Shipman's who eventually alerted the authorities.
``It's a poor, working-class town. The people are lovely and very
warm and genuine and proud, but they were brought up not to
challenge authority, to know their place. As a doctor here, you're
treated like a minicelebrity. People wave to you on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   If Shipman exploited his place in a patriarchal society, and
used that position to kill women almost exclusively, it was perhaps
fitting that a group of women who dared to think the unthinkable,
and to assail the unassailable, did the most to bring him to
justice.
</P>
<P>
   But even after they alerted police to Shipman, his standing in
the community, and the fact that he had altered his victims'
medical records, threw investigators off his trail. He was only
caught because he got sloppy by forging the will of a woman whose
daughter was a lawyer savvy enough not to buy his explanations. It
was the only death of more than 130 that the police have
investigated in which profit was an obvious motive.
</P>
<P>
   Known by his middle name, Fred, Shipman grew up in a place not
very different from Hyde, in a housing project in Nottingham. The
son of a truck driver, he was smart enough to win a place at an
exam school and go on to university, a rare departure from career
paths that were largely determined by class. As a teenager, Shipman
watched his mother die slowly from lung cancer, her pain eased by
diamorphine, the prescription form of the pure heroin he would
later use to kill his patients.
</P>
<P>
   At 20, while in medical school, Shipman was forced to get
married after his 17-year-old girlfriend, Primrose, got pregnant.
But he was disciplined enough to finish his studies and become a
doctor. Soon after he joined his first practice, however, his
partners discovered that he was forging prescriptions to feed his
addiction to pethidine, an opiate.
</P>
<P>
   The British medical profession was, and many say still is, a
fraternity that protects its own. Shipman was allowed to plead
guilty, keep his license, and quietly move to another practice.
There was no mechanism to let patients know about his past.
</P>
<P>
   The police believe Shipman killed patients throughout his
career, part of what they think was a ``God complex'' _ he was
stimulated by the feeling of power. Most of his victims, like 70
percent of Britons, were cremated before burial, destroying the
evidence needed to trap him. Investigators believe it was not until
1992, when Shipman set up a solo practice, that he felt insulated
enough to begin killing patients in droves.
</P>
<P>
   His victims seemed to be picked for their vulnerability. Most
were elderly women of limited education, living alone on fixed
incomes, who gravitated to him because he was the town's only sole
practitioner, and who trusted him inherently. While most appeared
robust and healthy just before they died, few of their families
challenged Shipman's diagnoses of natural causes. Those who dared
to request an autopsy were talked or bullied out of it by Shipman,
who gave them gruesome details of what a post-mortem examination
entails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really want to dissect your mother?'' Shipman asked two
brothers as their mother sat lifeless in a nearby chair.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 15 other doctors in town, who admired Shipman's
unquestioned clinical skills, routinely examined the bodies of his
victims and, seeing nothing obvious to arouse their suspicions,
signed off on the certificates legally required for cremation. He
did the same for them, a you-scratch-my-back-I'll-scratch-yours
arrangement known as ``ash cash,'' because doctors collect a $65
fee for each case. If the discrepancy between the mortality rates
of their patients and Shipman's sometimes nagged them, Shipman's
peers reasoned that he had more elderly patients.
</P>
<P>
   It was not that Shipman never aroused suspicion. He did,
especially in recent years, when more and more of his patients died
suddenly. But he was able to deflect any detailed examination that
could have ended his killing spree by manipulating the deference
traditionally shown to doctors by their patients and their peers.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation as a conscientious doctor was earned. He was
widely admired for nursing terminally ill patients to the bitter
end. There is no suggestion he killed to relieve his patients of
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the room where he first drew up the death list, Shaw
remained haunted by the thought he could have saved many of his
customers. But he voiced a conviction that no one would have taken
him seriously had he made his suspicions known years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``From where I'm sitting now I can see the homes of six women he
killed,'' Shaw said as he and his wife stared out their window and
Dinky, the orphaned cat he took in when Harding died, lounged at
his feet. ``They weren't just my customers. They were our
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Bambroffe, an undertaker at her father's funeral parlor,
was the first to break the silence in 1997. She had noticed that
she was being called to the homes of Shipman's patients far more
often than to those of any other doctor. Even though Shipman was
her doctor, too, and had never displayed anything but
professionalism, something gnawed at her.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the numbers, she was bothered by the similarity of the
bodies. All were women. All were dressed, usually seated in a
chair. Her experience had been that when elderly women died at
home, they were usually in bed.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something else that ate at Bambroffe: All of the
dead women had been visited by Shipman on the day they died. In
fact, Shipman said most of the women were dead when he arrived.

   `It just didn't add up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She told her father, Alan Massey, who was so disturbed that he
went to Shipman's office and gingerly confronted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I was concerned,'' Massey recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Shipman calmly replied that there was nothing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can inspect this book,'' he said, showing Massey the
records he kept of his patients who died.
</P>
<P>
   Massey wanted to believe him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trusted this man with my family,'' the undertaker said.
</P>
<P>
   But the calls to collect the bodies kept coming, and Debbie
Bambroffe's suspicions only grew. In February 1998, Shipman asked
Dr. Susan Booth, who worked at a practice across the street, to
examine the body of one of his patients at Massey's funeral home
and sign off on a cremation.
</P>
<P>
   Bambroffe took Booth aside and shared her suspicions. Booth
hurried back to her offices, which she shares with four other
doctors. They pulled their records and compared the mortality rate
of their 9,800 patients and Shipman's 3,500 patients. Patel, one of
the partners, remembers feeling flushed when they realized that 41
of Shipman's patients had died suddenly at home in 1997, compared
to just 14 of theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``His patients were dying at a rate three times our patients,''
Patel said. Still, he said, such a small statistical pool meant
little. But while Patel and the others saw logical explanations,
their newest partner, Linda Reynolds, did not.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds also was less inclined to believe that doctors were
above reproach. Before coming to Hyde, she worked in a practice
where the most senior, respected physician had been convicted of
molesting patients.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors gathered at a pub outside town to decide what to do.
Reynolds gradually wore them down, convincing them they had to take
their suspicions to someone in authority. With their blessing, she
called the local coroner, John Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds risked her own career by essentially accusing a peer of
murder, but Pollard was alarmed by what she told him and alerted
police. The initial investigation was discreet, and many now
criticize it as only cursory. Neither Shipman nor the relatives of
the dead were questioned. After reviewing records that turned out
to be bogus, police dropped the inquiry, saying there was not
enough evidence to go further.
</P>
<P>
   Then, three months and three dead patients later, Angela
Woodruff walked into a police station and said, ``I think my
mother's doctor killed her.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff, a lawyer, had done her own investigation after
learning that her 81-year-old mother, Kathleen Grundy, had altered
her will just before she died in June 1998. The new will, which
left her mother's 300-year-old stone cottage and entire estate of
$600,000 to Shipman, had a signature that was clearly not her
mother's. Woodruff tracked down two people who had signed the will
as witnesses. They said their signatures had been forged.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a credible complainant, police got a court order to
exhume Grundy's body. After traces of diamorphine showed up in
Grundy's remains, more exhumations followed, and Shipman was
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   While many people in Hyde take some solace from Shipman's
conviction, there is a lingering bitterness, not least because
residents realize their town will always be associated with infamy.
For 20 years, the area has been stigmatized for being home to two
child killers known as the Moors Murderers. But Shipman has now
become England's, if not the world's, most diabolical killer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of a law that is a legacy of the status afforded
doctors, Shipman kept drawing his paycheck until Friday. It will be
several weeks before he is struck off the rolls as a physician.
While awaiting trial, he collected more than $160,000 in
taxpayer-funded salary.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, the 49-year-old doctor who was instrumental in
exposing Shipman, was diagnosed with terminal cancer last year and
has little time to live.
</P>
<P>
   Across this town, dozens of other families are haunted by
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Philomena Bardsley is convinced that Shipman murdered her
71-year-old mother, Alice Kitchen, and is determined that he stand
trial. She remembers how Shipman patronizingly dismissed her
insistence that her mother could not have died from a heart
condition for which she had never been diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Denis Maher, the 59-year-old pastor at St. Paul's
Church, is haunted, too. Five of his parishioners were among the 15
women Shipman was convicted of killing. He stood by their graves
during the exhumations, praying for both the dead and himself.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens more of his parishioners are among the suspected victims.
Shipman's conviction has triggered an outpouring. Every day last
week, someone called Maher or stopped him on the street. One woman
said Shipman had found her father dead four years ago, then
screamed at her when she insisted her father was healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at his desk, Maher wrote a homily he planned to deliver
at Mass. It was a sermon about forgiveness. But even Maher, a man
of great faith, was having trouble following his own advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord never forgives sin, but He forgives the sinner,''
Maher said in a soft brogue that betrays his native Tipperary. ``I
can't forgive Shipman until he accepts responsibility and shows
some remorse.''
</P>
<P>
   Maher says we will never know how many people Shipman murdered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know something,'' the priest said, ``I don't think Shipman
even knows. He killed so many he would have lost count.''

NEW YORK WOMEN APPEAR WARY OF MRS. CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They are voters Hillary Rodham Clinton should own,
but doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Voters like Karen Barth _ mid-40s, Jewish, Harvard MBA, an
``independent with Democratic leanings'' who ``detests'' much of
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's ``value system.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Barth is undecided in the year's hottest US Senate race _ a
race that got even hotter as after Clinton, finally and officially,
announced her candidacy Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Wilda Hess and Robin Gelburd should also be Hillary enthusiasts.
Both of them are lawyers who voted for Clinton's husband twice, and
who view Giuliani as a ``brusque'' man who ``carries a grudge.''
</P>
<P>
   But they, too, don't know whose lever they will pull come
November.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Lenore Portnoy, a former teacher who has voted
Democratic in nearly every election since John F. Kennedy, and who
fears that Giuliani wants to ``wreck the public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Portnoy wavers.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton officially in the campaign, many Democrats voice
concern that she has not yet captured her most natural
constituents: independents, Jews, and especially women.
</P>
<P>
   The hesitation of women is striking. A year ago, when she first
contemplated running for the Senate seat, polls showed her
outgunning Giuliani among women by 20 percent. Now, the two are
tied. Among white women, one poll suggests, Giuliani may be 18
points ahead.
</P>
<P>
   None of this means her candidacy is doomed. The polls are
inconclusive, although they generally put Giuliani six or seven
points ahead. And of course there are 10 months before the first
vote is cast.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is telling that Clinton's five months of touring the
state seem to have done little to improve her standing. In fact,
the travel may have served to underscore doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Why should that be? Several undecided women, interviewed last
week, provide a range of clues. They agree with her on social
issues, and would love to see New York elect a smart woman to the
Senate. But there's something about Hillary Clinton that gives them
doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Barth, the management consultant, lives in a liberal
neighborhood of Brooklyn and works on Manhattan's Upper West Side _
perhaps the quintessence of Hillary Country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little embarrassed to say this because I usually don't
care about personalities,'' Barth said, ``but I don't like her.
She's not my model of a modern woman. I don't admire what she's
done with her career, getting to where she is on her husband's
coattails.''
</P>
<P>
   Barth also called herself ``disturbed'' that Clinton ``doesn't
seem to have a competent bone in her body.'' She cited the health
care fiasco in the early days of her husband's presidency. And she
saw Clinton as having run a ``bumbling'' Senate campaign _ most
notably the misstep in the Middle East, where she sat as Yasser
Arafat's wife accused Israel of gassing Palestinian children, then
kissed her on both cheeks. She waited until the next day before
denouncing the remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of those people who feels Israel is the only thing
that matters,'' Barth said, ``but it was a pretty stupid situation
to put herself in. . . . It looked like she can't think on her
feet.''
</P>
<P>
   For many Jews, who form just 12 percent of the state's
electorate but are a crucial element in a Democratic coalition,
Israel is paramount. Clinton and Giuliani are tied among Jews;
Democrats usually need a 3-to-1 edge to win. And one Democratic
political consultant, who asked not to be identified, saw the
incident with Mrs. Arafat as ``fatal'' with many in this critical
constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Portnoy, the former schoolteacher, who lives in Dix Hills, Long
Island, matches that view. ``I like her stand on education,'' she
said, ``but I had a family that died in Auschwitz, and I'm
concerned whether she will protect Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   For other Democrats, the issue is simpler still. Ask Hess, a
retired lawyer in White Plains, not far from the Clintons' house in
Chappaqua, why she is reluctant to support her new neighbor, and
she replies: ``Carpetbagger.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of those polled in every survey consider it an issue
that Clinton has never worked or lived in New York. ``What is she
doing here?'' Hess said. ``It seems she wanted to be a senator and
this was the most convenient place to do it.'' She added, ``A lot
of my friends feel the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic women draw on a deeper, more visceral feeling
about the first lady: They just don't like her. Gelburd, the
health-care lawyer, who lives in Larchmont, a few towns away from
Clinton's Chappaqua, has seen her speak at the annual breakfasts of
the New York Women's Agenda, a professional group to which she
belongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been mesmerized by her speaking ability and her
intellect,'' Gelburd said, ``but I just feel she is so rehearsed.
It's hard to see a chink in her armor, and it's off-putting. I'd
like to know she has a spontaneous reaction, some internal core,
but I don't get that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she's wild about Giuliani, but, she said, ``at least
there's something very real, spontaneous, heartfelt about him.''
And, as a suburbanite who works in Manhattan, she appreciates
``improvements Giuliani has brought to the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Gelburd says friends, other professional women in their 40s,
feel the same way. ``There's no true affection for her,'' she said.
``I don't get a lot of sense of people rallying around her.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is ample time for Clinton to recover. Even these
four skeptical women say they might end up voting for her because
they have problems with Giuliani, too.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign in recent weeks has emphasized the issues, seeking
to make the case that what she stands for is more important than
who she is or where she's from.
</P>
<P>
   If the first lady does regain her momentum, the surge is likely
to come from the undecided.
</P>
<P>
   A pollster, John Zogby, is analyzing a sample of 8,000 undecided
voters, and some patterns are emerging. Overall, 10 percent of
voters have not made up their minds, but for Jews this number
climbs to 13 percent. ``That's a very big number,'' Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   The up-for-grabs vote also includes a disproportionate number of
senior citizens and independent voters, Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   One group with few if any doubts are African-Americans, who
favored Clinton, 86 percent to 8, in the Zogby poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary's got no problems up here,'' said Willie Kathryn
Suggs, a Harlem real estate broker. ``We all like her a lot, and we
hate Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   A decisive factor in this election, especially if it stays
tight, may be how heavily blacks turn out to vote. This is a
crucial factor for Clinton because she does not hold the dominating
lead in New York City that a Democrat usually needs to carry a
statewide race.
</P>
<P>
   The rule of thumb is that a Democrat must win the city by more
than 2 to 1 to offset the Republicans' likely strength in the rest
of the state, which is more conservative.
</P>
<P>
   However, the latest polls showed Clinton barely holding on to 2
to 1 in the city. Giuliani led her in the suburbs by more than
that, and led her upstate by 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic activists say Clinton's chances will soar only
if Giuliani commits a serious blunder _ which, given his hot-headed
tendencies, is not out of the question _ or if a conservative
faction splits.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, is not impossible. Not since 1974 has a Republican
won statewide office without the support of the Conservative Party.
And its chairman, Mike Long, says he will not support Giuliani
unless the mayor comes out against partial-birth abortions.
Giuliani, who favors abortion rights as much as any liberal
Democrat, said recently that he saw no reason to change his stand.
</P>
<P>
   A Conservative candidate could take 300,000 votes from Giuliani.
The candidate for the Right-to-Life party, which will not endorse
the mayor, will draw tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   But these scenarios of Republican self-destruction reflect a
fear among Democrats that their own candidate, who just a year ago
was greeted with wild ovations whenever she visited, might be
unable to win on her own appeal.

NEW BALLGAME FOR MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ For John McCain, it turned out that there was not
just a bounce from his landslide in New Hampshire. It's better than
that. Instead of the traditional ripple effect that gradually
spreads across the country, McCain is surging everywhere. He is
also consuming oxygen his would-be counterpart in Democratic Party
insurgency politics, Bill Bradley, desperately needs to sustain his
assault on Al Gore. But above all McCain is changing the Republican
landscape daily.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, for the embattled Republican establishment, the
little-noticed backwater primary on Tuesday in Delaware suddenly
looms vital. Admittedly, only the nearly moribund candidacy of
Steve Forbes confronts George W. Bush there, with McCain a ballot
presence in name only after a decision to treat the place like Iowa
in advance of his make-or-break date with South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   So nearly desperate has Bush's position become since New
Hampshire that beating a wounded candidate in a tiny state has
become crucial to Bush's hopes of a gradual comeback. In increasing
his last-minute investment in Delaware, Bush is betting that
Forbes's victory there four years ago is ancient history and that
support from Delaware's Republican establishment will be adequate
to produce a win.
</P>
<P>
   It had better be. To be beaten Delaware, or to have a large,
come-from-nowhere McCain vote emerge would be catastrophic. With
Bush's aura of inevitability at least temporarily shattered, the
minor reality check of a victory in Delaware would give him a
breather for his larger regrouping mission.
</P>
<P>
   What continues to be missing from the president-in-waiting is a
signal to Republicans around the country that he understands what
has happened to him and that he intends to fight for his beliefs
just as soon as he can be sure what they are. In place of candor,
there has been nothing but denial, mixed in with tactical maneuvers
whose cumulative impact has been to exacerbate Bush's problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign may be leaking badly right now, but it's still
a battleship, meaning it is very hard to turn it quickly. The
governor proved that right out of the New Hampshire box in South
Carolina; he proved it in the mess he has made of his position in
New York state; and he proves it daily with lame experiments at
coming up with the magic label that his multitude of consultants
and advisers believe can sink McCain with ordinary Republican
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The symbol for the ostrich behavior in South Carolina was Dan
Quayle, who showed up to endorse Bush his first day there. By then
there wasn't a soul left in the Bush campaign who didn't understand
that endorsements had become part of the problem the final week in
New Hampshire. But instead of lamely noting that the Quayle
``blessing'' had already been scheduled, a more alert campaign
would have canceled it.
</P>
<P>
   That goes double for the disaster that has befallen the campaign
in New York as a result of its alliance with Governor George Pataki
to use the state's ridiculously antidemocratic rules to keep McCain
off the ballot in most of the congressional districts. A week ago,
when a gutsy federal judge signaled his disgust with those rules,
the Bush campaign had a brief window of opportunity to get some
credit for seeing the legal and moral light and tossing in the
towel.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it went through six days of embarrassing confusion
before its belated move looked like the surrender that it was. The
result is that the McCain campaign not only has the same momentum
in New York it has earned in South Carolina, it also benefits from
a local issue.
</P>
<P>
   The fight there is far from over, but for a candidate with
McCain's limited resources facing multiple primaries on March 7,
his campaign now has a major cushion in New York _ courtesy of
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing shows the Bush campaign in full panic more than its
behavior in South Carolina. Chief surrogate David Beasely, who was
defeated for reelection last year in the governor's race, claimed
that the state would reverse New Hampshire's mistake on Feb. 19,
despite the fact that people in the campaign knew that polls
showing at best a deadheat were a certainty before the end of the
week. One hour Bush would claim the mantle of conservatism (``I am
the right'' was the most memorable syntactical monstrosity); at
other times, Bush was the self-proclaimed 50-state, national
candidate (leaving McCain the opening to retort that he better make
that 49); and at still others, Bush was the ``outsider'' and McCain
the dreaded ``Washington insider.''
</P>
<P>
   This flailing about with mixed messages is the symptom of the
absence of an underlying rationale for this campaign. Its money and
institutional support, in marked contrast to front-runners past,
has nothing to do with Bush's record, beliefs, or any other ties to
him personally. It's strictly business, which makes it an inch
deep.
</P>
<P>
   A candid recognition that the ballgame has changed, combined
with a statement by Bush of what he represents to voters as opposed
to donors and fellow pols, would still help reestablishing his
position. But until that happens, the wildest ride since Gary
Hart's in 1984, only this time by a much more formidable figure, is
going to continue.

CHRISTIANITY'S HOLY LAND CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ An educational campaign aimed at alerting Americans
that indigenous Christians are in danger of disappearing from the
land where Christianity began is under way at churches in
Washington and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is being mounted by the Holy Land Christian
Ecumenical Foundation, a Washington-based group that seeks to
highlight, as it puts it, ``the real possiblity that Christians are
becoming extinct in the Holy Land.''
</P>
<P>
   The group invited Palestinian Catholic priests to speak and
celebrate Mass in local parishes Sunday as it launched its ``Church
to Church'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the months ahead, the clerics will address other Catholic and
Protestant churches across the United States to draw attention to a
quiet exodus of Palestinian Christians in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   The diminishing Christian presence is also expected to be
addressed by Pope John Paul II on a historic pilgrimage in March,
when he will retrace the path of Jesus's life through Jordan,
Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many Americans who do not even realize that there
are Palestinians who are Christian,'' said the Rev. Emil Salayta,
director of educational services for the Jerusalem Latin
Patriarchate, who spoke at several Maryland churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we have to explain that our Christian community, which
traces its roots back to the time of Jesus 2,000 years ago, is now
in jeopardy,'' said Salayta in a telephone interview from Maryland.
``We hope American Christians will see how important it is to
maintain a Christian presence in the land where the faith began.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is headed by American and Palestinian church
leaders, as well as Donald Kruse, a former political officer at the
US consulate in Jerusalem. According to Salayta and foundation
literature, data collected from local parishes by the Vatican
indicate that in the early 1900s Christians accounted for
approximately 20 percent of the population of what is today Israel,
the West Bank, and Gaza, although census data gathered by the
British in the first half of the century indicates the figure was
much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The group's literature asserts, and Israeli census data
confirms, that the Christian population in that area is now less
than 2 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the turmoil of 50 years of Arab-Israeli conflict,
Palestinian, or Arab, Christians have steadily emigrated, most
seeking better economic opportunity in the United States, South
America, and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Complex economic, political, and social forces have pushed many
educated and talented young Christians to leave, said Salayta.
There are just 10,000 Christians living today in the West Bank city
of Ramallah, he said, although there are 70,000 Ramallah Christians
in the American Ramallah Federation, a social organization for
Palestinian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Many academics, including Karen Armstrong in her 1996 book,
``Jerusalem: One City, Three Faiths,'' support the contention that
the Christian presence was roughly 20 percent in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   However, that figure is disputed. A 1922 British census put the
Christian population at about 11 percent, notes a Boston-based
media watchdog, CAMERA, which focuses on issues involving Israel.
The census was taken during the British mandate that governed
Palestine following World War I.
</P>
<P>
   A number of church officials insist that the Christian
percentage of the population has declined dramatically since the
early 1900s, the result of emigration by Palestinian Christians,
waves of Jewish immigration to Israel since 1948, and the surging
birthrate of Palestinian Muslims, compounded by the relatively low
birthrate of Palestinian Christians.

`LIBERAL' TRAG FOR MCCAIN AT ODDS WITH HIS RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ As George W. Bush struggled to regain his campaign
footing this week, a message appeared to rise from the ashes of New
Hampshire: John S. McCain won the primary because of his liberal
views on taxes, his shared ideas with Al Gore, his tactic of
campaigning ``from the left.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor was careful not to question McCain's
Republican credentials outright. But by slipping ``liberal'' into
his remarks and in tying his opponent's name to the Clinton
administration, Bush took a tack that has prompted an
eyebrow-raising question on Capitol Hill: If McCain is liberal, who
would qualify as conservative?
</P>
<P>
   Thus far in his campaign, McCain has taken a far more modest
stance than the Texas governor on tax cuts, with a plan half the
size of Bush's proposal. The Arizona senator has shied away from
religious rhetoric. Most notably, he has stuck to his longstanding
demand for an overhaul of the way political campaigns are financed,
an idea anathema to the Republican fund-raisers and their
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   But with two glaring exceptions, campaign finance and his
outspoken opposition to tobacco interests, many familiar with
McCain's voting record view him as a mainstream conservative who
rarely wavers from the party line on issues ranging from tax cuts
to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he voted with Republicans 93 percent of the time,
according to an independent voting study. Despite his reputation as
a maverick, McCain has managed, on some government spending issues,
to ``outconservative just about everybody,'' said Derrick Max,
political director of the libertarian Cato Institute.
</P>
<P>
   He voted to confirm two conservative Supreme Court justices,
Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. He sponsored legislation banning
family-planning clinics from discussing abortion options. He voted
against Henry Foster for surgeon general in 1995, after disclosures
that Foster had performed abortions. When the 1996
telecommunications bill to deregulate the industry was on the
floor, McCain was the only Republican to vote against it, because,
he said, it was too weak. Last year, he voted for the $792 billion
Republican tax package. He also opposed last year's Democratic plan
to raise the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I served with John McCain for four years in the House of
Representatives, and the one thing he's never been accused of,
before this, is being a liberal,'' said Guy V. Molinari, Staten
Island Borough president and the head of McCain's campaign in New
York. ``This man is a conservative. Frankly, what I think we're
seeing is a laughable example of desperation on the part of the
Bush campaign. The Bush campaign is really coming apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Reed, a Republican strategist who ran the 1996 Dole
campaign and who is not affiliated with any candidate this year,
agreed. ``At the end of the day, you have to admit McCain is a
conservative Republican,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a group of old, fat, white conservatives saying
McCain's not a conservative. To the McCain campaign, that's a good
thing,'' Reed said. ``That's what they're trying to show: that
there will be change.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McCain has positioned himself in a way that makes it
difficult for the Bush campaign to pigeonhole him. Even the tax-cut
issue is tricky. While McCain's $237 billion, five-year tax cut
proposal is far smaller than the $483 billion plan set forth by
Bush, the Arizona Republican has emphasized another fiscal priority
dear to many conservatives: paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are several high-profile issues on which McCain has
been out of step with his party, and which support the message of
the Bush campaign. One example is McCain's vote against a 1997
Republican-sponsored proposal to ban research that uses fetal
tissue. He also voted in favor of legislation to increase the
tobacco sales taxes, a vote that has come under fire in South
Carolina in advertisements sponsored by the National Smokers
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   And there is one McCain policy that nearly all Republicans
oppose: campaign finance reform, which his Senate colleagues have
fought him on for years. Bush has made the most of the issue,
mentioning McCain and Gore in the same breath during news
conferences. And his campaign is clearly poised to emphasize the
issue in South Carolina, where Bush advisers believe their
argument, that McCain's brand of campaign finance reform would harm
the Republican Party and give power to labor unions, will appeal to
traditional conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain has taken the Clinton-Gore position on campaign
finance reform,'' said former South Carolina governor David
Beasley, while campaiging with Bush. ``We've let him get away with
a lot. He's to the left. He speaks to the left.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk, however, is offensive to many Democrats, who say
McCain has never been aligned even with the block of Senate
Republicans who sometimes vote with Democrats and are consistently
moderate on issues such as abortion rights and health care.
``There's nobody on our side of the fence who would characterize
him as a liberal,'' said Senator John F. Kerry. ``That's trash
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides said they are not trying to cast McCain as a liberal,
but are simply noting that he espouses views identical to, if not
more liberal than, those of the Clinton administration. Especially
when it comes to taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no suggestion that John McCain is a liberal,'' said
Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman. ``On the contrary, John McCain is
a Republican who agrees with Al Gore and Bill Clinton too much. . .
. When you consider that President Clinton cuts taxes by more than
John McCain, that's not exactly the Republican way of getting
things done.''
</P>
<P>
   But even on taxes, McCain aides say his record adds credibility
to his claim as a conservative.
</P>
<P>
   The National Taxpayers Union, one of the most conservative
special-interest groups in Washington, gave McCain a 73 percent
approval rating for his Senate votes on taxes in 1998, 12 points
higher than the rating for Senate Republican leader Trent Lott, and
64 points higher than that of Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Action League, an abortion-rights group, approved McCain's votes
just 10 percent of the time. NARAL also says McCain has voted 82
out of 86 times to restrict abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   As for the AFL-CIO, it gave McCain a rating of 8 in 1998. Two
years later, he scored a zero.

BORING HIS WAY TO INFAMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a restaurant, I found myself seated next to a table occupied
by a world-class bore.
</P>
<P>
   Now I know bores, and I have met bores, and I have been
tormented by scores of bores in my time, but this guy won the
prize.
</P>
<P>
   His conversation was beyond boring. It was stupefying. And it
was loud. I didn't have to strain to overhear a word. Fully half
the people in the restaurant were subjected to his monologue. It
was like some kind of awful floor show. Strangers exchanged
sympathetic glances, smiled ruefully at one another.
</P>
<P>
   The bore's two female victims were seated across the table from
him. Occasionally, one or the other would attempt to say something,
but the bore would cut her off rudely after a word or two and
yammer on about himself, launching into another pompous soliloquy
with an opening line like, ``Another thing I'm very good at is . .
.'' or ``The first year I'll only make 40 percent of a million
dollars, but that's a down payment on a pretty nice house . . .''
or ``I could sit here and become very, very rich doing the same
thing, but I need a challenge and I think the synergy I feel at
General Mills . . .''
</P>
<P>
   From what I could gather, which was a lot more than I wanted to
gather, all the blathering came down to whether he should take a
job selling Cheerios. As one who tries to remember to eat her
oatmeal every morning, I would never underestimate the importance
of breakfast foods. But let's be honest, the fate of the universe
doesn't hinge on Cheerios sales, although, listening to this guy
talk, I might have thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   I sat there asking myself the same question I always ask in
these situations: Does this person have any idea how boring he is?
</P>
<P>
   Of course he doesn't. They never do. Even when people tell bores
straight out that they're boring, they refuse to believe it. How
many times have commentators pointed out that Al Gore is boring?
And yet he goes right on being boring. Why?
</P>
<P>
   There ought to be a Bores Anonymous. But since most bores are in
denial, who would attend the meetings? Although I bet if somebody
launched Bore-Anon, a self-help group for the friends and loved
ones of bores, the sessions would be jammed.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has the capacity to bore. At some point, each of us
bores somebody. If we're lucky enough to have even a shred of
self-awareness, we learn from our mistakes and try not to bore
again. The dyed-in-the-wool bore isn't able to see that he's
boring. He thinks he's fascinating. Why would he want to change?
</P>
<P>
   A psychotherapist I know tells of treating an extremely boring
patient, a man so boring that the therapist kept falling asleep
during their sessions. Eventually, there was a breakthrough. The
patient came to realize that he had developed a boring style as a
way of discouraging intimacy. The ploy had worked perfectly. He'd
never had any success with relationships, which was one of the
problems that had brought him to the therapist in the first place.
Once he understood why he was boring, he was able to change his
behavior and presumably went on to live a full life as that rarest
of creatures, a reformed bore.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that guy in the restaurant was trying to avoid
intimacy by boring on about himself? Or was he just an
old-fashioned bore?
</P>
<P>
   Thinking about him reminds me of that recently published study
about competence, in which researchers concluded that most
incompetent people have no idea they're incompetent and are, in
fact, more confident of their abilities than people who do things
well. There may be something similar at work when it comes to
bores. Perhaps scientists will apply themselves to the question, if
they can stand to do the research.

NEW SUIT: DRESS-UP CAN STILL BE CASUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Men's khakis pants, which revolutionized the dress code of
corporate America in the 1990s, are headed for retirement this fall
_ to be replaced by the most unlikely of garments: the business
suit.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of fashion industry shows this week and last in
New York and in Milan last month, the suit is reemerging as a hip
option for men.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at some of the top names _ Prada, Gucci, and
Dolce &AMP; Gabbana _ they all filled their runways with suits,'' says
Dan McCampbell, men's fashion director at Saks Fifth Avenue. ``You
could have counted the suits (shown) last spring on one hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Do these shows signal the end of ``business casual,'' just when
such venerable companies as Boston law firm Hale and Dorr are no
longer requiring their attorneys to wear suits?
</P>
<P>
   Relax. Most of the suits being presented aren't uptight. A new
category of suit _ dressy casual _ is making its move as the new
century unfolds. Created for work and play, these suits are
tailored but have modern design elements: no upper chest pockets,
flat-front slim trousers, hidden jacket buttons, no jacket linings,
smaller lapels.
</P>
<P>
   Fabrics are in colors such as olive green, and pinstripes are
made of subtle reflective materials or in colors such as berry.
Some fabrics have stretch material in their weaves for comfort. And
many of the suits are presented with no ties, just a shirt with an
open collar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a brand-new kind of feeling'' in menswear, says Alan
Bilzerian, owner of self-named boutiques in Boston. ``It's a mood
change. Society is now transforming. Everybody looks way too
casual. The suit is the thing that men have always been able to
rely on for business, going out at night, traveling.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, fashion insiders say men are hungry for more elegance in
their wardrobes. While no one is advocating a return to the
buttoned-down stiffness of yesteryear, the dress-down casual look
is unacceptable to some.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are coming up on 10 years of casualization. Khakis and
cargoes are not happening,'' says Tom Julian, a fashion trend
analyst for New York ad agency Fallon McElligott. ``Designers are
reinterpreting the suit for a new audience and new lifestyles. What
is the modern suit? I think the idea is that individualism (instead
of uniformity) is now required.''
</P>
<P>
   Says designer Ron Chereskin, who unveiled his collection
Thursday, ``My whole show is definitely casual dressy. I think it's
a tremendous movement right now.'' Chereskin presented about 10
``non-matching suits'' _ essentially a group of sports coats paired
with pants of similar colors. ``The whole idea is to get much more
out of your wardrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   From a cultural perspective, fashion analysts contend that the
new look signals that men are freer to express their feelings in
society. ``When you wear a suit and tie, all your feelings are kept
inside. You have self-restraint,'' says Ruth P. Rubinstein,
associate professor of sociology at the Fashion Institute of
Technology in New York and author of ``Dress Codes: Meanings and
Messages in American Culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These new fashions are saying, `No, men can express their
feelings,' . . . `I don't take life so seriously.' The suit is less
an image of authority and self-denial,'' she said. ``The use of
color (or hidden buttons or funky pinstripes) enriches you and
makes you feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Next fall, consumers can expect suits of every style. Designer
Joseph Abboud presented 40 suits on Saturday with such elements as
unlined jackets, small cargo pockets on the pants, and no shoulder
padding. Paul La Fontaine, design director for Claiborne Menswear,
sent 10 suits down the runway last Thursday with, among other
things, hidden buttons and pocket zippers, flat-front pants,
stretch fabrics, and fabrics in colors such as reddish brown and
olive green.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, these won't be acceptable in every workplace and may
not appeal to all ages. ``It's a little ahead of the curve right
now,'' says Debra Greenberg, president of retailer Louis Boston.
``The movement of men (in fashion) is very slow. It took them all
this time to get the casual idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she says, there is an entire generation of men under 35
intrigued by the idea of a suit. ``It's a novelty to them. They
truly have grown up without (formal) clothing as we know it. We're
selling suits to young computer guys who want to look like they've
made it. . . . It's going to be cheeky to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lou Andre, president of wardrobe management company
Organization by Design, says the business-casual movement has
actually prepared men to be more open to the dressy-casual suit.
``Almost every single man has a business-casual day so they're in
the stores, they're looking, they're thinking,'' she says.
``They've been coached and educated through the media and their
employer that there is room for more than two looks (work and
non-work) in their closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If designers can translate the fantasy looks of the runway
into a reality at the store level, they have a huge opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   But will everyday men, many of whom have become quite
comfortable in khakis, embrace these new suits?
</P>
<P>
   John McGee, the owner of Mamma Maria restaurant in Boston's
North End, thinks so. ``It's an easy way to get dressed,'' says
McGee, 40. ``The whole crisis of the dress-down day is that no one
knows what to do, other than throw on khaki pants. This is a
one-stop relaxed way to dress. You don't have to wear it with ties.
You can wear it with an open neck or a turtleneck.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Jeffry Pond, a Boston architect, ``I enjoy dressing up to
go to the theater or out to dinner. I was brought up that way. I
can't imagine meeting with lawyers and bankers without wearing a
suit. I know things are much more casual than they used to be but I
think society could use a little bit of that formality. We like to
believe we're all friends and chummy but we aren't really.
Politeness and courtesy are all about making our interactions work.
Formality in dress is a part of that as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Pond, 54, steers clear of traditional suits in navy and
charcoal. ``I don't want to have that much of a uniform on. I
prefer to feel that the suit I have on is a little bit out of the
ordinary.'' Currently, his wardrobe includes a green-brown suit and
a bright tomato-red number. ``It's not a usual color,'' he says.
``That's what gets me excited.''

DICAPRIO TAKES THE PLUNGE INTO HIS FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Beach,'' Leonardo DiCaprio drinks snake blood, cusses
like Tony Soprano, smokes funny cigarettes, and is generally the
kind of guy who would sucker-punch that sissified Jack Dawson for
all his Dudley Do-Right chivalry and woo-woo ``King of the World''
nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Toto, I don't think we're on ``Titanic'' anymore.
</P>
<P>
   It was, of course, that 1997 blockbuster that catapulted
DiCaprio from an Oscar-nominated up-and-comer into Hollywood's
hottest young actor. Playing an old-fashioned romantic hero, he was
a boyish, golden-haired Rhett Butler for a new generation of
teenage girls whose repeated viewings of the film propelled it to a
record-shattering $1.86 billion worldwide gross. Faster than you
could say ``My Heart Will Go On,'' DiCaprio became a tabloid fave
and paparazzi magnet, with his face as the wallpaper of choice in
girls' bedrooms from Boston to Bangkok. It was a tremendous boost
for DiCaprio, then 23, but it also sharply divided his career into
``before'' and ``after,'' with everything since ``Titanic''
receiving, perhaps unfairly, a harsh and relentless scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The ``after'' portion of DiCaprio's professional life begins in
earnest this Friday, with ``The Beach.'' Although he has appeared
in two films since ``Titanic'' _ ``The Man in the Iron Mask'' and
Woody Allen's ``Celebrity'' were both released in 1998 _ ``The
Beach'' was the first project he signed on to during those feverish
months when it seemed every director and producer in Hollywood was
offering DiCaprio the world plus points.
</P>
<P>
   And ``The Beach'' is a far different film from ``Titanic,'' with
DiCaprio playing an often selfish, unsympathetic character _ which
has some already wondering if the actor hasn't strayed too far from
the kind of role that shot his career into the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The superstar mentality is you're a superstar forever; the
reality is it ain't so,'' said Martin Grove, movie analyst for The
Hollywood Reporter. ``His superstardom is based on the success of a
single film which scored at the box office not completely because
of him, but because of the totality of what it was. He needs to
ensure his longstanding success by doing more films along the lines
of what his fans want to see.'' Whether ``The Beach'' falls into
that category remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Alex Garland's 1997 novel, ``The Beach'' stars DiCaprio
as Richard, a young and restless American looking for excitement
and danger in Bangkok. In his fleabag hotel, he meets Daffy (Robert
Carlyle), who gives him a hand-drawn map to an island paradise.
Richard shares the map with two French friends, and off they go in
search of freedom, adventure, and lots of marijuana, which
supposedly covers the island. Of course, once Richard and his pals
get there, they learn that paradise isn't everything it's cracked
up to be.
</P>
<P>
   It's like ``Lord of The Flies,'' with smatterings of
``Apocalypse Now'' _ hardly the sort of movie fare that makes
teenage hearts go pitty-pat, even though DiCaprio has love scenes.
But the $50 million film is far more reminiscent of the quirky
projects DiCaprio, 25, used to favor before he was lured to the
ocean by ``Titanic'' director James Cameron's siren song. (Or was
it Celine Dion's?)
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Titanic,'' DiCaprio was shaping up as one of
Hollywood's more interesting actors, or at least one willing to
take chances. He first caught critics' eyes with ``This Boy's
Life,'' a 1993 adaptation of the Tobias Wolff memoir. Only 19,
DiCaprio more than held his own with Robert DeNiro and Ellen Barkin
as a teenager adjusting to, among other things, his mother's
marriage to an abusive man. The movie wasn't a hit, but DiCaprio
emerged as someone to keep an eye on.
</P>
<P>
   What gifts ``This Boy's Life'' implied blossomed a year later in
``What's Eating Gilbert Grape.'' DiCaprio played Arnie, the
mentally retarded younger brother of the title character, played by
Johnny Depp. The film was a wonderful drama about small-town life,
but it was DiCaprio's performance that got people talking. Without
gimmickry or hamminess, DiCaprio completely disappeared into Arnie,
inhabiting the character from the inside out. The role earned
DiCaprio the best reviews of his career, as well as Academy Award
and Golden Globe nominations.
</P>
<P>
   He plunged into other unconventional roles. In ``Basketball
Diaries,'' he starred as Jim Carroll, a playground hoop hero-turned
smack-addled author. In ``Total Eclipse,'' he was gay French poet
Arthur Rimbaud. Both films were mediocre, and both flopped at the
box office (though ``Total Eclipse'' became something of a must-see
among Leophiles, since DiCaprio briefly appears nude). Yet they
showed DiCaprio as an actor willing to steer clear of vapid
romantic dramas and teen sex comedies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, returning to the dark and offbeat ``The Beach'' may not
be the best thing for DiCaprio's career momentum, Grove said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing the quirky, small films is nice, but that sort of thing
comes either early in your career or later in your career,'' Grove
said. ``In the middle of your career, you need to satisfy your core
base of fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that DiCaprio himself hasn't considered this. He just hopes
his fans will allow him to play characters other than Jack Dawson.
DiCaprio recently told MTV's Chris Connelly ``I think it would be
underestimating them as an audience and their intelligence to not
think that an actor's not going to take different types of roles. .
. . I think I'd be underestimating them if I were to go do the same
thing over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always known what I wanted to do as an actor, and I
wanted to take chances, and that's all. That's all I really wanted
to do,'' he said. `` `Titanic' was something that in its own right
was a chance. It was something that I'd never done before, and it
was trying to do something different, and it was experimenting in a
lot of ways. And it's not to say that I won't try something like
that again, I don't know. But that was much more different than
what I'm doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   While that may be fine and good for DiCaprio, the filmmakers
weren't taking any chances. They tweaked the romantic side of
DiCaprio's character, which was far less prevalent in Garland's
book. According to an article in Variety, that's not all bigwigs at
20th Century Fox, the film's distributor, have done to help the
film. Adopting a less-is-more strategy, the studio scaled back on
prerelease hype, perhaps in hopes of deflating expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But it may already be too late. Mention DiCaprio, and hype comes
whether anyone invites it or not. While no one expects ``The
Beach'' to hit the whopping numbers of ``Titanic,'' anything less
than a No. 1 debut next weekend will be considered a failure, no
matter how much the studio tries to spin it. For better or worse,
DiCaprio is the film's brand name, and for the first time in a
still-evolving career, he's expected to ``open'' a film on the
strength of that name. Now, after two years away from the screen,
DiCaprio may have his greatest career challenge yet in trying to
prove he's still king of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're really serious about long-term superstar status, you
must do what your fans want to see you do. That's been the story of
Hollywood since the very beginning of movies,'' Grove said. ``Give
the fans what they want, the fans will be back. Do something
different, and they may start watching somebody else.''

RANKINGS SHOWN TO SWAY COLLEGE CHOICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's ranking season again, when colleges across the country plow
through foot-high piles of surveys seeking data _ from SAT scores
of incoming freshmen to donation rates of alumni _ to help
determine the popularly published pecking order of higher
education.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges that sink lower on the list will curse the rankings;
those that rise will boast. All along, though, most every college
will insist that rankings don't matter.
</P>
<P>
   But new evidence shows they do, hurting or helping a school's
ability to attract the best students and even determining the cost
of tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Even a small slip on the rungs of the US News &AMP; World Report
rankings of major colleges and universities may mean a school
becomes less selective and must offer more financial aid simply to
fill its freshman class. Fewer applicants tend to accept offers of
admission, and those who do will have lower SAT scores than the
previous class.
</P>
<P>
   And chances are, according to one study, that once a school
begins to slide, it continues to do so because the magazine then
weighs the school's ability to attract the best students and the
quality of those students in deciding the next year's rankings. A
ranking, in other words, doesn't just grade a school for quality,
it helps determine what ranking that school might get the following
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a vicious circle,'' said James Monks, an economist with
the Consortium on Financing Higher Education, who coauthored a
study on the effect of the US News &AMP; World Report rankings for 30
elite schools over 11 years. ``If it's not surprising that students
would be more likely to choose an institution that's doing better
in the rankings, why would they not respond the other way, and be
less likely to choose a school that's doing worse?''
</P>
<P>
   The study only confirms what colleges are loath to admit.
</P>
<P>
   Monks and Cornell University economist Ronald Ehrenberg looked
at the performance of some of the highest-ranked schools in the US
News rankings, the granddaddy of a series of rankings put out by
magazines and guidebooks. All the schools belong to the consortium,
which includes smaller liberal arts colleges such as Amherst and
Trinity as well as large research schools such as Yale and Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the shifts in rank are dramatic: Bryn Mawr, in the most
extreme case, slipped from fifth in 1990 to 23d in 1991; Cornell
bounced from 14th to sixth to 11th between 1987 and 1999; this
year, the California Institute of Technology jumped from ninth to
first place among national universities.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem obvious that a school that ranks higher will
attract more students. Cornell, for example, increased its yield _
college parlance for the percentage of applicants who accept
admissions offers _ from 46.6 to 49.2 as it rose from 14th to sixth
in the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   What surprised the researchers, though, was how a decline in
rankings could make it harder for a school to lure students.
</P>
<P>
   On average, for every five points a school slips, it admits 2
percent more applicants _ becoming less selective. But the drop in
rank also means a smaller percentage of applicants will accept
admission offers: Every six-point decline in ranking means a 1
percent drop in yield.
</P>

   A school that fell from sixth place to 10th sees its average SAT
scores drop 5.5 percent, the study found. And schools that drop
also have to offer more financial aid to attract students. For
every 10 points a school falls in the rankings, it ends up getting
4 percent less tuition after financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps understandably, the study also found that schools can
increase their yield with an increase in endowment. Every $100,000
increase in endowment means the school can offer 4 percent more in
grant aid.
</P>
<P>
   Richer schools essentially can buy their way to higher yields.
But poorer schools that slip in the rankings may not have the
option of offering more aid. And because higher-ranked schools have
to give less financial aid, Monks said, he suspects that they end
up getting more affluent students because they can afford to go
somewhere that doesn't give them as much money.
</P>
<P>
   However, US News, which is in its 17th year of compiling the
rankings, says the effects the study found are so small as to be
insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changes of that sort are just as likely to be associated with
the success of their varsity football team,'' said Peter Cary,
special projects editor for the magazine. ``I wouldn't be surprised
if the schools see that movement year in and year out regardless of
how US News ranks them.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey also questions how US News determines rank.
</P>
<P>
   The methodology changes periodically. When the magazine started
``Best Colleges,'' rankings were based on reputation alone (the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign was number one ). Now US
News factors in a range of other data, including yield, how many
applicants are accepted, per-student spending, and the number of
full-time faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Given how much some schools bounce from year to year, Monks and
Ehrenberg say, the method is flawed; it's simply not possible that
one school becomes that much worse or better. Colleges chime in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is, it's the rankings that change more
than the institution,'' said Lorna Miles Whalen, dean of enrollment
and admissions at Johns Hopkins University, which rose in rank from
14th to seventh this year. ``It's not really anything we did.''
</P>
<P>
   That hardly means schools don't pay attention to the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are rankings aware,'' Miles Whalen added. ``We think about
the implication of actions on our rankings; we're as vulnerable to
moving forwards as backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   As colleges gather the data they will submit to US News and
other ranking surveys, they try to figure out how they can
calculate their numbers to best increase their status.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell used to count anyone who ever attended the school as
``alumni.'' Recently, though, it began excluding anyone who did not
graduate because that increased the percentage of alumni who donate
to the school.
</P>
<P>
   At Hopkins, administrators quibble over whether their
student-faculty ratio is 9 to 1, 8.7 to 1, or 9.2 to 1, as if the
smallest change would make that much difference in the ranking.
</P>
<P>
   And at Connecticut College, President Claire Gaudiani has said
that she sets targets for the school based on what will help in the
rankings. ``It's really unfortunate, because university resources
could be better used educating students, rather than being devoted
to working the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say the things the magazine weighs have little to do with
measuring how good a school is. In fact, college presidents
complain that the things they do to become better can hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pride ourselves on doing more with less, but every time we
do something more efficiently, our rankings go down,'' said Stephen
Lewis, president of Carleton College in Minnesota, which generally
falls among the top 10 for best liberal arts colleges. ``What
bothers me is the appearance of being scientific and quantitative,
when they are not.''

NEW GAME SHOWS SAY SOMETHING ABOUT OUR INTELLIGENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Incudes sample questions text table; a and l coding)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s, at the height of Egghead Chic, a contestant on
a popular network quiz show won $32,000 by correctly answering a
two-part question about characters in the Sherlock Holmes stories.
The answer had 14 separate components. No multiple choice, no
audience ``lifelines.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' ABC's current prime-time
hit, a contestant recently won $32,000 by answering the question,
``Which of the following months has no federal holiday?'' There
were four choices listed, further reducible by a ``50-50 lifeline''
option or by polling the studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   The degree-of-difficulty gap between the two raises ticklish
questions about these shows themselves. Does the content of
programs like ``Millionaire'' and ``Twenty-One'' (the reincarnated
version) reflect a watering down of the intellectual product, a
dumbing down, so to speak, of their audience appeal? And if so,
what does the unexpected popularity of these shows say about
society today compared to the America that went nuts for quiz shows
in the '50s?
</P>
<P>
   On style points alone, the debate is a no-brainer. NBC's
``Twenty-One'' resurrects the show's original '50s-style isolation
booth _ but precious little of its intellectual muscle. Contestants
would have to have been locked inside such a booth since 1958 not
to answer such puffballs as, ``NASA's launch site is located in
Florida. True or false?'' Even allowing for drama building, some of
the early-round questions on ``Millionaire'' (What two colors do
you find on an Oreo cookie?) would not stump Bert or Ernie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched one guy win $1 million on a question I had in
seventh-grade science,'' scoffs Herbert Stempel, a real-life star
of the original ``Twenty-One'' show. ``They've dumbed it down to
such an extent, even `Jeopardy' isn't what it used to be. There's
no comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   Author Don Lessem, who competed on ``Jeopardy'' last month, also
appeared on a '70s-era quiz show called ``Who, What, Where.'' It's
a whole new ballgame today, Lessem says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not in tune with junk culture, you're at a real
disadvantage on these shows,'' he says. ``To earn money in the
'70s, I had to know who discovered the cure for syphilis. Now all
you need to know is which actor has syphilis.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, none of this is terribly surprising. This is the
golden age, after all, of Mortal Kombat, ``South Park,'' and the
World Wrestling Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Standardized tests are under attack in school systems
everywhere. Network shows are vying for an increasingly fragmented
audience, most of which is not attending Mensa meetings anyway.
Cultural literacy is a slippery concept at best, well beyond the
capacity of Regis Philbin to define in a few brief moments with
thousands of dollars _ and upward of 30 million viewers _ at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's taken for granted as information most educated people
should know changes over time,'' notes E. D. Hirsch, an authority
on cultural literacy. ``I'm all for the democratization of
knowledge that some of these shows represent, but there's a big
difference between good general information and useless general
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Also misleading information. On a recent installment of
``Millionaire,'' a contestant complained about being disqualified
for answering a question about who was the youngest US president at
the time of his inauguration. The contestant chose John F. Kennedy.
The supposedly correct answer, Theodore Roosevelt, hinged on the
definition of inauguration, some historians pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard education professor Howard Gardner, no fan of these
shows, says it's too bad that ``Millionaire'' and its spawn promote
the idea of knowledge as a way to win money.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the point of view of entertainment, it's no better or
worse than much of what's on television, I suppose,'' Gardner says.
``But as a social message about what we should know and why we
should learn, it is discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   To properly frame the debate over declining quiz-show standards,
some say, it helps to recall the time in which these earlier shows
flourished, when brainiacs like Charles Van Doren and Joyce
Brothers became heroes by winning one tense prime-time duel after
another.
</P>
<P>
   Van Doren, a nerdy Columbia University professor, became a
national idol on par with James Dean before it was revealed that he
and others had been fed answers by the shows' producers.
</P>
<P>
   Egghead Chic was more than entertaining in its heyday. It was,
well, sexy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then,'' recalls Richard Goodwin, a key investigator in
the scandal that killed off prime-time quiz shows for four decades,
``the whole objective was to showcase people from one walk of life
who had an improbable knowledge of other areas, like Joyce Brothers
and boxing. Or to make heroes out of supergeniuses like Van Doren.
It would be impossible to do that today because you couldn't keep
contestants on that long without rigging the shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's shows don't demand the same breadth of knowledge, adds
Goodwin, because ``the whole idea now is, this could be you. You
could be winning all this money. It's more like advertising in that
sense, getting you to identify with the beer drinker or the sexy
girl. But at least it's honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thompson, director of Syracuse University's Center for
the Study of Popular Television, points out the radical shift in
the cultural context, too. Knowing a lot of pop culture minutiae, a
staple of today's quiz shows, was not much on America's mind back
when television was in its infancy, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifties television really reflected the Cold War,'' Thompson
says. ``In 1957, our rockets were blowing up on the launch pad
while the Soviets had put Sputnik in space. There was this feeling
that intellectual prowess could boost us past the Soviets, so we
threw the educated elite into the arena and watched them play. We
watched Van Doren then the way we watched Michael Jordan play
basketball, to marvel at the brilliance of people more gifted than
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's shows, Thompson says, are about ``people with jobs like
ours answering questions we could answer. It's a much more American
model in many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate has a generational aspect as well. A Harvard Law
School student, Rahim Oberholtzer, 27, won a record $1.12 million
on ``Twenty-One'' earlier this month. According to Oberholtzer, the
questions he got were nowhere near as easy as they may have seemed
to viewers at home _ even if none contained a single historical
reference to any period prior to the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a situation where a lot of education will necessarily
help,'' Oberholtzer observes. ``The most crucial thing is having a
good memory. You don't need a law degree, but you do need to stay
up on current events, whether it's movies or music or politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Fodera, 24, of Newton, Mass., became a minor celebrity
through his appearance on ``Millionaire'' last month. Fodera
guessed wrong on a $100 question about what Jack Horner pulled out
of his famous nursery-rhyme pie (Fodera picked ``blackbirds,'' not
``plum''). For Fodera, this proved to be both good news and bad
news.
</P>
<P>
   The good news was that he and another first-round loser were
invited on Rosie O'Donnell's syndicated talk show. Fodera won a new
car by acing a makeup test and has been invited back by O'Donnell.
The bad news? The New York Post published an editorial fingering
Fodera as the poster boy for all that is wrong with American youth,
from its obsession with video games to the fact that parents no
longer read enough books aloud to their toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe they wrote about the dumbing down of
America and based it on me,'' fumes Fodera. ``I'm a former doctoral
student, for one thing. My parents read books to me all the time. I
didn't play video games. It's a game show, that's all it is. It is
not indicative of the American educational system _ or anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing on which virtually all agree is that the bottom line
of all these shows, present and past, is money. Lots of money
earned in the white heat of competition.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin says it's no accident these shows are hot again.
``This,'' he says, ``is the most materialistic era America has seen
since the '50s. And these days it wouldn't be Van Doren on the
cover of Time, it would be Philbin.''

JOHN UPDIKE EXPLORES WHAT WAS REALLY ROTTEN IN DENMARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
GERTRUDE AND CLAUDIUS 
By John Updike. Knopf. 
212 pp. $23. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We tend to think of Shakespeare's Prince Hamlet as the first
introvert of modern tragedy, with his theatrical domain _ along
with Wittenberg and rotten Denmark _ as that of the first great
Renaissance drama. But the prince's self-consciousness and madness,
feigned or otherwise, couldn't by themselves give us the
labyrinthine complexity of ``Hamlet'' _ the brilliant ambiguities
of the young man's soliloquies, the torturous sorrows of Ophelia's
suicide, the play's explorations of good and evil and of humanity's
moral obligation to understand both. With the ghost of Hamlet's
dead father hovering over his son's conscience, we watch a tale
unfold whose central action has already taken place: Claudius, King
of Denmark and stepfather to the prince, has poisoned Hamlet's
father and absconded with queen and crown. It will be Hamlet's
role, of course, to unearth this lethal secret and then decide what
to do about it. And while he spends the next five acts mostly
thinking out loud, his meditations will end in a staggering last
scene of consummate death.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the play's timelessness lies in its dualities, about
which volumes have been written, from the two dead kings to the
collision between classical heroism and Reformation thought. This
infinity of interpretation applies equally to the cast: Is Claudius
really a vicious incorrigible, or has he straightened up since that
Cain moment of weakness when he killed his brother? Is Queen
Gertrude in fact a weak sister who sold out her only son, or is she
an ermine-robed victim of ruthless patriarchy? And what of poor old
Polonius? OK, so he's a self-serving bore and a hypocrite, both of
which he pays for at the point of Hamlet's sword in the third act.
But did any father ever love his daughter more?
</P>
<P>
   And now, regarding the publication of ``Gertrude and Claudius,''
dare one say it? What a piece of work is Updike! Our own king of
erudition _ a Renaissance writer if ever contemporary America could
claim one _ has gone back to the Hamlet story to imagine its
inception: its offstage pre-story, when Claudius fell in love with
his brother's queen and that first dastardly deed in the garden was
set in motion. Wickedly replete with allusions, weaving the history
of ideas with the lustier possibilities of adulterous coupling,
``Gertrude and Claudius'' is an intelligent little novel of whimsy.
Opening with Gertrude's marriage, at 16, to King Hamlet, then
following the building treachery of the next three decades,
Updike's story ends with the stage set for the beginning of
``Hamlet.'' It's the background case file, in other words, on the
newlywed parents of the prince _ their story exposed as a blended
family in extremis, rife with the usual pitfalls of envy, boredom,
and unleashed aggression.
</P>
<P>
   You can feel Updike's pleasure and intellectual curiosity
throughout this novel, for which he returned to several versions of
the ancient Hamlet legend, in which Amleth, a Danish noble, takes
revenge on his uncle for killing his father. Accordingly, Updike's
characters are given the names drawn from Shakespeare's sources,
including the 12th-century Latin text by Saxo Grammaticus and
Francois de Belleforest's later adaptation in ``Histoires
tragiques.'' Thus Polonius appears as Corambis; Claudius as Feng
and Fengon until he takes the reigning title of Claudius; and
Gertrude as Gerutha, then Geruthe. This care has the added effect
of making the story ageless as well as more intimate; in Updike's
hands, at the story's lighter moments, what we have are a couple of
unhappy campers who find their way into a second chance by way of
each other's pre-silk undergarments.
</P>
<P>
   Gertrude, in particular, is rendered with great sympathy. Deemed
powerless by the men around her from the day she was born, she's
cast here as a large-hearted, disappointed woman who must struggle
to recognize her own desires. When Claudius gives her a blinded
female falcon as a gift, he consoles Gertrude's worries: ``It is
for her own protection,'' he tells his beloved, ``otherwise she
will be frantic for the possibilities of freedom that she sees
about her.'' Claudius hardly deserves such sympathy, roaming the
Mediterranean and coveting his older brother's wife. But his
passion for Gertrude is true, and the shadows of sibling rivalry
that accompany it nonetheless coexist with a cosmopolitan,
early-modern sensibility. By the time he enlists Polonius in that
conspiracy to empty a vial of herbona into King Hamlet's ear, he
has been pushed into desperation by circumstances of love as well
as treachery.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Hamlet himself is off in Wittenberg, naturally, reading
philosophy in the place where Martin Luther nailed his ``Theses''
to the door. But the general discord the young prince effects in
``Gertrude and Claudius'' would have us believe that this is a
brooding boy who may turn out to be more trouble than joy: a
``fragile, high-strung, quick-tongued child,'' his own mother
thinks; she will come to believe that her son suffers from ``the
madness of detachment.'' None of which will slow Claudius in
orchestrating the young man's return to Elsinore, of course _ where
Ophelia waits, Polonius plots, and Gertrude and Claudius happily
reign.
</P>
<P>
   The question at hand, though, is whether ``Gertrude and
Claudius'' succeeds _ as a self-contained story, a contemporary
dramatic commentary, an elixir for the play itself. Well, yes, but
only if you're keen to immerse yourself in ``Hamlet'' in order to
partake of the pleasures Updike offers; otherwise, his
reinterpretation may seem capricious or uninviting, as pedantic as
Polonius to the uninitiated. The novel is written in prose
correspondent to its history, which is authentic but hardly the
stuff of Updike the splendid modern stylist. In an effort to place
Gertrude and Claudius's love story in time, Updike has woven
strains of intellectual history through the text _ the rise of
empiricism, say, or the collision between naturalism and the advent
of Christianity. These strains worked for me; I can also imagine
them seeming tedious to a reader in a less willing state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   What seems luminescent about ``Gertrude and Claudius'' is its
attendant passions _ not those of the star-crossed, roguish lovers,
but rather those authorial joys evoked by the tragedy of
``Hamlet.'' There is something delightful about following Updike
down this path, seeing his sentiments and sympathies unfold,
watching him deftly handle the text of ``Hamlet'' and the spiritual
ambiguities that surround it. Sometimes brilliant and sometimes
thuddish, ``Gertrude and Claudius'' is an intellectual indulgence,
but the indulgence is contagious. At its best, the novel will send
you into the infinite luxuries of the play itself: its staircases
of madness and wisdom, sorrow and pity. And so, in keeping with
Updike's newfound heroine, we'll leave the final note of cunning to
Queen Gertrude _ who, when asked about her son's state of mind,
replies, ``Mad as the sea and wind when both contend / Which is the
mightier.'' Give that woman a scepter!

   BOSTON _ It's as unforgettable as the prom. A lifeless frog,
cat, or fetal pig stretched out on a table, smelling of chemical
preservatives, awaiting the scalpel cut of students learning
through dissection.
</P>
<P>
   For some horrified students, it's an experience they would
prefer to skip. A proposed bill would help them do that, allowing
them to use alternatives such as computer technology that some say
teach the same lessons.
</P>
<P>
   While the proposal isn't new _ a similar bill has languished in
the Legislature for a decade _ this time a group that promotes
cruelty-free education is dressing up the subject as a women's
issue, hoping it will be the key to the bill's success.

Lab, and other three-dimensional CD-ROM software students can use
to study organs, muscles, and skeletal systems by touching a mouse
instead of a frog.
</P>
<P>
   But some science teachers say clicking is not the same as
cutting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want a doctor working on me that worked on a
computer model,'' said Michael Nassise, director of natural and
applied sciences at Stoughton High School, who uses computer
technology as a supplement. ``Nothing can beat working with the
actual specimen.''
</P>
<P>
   Jocelyn Koloski, a Triton Regional High School senior, dissected
a frog, a sheep eyeball, and a sheep brain in eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't do it again,'' she said. ``At the time, I really
didn't know differently. I didn't think about it too much. It was
sort of: Here are the animals, they're dead, cut them up . . . I
was young. I didn't know about options.''
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake here is more than avoiding slicing up frogs,
say coalition members. Offering choice on dissection is paramount
to keeping girls interested in pursuing careers in science and
medicine where they are underrepresented, Capaldo said.
</P>
<P>
   The argument goes: Students required to dissect despite their
ethical concerns about animals being killed for that purpose may
turn away from science and choose other career paths.
</P>
<P>
   Some students may even undermine their chances because they
avoid classes that require dissection, said Prudence Goodale,
assistant superintendent at Stoughton High.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colleges are looking for students who have a strong background
in science,'' she said. ``So when a student arrives in college and
is contemplating a career in science, if they don't have as many
courses and labs as other students, they may feel they are at such
a disadvantage that they may turn to another career.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the Ethical Science and Education Coalition
has mailed out information to about 800 Massachusetts girls who
have expressed their objections to dissection on the hot line of
the National Anti-Vivisection Society in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   However, pushing alternatives to dissection as a women's issue
may be a tough sell to some who wonder whether the strategy plays
into stereotypes of women as the weaker sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to categorize everything as women's issues,''
said state Representative Lida E. Harkins, a Democrat from Needham
and newly appointed chairwoman of the Committee on Education, Arts
and Humanities. ``I like to think we can face the issue head-on.''
</P>
<P>
   Coalition leaders, who have a lobbyist pushing for the bill, are
hoping they can convince Harkins, who has the power to bring the
bill before the committee. The coalition also has sent a letter to
the head of the women's legislative caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at it as a women's issue,'' said state
Representative Louis L. Kafka (D-Sharon), the bill's lead sponsor.
``I just feel students have certain rights, male or female.''
</P>
<P>
   Kafka said the computer technology he has seen has come far
enough to offer students a virtual reality dissection experience
comparable to the real thing. In the past, the dissection bill has
stalled, partly because several lawmakers objected to the only
alternative _ which was to allow students to work with plastic
models of animals.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Teachers Association remains opposed to the
bill, objecting that it would interfere with a teacher's authority
to determine course requirements.
</P>
<P>
   And several teachers still support dissection. Nassise, the
Stoughton High teacher, bought his computer program from the
Ethical Science and Education Coalition. But in the fall, 11th- and
12th-graders in his honors physiology class will start out with a
cat and dissect it throughout the year until it is a skeleton.
</P>
<P>
   Other teachers, such as Tom Gwin at Newton High North, insist
computer programs are just as good. His school began using a
computer model after some students, mostly girls, objected to
dissection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't force kids to dissect,'' said Gwin, head of the
science department. ``We know some kids have bad feelings about
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsie McLaughlin, a senior at Triton Regional, sympathizes with
classmates who can't stomach dissections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great thing to have hands-on experience, to
touch and be there,'' she said. ``I'm looking into going into a
science field. For those not looking, they shouldn't have to cut up
a frog or a pig when you have the technology now to do otherwise on
a computer.''
</P>
<P>
   With or without a bill, dissection as a teaching tool in middle
and high school may be on its last legs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston public schools, it is being de-emphasized, said
Ann Hamadeh, program director for science.
</P>
<P>
   Science course work has been reconfigured to fit the material
covered on the state's standardized test, she said, and the
approach to biology has more to do with the study of molecular
structure and environmental and ecological subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers also object to dissection out of respect for life,
Gwin said. The Humane Society of the United States estimates that 6
million vertebrates are dissected every year, of which 3 million
are frogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look across the world and realize amphibians are
disappearing because of acid rain, it seems silly to purchase over
100 frogs to dissect,'' he said.

NEW BALLGAME FOR MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ For John McCain, it turned out that there was not
just a bounce from his landslide in New Hampshire. It's better than
that. Instead of the traditional ripple effect that gradually
spreads across the country, McCain is surging everywhere. He is
also consuming oxygen his would-be counterpart in Democratic Party
insurgency politics, Bill Bradley, desperately needs to sustain his
assault on Al Gore. But above all McCain is changing the Republican
landscape daily.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, for the embattled Republican establishment, the
little-noticed backwater primary on Tuesday in Delaware suddenly
looms vital. Admittedly, only the nearly moribund candidacy of
Steve Forbes confronts George W. Bush there, with McCain a ballot
presence in name only after a decision to treat the place like Iowa
in advance of his make-or-break date with South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   So nearly desperate has Bush's position become since New
Hampshire that beating a wounded candidate in a tiny state has
become crucial to Bush's hopes of a gradual comeback. In increasing
his last-minute investment in Delaware, Bush is betting that
Forbes's victory there four years ago is ancient history and that
support from Delaware's Republican establishment will be adequate
to produce a win.
</P>
<P>
   It had better be. To be beaten Delaware, or to have a large,
come-from-nowhere McCain vote emerge would be catastrophic. With
Bush's aura of inevitability at least temporarily shattered, the
minor reality check of a victory in Delaware would give him a
breather for his larger regrouping mission.
</P>
<P>
   What continues to be missing from the president-in-waiting is a
signal to Republicans around the country that he understands what
has happened to him and that he intends to fight for his beliefs
just as soon as he can be sure what they are. In place of candor,
there has been nothing but denial, mixed in with tactical maneuvers
whose cumulative impact has been to exacerbate Bush's problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign may be leaking badly right now, but it's still
a battleship, meaning it is very hard to turn it quickly. The
governor proved that right out of the New Hampshire box in South
Carolina; he proved it in the mess he has made of his position in
New York state; and he proves it daily with lame experiments at
coming up with the magic label that his multitude of consultants
and advisers believe can sink McCain with ordinary Republican
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The symbol for the ostrich behavior in South Carolina was Dan
Quayle, who showed up to endorse Bush his first day there. By then
there wasn't a soul left in the Bush campaign who didn't understand
that endorsements had become part of the problem the final week in
New Hampshire. But instead of lamely noting that the Quayle
``blessing'' had already been scheduled, a more alert campaign
would have canceled it.
</P>
<P>
   That goes double for the disaster that has befallen the campaign
in New York as a result of its alliance with Governor George Pataki
to use the state's ridiculously antidemocratic rules to keep McCain
off the ballot in most of the congressional districts. A week ago,
when a gutsy federal judge signaled his disgust with those rules,
the Bush campaign had a brief window of opportunity to get some
credit for seeing the legal and moral light and tossing in the
towel.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it went through six days of embarrassing confusion
before its belated move looked like the surrender that it was. The
result is that the McCain campaign not only has the same momentum
in New York it has earned in South Carolina, it also benefits from
a local issue.
</P>
<P>
   The fight there is far from over, but for a candidate with
McCain's limited resources facing multiple primaries on March 7,
his campaign now has a major cushion in New York _ courtesy of
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing shows the Bush campaign in full panic more than its
behavior in South Carolina. Chief surrogate David Beasely, who was
defeated for reelection last year in the governor's race, claimed
that the state would reverse New Hampshire's mistake on Feb. 19,
despite the fact that people in the campaign knew that polls
showing at best a deadheat were a certainty before the end of the
week. One hour Bush would claim the mantle of conservatism (``I am
the right'' was the most memorable syntactical monstrosity); at
other times, Bush was the self-proclaimed 50-state, national
candidate (leaving McCain the opening to retort that he better make
that 49); and at still others, Bush was the ``outsider'' and McCain
the dreaded ``Washington insider.''
</P>
<P>
   This flailing about with mixed messages is the symptom of the
absence of an underlying rationale for this campaign. Its money and
institutional support, in marked contrast to front-runners past,
has nothing to do with Bush's record, beliefs, or any other ties to
him personally. It's strictly business, which makes it an inch
deep.
</P>
<P>
   A candid recognition that the ballgame has changed, combined
with a statement by Bush of what he represents to voters as opposed
to donors and fellow pols, would still help reestablishing his
position. But until that happens, the wildest ride since Gary
Hart's in 1984, only this time by a much more formidable figure, is
going to continue.

THE UN-JULIA: KATE WINSLET'S FIGHT TO TRIUMPH OVER STARDOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Kate Winslet in a scene from ``Holy
Smoke.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Kate Winslet thought she was going mad.
 &HT;    She was 18 or 19 years old, and deeply confused as to who she
was. Though she'd started acting and loved the craft, she still
groped for an identity, a sense of herself as a person.
 &HT;    ``That's very typical for young people _ not just women, but
young people _ to feel,'' the English actress says. ``I pushed
myself through that period, saying `I'll go through this lonely
bit, I'll go through this suicidal bit and I'll come out the other
side and feel OK.'
 &HT;    ``It took a long time,'' she admits, ``but I knew there were all
these other important things that I had to do. I suppose I was
lucky, because I had a really stable upbringing that gave me the
security to do that.
 &HT;    ``Some people don't have that, and it can be quite scary.''
 &HT;    Those hard days may have been worth it, however, because they
equipped Winslet to deal with the consequences of her own success.
They gave the now-24-year-old actress the courage not to be a movie
star.
 &HT;    After her meteoric rise in the wake of ``Titanic'' (1997),
Winslet might have seized the moment, starring in one blockbuster
after another as so many others have done. But instead of ``going
Hollywood,'' Winslet has reaffirmed her status as one of the most
talented actresses of her generation, seeking out challenging roles
in smaller, idiosyncratic films that allow her to test herself and
further develop her art.
 &HT;    First there was ``Hideous Kinky'' (1999) and now there is ``Holy
Smoke,'' opening nationwide throughout February. Directed by Jane
Campion and based on a screenplay by Campion and her sister Anna,
``Holy Smoke'' stars Winslet as Ruth, an Australian woman who,
during a visit to India, becomes caught up in the teachings of a
Hindu/Buddhist guru.
 &HT;    Disturbed by Ruth's new life, her family plots to save her from
herself, ultimately reaching out to P.J. Waters (Harvey Keitel), an
American deprogrammer. Waters whisks Ruth away to a halfway hut in
the middle of nowhere, and the agonizing deprogramming process
begins. It's thrown out of whack, however, when Ruth seduces P.J.
and turns the tables on him.
 &HT;    ``I loved the fact that Jane was asking me to play a woman who
was very real and very now and very ballsy,'' Winslet says, rolling
her first of several cigarettes during a conversation at
Manhattan's Essex House. She's in winning form, speaking earnestly,
laughing at herself often and looking chic in a blood-red blouse
and black jacket.
 &HT;    ``I was flattered to be asked,'' she says. ``It made me think,
`God, maybe I really could do this.' I loved the script.
 &HT;    ``Ruth is just trying to figure out who she is,'' Winslet says,
``and I think she does that through her relationship with P.J. He
opens up other sides of her she didn't even know she had, and she
does the same for him.
 &HT;    ``It was the script, Jane, the character and Harvey Keitel that
attracted me, as this one big, fabulous package.''
 &HT;    Winslet threw herself into the project, spending two weeks in
India researching her role, taking the advice of a friend to
actually get sloshed for a drunk scene and giving her all in
several sexually charged scenes opposite Keitel. For one particular
sequence, Winslet was called upon to stand buck naked, urinate on
herself and confront Keitel.
 &HT;    The actress felt liberated after filming her first nude scene,
in ``Jude'' (1996). Now, she says, it's just part of the job. Sort
of.
 &HT;    ``When I had to do it in `Jude' I was so petrified,'' she
recalls. ``I felt like I just couldn't do it. Emma Thompson said,
`You'll feel liberated. Just go for it.'
 &HT;    ``She was right,'' the actress adds, ``and I did. Ever since
then ... nude scenes are hard to do, but at the end of the day they
are no different from any other scene, because you have to forget
yourself and your physicality, and you have to concentrate on the
work involved. Otherwise all kinds of my own paranoia would come
into play, and I wouldn't be embodying the character.
 &HT;    ``They are difficult scenes to do, but there is a certain sense
of `Yes, I did that' when you get to the other side.''
 &HT;    Actually, she admits, not much scares her anymore.
 &HT;    ``I don't think so,'' she says, smiling slyly. ``When it comes
to being in a movie, there are all kinds of things and you think,
`I can't even act anymore _ I look like the back end of a horse.
How can I possibly do this?'
 &HT;    ``You panic like crazy,'' she says, ``but I don't know a single
actor who doesn't do that. Apart from a normal paranoia until you
get to day one, there really isn't anything that scares me.
 &HT;    ``If anything, `Holy Smoke' almost changed any fears I
subconsciously had,'' she adds, ``because I had to play that role.
I had to be really uninhibited. I had to be very free and not
afraid.
 &HT;    ``Jane dragged me there, kicking and screaming.''
 &HT;    Back home in London, Winslet reports, there's little kicking or
screaming. She and her husband, aspiring director Jim Threapleton,
are doing fine, thank you very much.
 &HT;    As for the age-old question that arises whenever half of a
couple is a major star ...
 &HT;    ``It's a question that is asked a lot to celebrities, if you
like,'' Winslet says, interrupting. ```Who wears the trousers in
your relationship?' I say we wear one leg each. It's incredibly
equal, and that just doesn't come into play.''
 &HT;    Winslet, who first made her mark in such period films as ``Sense
and Sensibility'' (1995) and ``Jude,'' is back in corsets for her
next film, ``Quills.'' The story of the Marquis de Sade, the film
co-stars Geoffrey Rush and Joaquin Phoenix, and is directed by the
always-unpredictable Philip Kaufman.
 &HT;    As its subject matter suggests, ``Quills'' is far more likely to
win critical plaudits than to score big at the box office. And
chances are that Winslet passed up far more commercial projects and
larger paydays in order to do it, the same way she reportedly
turned down ``Shakespeare in Love'' (1998), ``Anna and the King''
(1999) and the upcoming ``Autumn in New York'' in favor of
``Hideous Kinky'' and ``Holy Smoke.''
 &HT;    ``I hate to get down to specifics,'' Winslet says, shaking her
head at the mention of those other films. ``I don't have any
regrets, because I don't believe in having regrets in life. I think
you only have one life, and if you regret things then you're
stepping backward.
 &HT;    ``I'm a believer in going forward and going for it and having
fun, actually,'' she says with a smile. ``I have no regrets in my
life at all.''

 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It's almost ... well, supernatural.
 &HT;    About the last thing anyone associated with the pop-music scene
looked for last year was a record-shattering comeback from Carlos
Santana.
 &HT;    But that's exactly what has happened in the wake of June's
release of ``Supernatural,'' a record that pairs Santana with such
contemporary luminaries as Dave Matthews, Lauryn Hill, Rob Thomas
of Matchbox 20, Everlast, Eagle-Eye Cherry and Wyclef Jean, as well
as fellow rock-guitar hero Eric Clapton.
 &HT;    Faster than you can say ``Oye Como Va,'' ``Supernatural'' became
a sensation, topping the Billboard album charts at the same time
``Smooth,'' co-written and sung by Thomas and Santana, hit the top
of the singles charts.
 &HT;    Besides reviving the star Santana kindled 30 years ago with his
defining performance at the original Woodstock festival, it also
earned the 52-year-old songwriter, musician and bandleader an
American Music Award for the year's favorite pop/rock album and a
whopping 10 Grammy Award nominations, the most of any artist this
year.
 &HT;    And, Santana says, this success isn't entirely accidental.
 &HT;    ``This CD is assigned and designed to reach junior-high school,
high school and universities,'' explains the Mexican-born musician,
whose previous two No. 1 albums, ``Abraxas'' and ``Santana III,''
were released in the early 1970s. ``With Lauryn Hill and Dave
Matthews, it was designed to assault the radio airwaves with the
Santana vibration.
 &HT;    ``If you play something from the heart,'' he adds, ``they'll
listen to it. Eubie Blake, the piano player, used to say `If you
listen, we get you.'
 &HT;    ``So it ain't about generations,'' Santana says. ``We're
connecting because, even though they're very young and some of them
may have never heard us, once we drop the music on them, they go
`Oh, what is this?'
 &HT;    ``It's going in, and it's making an impact.''
 &HT;    Santana's three-plus decades of recording include not only work
with his own band but also numerous collaborations and a leading
role in the blending of Latin and rock styles. He views music as
spiritual expression _ something that, when done correctly, can
``rearrange the molecular structure of the listener'' and inspire a
higher understanding of the self and the world around us.
 &HT;    At the turn of the century, Santana also feels compelled to
spread a ``positive vibration'' to counterbalance the aggressive,
violent images that saturate popular culture.
 &HT;    ``All you have to do is look at what's happening in schools,
with guns and stuff, and I felt that by creating this music we were
presenting the audience, the young listeners, a new menu,'' he
says. ``We don't want them to feel like us or think like us or
believe like us _ everybody's entitled to their own unique
viewpoint and to pursue their own destinies. But we did want to
present them with a new menu.
 &HT;    ``In other words,'' he explains, ``when the sound resonates and
the vibrations that come out of us through the songs rearrange the
molecules, then you and I are reminded that we are multidimensional
spirits, and we have enormous opportunities and possibilities to do
grand things for the highest good of life and people on the
planet.''
 &HT;    Of course, what's a message without an audience to hear it?
That's what brought Santana back to Arista Records chief Clive
Davis, the man who had signed him to Columbia Records in 1969, to
help put together ``Supernatural'' and its superstar
collaborations.
 &HT;    For his part, Santana says his main responsibility wasn't really
the music as such, but rather to make sure the project stayed true
to his mission.
 &HT;    ``This is not show business,'' he says. ``This is not
entertainment. None of the musicians I play with on this CD is an
entertainment guy or a show-business guy _ we're musicians, and we
believe that music has the power to bring unity and healing in a
new kind of dimension and thinking. And that's why we did it.
 &HT;    ``All of us came with our hearts forward, and it sounds like one
breath,'' Santana says. ``It doesn't sound like it was painted by
numbers or like I was dipped into somebody else's stuff. To me,
it's a masterpiece of joy.''
 &HT;    ``Smooth,'' the album's big hit, is also one of its most joyous
moments, a celebration of sensuality and romantic dynamics. Yet
beforehand many wondered if Thomas, best known for hooky-pop hits
with Matchbox 20, wasn't a bit too lightweight to be working with
someone like Santana.
 &HT;    ``He was just as deep as all the other people, no less,''
Santana insists. ``Don't let the word `popular' fool you _ there's
nothing more popular than Nat King Cole, still. (Thomas')
convictions are true for what he's doing _ he caught that spirit of
Spanish Harlem, `Mona Lisa.'
 &HT;    ``He has this beautiful lady, she looks Afro-Cuban or she might
be Puerto Rican, so he understands the concept of
multidimensional,'' the musician adds. ``He has a deep soul and
deep convictions. We sat down and talked about it before we started
recording the song. I'm just very, very grateful, man _ he's a
great writer.''
 &HT;    There are stories behind each of the album's pairings. Hill, for
instance, had Santana as a guest on her Grammy-winning ``The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' and was more than happy to return
the favor.
 &HT;    Santana had been introduced to Matthews' music by his 9-year-old
daughter. Intrigued, he presented Matthews with the beginnings of
``Love of My Life,'' a song inspired by Brahms' ``Concerto No. 2,''
and let the younger rocker finish it.
 &HT;    Clapton, meanwhile, had seen Santana perform with Hill at last
year's Grammys, and called after Davis approached him about the
project.
 &HT;    ``He said, `I definitely want to play on your album, but only if
you hear me and if there's room for me,''' Santana recalls. ``Can
you imagine Eric Clapton telling you such a thing?''
 &HT;    The two met one afternoon and came up with ``The Calling,'' a
lengthy opus which Santana likens to ``having two Apaches at the
Grand Canyon evoking the spirits, that kind of thing.''
 &HT;    Part of ``Supernatural's'' success is its opportune timing, many
observers believe. The success of Ricky Martin and others has
reawakened mass interest in Latin music, resulting in some
sales-inducing curiosity about Santana as one of its important
figures.
 &HT;    The guitarist himself dismisses the notion, however _ though
``Supernatural'' does include several songs with Spanish lyrics.
The way he sees it, he's been around far too long to be helped by
trends.
 &HT;    ``I take great delight in crystallizing the reality that Latin
or Spanish, whatever we call it, is really African music,'' Santana
says. ``Ricky Martin, yours truly, Gloria Estefan, Los Lobos _
everyone who calls themselves Latin or Spanish is really playing
African music, unless you mix it with polkas or waltzes.
 &HT;    ``But basically, everybody's playing rumba, cha cha cha, samba,
bolero, and all that stuff really comes from Africa,'' he says.
``Whatever we call ourselves these days, Latin or Spanish or
Chicano, it's OK _ but we have to remember that we really are
playing African music and so honor that.''

NO HANG-UPS: DIANE KEATON'S CLEAR-EYED VIEW OF HOLLYWOOD

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Diane Keaton with Meg Ryan and Lisa
Kudrow in a scene from ``Hanging Up.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    As usual, the tabloids were full of catfight rumors.
 &HT;    Three top female stars _ veteran Diane Keaton, at-her-peak Meg
Ryan and up-and-coming Lisa Kudrow _ were co-starring in ``Hanging
Up.'' To add to the mix, Keaton was directing as well.
 &HT;    Did the fur fly?
 &HT;    ``Of course, when you put three strong women together,'' Keaton
says, ``everyone wants to know if there was trouble.''
 &HT;    On the contrary, the actress/director says _ the three actually
found a lot in common.
 &HT;    ``Meg would gather all of us in the makeup trailer and we'd talk
about our kids,'' she says. ``We would talk about the stresses of
being working moms. It was heavenly.''
 &HT;    Clad in a maroon-leather jacket, matching pants and a white
T-shirt for an interview at Los Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel, Keaton
shows no sign of any second thoughts about ``Hanging Up,'' her
loose adaptation of screenwriter/novelist Delia Ephron's family
memoir, which will open nationwide on Feb. 18.
 &HT;    Notoriously private, Keaton doesn't especially like doing
interviews, but she's professional enough to know when it's
necessary.
 &HT;    ``You know, I don't think I'm so shy,'' she insists. ``I've got
this self-effacing thing going on. And I think I'm protective and a
little paranoid. But I'm too old to be shy.''
 &HT;    Certainly, the 54-year-old Keaton wasn't so shy as to sit back
waiting for the chance to direct ``Hanging Up.''
 &HT;    ``I've saved an hour-long message on my phone machine from
Diane, insisting why she was the only one to direct this movie,''
says co-writer/co-producer Nora Ephron, who briefly considered
directing it herself. ``And Diane was right. I was too close to the
project. And Diane brought the right sensibilities.''
 &HT;    Keaton, Ryan and Kudrow play three sisters dealing with their
aging, alcoholic and often abusive father (Walter Matthau).
 &HT;    ``The minute I read the script, something clicked,'' Keaton
says. ``I am one of three sisters. I love the themes of death and
loss and redemption. And I identified, because this is also a movie
about the stresses facing modern women.''
 &HT;    From ``Annie Hall'' (1975) to ``Baby Boom'' (1987) to ``The
First Wives Club'' (1996), Keaton has spent her career embodying
victims of those stresses.
 &HT;    ``I'm like any mom out there,'' she admits. ``I feel scattered.
I'm always trying to do too much at one time. I feel like I'm being
pulled in all directions.''
 &HT;    Being simultaneously the director and a star of the film didn't
make things any less stressful for Keaton, Ryan says.
 &HT;    ``We're in a hospital room and I'm sobbing into the arms of my
sister, played by Diane,'' Ryan recalls in a separate interview.
``Her back is toward the camera. The actress in Diane is patting my
shoulder and looking at me with such concern and grief.
 &HT;    ``Then the director in Diane whispers in my ear, `OK, are you
done? We've got to move on.'''
 &HT;    Directing counts to Keaton, whose first feature, ``Unstrung
Heroes'' (1996), won strong reviews.
 &HT;    ``I'm at the age as a woman in Hollywood where I know I need
another craft if I want to keep making a living,'' she says
matter-of-factly. `The First Wives Club' saved my professional life
_ that was a big hit. But, let's face it, I'm not 22 anymore. Roles
are not pouring in.''
 &HT;    One recent role cast her opposite Warren Beatty, her former
co-star in ``Reds'' (1981) and former offscreen love interest. But
the long-delayed ``Town &AMP; Country,'' which co-stars Goldie Hawn,
was reportedly a mess from beginning to end.
 &HT;    ```Town &AMP; Country' was, um ... you would ask me about `Town &AMP;
Country,''' Keaton says hesitantly. ``What can I say? Except the
film has been delayed and it has to come out. They've spent too
much money.''
 &HT;    Working with Beatty wasn't a problem, says Keaton, who has also
co-starred with former lovers Al Pacino and Woody Allen years after
their breakups. Nowadays, she adds, she's happily single and
raising her adopted daughter, Dexter.
 &HT;    ``When you're famous it's harder to experience love,'' she says.
``People give you their fantasies about you, and that is something
you can't possibly live up to in real life.''
 &HT;    She isn't bitter, though.
 &HT;    ``The memories of the past are sweet to me now,'' Keaton says
thoughtfully. ``Sometimes I'll sit around and get out the old
photos of my family and my life. I like to document people and take
a look at the past _ it's a way to take a look at what you've lost
and the person who meant so much to you. It's like letting them be
there again for you.
 &HT;    ``Then you don't lose them completely.''
 &HT;    As a young girl growing up in Los Angeles, Keaton recalls being
fascinated by the silver screen.
 &HT;    ``As a kid,'' she says, ``I would watch movies and think, `I'm
so self-conscious and shy, but maybe if I was another person I
wouldn't feel that way.'''
 &HT;    She dropped out of college at 19 and headed for New York, where
she studied acting and got her first break in the original cast of
the rock musical ``Hair'' (1968).
 &HT;    ``I was the only one who didn't take off my clothes at the
end,'' she says, laughing. ``I negotiated to wear a body
stocking.''
 &HT;    That same year Keaton met Allen, who cast her in his play ``Play
It Again, Sam.'' He was 32 and she was 22, and the two fell into an
intense personal and professional relationship.
 &HT;    ``What Woody taught me was to laugh about sex,'' she famously
said of their relationship. ``Not all the time, but once in a
while.''
 &HT;    Keaton won an Oscar as Best Actress for the title role in
Allen's ``Annie Hall'' (1977). The film also triggered a fashion
trend, as women across America started dressing the way Keaton
always had, adopting the floppy hats, baggy pants, oversized vests
and sweaters that once led Larry McMurtry to dub Keaton ``the Queen
of Swap Meets.''
 &HT;    ``I like to express myself through fashion,'' says Keaton, who
still dresses that way, ``but I never thought people would follow
along.''
 &HT;    A string of hit films followed, including ``Looking for Mr.
Goodbar'' (1977), ``Reds,'' ``Crimes of the Heart'' (1986), ``Baby
Boom'' (1987) and ``Father of the Bride'' (1991), as well as a
gradual immersion in directing, starting with music videos,
episodes of television's ``Twin Peaks'' and ``China Beach'' and,
finally, a couple of documentaries.
 &HT;    ``I never think about big financial hits,'' she says. ``I just
try to tell a good story.''
 &HT;    When she wraps, Keaton heads home to a Frank Lloyd Wright house,
located off Sunset Boulevard in the Hollywood hills.
 &HT;    ``My Dad would work really hard all day, and then he'd come home
and turn into a zombie,'' she says. ``That's not me. When I'm home
with my daughter, I say, `OK, enough for today. I will not worry
about movies.'
 &HT;    ``Fourteen hours is enough to devote to my craft,'' she says.
``I'm not going to cut into my daughter's time by having a phone
conversation with my agent where I'm saying, `No, I don't think I'm
right to direct `Gandhi II.'''
 &HT;    But what if it were about Gandhi's three sisters?
 &HT;    Keaton wrinkles her brow.
 &HT;    ``Can I get back to you about that one?''

 By KEVIN SNOW  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before Feb. 13. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's no wonder that most live television shows employ a warm-up
comedian before the host gets near the audience. You can't expect a
cheerful reception from a bunch of people fresh from 30 minutes
standing in line out in a frigid New York night or jammed into a
cramped anteroom that really is referred to as a ``holding tank.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the host is his own warm-up man. David Letterman meets
his audience prior to taping, for example, but his brief chat
almost gives the impression that an audience should feel privileged
to be in his presence.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Stewart is a different story. As soon as he steps onto ``The
Daily Show'' set, he makes everyone feel at home. For almost 10
minutes he lets the crowd know that he's as happy to see them as
they are to see him.
</P>
<P>
   And Stewart actually is happy to see his audience. After years
of guest-host status on dozens of shows, Stewart took over as host
</P>
<P>
   of Comedy Central's popular program in January 1999, and he
hasn't looked back since. A nightly news-parody program is a long
way from the network talk shows that he was reportedly in line for
on numerous occasions, but it suits the 37-year-old Stewart just
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is perfect for me,'' Stewart says, leaning back into a
chair in his New York office. ``The opportunity to write jokes
about the news is a gift. I have a forum every day on television.
I'm really enjoying this.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, Stewart admits, he found frustration at
every turn. There are those who love the forever-on-the-road life
of a stand-up comic, but he isn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comedy circuit is tough,'' Stewart says. ``You begin to
wonder how many times you can jump in the van and head to Rochester
to play the karaoke club. That was probably the toughest part for
me _ I was looking for a way to know where I was going.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, an MTV talk show seemed to offer that
direction. Paramount bought the show in 1995, but its attempts to
syndicate it came to nought.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman's Worldwide Pants production company then signed
Stewart to a contract, but the only results of that deal were
endless rumors that he would be replacing various current hosts.
The most prevalent one had him replacing Tom Snyder on ``The Late,
Late Show'' _ a position ultimately filled, ironically, by
Stewart's ``Daily Show'' predecessor, Craig Kilborn.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors became so widespread that, when Stewart played
himself on Garry Shandling's ``The Larry Sanders Show,'' the
running gag for the final season focused on Larry's fears that his
bosses were grooming Stewart to take over the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like I was ever being interviewed for these jobs or
sending out resumes,'' the comedian says, laughing. ``I was just
going about my business, and every so often people would say, `Hey,
I hear you're taking over on that show.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny, because the story of what was really going on
was so different.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Stewart says, he tried not to let the rumors get
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what helped most is that my goals are never much
beyond what I'm doing now,'' he says in retrospect. ``This is the
kind of business that can disappoint you on a daily basis if your
needs are so great.''
</P>
<P>
   His unexpected down time allowed Stewart to experiment in film
acting, playing supporting roles in a few 1999 films, including
``The Faculty,'' ``Big Daddy'' and ``Playing By Heart,'' which
offered him his largest role to date.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Stewart has ambitions to become a movie star. In fact,
he says, he feels a bit uncomfortable even discussing it seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of fun to do,'' he says, ``but I recognize the
limitations of what that presents for me. I really have trouble
talking about acting to people, because it's something I don't
truly understand.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Playing By Heart,'' an ensemble film whose illustrious cast
included Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Dennis Quaid, Madeleine
Stowe, Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe, Stewart played a
sensitive architect courting a neurotic, romantically scarred woman
played by Gillian Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part for me in that film was the earnestness,''
the comedian says. ``Having to tell someone you love them, eight
times, in front of a bunch of guys standing around holding lights.
Those Teamsters aren't big huggers.''
</P>
<P>
   His film work was interesting and enjoyable, he adds, but it
only made it clearer to him that he wanted to get back into
television _ though not necessarily into the talk-show game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd already done the celebrity-driven thing,'' he says, ``so I
wasn't sure if I wanted to go that route again.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart can pinpoint the exact moment when he realized that he
had to get back on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching Mary Bono during the Clinton impeachment
proceedings,'' Stewart recalls. ``She had just written a book about
Sonny Bono, all of his drug issues, how he died. And she was on the
congressional subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about a travesty,'' he says, rolling his eyes. ``When
they got to her, her comment was, `What do I tell my children?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sitting there thinking, you just wrote a tell-all book
about Hollywood ... What do you tell your children about the
president? How about this: The president was on painkillers and he
skiied into an intern.'''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This made me realize I had the itch,'' he says. ``The book and
movie roles didn't have the pop that I was looking for _ I wanted
to get back in the daily grind.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Stewart's role on ``The Daily Show'' is as an
anti-anchorman. He doesn't simply read the news _ he takes shots at
it and how it's presented. Sometimes his facial expressions and
body language are enough to make his opinion hilariously clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there's a dual role of commentary and satire on the
way the news is disseminated nowadays,'' he says. ``It's a show
about the media to a certain extent, but not explicitly. It's sort
of an implicit tear on the media, but not just the news _ it's just
using the actual structure of a newscast.''
</P>
<P>
   The show benefits from its team of correspondents, with regular
contributors Vance Degeneres and Mo Rocca taking minor news events
and blowing them way out of proportion, almost as tribute to some
of the major networks' newsmagazines.
</P>
<P>
   Those programs are one topic that gets Stewart heated up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pomposity of `Dateline,' `20/20' and the new world of
scare tactics is unbelievable,'' he says, shaking his head. ``News
today functions like entertainment. There is no grander thesis, no
higher purpose anymore, and it's unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's passion for the news may be what makes him so happy
with his current post _ though he typically resists embracing it
wholly, happy or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I've got work, I always think that things are good,'' he
says. ``The way I look at, if I'm not bartending anymore, things
can't be too bad.''

THE UN-JULIA: KATE WINSLET'S FIGHT TO TRIUMPH OVER STARDOM

 (Includes a color slide of Kate Winslet in a scene from ``Holy

 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Kate Winslet thought she was going mad.
 &HT;    She was 18 or 19 years old, and deeply confused as to who she
was. Though she'd started acting and loved the craft, she still
groped for an identity, a sense of herself as a person.
 &HT;    ``That's very typical for young people _ not just women, but
young people _ to feel,'' the English actress says. ``I pushed
myself through that period, saying `I'll go through this lonely
bit, I'll go through this suicidal bit and I'll come out the other
side and feel OK.'
 &HT;    ``It took a long time,'' she admits, ``but I knew there were all
these other important things that I had to do. I suppose I was
lucky, because I had a really stable upbringing that gave me the
security to do that.
 &HT;    ``Some people don't have that, and it can be quite scary.''
 &HT;    Those hard days may have been worth it, however, because they
equipped Winslet to deal with the consequences of her own success.
They gave the now-24-year-old actress the courage not to be a movie
star.
 &HT;    After her meteoric rise in the wake of ``Titanic'' (1997),
Winslet might have seized the moment, starring in one blockbuster
after another as so many others have done. But instead of ``going
Hollywood,'' Winslet has reaffirmed her status as one of the most
talented actresses of her generation, seeking out challenging roles
in smaller, idiosyncratic films that allow her to test herself and
further develop her art.
 &HT;    First there was ``Hideous Kinky'' (1999) and now there is ``Holy
Smoke,'' opening nationwide throughout February. Directed by Jane
Campion and based on a screenplay by Campion and her sister Anna,
``Holy Smoke'' stars Winslet as Ruth, an Australian woman who,
during a visit to India, becomes caught up in the teachings of a
Hindu/Buddhist guru.
 &HT;    Disturbed by Ruth's new life, her family plots to save her from
herself, ultimately reaching out to P.J. Waters (Harvey Keitel), an
American deprogrammer. Waters whisks Ruth away to a halfway hut in
the middle of nowhere, and the agonizing deprogramming process
begins. It's thrown out of whack, however, when Ruth seduces P.J.
and turns the tables on him.
 &HT;    ``I loved the fact that Jane was asking me to play a woman who
was very real and very now and very ballsy,'' Winslet says, rolling
her first of several cigarettes during a conversation at
Manhattan's Essex House. She's in winning form, speaking earnestly,
laughing at herself often and looking chic in a blood-red blouse
and black jacket.
 &HT;    ``I was flattered to be asked,'' she says. ``It made me think,
`God, maybe I really could do this.' I loved the script.
 &HT;    ``Ruth is just trying to figure out who she is,'' Winslet says,
``and I think she does that through her relationship with P.J. He
opens up other sides of her she didn't even know she had, and she
does the same for him.
 &HT;    ``It was the script, Jane, the character and Harvey Keitel that
attracted me, as this one big, fabulous package.''
 &HT;    Winslet threw herself into the project, spending two weeks in
India researching her role, taking the advice of a friend to
actually get sloshed for a drunk scene and giving her all in
several sexually charged scenes opposite Keitel. For one particular
sequence, Winslet was called upon to stand buck naked, urinate on
herself and confront Keitel.
 &HT;    The actress felt liberated after filming her first nude scene,
in ``Jude'' (1996). Now, she says, it's just part of the job. Sort
of.
 &HT;    ``When I had to do it in `Jude' I was so petrified,'' she
recalls. ``I felt like I just couldn't do it. Emma Thompson said,
`You'll feel liberated. Just go for it.'
 &HT;    ``She was right,'' the actress adds, ``and I did. Ever since
then ... nude scenes are hard to do, but at the end of the day they
are no different from any other scene, because you have to forget
yourself and your physicality, and you have to concentrate on the
work involved. Otherwise all kinds of my own paranoia would come
into play, and I wouldn't be embodying the character.
 &HT;    ``They are difficult scenes to do, but there is a certain sense
of `Yes, I did that' when you get to the other side.''
 &HT;    Actually, she admits, not much scares her anymore.
 &HT;    ``I don't think so,'' she says, smiling slyly. ``When it comes
to being in a movie, there are all kinds of things and you think,
`I can't even act anymore _ I look like the back end of a horse.
How can I possibly do this?'
 &HT;    ``You panic like crazy,'' she says, ``but I don't know a single
actor who doesn't do that. Apart from a normal paranoia until you
get to day one, there really isn't anything that scares me.
 &HT;    ``If anything, `Holy Smoke' almost changed any fears I
subconsciously had,'' she adds, ``because I had to play that role.
I had to be really uninhibited. I had to be very free and not
afraid.
 &HT;    ``Jane dragged me there, kicking and screaming.''
 &HT;    Back home in London, Winslet reports, there's little kicking or
screaming. She and her husband, aspiring director Jim Threapleton,
are doing fine, thank you very much.
 &HT;    As for the age-old question that arises whenever half of a
couple is a major star ...
 &HT;    ``It's a question that is asked a lot to celebrities, if you
like,'' Winslet says, interrupting. ```Who wears the trousers in
your relationship?' I say we wear one leg each. It's incredibly
equal, and that just doesn't come into play.''
 &HT;    Winslet, who first made her mark in such period films as ``Sense
and Sensibility'' (1995) and ``Jude,'' is back in corsets for her
next film, ``Quills.'' The story of the Marquis de Sade, the film
co-stars Geoffrey Rush and Joaquin Phoenix, and is directed by the
always-unpredictable Philip Kaufman.
 &HT;    As its subject matter suggests, ``Quills'' is far more likely to
win critical plaudits than to score big at the box office. And
chances are that Winslet passed up far more commercial projects and
larger paydays in order to do it, the same way she reportedly
turned down ``Shakespeare in Love'' (1998), ``Anna and the King''
(1999) and the upcoming ``Autumn in New York'' in favor of
``Hideous Kinky'' and ``Holy Smoke.''
 &HT;    ``I hate to get down to specifics,'' Winslet says, shaking her
head at the mention of those other films. ``I don't have any
regrets, because I don't believe in having regrets in life. I think
you only have one life, and if you regret things then you're
stepping backward.
 &HT;    ``I'm a believer in going forward and going for it and having
fun, actually,'' she says with a smile. ``I have no regrets in my
life at all.''

`SUPERNATURAL' PHENOMENON: THE RESURRECTION OF CARLOS SANTANA 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of singer Carlos Santana.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It's almost ... well, supernatural.
 &HT;    About the last thing anyone associated with the pop-music scene
looked for last year was a record-shattering comeback from Carlos
Santana.
 &HT;    But that's exactly what has happened in the wake of June's
release of ``Supernatural,'' a record that pairs Santana with such
contemporary luminaries as Dave Matthews, Lauryn Hill, Rob Thomas
of Matchbox 20, Everlast, Eagle-Eye Cherry and Wyclef Jean, as well
as fellow rock-guitar hero Eric Clapton.
 &HT;    Faster than you can say ``Oye Como Va,'' ``Supernatural'' became
a sensation, topping the Billboard album charts at the same time
``Smooth,'' co-written and sung by Thomas and Santana, hit the top
of the singles charts.
 &HT;    Besides reviving the star Santana kindled 30 years ago with his
defining performance at the original Woodstock festival, it also
earned the 52-year-old songwriter, musician and bandleader an
American Music Award for the year's favorite pop/rock album and a
whopping 10 Grammy Award nominations, the most of any artist this
year.
 &HT;    And, Santana says, this success isn't entirely accidental.
 &HT;    ``This CD is assigned and designed to reach junior-high school,
high school and universities,'' explains the Mexican-born musician,
whose previous two No. 1 albums, ``Abraxas'' and ``Santana III,''
were released in the early 1970s. ``With Lauryn Hill and Dave
Matthews, it was designed to assault the radio airwaves with the
Santana vibration.
 &HT;    ``If you play something from the heart,'' he adds, ``they'll
listen to it. Eubie Blake, the piano player, used to say `If you
listen, we get you.'
 &HT;    ``So it ain't about generations,'' Santana says. ``We're
connecting because, even though they're very young and some of them
may have never heard us, once we drop the music on them, they go
`Oh, what is this?'
 &HT;    ``It's going in, and it's making an impact.''
 &HT;    Santana's three-plus decades of recording include not only work
with his own band but also numerous collaborations and a leading
role in the blending of Latin and rock styles. He views music as
spiritual expression _ something that, when done correctly, can
``rearrange the molecular structure of the listener'' and inspire a
higher understanding of the self and the world around us.
 &HT;    At the turn of the century, Santana also feels compelled to
spread a ``positive vibration'' to counterbalance the aggressive,
violent images that saturate popular culture.
 &HT;    ``All you have to do is look at what's happening in schools,
with guns and stuff, and I felt that by creating this music we were
presenting the audience, the young listeners, a new menu,'' he
says. ``We don't want them to feel like us or think like us or
believe like us _ everybody's entitled to their own unique
viewpoint and to pursue their own destinies. But we did want to
present them with a new menu.
 &HT;    ``In other words,'' he explains, ``when the sound resonates and
the vibrations that come out of us through the songs rearrange the
molecules, then you and I are reminded that we are multidimensional
spirits, and we have enormous opportunities and possibilities to do
grand things for the highest good of life and people on the
planet.''
 &HT;    Of course, what's a message without an audience to hear it?
That's what brought Santana back to Arista Records chief Clive
Davis, the man who had signed him to Columbia Records in 1969, to
help put together ``Supernatural'' and its superstar
collaborations.
 &HT;    For his part, Santana says his main responsibility wasn't really
the music as such, but rather to make sure the project stayed true
to his mission.
 &HT;    ``This is not show business,'' he says. ``This is not
entertainment. None of the musicians I play with on this CD is an
entertainment guy or a show-business guy _ we're musicians, and we
believe that music has the power to bring unity and healing in a
new kind of dimension and thinking. And that's why we did it.
 &HT;    ``All of us came with our hearts forward, and it sounds like one
breath,'' Santana says. ``It doesn't sound like it was painted by
numbers or like I was dipped into somebody else's stuff. To me,
it's a masterpiece of joy.''
 &HT;    ``Smooth,'' the album's big hit, is also one of its most joyous
moments, a celebration of sensuality and romantic dynamics. Yet
beforehand many wondered if Thomas, best known for hooky-pop hits
with Matchbox 20, wasn't a bit too lightweight to be working with
someone like Santana.
 &HT;    ``He was just as deep as all the other people, no less,''
Santana insists. ``Don't let the word `popular' fool you _ there's
nothing more popular than Nat King Cole, still. (Thomas')
convictions are true for what he's doing _ he caught that spirit of
Spanish Harlem, `Mona Lisa.'
 &HT;    ``He has this beautiful lady, she looks Afro-Cuban or she might
be Puerto Rican, so he understands the concept of
multidimensional,'' the musician adds. ``He has a deep soul and
deep convictions. We sat down and talked about it before we started
recording the song. I'm just very, very grateful, man _ he's a
great writer.''
 &HT;    There are stories behind each of the album's pairings. Hill, for
instance, had Santana as a guest on her Grammy-winning ``The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' and was more than happy to return
the favor.
 &HT;    Santana had been introduced to Matthews' music by his 9-year-old
daughter. Intrigued, he presented Matthews with the beginnings of
``Love of My Life,'' a song inspired by Brahms' ``Concerto No. 2,''
and let the younger rocker finish it.
 &HT;    Clapton, meanwhile, had seen Santana perform with Hill at last
year's Grammys, and called after Davis approached him about the
project.
 &HT;    ``He said, `I definitely want to play on your album, but only if
you hear me and if there's room for me,''' Santana recalls. ``Can
you imagine Eric Clapton telling you such a thing?''
 &HT;    The two met one afternoon and came up with ``The Calling,'' a
lengthy opus which Santana likens to ``having two Apaches at the
Grand Canyon evoking the spirits, that kind of thing.''
 &HT;    Part of ``Supernatural's'' success is its opportune timing, many
observers believe. The success of Ricky Martin and others has
reawakened mass interest in Latin music, resulting in some
sales-inducing curiosity about Santana as one of its important
figures.
 &HT;    The guitarist himself dismisses the notion, however _ though
``Supernatural'' does include several songs with Spanish lyrics.
The way he sees it, he's been around far too long to be helped by
trends.
 &HT;    ``I take great delight in crystallizing the reality that Latin
or Spanish, whatever we call it, is really African music,'' Santana
says. ``Ricky Martin, yours truly, Gloria Estefan, Los Lobos _
everyone who calls themselves Latin or Spanish is really playing
African music, unless you mix it with polkas or waltzes.
 &HT;    ``But basically, everybody's playing rumba, cha cha cha, samba,
bolero, and all that stuff really comes from Africa,'' he says.
``Whatever we call ourselves these days, Latin or Spanish or
Chicano, it's OK _ but we have to remember that we really are
playing African music and so honor that.''

NO HANG-UPS: DIANE KEATON'S CLEAR-EYED VIEW OF HOLLYWOOD

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Diane Keaton with Meg Ryan and Lisa
Kudrow in a scene from ``Hanging Up.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    As usual, the tabloids were full of catfight rumors.
 &HT;    Three top female stars _ veteran Diane Keaton, at-her-peak Meg
Ryan and up-and-coming Lisa Kudrow _ were co-starring in ``Hanging
Up.'' To add to the mix, Keaton was directing as well.
 &HT;    Did the fur fly?
 &HT;    ``Of course, when you put three strong women together,'' Keaton
says, ``everyone wants to know if there was trouble.''
 &HT;    On the contrary, the actress/director says _ the three actually
found a lot in common.
 &HT;    ``Meg would gather all of us in the makeup trailer and we'd talk
about our kids,'' she says. ``We would talk about the stresses of
being working moms. It was heavenly.''
 &HT;    Clad in a maroon-leather jacket, matching pants and a white
T-shirt for an interview at Los Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel, Keaton
shows no sign of any second thoughts about ``Hanging Up,'' her
loose adaptation of screenwriter/novelist Delia Ephron's family
memoir, which will open nationwide on Feb. 18.
 &HT;    Notoriously private, Keaton doesn't especially like doing
interviews, but she's professional enough to know when it's
necessary.
 &HT;    ``You know, I don't think I'm so shy,'' she insists. ``I've got
this self-effacing thing going on. And I think I'm protective and a
little paranoid. But I'm too old to be shy.''
 &HT;    Certainly, the 54-year-old Keaton wasn't so shy as to sit back
waiting for the chance to direct ``Hanging Up.''
 &HT;    ``I've saved an hour-long message on my phone machine from
Diane, insisting why she was the only one to direct this movie,''
says co-writer/co-producer Nora Ephron, who briefly considered
directing it herself. ``And Diane was right. I was too close to the
project. And Diane brought the right sensibilities.''
 &HT;    Keaton, Ryan and Kudrow play three sisters dealing with their
aging, alcoholic and often abusive father (Walter Matthau).
 &HT;    ``The minute I read the script, something clicked,'' Keaton
says. ``I am one of three sisters. I love the themes of death and
loss and redemption. And I identified, because this is also a movie
about the stresses facing modern women.''
 &HT;    From ``Annie Hall'' (1975) to ``Baby Boom'' (1987) to ``The
First Wives Club'' (1996), Keaton has spent her career embodying
victims of those stresses.
 &HT;    ``I'm like any mom out there,'' she admits. ``I feel scattered.
I'm always trying to do too much at one time. I feel like I'm being
pulled in all directions.''
 &HT;    Being simultaneously the director and a star of the film didn't
make things any less stressful for Keaton, Ryan says.
 &HT;    ``We're in a hospital room and I'm sobbing into the arms of my
sister, played by Diane,'' Ryan recalls in a separate interview.
``Her back is toward the camera. The actress in Diane is patting my
shoulder and looking at me with such concern and grief.
 &HT;    ``Then the director in Diane whispers in my ear, `OK, are you
done? We've got to move on.'''
 &HT;    Directing counts to Keaton, whose first feature, ``Unstrung
Heroes'' (1996), won strong reviews.
 &HT;    ``I'm at the age as a woman in Hollywood where I know I need
another craft if I want to keep making a living,'' she says
matter-of-factly. `The First Wives Club' saved my professional life
_ that was a big hit. But, let's face it, I'm not 22 anymore. Roles
are not pouring in.''
 &HT;    One recent role cast her opposite Warren Beatty, her former
co-star in ``Reds'' (1981) and former offscreen love interest. But
the long-delayed ``Town &AMP; Country,'' which co-stars Goldie Hawn,
was reportedly a mess from beginning to end.
 &HT;    ```Town &AMP; Country' was, um ... you would ask me about `Town &AMP;
Country,''' Keaton says hesitantly. ``What can I say? Except the
film has been delayed and it has to come out. They've spent too
much money.''
 &HT;    Working with Beatty wasn't a problem, says Keaton, who has also
co-starred with former lovers Al Pacino and Woody Allen years after
their breakups. Nowadays, she adds, she's happily single and
raising her adopted daughter, Dexter.
 &HT;    ``When you're famous it's harder to experience love,'' she says.
``People give you their fantasies about you, and that is something
you can't possibly live up to in real life.''
 &HT;    She isn't bitter, though.
 &HT;    ``The memories of the past are sweet to me now,'' Keaton says
thoughtfully. ``Sometimes I'll sit around and get out the old
photos of my family and my life. I like to document people and take
a look at the past _ it's a way to take a look at what you've lost
and the person who meant so much to you. It's like letting them be
there again for you.
 &HT;    ``Then you don't lose them completely.''
 &HT;    As a young girl growing up in Los Angeles, Keaton recalls being
fascinated by the silver screen.
 &HT;    ``As a kid,'' she says, ``I would watch movies and think, `I'm
so self-conscious and shy, but maybe if I was another person I
wouldn't feel that way.'''
 &HT;    She dropped out of college at 19 and headed for New York, where
she studied acting and got her first break in the original cast of
the rock musical ``Hair'' (1968).
 &HT;    ``I was the only one who didn't take off my clothes at the
end,'' she says, laughing. ``I negotiated to wear a body
stocking.''
 &HT;    That same year Keaton met Allen, who cast her in his play ``Play
It Again, Sam.'' He was 32 and she was 22, and the two fell into an
intense personal and professional relationship.
 &HT;    ``What Woody taught me was to laugh about sex,'' she famously
said of their relationship. ``Not all the time, but once in a
while.''
 &HT;    Keaton won an Oscar as Best Actress for the title role in
Allen's ``Annie Hall'' (1977). The film also triggered a fashion
trend, as women across America started dressing the way Keaton
always had, adopting the floppy hats, baggy pants, oversized vests
and sweaters that once led Larry McMurtry to dub Keaton ``the Queen
of Swap Meets.''
 &HT;    ``I like to express myself through fashion,'' says Keaton, who
still dresses that way, ``but I never thought people would follow
along.''
 &HT;    A string of hit films followed, including ``Looking for Mr.
Goodbar'' (1977), ``Reds,'' ``Crimes of the Heart'' (1986), ``Baby
Boom'' (1987) and ``Father of the Bride'' (1991), as well as a
gradual immersion in directing, starting with music videos,
episodes of television's ``Twin Peaks'' and ``China Beach'' and,
finally, a couple of documentaries.
 &HT;    ``I never think about big financial hits,'' she says. ``I just
try to tell a good story.''
 &HT;    When she wraps, Keaton heads home to a Frank Lloyd Wright house,
located off Sunset Boulevard in the Hollywood hills.
 &HT;    ``My Dad would work really hard all day, and then he'd come home
and turn into a zombie,'' she says. ``That's not me. When I'm home
with my daughter, I say, `OK, enough for today. I will not worry
about movies.'
 &HT;    ``Fourteen hours is enough to devote to my craft,'' she says.
``I'm not going to cut into my daughter's time by having a phone
conversation with my agent where I'm saying, `No, I don't think I'm
right to direct `Gandhi II.'''
 &HT;    But what if it were about Gandhi's three sisters?
 &HT;    Keaton wrinkles her brow.
 &HT;    ``Can I get back to you about that one?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's no wonder that most live television shows employ a warm-up
comedian before the host gets near the audience. You can't expect a
cheerful reception from a bunch of people fresh from 30 minutes
standing in line out in a frigid New York night or jammed into a
cramped anteroom that really is referred to as a ``holding tank.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the host is his own warm-up man. David Letterman meets
his audience prior to taping, for example, but his brief chat
almost gives the impression that an audience should feel privileged
to be in his presence.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Stewart is a different story. As soon as he steps onto ``The
Daily Show'' set, he makes everyone feel at home. For almost 10
minutes he lets the crowd know that he's as happy to see them as
they are to see him.
</P>
<P>
   And Stewart actually is happy to see his audience. After years
of guest-host status on dozens of shows, Stewart took over as host
</P>
<P>
   of Comedy Central's popular program in January 1999, and he
hasn't looked back since. A nightly news-parody program is a long
way from the network talk shows that he was reportedly in line for
on numerous occasions, but it suits the 37-year-old Stewart just
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is perfect for me,'' Stewart says, leaning back into a
chair in his New York office. ``The opportunity to write jokes
about the news is a gift. I have a forum every day on television.
I'm really enjoying this.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, Stewart admits, he found frustration at
every turn. There are those who love the forever-on-the-road life
of a stand-up comic, but he isn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comedy circuit is tough,'' Stewart says. ``You begin to
wonder how many times you can jump in the van and head to Rochester
to play the karaoke club. That was probably the toughest part for
me _ I was looking for a way to know where I was going.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, an MTV talk show seemed to offer that
direction. Paramount bought the show in 1995, but its attempts to
syndicate it came to nought.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman's Worldwide Pants production company then signed
Stewart to a contract, but the only results of that deal were
endless rumors that he would be replacing various current hosts.
The most prevalent one had him replacing Tom Snyder on ``The Late,
Late Show'' _ a position ultimately filled, ironically, by
Stewart's ``Daily Show'' predecessor, Craig Kilborn.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors became so widespread that, when Stewart played
himself on Garry Shandling's ``The Larry Sanders Show,'' the
running gag for the final season focused on Larry's fears that his
bosses were grooming Stewart to take over the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like I was ever being interviewed for these jobs or
sending out resumes,'' the comedian says, laughing. ``I was just
going about my business, and every so often people would say, `Hey,
I hear you're taking over on that show.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny, because the story of what was really going on
was so different.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Stewart says, he tried not to let the rumors get
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what helped most is that my goals are never much
beyond what I'm doing now,'' he says in retrospect. ``This is the
kind of business that can disappoint you on a daily basis if your
needs are so great.''
</P>
<P>
   His unexpected down time allowed Stewart to experiment in film
acting, playing supporting roles in a few 1999 films, including
``The Faculty,'' ``Big Daddy'' and ``Playing By Heart,'' which
offered him his largest role to date.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Stewart has ambitions to become a movie star. In fact,
he says, he feels a bit uncomfortable even discussing it seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of fun to do,'' he says, ``but I recognize the
limitations of what that presents for me. I really have trouble
talking about acting to people, because it's something I don't
truly understand.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Playing By Heart,'' an ensemble film whose illustrious cast
included Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands, Dennis Quaid, Madeleine
Stowe, Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe, Stewart played a
sensitive architect courting a neurotic, romantically scarred woman
played by Gillian Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part for me in that film was the earnestness,''
the comedian says. ``Having to tell someone you love them, eight
times, in front of a bunch of guys standing around holding lights.
Those Teamsters aren't big huggers.''
</P>
<P>
   His film work was interesting and enjoyable, he adds, but it
only made it clearer to him that he wanted to get back into
television _ though not necessarily into the talk-show game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd already done the celebrity-driven thing,'' he says, ``so I
wasn't sure if I wanted to go that route again.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart can pinpoint the exact moment when he realized that he
had to get back on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching Mary Bono during the Clinton impeachment
proceedings,'' Stewart recalls. ``She had just written a book about
Sonny Bono, all of his drug issues, how he died. And she was on the
congressional subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about a travesty,'' he says, rolling his eyes. ``When
they got to her, her comment was, `What do I tell my children?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sitting there thinking, you just wrote a tell-all book
about Hollywood ... What do you tell your children about the
president? How about this: The president was on painkillers and he
skiied into an intern.'''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This made me realize I had the itch,'' he says. ``The book and
movie roles didn't have the pop that I was looking for _ I wanted
to get back in the daily grind.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Stewart's role on ``The Daily Show'' is as an
anti-anchorman. He doesn't simply read the news _ he takes shots at
it and how it's presented. Sometimes his facial expressions and
body language are enough to make his opinion hilariously clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there's a dual role of commentary and satire on the
way the news is disseminated nowadays,'' he says. ``It's a show
about the media to a certain extent, but not explicitly. It's sort
of an implicit tear on the media, but not just the news _ it's just
using the actual structure of a newscast.''
</P>
<P>
   The show benefits from its team of correspondents, with regular
contributors Vance Degeneres and Mo Rocca taking minor news events
and blowing them way out of proportion, almost as tribute to some
of the major networks' newsmagazines.
</P>
<P>
   Those programs are one topic that gets Stewart heated up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pomposity of `Dateline,' `20/20' and the new world of
scare tactics is unbelievable,'' he says, shaking his head. ``News
today functions like entertainment. There is no grander thesis, no
higher purpose anymore, and it's unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's passion for the news may be what makes him so happy
with his current post _ though he typically resists embracing it
wholly, happy or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I've got work, I always think that things are good,'' he
says. ``The way I look at, if I'm not bartending anymore, things
can't be too bad.''

 &HT;    Beloved Big Cat is not alone in recovery
 &HT;    By Carlos Frias
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ With two armed guards at his side, it takes
Andres Galarraga 15 minutes to walk 15 feet, past the throng
stretching to touch his fingertips. Fans hang over the railing
behind home plate, and he is swept into a sea of arms. Those in
front don't hoard him; they pass forward an assortment of items to
be signed _ a new baseball, a torn sheet of notebook paper, an
old-style Braves cap, a scuffed baseball, a faded Yankees cap. He
pauses before signing the latter.
</P>
<P>
   These items won't end up at an auction. They might sit atop a
nightstand or coffee table, cherished by their owners and perhaps
passed down to grandchildren _ a memory of the day Abuela met The
Big Cat.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga signs every item, and as he hands it back, he looks
the owner in the eyes and flashes a wide grin.
</P>
<P>
   University Stadium begins to fill with more than 17,000 fans,
some who arrived more than three hours earlier to buy tickets. When
the announcer cries out ``Numero 41, Andreeeees Galarraaaaaaga!''
cheers cascade through the park and Galarraga's face barely
contains that famous smile.
</P>
<P>
   This is a day for celebration. More than 20 former and current
major-leaguers have come to Caracas to play in a charity softball
game to raise funds for Venezuela's mudslide victims.
</P>
<P>
   But more than that, it is a day to celebrate that Galarraga has
overcome an intruder that threatened their national treasure. That
the tiny scar on his back is all that remains of an illness that
kept him out of baseball for a season.
</P>
<P>
   That he has beaten cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Salsa music and the smell of home-cooked black beans filled the
cool night air as Galarraga, the youngest of five boys and a girl,
watched his sister, Haide, the oldest, dance with his brother,
Orlando, in the back yard of his mother's home.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago this week, Galarraga's aunts, uncles, cousins,
siblings and neighbors gathered in Los Dos Caminos, a suburb of
Caracas, to celebrate Haide's 50th birthday. With a half-empty
plate of shredded beef, black beans and fried plantains in front of
him, Andres swallowed and turned to his mother, Juana, seated next
to him at the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing in my back _ I'm not sure what it is, but it's
really starting to bother me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when are they doing the exam?'' Juana asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 17th. In Atlanta. They say they should know right away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ay, Dios, Andres. I hope it's nothing serious. Call me right
away and tell me what the doctor says.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning of Feb. 17, Juana awoke early and sat alone in her
upstairs den. As she prayed beside a statue of the Virgin of
Coromoto, Venezuela's patron saint, the baby of her family flew
from West Palm Beach to Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Six p.m., no word from her son. Eight p.m. Midnight. Seven a.m.,
Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Her nervous curiosity became concern when Haide called West Palm
Beach. Andres' oldest daughter, Andria, answered the phone and said
that Eneyda, Andres' wife, had taken the first flight to Atlanta
that morning.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, Juana started to cry. ``Something bad must have
happened if Eneyda went to him,'' she said. ``Ay, Nino Jesus!
What's happened?''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 4 p.m., Juana's phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   Eneyda's trembling voice broke the news _ it was cancer. Eneyda
passed the phone to Andres, who prepared his mother for the flurry
of phone calls and news reports that would fill the airways in the
coming hours.
</P>
<P>
   Juana could not speak. So mother and son sat together on the
phone and cried.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga knows what cancer can do. When he was 21, he
watched for five months as pancreatic cancer withered the body of
his 75-year-old father, Francisco, who fought in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Five days short of the 17th anniversary of Francisco Galarraga's
death, Andres had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a
form of cancer, in a vertebra in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That word _ when I heard `cancer,' I thought I was going to
die the next day,'' he said. ``But you know what? I was actually
relieved to hear it was cancer. At least I knew what it was, and
that with medicine and treatments, I could be cured.''
</P>
<P>
   Five months of chemotherapy and one month of radiation treatment
awaited. Intolerable pain and discomfort that would threaten to
break his spirit. But the worst part would come first: telling his
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga decided to say it simply, using the tool he has used
to break down so many barriers: ``I said it smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   With his wife carrying their youngest daughter Andrianna, 1, in
her arms, Galarraga sat across from his oldest, Andria, now 14, and
Katherine, 8, and broke the news, hiding any tears underneath his
smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never mentioned cancer. We called it lymphoma,'' Galarraga
said. ``It's a word they didn't really know, so it didn't sound so
scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, this is going to make me cry. They answered, `You're going
to be OK, Papi. We're going to take care of you.' And they did.
They did, you know, little kid things _ get my slippers, get my
lunch ready _ taking care of me as well as they could.''
</P>
<P>
   With his family by his side, Galarraga began the first of five
chemotherapy treatments. Right away, everyone realized this would
not be easy on him, physically or mentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that first day, I was like, `Oh, my God, how much more
of this can I take?''' he said. Goose bumps covered his arms as he
remembered four days of vomiting and nausea that haunted him after
the treatment. Medication made him retain water, adding nearly 30
pounds to his playing weight of 235 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe what I saw when I looked in the mirror,''
he said. ``I couldn't run. I couldn't lift weights. I couldn't do
anything. Imagine. I gained so much weight.''
</P>
<P>
   His salt-and-pepper hair began falling out, a little at a time
at first, then in clumps. Juana watched as her son brought her
handfuls of his locks, looking for encouragement. In typical
Galarraga fashion, she hid the tears behind a smile and sent him to
get a haircut, where he had the barber shave it to the scalp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say, `That's nothing. Don't worry,''' Juana remembers.
``Then, when he left, I would go upstairs and cry. But we couldn't
let him see us cry. We always showed him a smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga was in the worst shape of his life, physically and
emotionally. For the first time in 20 years, he had gone an entire
season without playing baseball. Especially discomforting was being
away from the game, watching his teammates on satellite television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd watch one or two innings to see how things were going,
then I'd turn it off,'' he said. ``I felt _ I don't know _
uncomfortable not being able to be with them.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep his mind fresh, Galarraga would spend hours outside in
the shade painting, a talent he discovered when he was 8 years old.
The walls of his home in West Palm are filled with his artwork,
mostly of peaceful landscapes and seascapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Painting really helped distract me from everything that was
happening,'' he said. ``I'm no artist or anything, but I would
spend four and five hours a day painting, and it really helped me a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga knew he was making progress. The tumor was shrinking
and the chemotherapy became easier with each session. But the
outside world, especially his fans in Venezuela, clamored to know
more.
</P>
<P>
   To begin to understand the love affair between Venezuela and
Galarraga, picture a stout young boy from impoverished and tattered
Chapellin, about 15 minutes from the heart of Caracas, where too
many homes have only three cinder-block walls and a tin roof.
</P>
<P>
   Like most kids from his neighborhood, his first form of
organized baseball was chapitas, a kind of stickball with a bottle
cap for a ball. Galarraga loved playing so much that his mother
used his siblings and nephews as spies to find out whether Andres
was skipping class to play pickup baseball at nearby Miranda Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would say, `Mama, why do I need school? I'm going to be a
baseball player,''' Juana remembers. ``I said, `That's not how it
goes. First, study. Then, we'll see what you can become.'''
</P>
<P>
   When Andres was 11 and playing with a youth league team from
Chapellin, he hit a grand slam to rally his team from nine runs
behind to a 10-9 win. A photographer from the local paper caught up
with Galarraga as he and his family were heading home, and asked
for a picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `No, Mama. I already changed and I'm tired,''' Juana
remembered. ``I said, `Listen, Andresito, this is important. It'll
just take a minute. Put your jersey back on. Put your cap on, and
let's take that photo. And smile, boy, smile!'''
</P>
<P>
   He forced a grin barely big enough to show his teeth, and the
next morning in Las Ultimas Noticias, The Latest News, was the
first published photo of the smile that has become his trademark.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that day on, he never stopped showing up in the papers,''
said Juana, looking at a large, glossy reprint of the photo. ``And
he never wipes that smile off his face.''
</P>
<P>
   That proved an important lesson for Galarraga, who has
distinguished himself by being gracious and approachable. Fans see
him not as an idol, but as an equal _ a hometown boy made good, who
married a girl who grew up three blocks from him, and whose mother
lives in a humble home, by choice, just 10 minutes from where
Galarraga grew up.
</P>
<P>
   When the world caught wind of his illness, even his family was
stunned by the level of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Mama, she didn't know just how much people loved him until
he got sick,'' said Alfonso Galarraga, the second youngest. ``He
received letters and prayers from everywhere _ Africa, Italy, Spain
_ everywhere. Everybody has been with him every moment; his wife,
Eneyda, all his family, all of Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The phone here never stopped ringing,'' said Haide, Andres'
sister. ``People called us. They stopped us in the streets.
Everyone asking, `Como esta El Gato?'''
</P>
<P>
   Local television aired a documentary of his life, from his
origins in the poor suburbs to his signing of a professional
contract with Montreal, where Expos manager Felipe Alou dubbed him
El Gran Gato for his cat-like reflexes, to becoming the Venezuelan
with the most home runs in the majors. When Venezuela chose its
team of the century, Galarraga received the most votes.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor of Juana's claimed that La Virgen de la Rosa Mystica,
an apparition of the Virgin Mary in Venezuela, had appeared to her
and said Andres would pull through his illness if they prayed for
the Virgin Mary to intercede on his behalf every day until March 8.
Today, Galarraga and his mother have statues of the Virgin Mary in
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Present and former players from around the majors, and from
other sports, called in support. That, Galarraga said, might have
made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suffered because of this thing,'' said Dennis Martinez, a
teammate of Galarraga's in Montreal for six seasons, and with the
Braves in 1998. ``I've known him since he was young. I've seen him
go though his ups and down. I care for him so much. I was one of
the first to call him and give him courage, make him know he has
friends with him.''
</P>
<P>
   His country didn't fail him when he was ill, and Galarraga could
not stand by when his homeland was in peril.
</P>
<P>
   In the second week of December, torrential rains caused
mudslides throughout La Guaira, Caracas' mountainous region,
killing more than 30,000 and leaving tens of thousands injured and
homeless. That same week, doctors checked and the malignancy in
Galarraga's back had disappeared; they cleared him to return to
full workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Just over two months remained before spring training, but rather
than increase a workout regimen that has him within 5 pounds of his
playing weight, Galarraga boarded the first flight from his home in
West Palm Beach when flights to Caracas resumed. On Christmas Eve,
the major day of celebration for Latin American families, Galarraga
visited several hospitals in Caracas, distributing toys donated by
him and the Braves to children injured in the mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, again sacrificing precious workout time, Galarraga
participated in El Juego de la Fraternidad, The Game of
Brotherhood, where he was the main attraction. He received a
standing ovation from fans elated to see their Big Cat again on the
prowl and among them in their time of need.
</P>
<P>
   Watching this display of affection were three native Venezuelans
who might attract their own attention most other times. Cleveland
shortstop Omar Vizquel, who organized the event, former
major-leaguer David Concepcion and Hugo Chavez, the country's
president, were unable to keep from smiling as Venezuela greeted
its favorite son with total fixation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple people recognize me,'' said Braves catcher Eddie
Perez, also a native Venezuelan, ``but here in Caracas, it's Andres
they love.''
</P>
<P>
   University Stadium looked like old Atlanta-Fulton County
Stadium, dotted with the many Braves caps and jerseys in the crowd.
And the mere mention of Galarraga's name elevated the crowd into a
20-second burst of applause.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, when the country's rookie president was introduced,
boos broke out, and voices called for his ouster:``Fuera!'' Thump,
thump. ``Fuera!''
</P>
<P>
   During the game, which was aired on every local television
station, every player pulled Galarraga aside to share good tidings
and their amazement at his recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `I'll be ready to play,''' former major-leaguer
Dave Winfield said. ``I said good, because they need you _ with the
bat, with the glove, with the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see him so strong. He looks so good,'' says Alfonso
Galarraga, who sits in the dugout alongside his brother. ``All the
prayers _ I think that really motivated him. He's done this all on
faith and desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith has done something else; Galarraga now refers to cancer in
past tense, health in the present and baseball in the imminent
future. Thus, a nuance appears in Galarraga's batting routine.
Before stepping into the box, he pauses and crosses himself.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd's cheers of hope and respect ring in his ears
again, the Big Cat feels grateful to be alive and lucky to be
playing the sport an entire country believes he was born to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great physically and mentally, especially mentally,''
Galarraga says. ``I actually feel stronger than when I had the
problem with my back. Baseball's always been my passion, and I
think God has laid his hands so that I can be here today.''

   CLINTON-BOOM (Washington) _ The economy's robust expansion has
largely overlapped with the Clinton era, and the president and his
team have not been shy about claiming their share of credit for the
boom. But by the reckoning of many Republicans, the expansion is
nothing more than an extension of a growth surge that began in the
Reagan administration. This current stretch of good times, however
framed, clearly has many factors behind it. There have been
dizzying advances in computing power. Investors have proven willing
to finance new ideas. Workers have become more productive. The
Federal Reserve has conducted monetary policy with skill and
flexibility. But this is an election year, making it hard to avoid
putting the economy and the longevity of this expansion in a
political context. And to a remarkable degree, voters are being
asked to judge whether they believe this is a Reagan boom or a
Clinton boom. By Richard W. Stevenson.

&HT;     AIR FORCE, FACING RECRUITING SLUMP, WORKS ON A LOG 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Cold War is over. The economy is booming. And
patriotic teen-agers aren't exactly circling Air Force recruiting
centers.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? Try a logo.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force is preparing to adopt its first servicewide symbol
to boost its image and capture its colorful history and traditions.
The leading candidate features stark blue diagonal bands resembling
folded wings, lifted behind a white star.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Michael E. Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff, said the
idea is to get those outside the service to know it better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know who we are and what we do, now and in the future. We
want others to know, associate with and support our Air Force,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The service spent $805,000, hired a consulting firm and listened
to 68 focus groups in a bid to put a face to its name.
</P>
<P>
   Though no decision has been made on the logo, Ryan said he was
``coming to appreciate'' the logo, which ``just has a lot of
meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Branches of the Air Force, among them the Air Combat Command and
the U.S. Air Forces in Europe, have bright, colorful logos well
known to many service members worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   While the service has a seal, it never has had an official
symbol, the kind of identifiable logo such as the Marine Corps'
globe and anchor.
</P>
<P>
   The most identifiable Air Force symbol is the roundel, with a
star on a circular field with three bars on each side, that appears
on aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the roundel nor a similar symbol _ a red circle inside a
white star that was used before and in the early days of World War
II by legendary air commander Gen. H.H. ``Hap'' Arnold _ is
official.
</P>
<P>
   While it is ``very significant, very special to us,'' the Arnold
emblem never was made an official Air Force symbol, said Col. Ron
Rand, the service's public affairs director.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force research showed air personnel often felt more
allegiance to their units than the service itself. Keeping veteran
personnel in uniform and recruiting enough new ones is a crucial
issue for the Air Force, which fell short of its enlistment goal in
1999, the first time in 20 years that had happened.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force also is spending millions on its first paid
advertising campaign, has revamped an Internet site for recruiting
and is giving bonuses to new recruits in hopes of reversing a
recruiting tailspin that has affected every military branch except
the Marines.

 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MICHAEL MECHANIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Jan. 30, 2040: I could hardly believe my eyes.
There was old Bunbury, after all these years, strolling along Fifth
Avenue in Chase Manhattan in the same old Armani top hat and tails
_ he always had been a bit of a fop. But I was glad to see him. It
brought back memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where've you been, old man?'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, here and there,'' he replied. ``I lived with my betrothed
in Starbuckstown for a dozen or so years, but that relationship
didn't end terribly well, you see. So I then landed a situation at
the Netscape division in Nantucket. Net, which, since the
consolidation, has been renamed Netscape-by-the-Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you there still?'' I inquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``They canned me in '21,'' said my old acquaintance. ``The city
was downsized after LosAngeles.Com was annexed by Microsoft South,
and we lost our living cubicles to clear the way for the new
company's Eastern branch. Then, only last year, I moved back to
Jersey Online.''
</P>
<P>
   After my encounter with Bunbury, I began to reflect on the
completeness of our transformation: What they used to call the
``information superhighway'' was no longer distinguishable in any
way from the ordinary highway. The advertising excesses of the late
20th century, once naysayed by curmudgeons and embittered Luddites
coast-to-coast, had finally come to fruition. And, ironically
enough, we now adhere to the old Japanese model in which the
corporation takes care of us, and we take care of the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   It was inevitable. Even when Bunbury and I were lads, the
writing was on the wall, or, as the young ones now say: ``The beta
was ready for prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy began pre-2000, when Half.Com, a company in what used
to be Pennsylvania (and became Sylvania after the light-bulb
manufacturer bought it) decided to get some cheap publicity by
convincing the town of Halfway, Ore., to temporarily change its
name to Half.Com in exchange for a paltry 75 grand and a bunch of
free computers for the elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   But the change soon became permanent, and the trend _ taken a
step further _ caught on like wildfire: Cities small and large
began merging with private corporations in exchange for hefty
infusions of cash to fix potholes, pay cops and save deteriorating
schools and municipal buildings from termites. Soon enough, the
corporations began pushing out elected officials, though they
typically kept a few around for ceremonial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon became Shoesbury, capital Niketown; Mayor Willie Brown
sold San Francisco to the Haas family, which renamed it Levitas;
Washington retained its name merely to avoid paperwork (though the
D.C. now stands for Dot Com) after the capital was purchased by a
coalition of defense contractors _ a purchase that began in the
1980s, but wasn't completed until 2014. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Half.Com marked advertising's first incursion into
public life. In 1999, long before Reebok bought up Stoughton in
Massachusetts, the shoe maker began teaming up with public school
districts in the Pennzoil subsidiary formerly known as Texas. These
``Team Reebok'' schools allowed the company to display ad banners
and logos, and in exchange offered student discounts on shoes and
support for school athletic programs.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of the 1990s, the Coca-Cola Co., which recently
bought Bolivia, and its rival soft drink maker, Pepsico, were
engaged in similar efforts. Each offered millions in financial
incentives, from sales kickbacks to athletic scoreboards to
computer software, in order to lock up exclusive marketing
agreements with hundreds of public school districts and
universities.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, Greenbriar High School in Evans, Ga., sponsored a
``Coke in Education Day,'' to vie for a $10,000 prize the company
offered. Faculty and students staged a day of cola-based
activities: A Coke exec discussed his job in a class setting;
chemistry students measured the cola's sugar content (substantial);
and the entire student body, donning Coca-Cola T-shirts, spelled
out the word ``Coke'' for a school photo. But when one ungrateful
student, Mike Cameron, pulled off his Coke T-shirt to reveal a
Pepsi shirt, school officials were aghast. They suspended him,
naturally.
</P>
<P>
   That was what the old days were like. Such things were actually
considered newsworthy back then. People would complain about the
corporate deals with publishing houses that allowed product names
to figure prominently in elementary-school textbooks, teaching not
only reading and arithmetic, but brand loyalty. And parents used to
fret about fast-food outlets in school cafeterias.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody complains anymore. And why would they? When advertising
finally prevailed, so did we. Just look around: Castro is long
dead. Elian Gonzalez grew up a proud American, with many
possessions. The average Beijing resident now tools around in a
late-model hydrogen-powered Buick. And we have all the things we'll
ever need, at least until new needs are manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   The business world has taught us that we are commercial beings
by nature, and why resist nature?
</P>
<P>
   They showed us how to register our babies at birth as
subsidiaries of ourselves, the parent corporations. We grow up
loving our parent corporations, and later learn to love our
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The corporations take care of us, and we, of them _ unless
somebody is offered a better deal. We are free at last. There is no
longer any need to fear. We are free at last.

<P>
   DALE CITY, Calif. _ The aspirations of 3,800 Cleveland school
children were put on hold last month when a federal judge, Solomon
Oliver, ruled that a Cleveland school-choice program violated the
separation of church and state and was therefore unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's 4-year-old voucher program gives needy families with
children in kindergarten through sixth grade up to $2,500 per year
in tuition vouchers. The money comes from public funds. Most of the
3,543 children enrolled are in religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver said that because nearly all the 56 participating schools
were religion-based, the program had ``the effect of advancing
religion through government-supported religious indoctrination.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver ordered the program closed, but he agreed to let it
continue until an appeal could be heard.
</P>
<P>
   School-choice supporters said they would appeal the decision to
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. And they should, as
Oliver's decision raised more questions than it answered.
</P>
<P>
   One question: If the Cleveland school choice program violates
the separation of church and state, what would Oliver say about the
GI Bill or federal Pell Grants that people use to attend any
accredited college or university?
</P>
<P>
   Oliver's contradictory decision highlights the complexities of
school choice programs where families are given vouchers for state
funds to spend at a school of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   First proposed by economist Milton Friedman after the U.S.
Supreme Court outlawed school segregation in 1954 in Brown vs. the
Board of Education, ``school choice'' was used by white parents to
circumvent Brown and send their children to all-white private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   That practice was ruled unconstitutional in the late 1950s, but
the concept of school choice would forever change education. In
1989 in Milwaukee, African-American activists, parents and
politicians pushed forward a voucher plan. It remains the only
publicly financed voucher program in the nation. It has withstood
legal challenges from the American Civil Liberties Union, teachers'
unions, People for the American Way and the NAACP. The Cleveland
program was modeled after Milwaukee's.
</P>
<P>
   Many, if not most, liberals see taxpayer-financed school choice
as a diabolical plot to destroy the public school system. Political
conservatives, on the other hand, see it as a way to improve public
schools through competition.
</P>
<P>
   The battle points up the failure of the public school system in
urban America. Parents of children locked into these schools are
tired of the array of excuses used to justify failure _ the broken
home theory, charges of racism or the effects of socio-economic
status.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Gallup poll showed that people surveyed favored school
choice 51 to 47 percent. Among African-Americans, support for
school choice is off the charts _ despite opposition from black
leaders (who often send their children to private schools) and the
NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 poll by the Joint Center for Political and Economic
Studies, a Washington think tank, found that 60 percent of blacks
favored school vouchers. Support for a flat-out voucher program is
at 70 percent among young blacks between the ages of 26 and 35.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks in favor of school choice see it as a way to save a
generation of black students now attending public schools with 30
to 40 percent dropout rates and collective grade point averages
below 2.0.
</P>
<P>
   The push for school choice among blacks can be seen in the new
book, ``Not Yet Free at Last,'' by Mikel Holt, the editor of the
Milwaukee Community Journal, a black weekly newspaper. Holt
compares the battle for school choice in Milwaukee and the nation
with the battle to desegregate schools in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   But while the battle to desegregate schools was fought against
Southern segregationists, Holt writes that the battle for school
choice will be fought against liberal special interest groups, such
as People for the American Way and teachers' unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``While condemning school choice, the left offers no real
solutions for the abysmal failure of the public school system and
the harm it has caused millions of minority and poor children,''
writes Holt.
</P>
<P>
   He has a point.
</P>
<P>
   While it isn't perfect, school choice is the only certain
solution that will break up the educational status quo and ensure
that greater educational opportunities are available for the people
who need them most.

&HT;     CENSUS CHIEF FEARS POOR RESPONSE TO POPULATION COUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SHERRY SYLVESTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. Census Director Kenneth Prewitt fears that Americans may be
too busy to participate in the all-important head count this year.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government plans to spend $7 billion on the
population count, including a multimillion-dollar advertising
campaign to encourage people to fill out forms.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt has stressed for months that census information is
confidential and will not be shared with other government agencies,
particularly the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the
Internal Revenue Service. But recently, Prewitt said
confidentiality worries are not the real problem facing the census.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the 35 million households which will not return their
census forms, only about 5 percent are hostile or afraid,'' Prewitt
said. ``The others simply can't be bothered.''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt is calling for a ``great civic moment.'' Wherever he
goes, he urges Americans to fulfill their civic responsibilities by
participating in the census. But for increasingly busy Americans,
the timing of this census may be particularly bad.
</P>
<P>
   Figures released in December from the U.N. International Labor
Organization reveal Americans now are working more than citizens of
any other industrialized nation.
</P>
<P>
   The average American spends nearly 51 hours per week on the job.
That means that after sleeping and commuting time, there are fewer
than 20 hours remaining for what has been called ``leisure'' time,
even though many of those hours also must be earmarked for
housekeeping, laundry and maintenance activities.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a third of college-educated men and 20 percent of
educated women are working more than 50 hours per week.
</P>
<P>
   Data from the National Center for Health Statistics indicate
that 56 percent of Americans feel ``a lot or moderate'' stress, and
a Pennsylvania State University study found people feel so rushed
that almost 50 percent said they would be willing to give up a
day's pay to get a day off work.
</P>
<P>
   Similar research at the Family and Work Institute found 70
percent of all parents feel they do not spend enough time with
their children, and 85 percent of the public, including nonparents,
say they have family responsibilities that they don't have time to
fulfill.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt, who headed the National Opinion Research Center at the
University of Chicago before taking charge of the U.S. Census
Bureau, is aware of the data that show a constant decrease in
public participation because people feel they are too busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data are undeniable on voter participation and the
census,'' Prewitt spokesman David Hoffman said. ``So Dr. Prewitt is
saying to America: `We can do better.' The census is a unique
opportunity for civic responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Kalb, executive director of the Shorenstein Project at
the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University,
which is conducting the Vanishing Voter Project, said what the
Census Bureau is facing is similar to what his program is learning
about ``vanishing voters'' who display little interest in
campaigns, politics or government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't want to be rattled, disturbed or pressured
into thinking about serious global or national issues,'' Kalb said.
``The economy is fine; we're not at war; crime has gone down.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalb said it is not hard to imagine millions of Americans
collectively saying: ``Please Mr. Census Person, get off my back.
I'm not interested in talking with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalb also believes that in addition to being busy, Americans
also have become increasingly hostile to any kind of government
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people have a deep distrust of large
institutions, particularly government,'' Kalb said, noting the
Census Bureau's decision to hire a private advertising firm to
create census advertising is recognition of anti-government
hostility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an attempt to use extra (government) money to
make things seem as if they're not government programs, to package
ideas in ways that suggest they're a nongovernmental approach even
to governmental problems,'' Kalb said.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials are cautiously optimistic, saying they have
closed all the glaring gaps of the 1990 census, including updating
the national mailing list and targeting hard-to-count areas with
door-to-door enumerators.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt recently told the National Press Club that Census 2000
will be a benchmark on the status of civic responsibility, and a
lower response rate will indicate that the downward slide is
continuing. The census, conducted every 10 years, is used as the
basis for congressional districts and federal aid to cities and
states.
</P>
<P>
   But if the response to Census 2000 improves over the 1990 count,
Prewitt believes it will be a sign Americans are starting ``the
21st century by embracing our civic responsibility.''

&HT;     DISCOVERY COULD LEAD TO NEW ASSAULT ON TUBERCULOSIS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CINDY TUMIEL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Forty years ago, doctors and scientists thought
antibiotics would make tuberculosis a disease of the past. Yet TB
remains a potent killer, responsible for an estimated 3 million
deaths worldwide each year.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, drug-resistant strains of the bacteria
remain serious public health threats in South Texas and other
border areas.
</P>
<P>
   But tuberculosis researchers in Texas have unraveled the secrets
of a key protein that helps the bacteria to thrive and to carry on
their destructive work in the lungs. Tuberculosis most often
attacks the lungs, leading to violent coughing and hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   The protein discovery could lead to new treatments, as well as
vaccines to protect people.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting in the scientific journal Nature Structural Biology,
James Sacchettini and his colleagues at Texas A&AMP;M University
defined the three-dimensional structure of the protein, called
antigen 85c.
</P>
<P>
   The protein is an enzyme that performs a major function in
building and maintaining the cell wall of the tuberculosis
bacteria, a protective coating that can prevent some antibiotics
from entering.
</P>
<P>
   It also plays a role in tricking healthy cells into letting the
bacteria invade them.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge of the molecular structure of antigen 85 will help
scientists interfere with the bacterial life cycle, Sacchettini
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we know about its molecular structure, we can design
drugs that bind to this particular protein and inhibit its ability
to function to keep the bacteria alive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The protein helps the bacteria enter healthy cells called
macrophages, which normally kill invading bacteria, Sacchettini
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new knowledge about antigen 85c possibly could lead to
treatments interfering with that process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, now that we know the molecular structure, we can design
a really good antigen. This would allow us to vaccinate people so
their immune system would be ready for invasion by the bacteria,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Cox, director of clinical research at the Texas Center
for Infectious Diseases in San Antonio, said the A&AMP;M researchers
have made a ``potentially major breakthrough'' in the search for
much-needed new treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The overall number of tuberculosis cases is down _ the rate of
cases declined 10 percent in Texas, and 8 percent nationwide,
between 1997 and 1998. But the number of drug-resistant infections
is growing, Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly the San Antonio State Chest Hospital, the Center for
Infectious Diseases is one of the few remaining places in Texas
where tuberculosis patients can get long-term care beyond their
initial hospital stay.
</P>
<P>
   At any given time, the center houses 50 to 60 patients from
across the state, who generally stay 115 to 145 days, said James
Elkins, the facility's director.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disease takes a long time to be killed from the body,
regardless of antibiotic treatment,'' Elkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberculosis remains a rampant killer in developing nations,
spurred on both by drug-resistant strains and the acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization estimates that one-third of the
world's population is infected with tuberculosis bacteria, and
about 200 million each year will develop an active infection.

   VIENNA _ A prominent Austrian journalist who is fiercely
critical of the country's far-right leader Jorg Haider has become
one of the first victims of the new political realities sweeping
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Marschall 47, a journalist at the leading independent
regional paper Oberosterreichische Nachrichten, was given his
notice on Friday, the day that the new Austrian government was
sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   He told The Independent that the editor and the paper's owner
said that ``my commentaries and style were not liked'' and ``due to
the new political situation I could no longer be afforded.''
</P>
<P>
   The editor Hans Koppl said that there had been 500 subscription
cancellations and ``massive expressions of displeasure'' with
Marschall's columns. ``A paper lives from its readers and their
satisfaction. Marschall's style was insulting for many of them...
Something has to be done about it. I admit that it doesn't look
very good.''
</P>
<P>
   SOS-Mitmensch, the Austrian human rights group that organized
the first demonstrations against the new government, called
Marschall's case ``the first breach of the preamble to the
government's program.''
</P>
<P>
   The preamble was the declaration that the new government would
respect human rights, which President Thomas Klestil forced Jorg
Haider and Wolfgang Schussel to sign before they were sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   SOS-Mitmensch called for Marschall's reinstatement, saying ``the
freedom of press and freedom of expression is a human right.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the demonstrations in the capital grew placid and
were petering out Sunday. Austrians have accepted that a government
including Haider's Freedom Party is here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the first consequences of the country's pariah status
are making themselves felt. An international congress of orthodox
rabbis, planned to take place in March in Vienna, will now be held
in the Slovak capital Bratislava instead.
</P>
<P>
   The famous Opera Ball, the highlight of the social season, has
also been dealt a crippling blow. This was the year when it went in
search of its old-world charm and ditched the fading Hollywood
stars, usually paid handsomely to grace the event.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the international favor, Portugal's President Jorge
Sampaio was to be guest of honor on March 2. But he has cancelled _
EU state visits are off.
</P>
<P>
   This is just a foretaste of things to come, as Austrians
themselves realize. A poll in Sunday's Format magazine finds that
two thirds of Austrians expect their country's economy to be
damaged by the political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   The man responsible for Austria's sudden image problem is not
helping. Trying to be conciliatory Sunday, Haider promised in the
same breath to compensate Holocaust survivors, Sudeten Germans and
Austrian prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Despite everything he has said and been forced to retract, he
still seems to think that Jews and Austrian soldiers in the
Wehrmacht were victims of equal rank.
</P>
<P>
   And he is still playing his divisive politics, looking for
scapegoats. His latest targets are the outgoing Social Democrat
Chancellor, Viktor Klima and President Klestil, whom he accused of
organizing the EU sanctions in an attempt to keep his party out of
power.
</P>
<P>
   He threatened them with parliamentary inquiry for ``political
high treason,'' Sunday if evidence emerged that either had
orchestrated the EU campaign to stop his party from entering
power. &QL;

   VIENNA _ Austria's head of state has been accused of
overstepping his authority by trying to thwart Jorg Haider's rise
to power.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, President Thomas Klestil should have long ago asked
the second biggest party _ Haider's _ to form a government when it
became clear that the marriage between the Social Democrats and the
conservative People's Party was on the rocks. Or, failing that, he
should have called new elections.
</P>
<P>
   President Klestil did neither, and for sound historical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Just over 100 years ago, another head of state did resort to
dictatorial powers to keep a democratically elected demagogue out
of office. But new elections merely augmented the politician's
support, and eventually the state had to yield to the new force,
with tragic consequences for mankind.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels with today's developments are uncanny.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1895. In the twilight of the Austro-Hungarian
Empire, a man named Karl Lueger was campaigning for the post of
Vienna Mayor. Lueger, son of a janitor, had started off as a
liberal, but made little headway. Then he discovered that preaching
hatred against Jews got you a lot more votes than advocating free
trade, and his future was made.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Franz Joseph, hardly a liberal himself, was disgusted.
``Anti-Semitism is a disease that has spread to the highest
circles, and the agitation is unbelievable,'' the Kaiser wrote to
his wife Sissi.
</P>
<P>
   Franz Joseph instructed his government to dissolve any gathering
of anti-Semites. Lueger won the Vienna elections in June 1895, but
fell short of an outright majority. That came three months later in
a re-run.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser was faced with a dilemma. He was terrified of
Lueger's populism but keeping Lueger out would only boost his
support.
</P>
<P>
   After much imperial dithering, Franz Joseph vetoed Lueger,
dissolved the council and replaced it with an imperial commission.
The people of Vienna rose as one, and were prevented from storming
the Hofburg only by a bloody intervention of the police.
</P>
<P>
   New elections were held in April the following year, giving
Lueger an increased majority. The Kaiser began to yield, allowing a
Lueger ally named Joseph Strobach to take office. A year later, in
April 1897, Lueger triumphed in elections for the fourth time, and
Franz Joseph no longer had the strength to say no.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Lueger was to run Vienna for the ensuing 13 years. There
was no outright persecution of Jews during his reign, only petty
harassments.
</P>
<P>
   He had made anti-Semitism respectable, and created an
intellectual climate in which hatred of foreigners was becoming the
norm.
</P>
<P>
   One individual deeply influenced by his formative years in
Luegner's Vienna was a young dilettante painter who had washed up
impoverished on the city's streets. His name was Adolf Hitler. &QL;

<P>
   VUKOVAR _ They voted amidst the rubble of Vukovar Monday,
choosing a new Croatian president to lead them out of the ruins of
war that reduced this once picturesque Danube city to a pile of
shell-scarred wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The second round of the presidential election is a run-off
between Stipe Mesic, a former president of Federal Yugoslavia, and
his center-left political ally, Drazen Budisa, of the Social
Liberal party, which is currently in coalition government with the
Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning stopped on Saturday afternoon but late-night opinion
polls put Budisa slightly ahead of Mesic.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is more one of style than substance, with the
dry, uncharismatic former librarian Budisa versus the folksy,
joke-cracking Mesic.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates emphasize their commitment to bringing Croatia
out of the international isolation into which it fell during the
Tudjman era, and accelerating as rapidly as possible Croatia's
entry into both NATO and the EU.
</P>
<P>
   Among the younger generation Budisa was seen as offering hope
for a new era in Europe, while Mesic was too redolent of the old
system, having had a long political career in the former
Yugoslavia, as well as independent Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will vote for Budisa, because he offers young people hope
for a better future, with a Croatia that is going towards Europe.
He is a new style of politician, but Mesic is from the old school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Budisa's program is better, because he will bring jobs for
young people and orientate us towards the west,'' said Ognjen
Plavsic, 25, a student.
</P>
<P>
   But whoever is Croatia's next president, little will change for
this war-ravaged city in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The scars of war are everywhere. The bumpy roads leading into
Vukovar are pockmarked with shrapnel marks and potholed by incoming
shellfire.
</P>
<P>
   Once picturesque pink and yellow Hapsburg era buildings have
collapsed inwards, beams and shattered walls piled on top of each
other, while grass and moss grows on top.
</P>
<P>
   This is a ghost town. Only the battered facades with the
remnants of the once ornate plasterwork on these 19th-century
buildings bear silent witness to the memory of another Vukovar that
was a jewel on the Danube, where Serbs, Croats and Hungarians lived
together in peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Pounded for months by Serb guns during the Croatian war of
independence in 1991, Vukovar became known as Croatia's Stalingrad
for its steadfast resistance against the Yugoslav army and their
paramilitary allies.
</P>
<P>
   When the city fell in the winter of that year, many of the
surviving inhabitants were murdered en masse.
</P>
<P>
   Others accused the former President Franjo Tudjman of
sacrificing the city to create a rallying point for his nascent
nation. Either way the city remains neglected.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Vukovar, who note that Serbs now outnumber the city's
Croat population by more than 2-1, suggest the situation could be
even more complicated. Of the city's original population of 84,000,
only 18,000 have returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of investment in areas of return is part of a
continuation of ethnic cleansing,'' said local Serb leader Milorad
Pupovac. ``Some people believe it is better to have a ghost city or
town than when they are ethnically mixed.''
</P>
<P>
   The new geography of the Balkans also hurts the city. While
Vukovar was centrally located in former Yugoslavia, it is now
situated close to Serbia, an international pariah state.
</P>
<P>
   Vukovar's prime location on the Danube is also of little use
because wreckage from allied attacks on Serbia during the 78-day
NATO bombardment over Kosovo has blocked virtually all river
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter of 1991, a few days after Vukovar fell to Serb
forces, the dull thud of nearby shellfire still echoed across the
heaps of blackened rubble. The scene resembled present-day Grozny.
The streets were filled with Yugoslav soldiers and Serb
paramilitaries, pumped up on the adrenaline of battle.
</P>
<P>
   Now Vukovar has returned to Croatia, and many wonder why so many
lives were ended and to what end. The city has begun to reawaken:
there is a market, shops and bars are open. But an almost tangible
bitterness runs through its once pretty streets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some have returned to try and rebuild their lives in the
wreckage of their hometown.

   VUKOVAR _ They voted amidst the rubble of Vukovar Monday,
choosing a new Croatian president to lead them out of the ruins of
war that reduced this once picturesque Danube city to a pile of
shell-scarred wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The second round of the presidential election is a run-off
between Stipe Mesic, a former president of Federal Yugoslavia, and
his center-left political ally, Drazen Budisa, of the Social
Liberal party, which is currently in coalition government with the
Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning stopped on Saturday afternoon but late-night opinion
polls put Budisa slightly ahead of Mesic.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is more one of style than substance, with the
dry, uncharismatic former librarian Budisa versus the folksy,
joke-cracking Mesic.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates emphasize their commitment to bringing Croatia
out of the international isolation into which it fell during the
Tudjman era, and accelerating as rapidly as possible Croatia's
entry into both NATO and the EU.
</P>
<P>
   Among the younger generation Budisa was seen as offering hope
for a new era in Europe, while Mesic was too redolent of the old
system, having had a long political career in the former
Yugoslavia, as well as independent Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will vote for Budisa, because he offers young people hope
for a better future, with a Croatia that is going towards Europe.
He is a new style of politician, but Mesic is from the old school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Budisa's program is better, because he will bring jobs for
young people and orientate us towards the west,'' said Ognjen
Plavsic, 25, a student.
</P>
<P>
   But whoever is Croatia's next president, little will change for
this war-ravaged city in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The scars of war are everywhere. The bumpy roads leading into
Vukovar are pockmarked with shrapnel marks and potholed by incoming
shellfire.
</P>
<P>
   Once picturesque pink and yellow Hapsburg era buildings have
collapsed inwards, beams and shattered walls piled on top of each
other, while grass and moss grows on top.
</P>
<P>
   This is a ghost town. Only the battered facades with the
remnants of the once ornate plasterwork on these 19th-century
buildings bear silent witness to the memory of another Vukovar that
was a jewel on the Danube, where Serbs, Croats and Hungarians lived
together in peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Pounded for months by Serb guns during the Croatian war of
independence in 1991, Vukovar became known as Croatia's Stalingrad
for its steadfast resistance against the Yugoslav army and their
paramilitary allies.
</P>
<P>
   When the city fell in the winter of that year, many of the
surviving inhabitants were murdered en masse.
</P>
<P>
   Others accused the former President Franjo Tudjman of
sacrificing the city to create a rallying point for his nascent
nation. Either way the city remains neglected.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Vukovar, who note that Serbs now outnumber the city's
Croat population by more than 2-1, suggest the situation could be
even more complicated. Of the city's original population of 84,000,
only 18,000 have returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of investment in areas of return is part of a
continuation of ethnic cleansing,'' said local Serb leader Milorad
Pupovac. ``Some people believe it is better to have a ghost city or
town than when they are ethnically mixed.''
</P>
<P>
   The new geography of the Balkans also hurts the city. While
Vukovar was centrally located in former Yugoslavia, it is now
situated close to Serbia, an international pariah state.
</P>
<P>
   Vukovar's prime location on the Danube is also of little use
because wreckage from allied attacks on Serbia during the 78-day
NATO bombardment over Kosovo has blocked virtually all river
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter of 1991, a few days after Vukovar fell to Serb
forces, the dull thud of nearby shellfire still echoed across the
heaps of blackened rubble. The scene resembled present-day Grozny.
The streets were filled with Yugoslav soldiers and Serb
paramilitaries, pumped up on the adrenaline of battle.
</P>
<P>
   Now Vukovar has returned to Croatia, and many wonder why so many
lives were ended and to what end. The city has begun to reawaken:
there is a market, shops and bars are open. But an almost tangible
bitterness runs through its once pretty streets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some have returned to try and rebuild their lives in the
wreckage of their hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrible at first when we came back to see the
destruction, especially when it is your hometown, although we had
an idea what to expect from the television pictures,'' said
beautician Darija Matkovic, 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not voting because although the situation is bad in
Croatia, whoever wins it will be better in the future.'' &QL;

   THE HAGUE _ Hans Brinker must be turning in his grave. For the
Dutch are beginning to turn their backs on the celebrated little
boy who saved their forefathers by sticking his finger in a dike.
</P>
<P>
   The government is drawing up plans deliberately to break some of
the country's famous sea defenses to let water on to the land. It
should be ready to implement the scheme _ which strikes deep into
the national psyche _ later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the plan is to save the most densely populated parts
of the country from the rising waters by sacrificing relatively
unimportant farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Amid huge controversy, the government is locked in delicate
negotiations with local authorities about which areas should be
surrendered to the flood.
</P>
<P>
   When these are complete specially selected areas will be set
aside to be inundated when the waters rise and new housing will be
banned on vulnerable land.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management
told the Independent on Sunday that the question was not whether
the plan would be implemented but how.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand years ago all of what is now the Netherlands was
above sea level. But now half of the country and most of its people
would be drowned if its flood barriers were all to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The land has long been sinking as the Dutch have pumped out
underground reservoirs, lowering the water table and digging it up
for peat. Meanwhile the seas are rising faster than ever, as a
result of global warning, and wetter weather is increasingly
filling rivers to bursting point.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now the Dutch have responded by building ever higher
dikes. But they have had some narrow escapes all the same. In 1995
250,000 people had to leave their homes, in the biggest evacuation
since the Second World War, when rivers almost burst their banks.
</P>
<P>
   And 1998 was the wettest year on record, bringing another
desperately close call.
</P>
<P>
   This year the country will complete a $1.6 billion crash program
of strengthening 465 miles of dikes but a report by four government
ministries has concluded that this process will not work in the
long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature does not let itself so easily be shackled,'' the report
says. ``There is a growing realization that this approach is
subject to a law of diminishing returns. Procrastination is no
longer an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to have painted ourselves into a corner; the cost of
water management just keeps rising and flooding is expected to
become more common. We will have to decide where the high cost of
intensive water management can be justified and where not. The
longer we delay the harder the choices will become.''
</P>
<P>
   And Monique de Vries, the secretary of state for water policy,
told a symposium last year: ``Despite all our work, it remains
difficult to keep our heads above water. We must reserve space now
for extreme conditions. It is a calculated sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Henk Zomerdijk, mayor of the villages of Echteld and Ochten in
the central Netherlands which narrowly escaped disaster in 1985,
adds: ``We just can't go on endlessly building dikes higher and
higher. The higher they are the more danger there is if they
break.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to computers, I must admit I have a love-hate
relationship. I love the things they pretend to be able to do, but
I hate the inevitable problems that go with it. I am also a bit of
a Luddite when it comes to buying them.
</P>
<P>
   Computers have that irritating ability to evolve to a more
advanced stage the second after you spend your life savings on one.
In fact, I am so put off by knowing that whatever I buy will be
out-of-date by the time you get it unwrapped that it seems useless
replacing the one you have.
</P>
<P>
   Let me explain. My present computer is a wonderful little Compaq
laptop I won as a prize some seven years ago. In computer terms, it
is about as advanced as a cretaceous dinosaur, running on a 386
chip with Windows 3.1 on a monochrome screen.
</P>
<P>
   It is so ancient that whenever my Internet service provider asks
me what I am running their software on, I immediately change the
topic of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   If only computers would stop evolving, then everything would be
fine. I would be perfectly happy with my miserable little screen (a
veritable Imax compared with the one that came with my previous
computer _ a steam-age ``portable'' Osbourne, which was about as
portable as a suitcase full of bricks).
</P>
<P>
   I would be perfectly happy with my limited ability to send
e-mail and surf the Web if only I wasn't made constantly aware of
just how antediluvian it has become.
</P>
<P>
   I thought I would be eternally satisfied with a bit of
word-processing, communications and limited surfing. But along
comes the Pentium chip, color screens, CD-Roms, DVDs, Windows 95
and 98 and other evolving life-forms in the computer kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, my neat little Compaq is an embarrassment, something
which should be confined to an attic room like a mentally deficient
relative.
</P>
<P>
   The final straw came when my machine was hit by the millennium
bug. The date flipped to January 1980. The time had come, I
thought, to accept the onslaught of the 21st century and to find
myself a new laptop, or rather notebook as they now seem to be
called.
</P>
<P>
   There was little doubt that it had to be a notebook. A desktop
PC is just too static. For me, moving around the house to write and
think is just as important as being able to move a computer between
office and work.
</P>
<P>
   Scanning the sad pages of the computer press made me realize
just how difficult that decision was going to be. The variety of
choice is stupendous. Of course there are the usual names, IBM,
Compaq, Toshiba and the Macs, but which one should I go for?
</P>
<P>
   My eye settled lazily on a magazine review of a selection of
notebooks running at a speed of 400Mhz with a Pentium II. It was
billed as about the fastest around but with an ominous warning that
something even faster _ a mobile Pentium III for notebooks _ was
already in production.
</P>
<P>
   Should I wait a few more months, I thought? (No need, they are
now on sale.) I recognized few of the manufacturers being reviewed,
with names such as Elonex, Aci, and Rock, but find myself attracted
to the winning machine, the Hi-Grade UltiNote.
</P>
<P>
   According to the magazine it fulfills most of the requirements
you can expect of a notebook in its price range. ``Sleek, slim and
silver,'' it says, ``Hi-grade's UltiNote is undoubtedly the most
portable of the notebooks we looked at, and arguably one of the
most attractive.'' It is also one of the most solid, apparently
discerned by the lack of ``flexing'' in the space between keyboard
and screen.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot tell a lie: a trial run on the UltiNote puts my Compaq
to shame. The screen is large and clear. It is also very fast.
Surfing is like a powerboat ride compared with a slow row around
the duck pond on my old laptop.
</P>
<P>
   The machine is slim and lightweight, with an interchangeable
slot for either a floppy disc drive, CD-Rom or DVD drive. But an
extra box no bigger than a video with two other drives can be used
for expansion, without adding to the weight or size of the machine
itself. And its silver casing makes it perfectly presentable for
any public performance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a nagging doubt in my mind that my new machine
might somehow become as redundant as a Yorkshire coal miner. A
little voice is telling me to wait another six months or year, when
a faster, more capacious machine will come on to the market for the
same price.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the thorny issue of who are Hi-Grade Computers
anyway? Before opening this magazine, I'd never heard of them.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out they have been operating for more than a decade and
are one of the market leaders _ so much for my knowledge of the
computer industry _ and the machine comes with the standard year's
guarantee and technical support.
</P>
<P>
   My fingers are itching. The UltiNote AS8300 beckons me like a
stricken mariner to a siren. Will this sleek keyboard allow me to
surf the waves like a true Nethead, or am I going to end up
shipwrecked on a hardware hulk?
</P>
<P>
   No, the time has come. I've got to reach for my checkbook and
finally enter the 21st century. &QL;

<P>
   When it comes to computers, I must admit I have a love-hate
relationship. I love the things they pretend to be able to do, but
I hate the inevitable problems that go with it. I am also a bit of
a Luddite when it comes to buying them.
</P>
<P>
   Computers have that irritating ability to evolve to a more
advanced stage the second after you spend your life savings on one.
In fact, I am so put off by knowing that whatever I buy will be
out-of-date by the time you get it unwrapped that it seems useless
replacing the one you have.
</P>
<P>
   Let me explain. My present computer is a wonderful little Compaq
laptop I won as a prize some seven years ago. In computer terms, it
is about as advanced as a cretaceous dinosaur, running on a 386
chip with Windows 3.1 on a monochrome screen.
</P>
<P>
   It is so ancient that whenever my Internet service provider asks
me what I am running their software on, I immediately change the
topic of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   If only computers would stop evolving, then everything would be
fine. I would be perfectly happy with my miserable little screen (a
veritable Imax compared with the one that came with my previous
computer _ a steam-age ``portable'' Osbourne, which was about as
portable as a suitcase full of bricks).
</P>
<P>
   I would be perfectly happy with my limited ability to send
e-mail and surf the Web if only I wasn't made constantly aware of
just how antediluvian it has become.
</P>
<P>
   I thought I would be eternally satisfied with a bit of
word-processing, communications and limited surfing. But along
comes the Pentium chip, color screens, CD-Roms, DVDs, Windows 95
and 98 and other evolving life-forms in the computer kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, my neat little Compaq is an embarrassment, something
which should be confined to an attic room like a mentally deficient
relative.
</P>
<P>
   The final straw came when my machine was hit by the millennium
bug. The date flipped to January 1980. The time had come, I
thought, to accept the onslaught of the 21st century and to find
myself a new laptop, or rather notebook as they now seem to be
called.
</P>
<P>
   There was little doubt that it had to be a notebook. A desktop
PC is just too static. For me, moving around the house to write and
think is just as important as being able to move a computer between
office and work.
</P>
<P>
   Scanning the sad pages of the computer press made me realize
just how difficult that decision was going to be. The variety of
choice is stupendous. Of course there are the usual names, IBM,
Compaq, Toshiba and the Macs, but which one should I go for?
</P>
<P>
   My eye settled lazily on a magazine review of a selection of
notebooks running at a speed of 400Mhz with a Pentium II. It was
billed as about the fastest around but with an ominous warning that
something even faster _ a mobile Pentium III for notebooks _ was
already in production.
</P>
<P>
   Should I wait a few more months, I thought? (No need, they are
now on sale.) I recognized few of the manufacturers being reviewed,
with names such as Elonex, Aci, and Rock, but find myself attracted
to the winning machine, the Hi-Grade UltiNote.
</P>
<P>
   According to the magazine it fulfills most of the requirements
you can expect of a notebook in its price range. ``Sleek, slim and
silver,'' it says, ``Hi-grade's UltiNote is undoubtedly the most
portable of the notebooks we looked at, and arguably one of the
most attractive.'' It is also one of the most solid, apparently
discerned by the lack of ``flexing'' in the space between keyboard
and screen.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot tell a lie: a trial run on the UltiNote puts my Compaq
to shame. The screen is large and clear. It is also very fast.
Surfing is like a powerboat ride compared with a slow row around
the duck pond on my old laptop.
</P>
<P>
   The machine is slim and lightweight, with an interchangeable
slot for either a floppy disc drive, CD-Rom or DVD drive. But an
extra box no bigger than a video with two other drives can be used
for expansion, without adding to the weight or size of the machine
itself. And its silver casing makes it perfectly presentable for
any public performance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a nagging doubt in my mind that my new machine
might somehow become as redundant as a Yorkshire coal miner. A
little voice is telling me to wait another six months or year, when
a faster, more capacious machine will come on to the market for the
same price.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the thorny issue of who are Hi-Grade Computers
anyway? Before opening this magazine, I'd never heard of them.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out they have been operating for more than a decade and
are one of the market leaders _ so much for my knowledge of the
computer industry _ and the machine comes with the standard year's
guarantee and technical support.
</P>
<P>
   My fingers are itching. The UltiNote AS8300 beckons me like a
stricken mariner to a siren. Will this sleek keyboard allow me to
surf the waves like a true Nethead, or am I going to end up
shipwrecked on a hardware hulk?
</P>
<P>
   No, the time has come. I've got to reach for my checkbook and
finally enter the 21st century. &QL;

 &HT;    STEVE AND COKIE ROBERTS, A COUPLE OF AUTHORS
 &HT;    Moving in (e) entertainment and (w) Washington categories for
release Sunday, Feb. 13.
 &HT;    By BOB DART

<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ It's a winter morning and a foot of snow covers
the back yard where Cokie Boggs and Steve Roberts were married on a
warm September evening in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   President Lyndon Baines Johnson was among the 1,500 wedding
guests. A White House doctor used his tiny ear light to find
Steve's wedding band after the 4-year-old ring bearer dropped it in
the grass. The ceremony took place behind the sprawling suburban
home where Cokie grew up as the daughter of House Majority Leader
Hale Boggs, a Louisiana Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Cokie and Steve Roberts still live in that house. Their
daughter, Rebecca, was married in the same back yard. In the
springs and summers, Steve tends the vegetable garden first tilled
by his father-in-law nearly half a century ago. For years, Steve's
parents timed their drives from Florida to New Jersey to coincide
with the Seders that their Catholic daughter-in-law prepared for
Passover in this house.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the seasons of a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, we've lived for better, not worse; richer, not poorer;
in health, not sickness,'' concludes Cokie. ``Still, after 33
years, we can't anticipate what will happen from this day
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From This Day Forward,'' a phrase from traditional wedding
vows, is the title of a new book by the journalist couple. She is a
news analyst and anchor for ABC-TV and National Public Radio. He
was a New York Times correspondent for 25 years and is now a
commentator on CNN and public television while also teaching about
the media and public affairs at George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   The book chronicles their life together, from their meeting when
he was at Harvard and she was at Wellesley to their latest family
holiday welcoming the new millennium in Rome with her mother, Lindy
Boggs, the U.S. ambassador to the Vatican. It's a lively story of
the very mixed marriage of a Catholic woman from New Orleans to a
Jewish man from New Jersey. Fittingly, publisher William Morrow has
set a publication date of Valentine's Day for the 351-page volume.
</P>
<P>
   But the authors stress that they haven't composed a guide to
marital bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to set ourselves up as anything here. That is
truly asking for it,'' said Cokie, 56. ``That's why I feel very
strongly that we're just telling stories here, folks. We're not
saying 'how to,' because that is a recipe for disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not sermons. We're not preaching even the gospel of
marriage, although we say in the book we're very much partisans of
marriage for us and for most people,'' said Steve, 57. ``But we
also know that not every marriage is made in heaven. We also know
that marriage is not for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   This conversation is taking place in the Robertses' den over
cups of New Orleans-style coffee with chickory. Each half of the
couple has a lot to say. Sometimes they take turns talking.
Sometimes they interrupt each other. Sometimes they finish each
other's sentences. That's how much of the book goes, too. They told
their stories to Colleen Connors, a former student of Steve's, who
prodded them with questions when needed. The tales were transcribed
and edited.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't write about your experiences in the relationship in
each other's voice,'' said Cokie. ``We realized that the only way
you could do it is in dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   They worried that writing a book about their marriage might
jeopardize the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We very consciously said when we started this project that if
it became an issue between us, we'd drop the project,'' explained
Steve. ``The marriage is more important than the book.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   They dispute what she was wearing when they met. He recalls her
in charcoal-gray Bermuda shorts. She denies ever owning such
attire. They agree that he refused her request to stop for a snack
at Eddie Leonard's Sandwich Stop while driving to the Hay Adams
Hotel after their wedding reception.
</P>
<P>
   Steve was working for the Times and they were living in New York
a couple of years later when their son, Lee, was born. Shortly
thereafter, they moved to a mountaintop in Malibu and Steve covered
the West Coast for the Times. Their daughter, nicknamed Becca, was
born was born during their five years in California. Steve traveled
a lot. Cokie worked part-time as a TV producer but focused mostly
on motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Then the New York Times sent Steve to Greece. The family lived
in a suburb of Athens. Again Steve was frequently on the road and
Cokie had the primary responsibility for daily child-rearing.
However, during a Turkish invasion of nearby Cyprus, she gained
notice in media circles for radio reports she filed for CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   At home, they schooled their children in the heritage of dual
faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in that part of the world often reminded us of how
Jewish and Christian traditions are so intertwined,'' Steve writes
in the book. ``That made it easier to raise the kids in both
religions and celebrate everything!''
</P>
<P>
   In late 1977, they returned to Washington. Five years earlier,
Cokie's father had died in a plane crash in Alaska. Her mother,
Lindy, had been elected to represent his Louisiana district in
Congress. Now Steve and Cokie and their children moved back into
the house Cokie had first moved into at the age of 8. Not long
afterward, Mrs. Boggs moved into an apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Although they had eaten grits in California and Greece, the
Robertses' kids received a renewed dose of their Southern heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cokie's parents served in Congress for a combined total of 50
years,'' said Steve. ``It wasn't just that just they were from the
South. They represented the South.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being from New Orleans is almost like an ethnicity,''
explained Cokie. ``It really is a particular thing. It's the people
and the food and our music and you do feel a sense of kinship
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple also found that living in Washington was much more
expensive than living in Greece. They needed two incomes. So while
Steve wrote for the New York Times, Cokie reported for the National
Public Radio programs ``Morning Edition'' and ``All Things
Considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Their children grew up and left home and married. Their careers
took new paths. Steve left the Times, wrote a column for U.S. News
and World Report, then became a professor at George Washington
University. He still appears regularly on CNN's ``Late Edition''
and public television's ``Washington Week in Review.'' Meanwhile,
Cokie became co-anchor of the ABC Sunday program ``This Week With
Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts.''
</P>
<P>
   The transition caused some strains, the couple recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I very quickly decided that the worst thing I could do was
let this become an issue between us, a competition,'' said Steve.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that he discovered a new deep satisfaction in
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, the fact that Cokie was so successful made that
possible,'' he said. ``In some ways, it was liberating. If I was no
longer the main source of income, that freed me to spend time on an
enterprise'' where salary is not the chief reward.
</P>
<P>
   The new focus on career also helped Cokie adjust to her children
leaving home. ``My first definition of self had been as a mother
for 20 years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they agree, their story together has turned out pretty
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been incredibly blessed,'' Cokie writes.

   In theory, anyone can grow up to be president. In practice, the
next president is going to be a graduate of Harvard, Yale,
Princeton or the Naval Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are he will also be a graduate of either St. Albans
School or Phillips Academy Andover. He will be either the son of a
senator, the son of a president and grandson of a senator, the son
and grandson of an admiral, or -- the humblest background and
longest shot in the group -- the son of a Midwestern banker.
</P>
<P>
   Given the small slice of the population these privileged
backgrounds represent, we have here a spectacular breakdown in the
law of averages. Either that or an interesting perspective on
American society.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, you don't have to be an aristo to become president.
For one thing, George W. Bush is the only full blue blood in the
lot. For another, poor white trash defeated Andover-and-Yale Sr.
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But even in supposedly class-bound Britain it would be
considered shocking if the two politicians battling for the top job
both had attended hoity private schools.
</P>
<P>
   For decades now we've been hearing about the decline or death of
the Protestant Establishment (or the Episcopacy or the WASP
Ascendancy or just the Upper Class). In fact, in America we're not
supposed to have had an inherited class system. Even left-wing
critiques of power in American society tend to emphasize the role
of money, not bloodlines.
</P>

   What is supposed to have replaced the Protestant Establishment
is something called meritocracy. Enthusiasts celebrate meritocracy
as the perfect human-resources policy for democracy and capitalism:
a system in which everyone has equal opportunity to thrive based on
his or her own talents and efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics, such as Nicholas Lemann in his current book ``The Big
Test,'' see an aristocracy of bloodlines being replaced by an
aristocracy of test scores. Even meritocracy is already dead,
according to many social critics, mainly conservative. They mourn
that meritocracy was killed by affirmative action and political
correctness, and succeeded by a social order based on government
fiat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it seems that bloodlines remain remarkably powerful, even in
a political culture where denunciation of ``elites'' is as routine
as ``God bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just in politics. Even at the cutting edge of the
economy, the place where everything is new, where success can
strike anyone and failure can too, where capitalism sorts and sifts
with blind efficiency, where what you do matters and where you're
from doesn't, and blah blah blah -- in cyberspace, that is -- the
law of averages seems to have broken down.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s I was a ``tutor'' (precious term for resident
adviser) in a ``house'' (dormitory) at Harvard. Scott McNealy was
there. Now, as founder and CEO of Sun Microsystems, he is one of
the biggest cyberbigshots.
</P>
<P>
   George Bell was there too, and he's now also a cyberbigshot, CEO
of Excite(at)home, the Web portal and cable access company.
</P>
<P>
   The other day I was trying to remember the name of that woman
who got hired as CEO of eBay, the auction site, and almost
immediately became an IPO billionaire. Was it something like ``Meg
Whitman''?
</P>
<P>
   No, that was Ann Whitman's sister who dated that pre-med guy
from Kirkland House and went to Harvard Business School, then moved
to San Francisco, and oh my gosh!
</P>
<P>
   Steve Ballmer, now CEO of Microsoft (and therefore my boss), was
not in K-House but had friends there and was around a lot. Bill
Gates? Maybe he was around too. Who noticed?
</P>
<P>
   All this future royalty of cyberspace in one dorm at one
university. Coincidence? Or is there some other explanation?
</P>
<P>
   Like almost all dorms at all universities back then -- and
unlike almost all dorms at all universities now -- Kirkland House
was definitely not a fertile culture of entrepreneurialism, let
alone of computer studies. So that's not the explanation.
</P>
<P>
   A Harvard education is good, but not that good. And to get into
Harvard you have to be reasonably bright, but you don't have to be
a genius. So those possible explanations don't wash either.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Harvard students, these folks did not stand out as
especially brilliant or promising. You would have liked them, found
them intelligent, and predicted happiness and success. But you
would not have predicted that they would be among the very top
leaders of a new economy that is transforming America.
</P>
<P>
   If these individuals have anything in common, beyond Kirkland
House, it's that they're from a group that was already a small
minority even at Harvard a generation ago: prep-school WASPs.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman and Bell are classic East Coast American blue bloods out
of Henry James or Edith Wharton: full members of the club. The
others only qualify for various levels of associate membership.
McNealy and Ballmer both attended private schools in Detroit, as
did Gates in Seattle. McNealy's father was an auto company CEO,
Gates' a prominent lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   As in politics, you don't need to be a blue blood to make it in
cyberspace. Silicon World probably is as wide open as anyplace in
history to talent and energy from any social background, ethnic
heritage, citizenship, table manners, or sanitary habits. This
isn't investment banking. That's what makes it so interesting that
bloodlines and elite institutions still seem to count.
</P>
<P>
   Money can't explain it. The WASP establishment no longer
dominates this country financially. None of the cyberpioneers comes
from a huge fortune. All four of the leading presidential
candidates are rich, but none is impressively rich by current
standards. Far richer men have tried using their own fortunes to
run for president, so far without success.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the notion of Ivy League universities as bastions of
bloodlines is half a century out of date. Harvard, Yale and
Princeton -- and the Naval Academy -- all claim to be loyal
servants of meritocracy now. And that's pretty much true.
</P>
<P>
   However, as it happens, each of the four top presidential
candidates had -- as a senator's son, an alumni son, an admiral's
son, or a star athlete -- a substantial exemption from the
meritocratic rigors of the admission process. So meritocracy can't
explain it either.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not money, and it's not merit in any conventional or at
least observable sense. I think it must be genuine moral
superiority. What other explanation could there be?

<P>
   In theory, anyone can grow up to be president. In practice, the
next president is going to be a graduate of Harvard, Yale,
Princeton or the Naval Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are he will also be a graduate of either St. Albans
School or Phillips Academy Andover. He will be either the son of a
senator, the son of a president and grandson of a senator, the son
and grandson of an admiral, or -- the humblest background and
longest shot in the group -- the son of a Midwestern banker.
</P>
<P>
   Given the small slice of the population these privileged
backgrounds represent, we have here a spectacular breakdown in the
law of averages. Either that or an interesting perspective on
American society.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, you don't have to be an aristo to become president.
For one thing, George W. Bush is the only full blue blood in the
lot. For another, poor white trash defeated Andover-and-Yale Sr.
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But even in supposedly class-bound Britain it would be
considered shocking if the two politicians battling for the top job
both had attended hoity private schools.
</P>
<P>
   For decades now we've been hearing about the decline or death of
the Protestant Establishment (or the Episcopacy or the WASP
Ascendancy or just the Upper Class). In fact, in America we're not
supposed to have had an inherited class system. Even left-wing
critiques of power in American society tend to emphasize the role
of money, not bloodlines.
</P>
<P>
   What is supposed to have replaced the Protestant Establishment
is something called meritocracy. Enthusiasts celebrate meritocracy

 DOES GOD CARE WHO WINS THE SUPER BOWL?
 (Slate commentary)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (David Plotz is Slate's Washington bureau chief)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so long ago that sports fields were the devil's
playground. Babe Ruth could commit five of the seven deadly sins
before noon and hit three home runs by dinner.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Damn Yankees,'' it was Satan, not God, who offered the
Washington Senators a pennant in exchange for a player's soul.
(Lesson: Offense wins games. Demons win championships.)
</P>
<P>
   But today there are Angels in the Outfield, and God seems to be
following pro sports more intently than any Vegas bookie.
</P>
<P>
   Several months before the Super Bowl, St. Louis Rams quarterback
Kurt Warner, a devout Christian, declared, ``The Lord has something
special in mind for this team.'' The Rams won the Super Bowl
because of a Warner touchdown pass. As the clock ticked to zero,
the quarterback yelled, ``Thank you, Jesus!''
</P>
<P>
   In post-game interviews, Rams receiver Isaac Bruce -- who claims
that uttering the word ``Jesus'' saved him from injury in a car
crash and healed a pulled groin -- described catching the winning
pass: ``That wasn't me. That was all God. ... I had to make an
adjustment on the ball, and God did the rest.'' (Thanks to God's
invisibility, the Rams were not penalized for having 12 men on the
field.)
</P>
<P>
   Why is God so busy on the gridiron?
</P>
<P>
   Though sports heroes boosted attendance at 19th-century tent
revivals, the modern era of ``Muscular Christianity'' began in the
late '40s, when Billy Graham began recruiting born-again athletes
to profess their faith publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Sports stars have espoused all kinds of religion -- Notre Dame
built a Catholic football dynasty; Muhammad Ali invoked Elijah
Muhammad at the beginning of every interview (much to Howard
Cosell's annoyance) but evangelical Christianity has been by far
the most successful in recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   Emotional, highly personal, nondenominational Protestantism has
supplanted Catholicism as America's dominant sports religion.
</P>
<P>
   Graham and other pastors have pursued a trickle-down theory of
religion. It relies on holy jock-sniffing: Fans who see their
heroes following Christ are more receptive to Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We develop athletic influencers into Christ-centered
leaders,'' says Athletes in Action, a sports evangelizing group.
</P>
<P>
   The Fellowship of Christian Athletes has been organizing at
schools and colleges since 1954. (Bill Bradley was briefly an
evangelical FCA member.)
</P>
<P>
   Today Athletes in Action, Pro Athletes Outreach, Champions for
Christ, and Christian Athletes United for Spiritual Empowerment
target pro athletes for spiritual help, making them perhaps the
most heavily proselytized group in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The evangelizing has especially borne fruit in the NFL. There
have been publicly religious players in the NFL since the '60s, but
their numbers have surged since the '80s. The increasing number of
African-American players has added to their ranks, as has the
proselytizing of stars such as Mike Singletary, Reggie White, and
Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Post-game prayer circles include players from both teams. Every
NFL team has a chaplain -- invariably an evangelical -- who holds
Bible studies and weekend chapels. (One anachronism in ``Any Given
Sunday,'' the Oliver Stone pro football movie, is that a Catholic
priest leads the team prayers.)
</P>
<P>
   According to Athletes in Action, which provides half the NFL's
chaplains, 35 percent to 40 percent of pro football players are
evangelical Christians, compared to about 25 percent of the rest of
America.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches like religion in the locker room because it can
straighten out otherwise wild or reprobate players. And
evangelicals are thrilled about it. ``They believe that God has
raised up big-time sport as a means to evangelism,'' says Wheaton
College Professor James Mathisen, co-author of Muscular
Christianity: Evangelical Protestants and the Development of
American Sport.
</P>
<P>
   The faithful are theologically obliged to share their
``testimony'' with others, and Christian athletes use their
encounters with large crowds and the media to spread the gospel.
Warner's endlessly repeated story -- from stock boy to MVP, backed
by Jesus -- will draw folks to church.
</P>
<P>
   Testimonies are usually simple, reflexive professions of faith.
Announcer: ``Tell me about that catch you made on third-and-10.''
Player: ``Well, first I want to thank my Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ'' Journalists often treat this testimony like a fart. They
wince and pretend nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletes are very pragmatic and outcome-oriented,'' says
Mathisen. It is no accident that many athletes believe in God's
involvement in all aspects of life, including football. Athletes
want results, and they want to see them when they pray.
</P>
<P>
   Former Green Bay Packer White, the most outspoken of Christian
athletes, says he knows God acts on football games because God
intervened in David's battle with Goliath. The Atlanta Falcons
chaplain recently declared that God cares about field goals. When
quarterback Randall Cunningham had a great season in 1998, he said
that God was showing his appreciation by letting Cunningham win 16
games.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes are also superstitious, searching for ways to control
games that are inherently chaotic. Some view faith as magic, a
``genie in a bottle,'' as Cleveland Browns chaplain Tom Petersburg
puts it. Pray, and good fortune will follow.
</P>
<P>
   According to GQ, the Rams' Bruce recently credited God for
answering his prayers after a poor first half: ``God really
manifested in the third quarter. I had 89 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that non-evangelicals reject the idea
that Jesus is throwing passes and making tackles. But it is also
the case that, except for athletes such as Bruce who make claims
about God's on-the-field heroics, few evangelicals accept the
``Jesus in the Backfield'' theology either.
</P>
<P>
   Team chaplains, theologians, pastors, and most Christian players
are skeptical, calling it ``facile,'' ``immature,'' and even
``heresy.'' Some argue that football is too trivial for God's
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``God does not give a rip about who wins or loses. God is
engaged in the world, but not in things like athletic contests.
That is too frivolous,'' says Emory University theologian James
Freeman, an expert on sports and religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think God could care less who wins or loses,'' says James
Mitchell, former Tennessee Titans chaplain and national director of
outreach for Pro Athletes Outreach. God may intervene at times when
it truly matters -- when Hitler threatens to conquer the world --
but He doesn't concern Himself with boys' games.
</P>
<P>
   Other evangelicals, including the FCA and AIA, hold that God may
care who wins the game and may even intervene, but that it's
foolish of players to presume to read His mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does God care? I would say yes, but we don't know who He wants
to win. God has plans for you however the game comes out,'' says
Petersburg. AIA spokesman Greg Stoughton says that while God may
answer a player's prayer for a win, ``victory to God may look a
whole lot different than it does to the player. Even if you lose,
God is about building character.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``genie in a bottle'' theory, they note, is incoherent about
defeat. If God wants you to win because you are faithful, does that
mean He wants your opponents -- who profess equal devotion -- to
lose? If your opponents lose, does that mean they didn't have
enough faith? If you lose, does that mean you don't have enough
faith? The genie has no answer.
</P>
<P>
   Most evangelicals turn the ``genie in a bottle'' theology on its
head. That theology views God as the instrument. God proves Himself
to you by making the catch or causing the fumble.
</P>
<P>
   But most evangelicals see the player as the instrument: The
player glorifies God by playing his best.
</P>
<P>
   Petersburg says that his Browns players never pray for victory.
They pray ``that they play with honor, that that they play to their
best ability, that they honor God in the way they play, that they
play injury-free.'' It's not about who wins and who loses. It's
about how they play the game.

Mathisen. It is no accident that many athletes believe in God's
involvement in all aspects of life, including football. Athletes
want results, and they want to see them when they pray.
</P>
<P>
   Former Green Bay Packer White, the most outspoken of Christian
athletes, says he knows God acts on football games because God
intervened in David's battle with Goliath. The Atlanta Falcons
chaplain recently declared that God cares about field goals. When
quarterback Randall Cunningham had a great season in 1998, he said
that God was showing his appreciation by letting Cunningham win 16
games.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes are also superstitious, searching for ways to control
games that are inherently chaotic. Some view faith as magic, a
``genie in a bottle,'' as Cleveland Browns chaplain Tom Petersburg
puts it. Pray, and good fortune will follow.
</P>
<P>
   According to GQ, the Rams' Bruce recently credited God for
answering his prayers after a poor first half: ``God really
manifested in the third quarter. I had 89 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that non-evangelicals reject the idea
that Jesus is throwing passes and making tackles. But it is also
the case that, except for athletes such as Bruce who make claims
about God's on-the-field heroics, few evangelicals accept the
``Jesus in the Backfield'' theology either.
</P>
<P>
   Team chaplains, theologians, pastors, and most Christian players
are skeptical, calling it ``facile,'' ``immature,'' and even
``heresy.'' Some argue that football is too trivial for God's
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``God does not give a rip about who wins or loses. God is
engaged in the world, but not in things like athletic contests.
That is too frivolous,'' says Emory University theologian James
Freeman, an expert on sports and religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think God could care less who wins or loses,'' says James
Mitchell, former Tennessee Titans chaplain and national director of
outreach for Pro Athletes Outreach. God may intervene at times when
it truly matters -- when Hitler threatens to conquer the world --
but He doesn't concern Himself with boys' games.
</P>
<P>
   Other evangelicals, including the FCA and AIA, hold that God may
care who wins the game and may even intervene, but that it's
foolish of players to presume to read His mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does God care? I would say yes, but we don't know who He wants
to win. God has plans for you however the game comes out,'' says
Petersburg. AIA spokesman Greg Stoughton says that while God may
answer a player's prayer for a win, ``victory to God may look a
whole lot different than it does to the player. Even if you lose,
God is about building character.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``genie in a bottle'' theory, they note, is incoherent about
defeat. If God wants you to win because you are faithful, does that
mean He wants your opponents -- who profess equal devotion -- to
lose? If your opponents lose, does that mean they didn't have
enough faith? If you lose, does that mean you don't have enough
faith? The genie has no answer.
</P>
<P>
   Most evangelicals turn the ``genie in a bottle'' theology on its
head. That theology views God as the instrument. God proves Himself
to you by making the catch or causing the fumble.
</P>
<P>
   But most evangelicals see the player as the instrument: The
player glorifies God by playing his best.
</P>
<P>
   Petersburg says that his Browns players never pray for victory.
They pray ``that they play with honor, that that they play to their
best ability, that they honor God in the way they play, that they
play injury-free.'' It's not about who wins and who loses. It's
about how they play the game.

RELATIVISM DIDN'T START WITH EINSTEIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Slate commentary)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GREENBERG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to Time, person of the century Albert Einstein is
responsible for the 20th century's moral relativism and artistic
modernism. What hooey!
</P>
<P>
   Amid December's bickering over whether Einstein deserved Time's
person of the century accolades, no one stopped to question the
sweeping claims the magazine made on the genius's behalf. In
particular, Time said Einstein's theory of relativity spawned
artistic modernism and moral relativism. Managing Editor Walter
Isaacson wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Einstein's theory of relativity not only upended physics, it
also jangled the underpinnings of society. For nearly three
centuries, the clockwork universe of Galileo and Newton which was
based on absolute laws and certainties formed the psychological
foundation for the Enlightenment, with its belief in causes and
effects, order, rationalism, even duty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now came a view of the universe in which space and time were
all relative. Indirectly, relativity paved the way for a new
relativism in morality, arts and politics. There was less faith in
absolutes, not only of time and space but also of truth and
morality. `It formed a knife,' historian Paul Johnson says of
relativity theory, `to help cut society adrift from its traditional
moorings.' Just as Darwinism became, a century ago, not just a
biological theory but also a social theology, so too did relativity
shape the social theology of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect on arts can be seen by looking at 1922, the year
that Einstein won the Nobel Prize, James Joyce published `Ulysses'
and T.S. Eliot published `The Waste Land.' There was a famous party
in May for the debut of the ballet Renard, composed by Stravinsky
and staged by Diaghilev. They were both there, along with Picasso
(who had designed the sets), Proust (who had been proclaimed
Einstein's literary interpreter) and Joyce. The art of each, in its
own way, reflected the breakdown of mechanical order and of the
sense that space and time were absolutes.
</P>
<P>
   The above passage borrows heavily from the opening chapter of
Paul Johnson's ``Modern Times,'' which is less a work of history
than a right-wing screed bemoaning the rise of the welfare state
and the spread of liberalism. But set aside that Time relied on a
polemicist few historians take seriously -- others have drawn such
links before. Set aside, too, that Time simply asserted, rather
than demonstrated, its claim. Does the argument have merit?
</P>
<P>
   Not much. The notion that the sheer force of Einstein's ideas
revolutionized the world is mistaken. In 1905 Einstein published
his ``Special Theory of Relativity'' the one you might be familiar
with, often explained via the example of a light beamed from the
back of a train and it took years before even scientists paid
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein remained quite unknown to the public at large until May
1919, when the British astronomer Arthur Eddington set out to test
his ``General Theory of Relativity'' devised in 1915. During a
solar eclipse, Eddington watched to see if a ray of light passing
the sun would bend according to Einstein's formulations or Isaac
Newton's 17th-century laws and Einstein won. Only then did Einstein
achieve international celebrity; only then did pundits proclaim
that a new consciousness was at hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Times of London, for example, wrote that Einstein's theories
would ``overthrow the certainty of the ages, and to require a new
philosophy, a philosophy that will sweep away nearly all that has
hitherto been accepted as the axiomatic basis of physical
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen. For all his fame and genius, Einstein's work
didn't change the way people thought day-to-day. Despite a raft of
books and articles introducing his ideas to lay readers, most
people didn't understand them. ``Everyone knows that Einstein did
something astounding,''
</P>
<P>
   Bertrand Russell noted, ``but very few people know exactly what
it was that he did.'' While some grasped the gist of his theories,
few possessed the advanced knowledge of math and physics required
to truly assimilate them.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, the nature of Einstein's ideas that space and
time are relative concepts aren't applicable to everyday
encounters. Einstein said that time and space were relative to the
observer's frame of reference. But all human beings share the same
reference frame. So we go about our lives as if Newtonian laws
pertained which, for all intents and purposes, they do. Newtonian
laws betray us only when we're dealing with objects approaching the
speed of light, something the average person rarely does.
</P>
<P>
   The relativity-relativism connection rests on the belief that
Einstein said that ``everything is relative,'' ``there are no
absolutes,'' or something to that effect. But he didn't. To the
contrary, Einstein saw his achievement as restoring order to our
understanding of the universe after 19th-century discoveries in
electricity and magnetism introduced anomalies Newton's laws
couldn't account for. Einstein devised new rules to explain the
discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   These rules posited, among other things, that (as Alan J.
Friedman and Carol C. Donley have put it) ``measurements of time,
space, and mass are relative to the individual observer's
time-space reference frame.'' That's the part everyone goes nuts
about. But, Friedman and Donley go on to note, ``nothing is
subjective or uncertain about those measurements.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, for everyone who shares a particular frame of
reference the measurements are the same. What's more, the object's
measurements in one frame of reference can be used reliably to
predict those in another frame; the measurements vary from frame to
frame, but they vary in accordance with fixed laws. The upshot:
Einstein didn't demolish the basis for certainty in knowledge; he
restored it.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein himself often insisted that his theories had no
relevance for anything except science. He called the hullabaloo
surrounding his findings ``psychopathological,'' and he disabused
those who would misapply his ideas. Asked what effect his theory
would have on religion, he said: ``None. Relativity is a purely
scientific matter and has nothing to do with religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did his ideas have ramifications for art, literature, or
music. When given a paper called, ``Cubism and the Theory of
Relativity,'' Einstein rejected any connection between the two
ideas:
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory says only that the general laws are such that their
form does not depend on the choice of the system of coordinates.
This logical demand, however, has nothing to do with how the
single, specific case is represented. A multiplicity of systems of
coordinates is not needed for its representation. This is quite
different in the case of Picasso's painting. This new artistic
`language' has nothing in common with the Theory of Relativity.''
</P>
<P>
   You might argue that even if the pioneers of modernism
misunderstood Einstein, they were still reflecting his influence in
working with bowdlerized versions of his theories. Alas, that's
also wrong. Most of the great works of modernism began (and some
were completed) before Einstein's ideas entered the culture.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Time's own examples. Pablo Picasso painted his Les
Demoiselles d'Avignon, famous for introducing a multiplicity of
perspectives of an object into a single frame, in 1907. Likewise,
James Joyce's ``Ulysses,'' known for ushering in modernism with its
narrative fragments and stream-of-consciousness style, was first
serialized in 1918. Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring,
controversial for its atonality and dissonance, premiered in 1913.
</P>
<P>
   That year, too, Marcel Proust began ``Remembrance of Things
Past.'' By 1922 he was dead. All of these modernist masterpieces
were launched before the artists knew Einstein's name.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, it's easy to find other, more direct influences upon
the moderns. Cubism drew inspiration from Paul Cezanne and Henri
Matisse. William Butler Yeats influenced Joyce. Virginia Woolf read
the philosophers William James and Henri Bergson, who questioned
linear notions of time in the 1880s.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the 1920s, some modernists did read Einstein and
claim him as a muse -- though usually they misconstrued his ideas.
Efforts to incorporate Einstein into literature don't hold up the
way Joyce and Woolf do. For example, William Carlos Williams' poem
``St. Francis Einstein of the Daffodils'' mixes a garbled notion of
the theory of relativity with a dash of Thomas Jefferson:
</P>
<P>
   April Einstein
</P>
<P>
   has come among the daffodils
</P>
<P>
   shouting
</P>
<P>
   that flowers and men
</P>
<P>
   were created
</P>
<P>
   relatively equal.
</P>
<P>
   Oldfashioned knowledge is
</P>
<P>
   dead under the blossoming peachtrees.
</P>
<P>
   The work is seldom taught in Poetry 101.
</P>
<P>
   Other writers, significantly the British novelist Lawrence
Durrell, also claimed they were applying Einstein's ideas to
literature. They may have liked to think they were inventing a
literary equivalent of the new physics, but their formal
experiments could easily have taken place without Einstein. After
all, relativism of various sorts dates at least to the pre-Socratic
philosophers of ancient Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man is the measure of all things,'' said Protagoras, one of
the so-called Sophists, pointing out that water might feel warm to
one person, cold to another. Some Sophists also argued for a
cultural and moral relativism, contending that supposedly sacred
rites, such as marriage, were merely social conventions that varied
among cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Moral relativism constitutes a final area where Time, Paul
Johnson, et al. misfire in ascribing even an indirect causal role
to Einstein. Again, Einstein disavowed any connection between his
theories and a system of morals or ethics. He believed in a god and
in fixed notions of right and wrong. Second, moral relativism did
not, as Johnson suggests, burst out of nowhere in the 1920s.
Philosophers have long entertained the idea that right and wrong
are human or social conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, to the degree that moral relativism did take hold in
the 20th century, its currency owed more to such thinkers as
Friedrich Nietzsche, who in the 19th century argued that reason
doesn't lead us to absolute standards of good or evil. Proclaiming
that God is dead, Nietzsche suggested that the new man, or
superman, creates his own morality in the service of his own will
to power. If you want to understand the popularity today of
relativism, visit any elite college campus. There are more students
toting Nietzsche than there are spouting Einstein.
</P>
<P>
   When you think about it, the idea that everything is relative,
or that everybody has his own point of view, is so obvious and
familiar that it hardly takes a genius to think of it. In that
sense, the suggestion that Einstein kicked off relativism and
modernism is a massive insult to his intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, to assert that Einstein had nothing to do
with them is not to diminish his genius or greatness. It is,
rather, to enlarge them.

IF GEORGE W. WAS AN INTERNET COMPANY... 
</HEADLINE>
  (Slate commentary)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (William Saletan is a Slate senior writer.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By WILLIAM SALETAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every four years, as the primary returns trickle in from New
Hampshire, presidential candidates trot onstage with metaphors
designed to spin the results.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's metaphor, ``touchdown,'' implies that a win is a win.
Bill Bradley's, ``turnaround,'' implies that the real winner is the
guy who lost more narrowly than expected. George W. Bush's, ``bump
in the road,'' implies that Bush's lopsided loss to John McCain is
a momentary, inconsequential distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire has long been known as a bump in the road for
front-runners,'' Bush joked Tuesday night. ``The road to the
Republican nomination and the White House is a long road. Mine will
go through all 50 states.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Bush has the money, the organization, the
endorsements and the lead in polls throughout the country.
Resistance is futile.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitability is a self-fulfilling spin. As long as people
believe it, it's true. But what if they don't? What if McCain's win
in New Hampshire shatters the prevailing certainty that Bush will
be the nominee or would be more electable? What arguments can Bush
fall back on? This is the question New Hampshire has exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Why do so many people support Bush? Because they think he's
electable, because Republican leaders support him, and because
Republican donors have united behind him. In short, people support
him because other people support him.
</P>
<P>
   This is what stock market analysts call a speculative bubble.
Prick the confidence and the bubble bursts.
</P>
<P>
   Think of Bush as an Internet company. What are his expenses so
far? Reportedly $35 million. And what are his earnings? An 11-point
win in Iowa and an 18-point defeat in New Hampshire. So why do
people keep buying his stock? Because it keeps going up, as
measured by polls and campaign-finance reports.
</P>
<P>
   I'm buying stock in Bush because you're buying it. If you begin
to doubt that Bush is the most electable candidate, you might stop
giving him money and telling pollsters you plan to vote for him. If
you and others stop giving him money, then maybe his nomination
isn't inevitable. And if you and others stop telling pollsters you
plan to vote for him, then maybe he isn't so electable. So then
maybe I should stop giving him money and telling pollsters I plan
to vote for him. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Bush thinks he can stop his slide by marshaling his assets,
arguments and achievements. But the more you examine these assets,
arguments and achievements, the more you realize that they all rest
on the same circular logic.
</P>
<P>
   How did Bush become the front-runner? By raising lots of money.
And why did donors give him that money? Because they thought he
could win. Maybe they had good reasons to think so. But the point
is, the rest of us don't know what those reasons were. All we know
is that they gave him the money. We're supposed to favor him
because people with money favor him.
</P>
<P>
   How did Bush solidify his domination of the field? By securing
endorsements from scores of Republican governors and members of
Congress. And why did those officials endorse him? Because they
think he's the most electable Republican.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush's latest endorser, Rep. Mike Castle, R-Del., put it in a
press release Monday, Bush is ``the Republican who can win the
nomination and go on to win the general election.'' Castle's
endorsement is supposed to persuade Republicans in Delaware to vote
for Bush. In other words, you're supposed to support Bush because
politicians support him, because you're supposed to support him.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't Bush have any other arguments why you should support
him? Yes, he does. He says he's a true conservative, unlike McCain.
But how do we know this? Critics in Texas say Bush raised sales
taxes there after promising not to, and the Manchester Union Leader
argued in detail that Bush's record contradicts his claim to be a
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about these critiques on ``Fox News Sunday,'' Bush
replied, ``I'm a conservative. I got elected governor in a
conservative state.'' A day later, Bush dismissed the tax complaint
by observing, ``I've done a good job as governor of Texas. It's
been confirmed by the people of my state overwhelmingly. It's the
most Republican big state.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, people should vote for Bush because he's
conservative, and the evidence that he's conservative is that
people have voted for him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also says you should vote for him because he's the
candidate best equipped to manage the presidency. But what about
his inexperience in office (five years), Washington (zero), and
foreign policy (zero)? McCain implicitly raised those questions in
a TV ad in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about these doubts on ``Face the Nation,'' Bush
replied, ``A lot of United States senators are asking the same
question. Republican senators saying, 'Which one of the two, Sen.
McCain or Gov. Bush, should we endorse? Who should we help, based
upon their leadership skills?' And by far, the overwhelming
majority of United States senators, who are Republicans, are
supporting me.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, you should vote for Bush because he has the leadership
skills to be president, which must be true because so many senators
have endorsed him, which they have done because they think you'll
vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   Where did the whole Bush juggernaut -- the money, the
endorsements, the lead in the polls begin? With his name. So Bush
brought his father onstage for a rally in New Hampshire. ``This
boy, this son of ours is not going to let you down,'' the former
president promised. But why should the resume of the father be
visited on the son?
</P>
<P>
   On ``Face the Nation,'' Bob Schieffer asked Governor Bush,
``Your dad used to say he was the foreign policy president. That
was his expertise. What would you say is your area of expertise?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush replied, ``Uniting people and setting an agenda that's
hopeful and optimistic, bringing people together to achieve that
agenda. John (McCain) is a good man, but I believe when it's all
said and done the people of this party are going to say, 'Governor
Bush can unite us.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Fox News Sunday,'' Bush argued, ``One of the big
differences in this campaign (is) that I can unite our party. I've
got the capacity to bring people together so we can win the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   To sum up: You should all vote for Bush because he's got
expertise. His expertise is that he's a uniter. And the evidence
that he's a uniter is that you're all going to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what George W. Bush has accomplished: He won the
governorship of a big state without Republican opposition in a year
in which every palatable Republican nominee was swept into office.
</P>
<P>
   He administered that institutionally weak office during a
national boom that poured surpluses into state treasuries and
enabled governors and legislators to cut taxes without cutting
spending.
</P>
<P>
   He accumulated enough time in office to become a plausible
presidential candidate just as the country's Democratic president
was discrediting his heir apparent with yet another scandal, and
just as Republican congressional leaders were discrediting
themselves by reducing their agenda to the president's impeachment,
thereby clearing the Republican presidential field for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   You were supposed to vote for Bush because everyone else was
supposed to vote for him. In New Hampshire, they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says it's just a blip in the market, and you should keep
holding his stock. But he's already lost most of his lead in South
Carolina. If he suffers another defeat there, people will begin to
ask why they should vote for him even if he's not inevitable or
more electable than his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, Alan Keyes, and Gary Bauer have spent two years
explaining why you should vote for them even if nobody else agrees
with you. Bush ought to be able to answer the same question.

giving him money and telling pollsters you plan to vote for him. If
you and others stop giving him money, then maybe his nomination
isn't inevitable. And if you and others stop telling pollsters you
plan to vote for him, then maybe he isn't so electable. So then
maybe I should stop giving him money and telling pollsters I plan
to vote for him. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Bush thinks he can stop his slide by marshaling his assets,
arguments and achievements. But the more you examine these assets,
arguments and achievements, the more you realize that they all rest
on the same circular logic.
</P>
<P>
   How did Bush become the front-runner? By raising lots of money.
And why did donors give him that money? Because they thought he
could win. Maybe they had good reasons to think so. But the point
is, the rest of us don't know what those reasons were. All we know
is that they gave him the money. We're supposed to favor him
because people with money favor him.
</P>
<P>
   How did Bush solidify his domination of the field? By securing
endorsements from scores of Republican governors and members of
Congress. And why did those officials endorse him? Because they
think he's the most electable Republican.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush's latest endorser, Rep. Mike Castle, R-Del., put it in a
press release Monday, Bush is ``the Republican who can win the
nomination and go on to win the general election.'' Castle's
endorsement is supposed to persuade Republicans in Delaware to vote
for Bush. In other words, you're supposed to support Bush because
politicians support him, because you're supposed to support him.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't Bush have any other arguments why you should support
him? Yes, he does. He says he's a true conservative, unlike McCain.
But how do we know this? Critics in Texas say Bush raised sales
taxes there after promising not to, and the Manchester Union Leader
argued in detail that Bush's record contradicts his claim to be a
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about these critiques on ``Fox News Sunday,'' Bush
replied, ``I'm a conservative. I got elected governor in a
conservative state.'' A day later, Bush dismissed the tax complaint
by observing, ``I've done a good job as governor of Texas. It's
been confirmed by the people of my state overwhelmingly. It's the
most Republican big state.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, people should vote for Bush because he's
conservative, and the evidence that he's conservative is that
people have voted for him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also says you should vote for him because he's the
candidate best equipped to manage the presidency. But what about
his inexperience in office (five years), Washington (zero), and
foreign policy (zero)? McCain implicitly raised those questions in
a TV ad in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about these doubts on ``Face the Nation,'' Bush
replied, ``A lot of United States senators are asking the same
question. Republican senators saying, 'Which one of the two, Sen.
McCain or Gov. Bush, should we endorse? Who should we help, based
upon their leadership skills?' And by far, the overwhelming
majority of United States senators, who are Republicans, are
supporting me.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, you should vote for Bush because he has the leadership
skills to be president, which must be true because so many senators
have endorsed him, which they have done because they think you'll
vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   Where did the whole Bush juggernaut -- the money, the
endorsements, the lead in the polls begin? With his name. So Bush
brought his father onstage for a rally in New Hampshire. ``This
boy, this son of ours is not going to let you down,'' the former
president promised. But why should the resume of the father be
visited on the son?
</P>
<P>
   On ``Face the Nation,'' Bob Schieffer asked Governor Bush,
``Your dad used to say he was the foreign policy president. That
was his expertise. What would you say is your area of expertise?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush replied, ``Uniting people and setting an agenda that's
hopeful and optimistic, bringing people together to achieve that
agenda. John (McCain) is a good man, but I believe when it's all
said and done the people of this party are going to say, 'Governor
Bush can unite us.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Fox News Sunday,'' Bush argued, ``One of the big
differences in this campaign (is) that I can unite our party. I've
got the capacity to bring people together so we can win the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   To sum up: You should all vote for Bush because he's got
expertise. His expertise is that he's a uniter. And the evidence
that he's a uniter is that you're all going to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what George W. Bush has accomplished: He won the
governorship of a big state without Republican opposition in a year
in which every palatable Republican nominee was swept into office.
</P>
<P>
   He administered that institutionally weak office during a
national boom that poured surpluses into state treasuries and
enabled governors and legislators to cut taxes without cutting
spending.
</P>
<P>
   He accumulated enough time in office to become a plausible
presidential candidate just as the country's Democratic president
was discrediting his heir apparent with yet another scandal, and
just as Republican congressional leaders were discrediting
themselves by reducing their agenda to the president's impeachment,
thereby clearing the Republican presidential field for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   You were supposed to vote for Bush because everyone else was
supposed to vote for him. In New Hampshire, they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says it's just a blip in the market, and you should keep
holding his stock. But he's already lost most of his lead in South
Carolina. If he suffers another defeat there, people will begin to
ask why they should vote for him even if he's not inevitable or
more electable than his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, Alan Keyes, and Gary Bauer have spent two years
explaining why you should vote for them even if nobody else agrees
with you. Bush ought to be able to answer the same question.

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Feb. 8:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LIFE-BEYOND-EARTH (Undated) _ Two prominent scientists say
the conventional wisdom the intelligent life is common beyond the
Earth is way off base. Drawing on new findings in astronomy,
geology and paleontology, the two argue that humans might be alone,
at least in the stellar neighborhood, and perhaps in the entire
cosmos. They say modern science is showing that Earth's composition
and stability are extraordinarily rare. Most everywhere else, the
radiation levels are too high, the right chemical elements too rare
in abundance, the hospitable planets too few in number and the rain
of killer rocks too intense for life ever to have evolved into
advanced communities. Alien microbes may survive in many places as
a kind of cosmic shower scum, they say, but not extraterrestrials
civilized enough to be awash in technology. By William J. Broad.
(2100 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo and graphic.

</P>
<P>
   SCI-LIFE-HUNT (Undated) _ More than a million people and
computers are now involved in processing data that may involve
transmission of signals from alien life. By William J. Broad. (385
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MOTHERS (Undated) _ Dr. Sarah Blaffer Hrdy (cq) examines the
complexities of motherhood and concludes it is a barter, a supple,
ever-changing push-me pull-you negotiation between two individuals
who need each other and are closely related, but who are not clones
and so do not always see eye to eye, or breast to mouth for that
matter. Hrdy, in a new book, tells of motherhood from a distinctly
Darwinian perspective, an appraisal of how a welter of selective
forces have shaped maternal behaviors, impulses and strategies over
tens of thousands of years. By Natalie Angier.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AIDS-DRUGS (San Francisco) _ The Doctor's World: In less
than four years, the euphoria over the success of new drug
combinations to treat AIDS has yielded to the sobering challenge of
dealing with the drugs' complications and failures. By Lawrence K.
Altman. (1800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CLIMATE-AFRICA () _ It has become increasingly clear to
scientists that in the 10,000 years since the last ice age ended,
the world's climate has often served up droughts far surpassing
anything seen in the last 150 years, resulting in some cases in the
collapse of entire ancient civilizations. Now a new study has found
that over the last millennium in equatorial East Africa,
decades-long droughts far longer and more severe than any in
recorded weather history have alternated with periods when rainfall
was heavier than today. By William K. Stevens. (1275 words)
</P>
<P>
   With map.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CLIMATE-YELLOWSTONE (Big Sky, Mont.) _ There is mounting
concern among biologists and other researchers that global climate
change may be creating conditions in and around the Yellowstone
National Park that are inhospitable for a tree that produces a nut
crucial to wildlife. If climate warming is the real, long-term
phenomenon many experts think it is, it could set off a domino-like
series of changes that could kill 90 percent or more of the white
bark pine trees and possibly compromise the future of the
threatened grizzly bear. By Jim Robbins. (1550 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PREDICTING-DURATION (Undated) _ Two experts dispute the
theory that the likely future duration of anything, from the human
race to a musical playing on Broadway, can be predicted. All you
need to know is the time that has passed since the entity in
question came into being until the moment when you asked, ``How
long will this last?'' By James Glanz. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on the
mysteries of ball lightning, a tracking device for the honeybee and
the ways honeybees measure distance. By Henry Fountain. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BREAST-CANCER (Undated) _ New ways to analyze various risks
with various strategies taken after breast cancer is diagnosed. By
Denise Grady. (1330 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENE-THERAPY (Boston) _ A Boston medical center has
suspended its gene therapy tests because of safety concerns arising
from a student's death last year in a similar trial program in
Pennsylvania. By Philip J. Hilts.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COLORBLIND-AID (Undated) _ New glasses to help the
colorblind distinguish hues have been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, becoming the first lenses specifically authorized
for color deficient vision. While some users are pleased, many
experts caution that such lenses do not make people see colors as
people with normal vision do. And while the lenses can help people
tell some colors apart, they can make it harder to distinguish
other colors. By Andrew Pollack. (1220 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BOULDERING (New York) _ The Novice: Bouldering in Central
Park, a form of rock climbing for those afraid of heights. It moves
more horizontally than vertically. By Liz Neporent. (825 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health: Nuts are back on
the menu, even for people on strict low-fat diets, because they
provide so many health benefits, including lowering cholesterol and
blood pressure. By Jane E. Brody. (1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
nutrition:
</P>
<P>
   _ Boston researchers may have found a way to reduce the risk of
mother-child transmission of HIV by using a vaccination of
antibodies instead of the live virus. (270 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A new study makes a tentative link between a strong wind and
migraines, but primarily the researcher discovered that people had
trouble telling just what set off the migraines. (325 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ The American Heart Association is reminding people that
decongestants can be hazardous for people with high blood pressure.
(230 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A twice-a-week, monthlong program of physical therapy and
exercise training significantly reduced pain levels and surgery
rates among patients with arthritic knees, according to a study in
this month's issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine. (175 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A study of Pennsylvania winters has found that a combination
of just over an inch of snow and temperatures below 20 degrees
caused death rates from heart attacks to triple among men aged 35
to 49 years old. (240 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answered: I got a brace
when I was 7 to correct idiopathic scoliosis. Is this still the
standard practice? Is it true that this problem is
disproportionately common in girls? By C. Claiborne Ray. (350
words)

<HEADLINE>
WORK AHEAD FOR BUSH AFTER N.H. LOSS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ It was obvious last week _ and not just because
of the snow and single-digit temperatures _ that the governor
wasn't in Texas anymore.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't even in Iowa. There were too many mountains, too many
trees and too much John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's lopsided loss to the Arizona senator in New
Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary doesn't end his
presidential bid. But it does tarnish the long-held perception that
Bush's ``coronation'' is inevitable, and he must rebound quickly in
upcoming contests in a friendlier South Carolina and other states.
</P>
<P>
   The race for the Republican presidential nod is still Bush's to
lose. The Texas governor scored an important victory in the Iowa
caucuses, continues to rake in millions of dollars in campaign
contributions and is backed by thousands of Republican leaders
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   And he doesn't have to campaign anymore in New Hampshire, where
all of the above advantages were of little help and may have even
been minuses.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a widespread misperception, it is not true that everyone
in New Hampshire has shared a cup of coffee with a presidential
candidate, has had a presidential candidate knock on his or her
door or even shaken hands with such a creature.
</P>
<P>
   But New Hampshire, like Iowa, is one of the few remaining places
in America where voters have numerous opportunities to see, hear
and question presidential contenders up close and personal in
countless town halls, school gymnasiums, diners and living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   This style of retail politics has been smothered in the
more-populous states like Texas, where well-funded candidates
usually win elections with paid television commercials,
endorsements, photo-ops and other events staged for a TV audience.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush was waging a national campaign, McCain skipped the
Iowa caucuses and bet his candidacy on New Hampshire, where he
spent much more time than Bush and outhustled the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   The senator was well-suited to New Hampshire campaigning. Vastly
outspent by Bush, McCain had nothing to lose by going one-on-one
with the voters, taking their questions at 114 town hall-style
meetings and being easily accessible to reporters. He was
constantly on the record with newspeople traveling on his campaign
bus.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush is as gregarious as McCain, the governor and his
handlers ran a more controlled, Texas-style campaign heavy on TV
commercials, big-name endorsements and photo-ops and had more
limited press contact.
</P>
<P>
   Bush drove a snowmobile, went bowling and flipped pancakes, all
of which produced some cutesy photos but didn't impress many
voters. He is, after all, running for president, not
chef-of-the-week.
</P>
<P>
   In one telling incident on the day before the election, Bush
abruptly canceled an appearance in Exeter when his political
handlers and taxpayer-paid, Texas security detail got spooked by a
small group of demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who traveled with no bodyguards, took demonstrators in
stride as part of New Hampshire's normal political process, made a
point of inviting them to ask questions at his town hall meetings
and often gave them answers they didn't want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's plain-spoken style _ laced with humor, sarcasm and
attacks on the ``big-money,'' special-interest Washington
establishment _ obviously appealed to New Hampshire voters, who
pride themselves on their independence and contrariness. They
apparently also were impressed with his military record and the
toughness that enabled him to survive five and one-half years as a
prisoner of war in North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   They were turned off, not impressed, by Bush's support from
almost all of their state's Republican leaders. And, as history has
repeatedly demonstrated, they love voting against front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also benefited from New Hampshire laws that allowed
independent voters to cast ballots in the Republican primary. Those
independents were instrumental in his victory, although the senator
drew strong support from registered Republicans as well.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and McCain were editorially battered by The Union
Leader, the state's largest newspaper, which supported publisher
Steve Forbes' lost cause. But in the closing days of the campaign,
the ultra-conservative paper spat most of its venom at Bush, even
calling him ``Gov. Smirk'' in a Page One editorial.
</P>
<P>
   In conceding his loss, Bush called New Hampshire a ``bump in the
road for front-runners.'' The state often doesn't vote for the
eventual presidential winner, but it also has been known for
permanently derailing the White House hopes of some early
front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   Bush now has to work to keep that bump from becoming a sinkhole.

   Austria's head of state has been accused of overstepping his
authority by trying to thwart Jorg Haider's rise to power. Just
over 100 years ago, another head of state did resort to dictatorial

But new elections merely augmented the politician's support, and
eventually the state had to yield to the new force _ with tragic
consequences for mankind.

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Sights and sounds, flavors and
feels of days gone by
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Alton T. Warner
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant memories of days gone by ...
</P>
<P>
   A clean yard with no grass. Mother raking the yard with a
dogwood brush broom.
</P>
<P>
   Riding to the grist mill on horseback to get corn ground into
meal.
</P>
<P>
   From under the house, the grunting of hogs trying to get warm on
a wintry night.
</P>
<P>
   The lowing of the milk cows as they make their way home.
</P>
<P>
   The old ones talking and the children listening. The old eating
first and the children last.
</P>
<P>
   The homeward journey of a family from town in a wagon, father
and mother on the spring seat eating cheese and crackers, the
children in the back licking stick candy, faithful dog trotting
under the wagon for protection from the hot sun.
</P>
<P>
   Hosts insisting on visitors staying for supper and spending the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying hot flat irons or bricks to bed to warm your feet on a
cold night.
</P>
<P>
   Mother taking a broom and fluffing up your feather bed. (Mr.
Sealy never made a mattress that slept better.)
</P>
<P>
   A pitcher of water and a glass on the pulpit for the preacher
when he got thirsty.
</P>
<P>
   A lamp being held so the preacher could read the Scriptures.
</P>
<P>
   A preacher who had plowed all week and rode 10 miles horseback
to preach on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting until almost Christmastime before all the boys and many
of the girls were allowed to wear shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Axle grease used for everything from greasing the wagon to
greasing the kids for ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Flirting with serious illness if you did not wear a bag of
asafetida around your neck.
</P>
<P>
   Sassafras tea, considered a must for good health.
</P>
<P>
   The meat market coming to your door in a wagon, the meat covered
with sweet gum brush in 100-degree weather.
</P>
<P>
   When stove-fixing was a good profession.
</P>
<P>
   People saying ``Much obliged'' instead of ``Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Saddle and harness hanging on the porch.
</P>
<P>
   When cheese didn't spoil, and milk was kept cool in the well.
</P>
<P>
   Mother making hominy.
</P>
<P>
   Half-soling shoes for the family at night.
</P>
<P>
   Gathering hickory nuts.
</P>
<P>
   When apples and oranges hidden under the bed before Christmas
smelled sweeter than any perfume.
</P>
<P>
   Block and chain on a dog to keep him in the yard.
</P>
<P>
   Washing at the spring with homemade soap that took off dirt and
skin.
</P>
<P>
   Sound and smell of coffee being ground in the early morning.
</P>
<P>
   Man plowing and a colt following alongside.
</P>
<P>
   Gun rack made of limbs over the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   A farmer hog-hunting on horseback, his cur dogs muzzled.
</P>
<P>
   When mothers had no time for nervous breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Quilting parties, candy pulling, log rolling and chimney
daubing.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors digging neighbors' graves.
</P>
<P>
   Peddler selling his goods from a wagon and taking chickens for
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Burning old rags and cow chips to keep away mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer going down the trail in early morning, hollering and a
neighbor answering.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing you were afraid of for your children was a mad
dog or a fighting cow.

   SCI-LIFE-BEYOND-EARTH (Undated) _ Two prominent scientists say
the conventional wisdom the intelligent life is common beyond the
Earth is way off base. Drawing on new findings in astronomy,
geology and paleontology, the two argue that humans might be alone,
at least in the stellar neighborhood, and perhaps in the entire
cosmos. They say modern science is showing that Earth's composition
and stability are extraordinarily rare. Most everywhere else, the
radiation levels are too high, the right chemical elements too rare
in abundance, the hospitable planets too few in number and the rain
of killer rocks too intense for life ever to have evolved into
advanced communities. Alien microbes may survive in many places as
a kind of cosmic shower scum, they say, but not extraterrestrials
civilized enough to be awash in technology. By William J. Broad.

   SCI-MOTHERS (Undated) _ Dr. Sarah Blaffer Hrdy (cq) examines the
complexities of motherhood and concludes it is a barter, a supple,
ever-changing push-me pull-you negotiation between two individuals
who need each other and are closely related, but who are not clones
and so do not always see eye to eye, or breast to mouth for that
matter. Hrdy, in a new book, tells of motherhood from a distinctly
Darwinian perspective, an appraisal of how a welter of selective
forces have shaped maternal behaviors, impulses and strategies over
tens of thousands of years. By Natalie Angier.

   SCI-CLIMATE-AFRICA () _ It has become increasingly clear to
scientists that in the 10,000 years since the last ice age ended,
the world's climate has often served up droughts far surpassing
anything seen in the last 150 years, resulting in some cases in the
collapse of entire ancient civilizations. Now a new study has found
that over the last millennium in equatorial East Africa,
decades-long droughts far longer and more severe than any in
recorded weather history have alternated with periods when rainfall
was heavier than today. By William K. Stevens. (1275 words)

   SCI-CLIMATE-YELLOWSTONE (Big Sky, Mont.) _ There is mounting
concern among biologists and other researchers that global climate
change may be creating conditions in and around the Yellowstone
National Park that are inhospitable for a tree that produces a nut
crucial to wildlife. If climate warming is the real, long-term
phenomenon many experts think it is, it could set off a domino-like

people with normal vision do. And while the lenses can help people

   &UR; PREVENTION: Cutting the Risk of AIDS in Infants &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In a study of pregnant monkeys and their offspring, researchers
have given the offspring temporary immunity to a form of the AIDS
virus, using a procedure that could offer a more effective way of
blocking HIV transmission during delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Most children who become infected with HIV do not contract it
from the blood of their mothers, but from contact with mucous
membranes before and during delivery. While the drug AZT has been
shown to reduce the odds of such transmission, it is ineffective in
8 percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston
turned to a form of vaccination called passive immunization, in
which already formed antibodies are injected instead of harmless
forms of the virus that teach the body to make its own antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, scientists have isolated and reproduced
antibodies from a tiny group of people who for some reason seem to
have a natural immunity to HIV. In experiments reported in the
February issue of Nature Medicine, Dr. Ruth Ruprecht and colleagues
at Dana-Farber gave four pregnant macaques a combination of three
of these human antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   After delivery, tests showed that the antibodies had made their
way into the fetal bloodstream. The newborns were given a second
dose, then were exposed to a hybrid form of HIV. Eight days later,
they received an antibodies booster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never found the virus in the four babies over six months of
testing,'' Ruprecht said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAUSE &AMP; EFFECT: A Warm Wind and a Bad Headache &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Cold winds cause headaches everywhere. Out in western Canada,
there's a warm winter wind called the Chinook that many blame for
migraines.
</P>
<P>
   A neurologist at the University of Calgary decided it could
present an opportunity to test a new method of figuring out what
mechanisms set off migraines in particular people. A growing body
of literature has identified a number of factors that create a
predisposition for migraines, but what actually sets them off has
been left more to patients' guesses.
</P>
<P>
   Patients at the university's Headache Research Clinic are often
asked to keep written records of their pains, so Dr. W.J. Becker,
the neurologist, compared 75 of these diaries with weather reports,
looking for correlations between a Chinook and severe headaches.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in January in the journal Neurology, he reported
first that the typical patient was a poor judge of trigger
mechanisms. Seventy-nine percent said they thought that Chinooks
caused migraines. But in only 20 percent of the cases did he find
evidence that the two actually coincided.
</P>
<P>
   In that group, the link proved not to be simple. And, they fell
into two distinct camps: those whose headaches began just before a
Chinook arrived and those whose pains rose and fell with the winds.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Richard B. Lipton of the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine noted that the diary approach
could offer a more reliable way to help patients identify their
particular headache causes and in turn help them determine when to
take medicine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONSEQUENCES: When Cold Pills Don't Stop at the Nose &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The American Heart Association has issued a reminder that colds
can be bad for high blood pressure, or at least that many
decongestants can be.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, said Dr. Kathryn A. Taubert, director of the
association's cardiovascular science division, is that most
decongestants go to work by reducing the swelling of inflamed sinus
tissues, but ``don't know that they're just supposed to act on the
nose.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they can constrict blood vessels throughout the
body, raising blood pressure. In other cases, they can interfere
with the working of blood pressure medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Many patients are only moderately aware of this danger, a recent
survey found. The survey showed that while 86 percent of patients
with high blood pressure said they checked the labels of
over-the-counter medicines, half of them reported taking cold or
flu drugs that are not recommended for people with hypertension.
The survey was conducted by Schering-Plough Health Care Products,
which makes a decongestant, CoricidinHBP, that does not constrict
blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Taubert said that peering at drugstore shelves through watery
eyes was not the best way to choose an appropriate cold medicine.
People with high blood pressure ``should talk to their physician
before they get sick,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSCLE GROUPS: A Therapist's Touch on Arthritic Knees &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A twice-a-week, monthlong program of physical therapy and
exercise training significantly reduced pain levels and surgery
rates among patients with arthritic knees, according to a study in
this month's issue of The Annals of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The study, from the Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam
Houston, Texas, put 83 patients, most over 60, into randomized
trials. Half were given physical therapy and training in knee
exercises to be done in the clinic and at home; the other half
received a placebo treatment _ ultrasound too weak to have an
effect.
</P>
<P>
   After eight weeks, those receiving the real treatment had
increased the distance they could walk in six minutes by 6 percent.
Over the year that followed, only 5 percent of the treatment group
needed knee surgery compared with 20 percent of the placebo group.
Members of the treatment group also said the pain was reduced by as
much as 40 percent after only three sessions, wrote the study's
lead author, Col. Gail D. Deyle.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AT RISK: Snow Shoveling Imperils Young Men, Too &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy snow and heart attacks go together like sidewalks and ice,
health officials have long known. But how deep does the snow have
to be for the risk to go up? Not all that deep, a study of winter
deaths in Pennsylvania has found: A combination of just over an
inch of snow and temperatures below 20 degrees caused death rates
from heart attacks to triple among men 35 to 49 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The risks went up for men of all age groups. Even men younger
than 35 faced a significant increase under those conditions,
according to the study, a joint project of epidemiologists from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Pennsylvania
Department of Health. In the study, published late last year in the
American Journal of Epidemiology, mortality records and weather
records were compared to establish relationships between snow and
cold and deaths from heart attack, strokes and respiratory
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Women fared better, the study found. The only significant
increase in death rates from bad winter weather were for women
older than 65, who faced higher risks of fatal respiratory illness
or stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier research has established that prolonged exposure to cold
makes the blood more likely to clot and cause a heart attack or
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hazard, the researchers said, is probably snow
shoveling, which the article labeled ``a traditional male
activity.''

   NEW YORK _ It looks like an unusual St. Valentine's Day gift: a
heart-shaped vase of lacy, metallic lattice for your dozen red
roses. But it is your body you are supposed to squeeze into this
iron contraption from the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   Corsets _ rigid, decorative, patterned with rosebuds, laced with
pretty ribbons or embroidered with bouquets of flowers _ are on
display like so many surreal sculptures at New York's Fashion
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   And just in case you think this ancient way of reshaping the
female is history, ``The Corset: Fashioning the Body,'' which runs
until April 22, shows modern examples: from luscious bodices with
lashings of romance from Christian Lacroix haute couture, through
those saucy underwear-as-outerwear creations in which Jean Paul
Gaultier famously turned Madonna's bosoms into twin peaks.
</P>
<P>
   The show's curator, Valerie Steele, is not afraid to suggest the
corset's erotic or even fetishistic underbelly.
</P>
<P>
   That seems cute and saucy in a collection of vintage postcards
of Victorian belles swelling in their stays, but sinister when the
tortured rib cage of a current corset freak are shown in ``before
and after'' X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've replaced the boned corset with the hard body,'' says
Steele, explaining how the corset has moved from a hidden _ if
decorative _ corrective to a fashion statement. But maybe it always
was.
</P>
<P>
   Steele contrasts the steamy Belle Epoque scarlet creations for
courtesans with the ``white for chastity'' wedding corsets with
hand-span waists.
</P>
<P>
   This naughty-versus-nice spirit runs through the show, from a
bodice full of artificial roses from Charles James in 1937 to
Thierry Mugler's dominatrix in shiny vinyl and Alexander McQueen
orthopedic laced leather.
</P>
<P>
   But even today corsets can be about hearts and flowers _ as in
Anna Sui's ribbon-laced floral bodice worn with blue jeans. &QL;

<P>
   PRAGUE _ Austria's Central European neighbors, some of which
hope to join the European Union one day, have reacted cautiously to
the inclusion of Jorg Haider's xenophobic Freedom Party in the
Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
   While echoing the condemnation of the Austrian developments
heard in the West, these countries also are hesitating to shout too
loudly at a country with which their historical ties are long and
deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Central European countries think they are playing it
safe: Don't get Haider mad and keep a low profile,'' said Jiri
Pehe, head of New York University's program in Prague and a former
adviser of President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Havel and President Milan Kucan of Slovenia both roundly
condemned the compromise that has brought rightist extremists to
power in a democratic Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But Hungary and Slovakia, both of which were allied with Hitler
during the War, have played down the importance of Haider's
newfound power. The Czech government broke with Havel and also took
a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The EU move to isolate Austria has also fueled the significant
Euroskeptic movement in Central Europe. Populist politicians have
painted an intrusive and bureaucratic Union as a modern version of
the Soviet Union, which occupied the region for close to half a
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It plays well into the hands of people who describe the EU as
an interventionist organization which does not respect the
sovereignty of its members,'' said Jiri Sedivy, director of the
Institute for International Relations in Prague. ``They say, `Look
what will happen to us in five years' time.'''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Czech Parliament, Vaclav Klaus, said last
week, ``It seems very strange to me that Austrian voters elected
someone, and somebody from outside wants to dictate to them who
will be in their government.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary said he was ``surprised''
by the EU move. ``It must be considered whether anybody has the
right to intervene,'' he said, adding that the EU was ``laying out
paths which to some extent run against the will of the Austrian
people.''
</P>
<P>
   His foreign minister, Janos Martonyi, has said that Hungary does
not plan to join EU states in isolating Austria diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   In Slovakia, the deputy foreign minister, Jan Figel, said his
country, which has just joined the EU expansion short list, had to
look after its own interests first. Austria is Slovakia's biggest
trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   Relations with Austria are fraught with historic overtones.
Austria sees itself as Nazi's Germany's first victim, but
historians generally agree that Austria was a willing ally of the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   And until World War I broke up the Austro-Hungarian Empire, most
of Austria's neighbors had been its imperial subjects for
centuries. During the Cold War, Austria's neutrality made it one of
the few openings the captive countries of Eastern Europe had to the
free world.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a certain amount of sympathy for Haider's agenda
in Central Europe. Still struggling with their transitions from
communism and central planning to democracy and free markets, many
of the Central European countries have suffered the same problems
that won Haider so many votes in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Six Central European countries hope to join the EU this decade,
but Haider's party has openly called for the EU expansion eastward
to be halted and for tighter controls on immigration from what it
calls ``the East.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Haider agreed with his coalition partners, the
conservative People's Party, to support the EU's planned expansion
eastward.
</P>
<P>
   Havel, who is hospitalized with the flu, said through a
spokesman that ``what Haider has said conflicts with the principles
on which a unified Europe was built after World War II, as well as
the fundamental principles of democracy and human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Kucan said Haider's success was ``not a good omen for the future
of Europe'' and ``a danger to Slovenia,'' which had been one of the
victims of Nazism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a turning to the wrong pages of history is dangerous for
Europe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring countries are also worried by Haider's calls for
them to return confiscated property to Austrians who, as citizens
of Hitler's greater German Reich, were expelled at the end of World
War II from what is now Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. &QL;

<P>
   Lately, it has become increasingly clear to scientists that in
the 10,000 years since the last ice age ended, the world's climate
has often served up droughts far surpassing anything seen in the
last 150 years, resulting in some cases in the collapse of entire
ancient civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new study has found that over the last millennium in
equatorial East Africa, decades-long droughts far longer and more
severe than any in recorded weather history have alternated with
periods when rainfall was heavier than today.
</P>
<P>
   The droughts dwarfed any experienced by humans in the 20th
century, including the American Dust Bowl of the 1930s and the
African Sahel drought of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the earlier droughts, some of which lasted as long as
80 years, according to oral traditions cited in the study, famine
ravaged the land, provoking social and political upheaval and
forcing large-scale migrations of people.
</P>
<P>
   Given this pattern of naturally occurring, long-term variability
in precipitation, say the scientists who performed the study, there
is a ``very high probability'' that a devastating dry period,
possibly lasting decades, will visit tropical Africa again in the
next 50 to 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it would affect a human population that has doubled
in the last 25 years and is increasing its use of water even
faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to anticipate that a major catastrophic drought will
happen sooner or later, and we must prepare for such an event,''
said Dr. Dirk Verschuren, a scientist at the University of
Minnesota and the University of Ghent, in Belgium, who headed the
study.
</P>
<P>
   While such a drought would not necessarily be unremitting, he
said, it could result in large-scale crop failures lasting 10 to 15
years at a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The study by Verschuren and Kathleen R. Laird and Professor
Brian F. Cumming of Queens University in Kingston, Ontario,
appeared in a recent issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Natural long-term variations in precipitation, especially dry
periods, have long had a major impact on human societies.
Researchers have linked a 300-year drought starting about 4,200
years ago to the collapse of the world's first great empire, that
of the Akkadians in Mesopotamia.
</P>
<P>
   Drought is also believed responsible for the collapse of several
pre-Inca civilizations in South America, and to have been a major
contributor to the disappearance of the Mayan civilization in
Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 3,500 years, according to one study, drought has
been the rule in what is now California, with some dry periods
lasting as much as two centuries; today's California climate,
despite occasional dry spells, is a relatively wet exception.
</P>
<P>
   Droughts as severe as that of the 1930s Dust Bowl, according to
a recent study by federal scientists, have occurred once or twice a
century over the last 300 to 400 years. And even more severe dry
periods have in the past periodically converted big stretches of
the Great Plains to Sahara-like conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists draw such conclusions on the basis of indirect
evidence, since widespread direct measurements of weather and
climate have been in use only since the mid-19th century.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent African study, Verschuren and two associates
examined clues contained in sediments in Lake Naivasha, Kenya. Over
the centuries, the shallow lake has collected runoff from its
immediate surroundings. In the middle of the lake is a deeper
depression formed by the rim of an ancient volcano. Sediment in the
runoff has been deposited there in such a way that it has been
protected from disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   Verschuren and his colleagues extracted a 20-foot core from the
protected sediments. The strata of sediment preserved in the core
reached back 1,100 years. The scientists analyzed the core for
three types of indicators of wetness and dryness: varying kinds of
soils, the pattern of different species of algae (some thrive in
low, saltier water, others in high, fresher water), and patterns of
different species of tiny insects called midges, which are also
sensitive to salinity.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis enabled the researchers to reconstruct the climatic
history of the region, and all three indicators told the same
story: over the last millenniums, the region has experienced a
constant succession of wetter and drier periods. Most recently,
there were serious droughts in the 1870s, just before Europeans
colonized the region, and in the late 18th and early 19th
centuries. Both of these were much longer and more severe than the
Dust Bowl and the 1970s Sahel drought, which threatened millions
with starvation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the precipitation scale, rainfall was found
to have been significantly higher than today in the 17th and early
18th centuries. This coincides with some of the colder periods of
what was called, in Europe, the little ice age, a five-century span
in which unusual cold afflicted parts of the Northern Hemisphere
from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, one of the major drought periods coincided with a
relatively warm time in Europe, which lasted from about A.D. 1000
to 1270.
</P>
<P>
   The practical question raised by the findings, Verschuren said,
is that of how to plan for the eventuality of a future megadrought
in Africa, where the survival of the populace depends mostly on
rain-fed agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``These emerging agricultural economies all do their best in
trying to feed their populations, but they do so at a major cost of
water use,'' Verschuren said. ``In many cases, there is serious
overexploitation of available water resources.''
</P>
<P>
   In countries where water availability is chancy and directly
dependent on climate, he said, ``you're basically setting yourself
up for a catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to prepare for a coming megadrought, he said, would be
to switch to drought-resistant crops. Another would be to reduce
dependence on irrigation, which requires large quantities of water.
</P>
<P>
   A broader lesson to be drawn from the findings, he said, is that
irrespective of any human impact on the world's climate, there is
great natural variability in rainfall, and this variability may
swamp the effects of any global warming produced by industrial
emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   The average surface temperature of the globe is rising, and the
dominant view among scientists is that it will increase by 2 to 6
degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 if emissions of the greenhouse gases are
not reduced. While attention in the global warming debate has
focused mostly on temperature, many experts say the warming's
effect on precipitation may be more striking.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the absence of any impact by greenhouse gases,
precipitation is often of greater concern than temperature. ``Human
societies suffer much more from declining or irregular water
resources than from changes in temperature,'' Dr. Frank Oldfield,
director of the international Past Global Changes project in Bern,
Switzerland, wrote in a commentary in Nature.
</P>
<P>
   In general, a warmer atmosphere causes more water to evaporate
from the earth's surface. This phenomenon can produce heavier
rains, but it can also make droughts worse. Scientists expect both
of these to happen in the future, but they are at a loss to predict
where and when it will rain less or more.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Verschuren said, the effect of global warming on
rainfall will probably be small in comparison with the natural
variations reported in the new study. Warming in theory could
either exacerbate an African drought or alleviate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even if it does alleviate the problem,'' he said, ``it is
not going to solve it, because the beneficial effects might be
relatively minor compared to the natural variability.''

<P>
   PRAGUE _ Austria's Central European neighbors, some of which
hope to join the European Union one day, have reacted cautiously to
the inclusion of Jorg Haider's xenophobic Freedom Party in the
Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
   While echoing the condemnation of the Austrian developments
heard in the West, these countries also are hesitating to shout too
loudly at a country with which their historical ties are long and
deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Central European countries think they are playing it
safe: Don't get Haider mad and keep a low profile,'' said Jiri
Pehe, head of New York University's program in Prague and a former
adviser of President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Havel and President Milan Kucan of Slovenia both roundly
condemned the compromise that has brought rightist extremists to
power in a democratic Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But Hungary and Slovakia, both of which were allied with Hitler
during the War, have played down the importance of Haider's
newfound power. The Czech government broke with Havel and also took
a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The EU move to isolate Austria has also fueled the significant
Euroskeptic movement in Central Europe. Populist politicians have
painted an intrusive and bureaucratic Union as a modern version of
the Soviet Union, which occupied the region for close to half a
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It plays well into the hands of people who describe the EU as
an interventionist organization which does not respect the
sovereignty of its members,'' said Jiri Sedivy, director of the
Institute for International Relations in Prague. ``They say, `Look
what will happen to us in five years' time.'''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Czech Parliament, Vaclav Klaus, said last
week, ``It seems very strange to me that Austrian voters elected
someone, and somebody from outside wants to dictate to them who
will be in their government.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary said he was ``surprised''
by the EU move. ``It must be considered whether anybody has the
right to intervene,'' he said, adding that the EU was ``laying out
paths which to some extent run against the will of the Austrian
people.''
</P>
<P>
   His foreign minister, Janos Martonyi, has said that Hungary does
not plan to join EU states in isolating Austria diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   In Slovakia, the deputy foreign minister, Jan Figel, said his
country, which has just joined the EU expansion short list, had to
look after its own interests first. Austria is Slovakia's biggest
trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   Relations with Austria are fraught with historic overtones.
Austria sees itself as Nazi's Germany's first victim, but
historians generally agree that Austria was a willing ally of the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   And until World War I broke up the Austro-Hungarian Empire, most
of Austria's neighbors had been its imperial subjects for
centuries. During the Cold War, Austria's neutrality made it one of
the few openings the captive countries of Eastern Europe had to the
free world.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a certain amount of sympathy for Haider's agenda
in Central Europe. Still struggling with their transitions from
communism and central planning to democracy and free markets, many
of the Central European countries have suffered the same problems
that won Haider so many votes in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Six Central European countries hope to join the EU this decade,
but Haider's party has openly called for the EU expansion eastward
to be halted and for tighter controls on immigration from what it
calls ``the East.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Haider agreed with his coalition partners, the
conservative People's Party, to support the EU's planned expansion
eastward.
</P>
<P>
   Havel, who is hospitalized with the flu, said through a
spokesman that ``what Haider has said conflicts with the principles
on which a unified Europe was built after World War II, as well as
the fundamental principles of democracy and human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Kucan said Haider's success was ``not a good omen for the future
of Europe'' and ``a danger to Slovenia,'' which had been one of the
victims of Nazism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a turning to the wrong pages of history is dangerous for
Europe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring countries are also worried by Haider's calls for
them to return confiscated property to Austrians who, as citizens
of Hitler's greater German Reich, were expelled at the end of World
War II from what is now Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. &QL;

   PARIS _ There is considerable introspection in Europe these days
regarding the role of countries other than Nazi Germany in abetting
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In Switzerland recently, a panel of historians produced a
350-page report strongly critical of that country's wartime policy
of turning away Jews attempting to flee Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   And in Stockholm recently, political leaders and experts, most
of them from Europe, gathered to discuss how the bleak lessons
learned from their own racist past could be applied to prevent
similar outbreaks in the present.
</P>
<P>
   The current furor over political developments in Austria
resonates with memories of the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans are praising the Europeans for their new
willingness to confront a shameful past, when many looked away or
did nothing, but they seem to have forgotten that the United States
itself had a despicable record during that same era.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of the charges that have been leveled against the
Swiss and some other European countries over the question of Jewish
refugees and virulent anti-Semitism could have been directed
against the United States, Canada and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nazis were the murderers, but we were the all too passive
accomplices.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds remarkably like Jean-Francois Bergier, the historian
who headed the Swiss panel. But those were in fact the words of an
American historian, David Wyman, a Protestant, who, after years of
the most thorough research, in 1984 produced an extremely
disturbing book, ``The Abandonment of the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not talking about Switzerland but about the United States
and its allies, and his findings have not been disputed. There have
been similar books on the subject, documenting chapter and verse.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, little Switzerland accepted as many Jewish
refugees during the war _ 21,000 _ as did the vastly greater United
States. That pitifully small number represented only 10 percent of
the number who could have been legally admitted under U.S.
immigration quotas at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Jews were turned away or dissuaded from
applying for visas by U.S. officials intent on keeping the inflow
to a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   We forget how rife anti-Semitism was in the United States and
the other Allied countries during World War II. In the spring of
1942, the sociologist David Riesman described American
anti-Semitism as ``slightly below the boiling point.''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that by the summer of 1942, Washington had confirmed
accounts of Hitler's plan to exterminate the Jews. But, according
to Wyman: ``The American State Department and the British Foreign
Office had no intention of rescuing large numbers of European Jews.
On the contrary, they continually feared that Germany or other Axis
nations might release tens of thousands of Jews into Allied hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any such exodus would have placed intense pressure on Britain
to open Palestine and on the United States to take in more Jewish
refugees _ a situation the two great powers did not want to face.
Consequently, their policies aimed at obstructing rescue
possibilities and dampening public pressures for government
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, according to Wyman, British Prime Minister Anthony
Eden even opposed a joint plea from the Allies to Germany to
release the Jews because of his fear that Germany might actually
agree.
</P>
<P>
   Strong popular pressure could have made a difference. Why wasn't
it there? Anti-Semitism and anti-immigration attitudes were
widespread in American society and entrenched in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1930s, as Jews were scrambling to escape from
Europe, a Roper poll showed that 70 to 85 percent of the American
people opposed raising quotas to help Jewish refugees enter the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Even more shocking, another set of polls taken in the years
between 1938 and 1945 revealed that as much as 35 to 40 percent of
the U.S. population was prepared to approve an anti-Jewish campaign
in America. Only 30 percent would have opposed it, and the rest
would have remained indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the failure of the mass media _ including
newspapers like the New York Times _ to publicize Holocaust news,
even though the wire services and other sources made most of the
information available early on.
</P>
<P>
   Added to that were the near silence of the Christian churches
and most of their leaders and the indifference of American
political and intellectual nabobs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest American journalists, Walter Lippmann, for
instance, wrote not a single column about the Holocaust or the
death camps.
</P>
<P>
   As for President Franklin Roosevelt, according to Wyman, he did
nothing about the mass murder for 14 months after first learning
about it. And then he ``moved only because he was confronted with
political pressures he could not avoid and because his
administration stood on the brink of a nasty scandal over its
rescue policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Even most of America's Jewish leaders at the time were remiss,
caught up in internal bickering, concerned about provoking
anti-Semitism, more worried about establishing the state of Israel
than saving Jews from the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   All this is a chapter of American history that Americans have
done their best to bury and forget. They have been very successful.
</P>
<P>
   It is not enough to encourage the Germans, the Swiss and others
to deal with their past. The United States should start delving
into its own. &QL;

anti-Semitism, more worried about establishing the state of Israel
than saving Jews from the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   All this is a chapter of American history that Americans have
done their best to bury and forget. They have been very successful.
</P>
<P>
   It is not enough to encourage the Germans, the Swiss and others
to deal with their past. The United States should start delving
into its own. &QL;

 &HT;    An ounce of prevention goes far in reducing heart disease
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In our fascination with fancy technology and
shocking studies, media reports tend to miss the main points about
heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   First, heart disease is much easier and cheaper to prevent than
to repair. Second, the most valuable technologies are the ones that
identify people most likely to develop it before they need to
repair it.
</P>
<P>
   Heart surgeons can do miraculous things. But by the time a heart
patient meets a surgeon, he or she is probably assured of some
permanent damage and considerable expense, not to mention the risk
of Alzheimer's-type dementia from surgery. Doctors have to stop the
heart to perform these operations, so it's best to halt heart
disease well before needing the chain-link safety net of heart
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Computer imaging and genetic rearranging are becoming valuable
tools, but so are the somewhat older technologies of writing on
paper and growing edible vegetables. So while studies about
baldness and hormone-replacement therapy received much attention in
the past two weeks, it's too bad significant research about stress
in particular and demeanor in general was generally ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Papers like this actually divert attention from the primary
message,'' Dr. Philip Greenland, a Northwestern University
cardiologist, said of the baldness study. It correlated heart
disease with hair loss at the crown of the head but not a receding
hairline.
</P>
<P>
   Greenland dismissed the need for further research into which
lost hairs warn of heart disease, because ``about 80 to 90 percent
of what we need to prevent heart disease is already known. The
problem is that addressing those behaviors is something a lot of
Americans don't want to do, so they are looking for other
excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, let's not kid ourselves about the big roles of
high blood pressure and cholesterol, low physical activity,
smoking, obesity, diabetes, poverty and diet. In one of the
recently ignored studies, the Jan. 29 British Medical Journal
reported that what we do as adults had far more to do with who gets
heart and blood vessel disease than our birth weight, childhood
snacks and parents' social class.
</P>
<P>
   A problem with these same-old-thing studies is they are not
being supplemented with research into how to help people
realistically choose to walk more flights of stairs and eat fewer
french fries. They also aren't as eye-catching as the recent news
that postmenopausal women are 40 percent more likely to get breast
cancer if they are taking estrogen and progestin supplements.
</P>
<P>
   News reporters make their livings with words and tend not to be
very good with numbers, although the pages usually come out in the
right order. TV reporters are more candid about this flaw, actually
admitting that we are ``not going to believe'' what they're going
to tell us whenever they get around to interrupting their
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   So a few things were sadly omitted from most of these reports:
Estrogen supplements reduce the rate of heart disease; women after
menopause are more than 11 times as likely to die of heart disease
than of breast cancer, and the researchers' main point was that
choices about drugs should not be made independently of choices
about diet and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Because we probably won't all adopt Mormon lifestyles tomorrow,
it's valuable to find ways of detecting the earliest stages of
heart disease. So it's too bad so little was made of the Jan. 18
report in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association,
that mental stress can intensify potentially fatal irregular heart
rhythms, and of the report in the January Journal of Health
Psychology that stress can provoke the poor blood flow that can
cause a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The latter research showed that a five-minute mental stress test
can help reveal a person's risk for heart disease. Other research
last year recommended monitoring the progress of an older woman's
heart disease with simple question about how well she's handling
household chores. Other research has shown better ways of
interpreting the basic treadmill stress test and the heart rate
after it.
</P>
<P>
   Reports in the last year also have shown that impotence, a
spouse's heart attack and fatty deposits elsewhere in the
bloodstream are largely ignored warning signs of heart disease.
They're not as exciting as the genetic markers, newly discovered
proteins and computerized images that also signal dangers, but
they're also not as expensive. They deserve attention.

 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It's late in the afternoon and there's a peaceful,
mellow feeling in artist Gary Hernandez's studio.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez and his son Tiziano have just settled down at their
easels for a few hours of quiet father/son painting and sketching.
</P>
<P>
   In the peach-colored living room that also serves as a gallery,
Josefa Hernandez serves coffee surrounded by her husband's and
son's art.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that the Gary J. Hernandez Gallery and School
of Fine Arts is a family affair. During art openings, Hernandez's
mother-in-law pours drinks and serves home-cooked food. While
father and son create their art and Gary teaches, Josefa, known to
all as Josie, holds it all together.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez admits he's a happy man. At 46, the son of blue-collar
workers, his struggles are finally behind him. He's an artist and a
teacher, living the dream he's had since he was a child growing up
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had the desire to draw,'' Hernandez said. ``My mom
gave me an eggshell pad and pencil when I was 5.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez dates his dreams to a second-grade school visit to the
Museum of Fine Arts in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally drawn into the paintings, but I didn't know how
to be an artist,'' Hernandez recalled. ``Everyone in my family
worked as laborers.''
</P>
<P>
   It took awhile for Hernandez to pull it together, but he finally
did, and he credits his mom for his determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a tough woman, and she taught me how to work,'' he
said. ``She would tell me, `Don't give up your dreams and optimism.
Go out and get what you want, don't wait for it to come
knocking.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's a sentiment he has passed on to his son Tiziano, 25, named
after the Italian artist Titian, and to his students.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's students, several of whom have been with him since
the early '90s, say they love his low-key but meticulous teaching
method.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes a serious, methodical approach, but he doesn't teach
by humiliation,'' said Diane McManus, an attorney. ``He is very
kind. And he says, `Don't be afraid to paint and take
chances.'''Equally important to many of the students is the
welcoming feeling of the Hernandez home. Both students and
collectors become part of their large, extended family and seem to
enjoy the shared camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   Classes are available year-round, Monday through Wednesday
evenings. During breaks, Josie Hernandez serves coffee and a
dessert on the lace-covered dining table. Students can take a
break, sip a cup of coffee and visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Josie is such a gracious host to us and makes us feel so
welcome,'' said Diana Rodriguez, who works with the Houston Fire
Department. ``It's like getting away to a whole other world.''
</P>
<P>
   The intimate, friendly atmosphere is one that Gary and Josie
Hernandez enjoy, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen the corporate world, and we like this one better,''
said Gary Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   But it took him years to get there. In high school, he was
involved in art classes and encouraged by a teacher to attend
college.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, after graduation, Hernandez married Josie, his
high-school sweetheart, got a job as a graphic artist at a local
sign company and began pulling his way up the corporate ladder.
</P>
<P>
   But he hung on to his dreams and kept drawing, through the
births of two sons, Gary Jr., 27, and Tiziano. When Tiziano was 2
weeks old, the family moved into the house where they still live,
in a blue-collar north Houston neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary has always had a studio, even if it was on the kitchen
table, which it was for years,'' Josie Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   His present studio, in the former attached garage, is a far cry
from the kitchen-table years, though he's still in the middle of
family life. Hernandez constructed a door to connect the living
room/gallery with his immaculate studio, lined with drawings by the
father/son team.
</P>
<P>
   The two have always worked well together, often side by side,
from the time Tiziano was a little boy. The only bone of contention
between them is their different tastes in music. While Dad prefers
the Gypsy Kings and the Buena Vista Social Club, his son is more
into Fugazi and Limp Bizkit.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '70s, Hernandez began taking classes at the Glassell
School of Art, studying with local artists such as Dick Wray. It
was then that he started working in oil and developed his
still-evolving style.
</P>
<P>
   He describes it as classical realism, with an emphasis on color,
figurative work and landscapes _ a style that defies the Hispanic
artist label.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's another myth we are trying to dispel,'' Josie Hernandez
said. ``When people see Gary, they ask him: `Do you do murals?'
Well, not every Hispanic artist does murals.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '80s, Hernandez went on his own as a graphic
artist. But by 1986, he had decided to devote all his energies to
creating art.
</P>
<P>
   It was an exciting and scary decision for Josie and Gary. Their
sons were in Catholic schools and for a while they depended solely
on Josie's salary. His extended family had a hard time grasping the
concept of his working at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started doing art, my family thought I was home
watching TV,'' Gary Hernandez recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Then Josie came down with lupus, and Gary spent more than a year
caring for his ailing wife.
</P>
<P>
   But life gradually improved. Josie got better, though she was
told she needed to live a stress-free life and was put on
disability. That freed her to manage Gary's business affairs, while
he plunged full-force into the art world.
</P>
<P>
   At first he taught art in middle school, but ultimately he
decided to focus on adults, and joined the Art League of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   For a number of years he taught evening classes and became the
group's first Hispanic president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to know the art community because I had been by
myself for so long,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he began showing his watercolors and figurative
pieces to galleries. The reaction was mixed. While gallery owners
liked his figures, they told him that landscapes sold better.
</P>
<P>
   So Hernandez went back to the drawing board and did a series of
paintings of people and Houston skylines.
</P>
<P>
   These proved more popular with galleries, but Hernandez decided
to stay on his own. In 1993, he officially opened both the gallery
and the school.
</P>
<P>
   Josie and Gary say they love the personal touch and getting to
know collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Even more precious to Gary and Josie is the freedom they have.
</P>
<P>
   Josie has moved out of the studio to her business office in the
house, where the walls are lined with paintings on layaway. And
Gary can paint whenever he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work every day, and I have a routine,'' Gary Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I like what I'm doing I will work till 2, get up at 9 and
can't wait to back to it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also given them time to travel. Since 1997, they have
visited Britain, France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, among
other places, seeing museums, tourist spots and artists' homes. The
trips have inspired Hernandez to do a series of travel paintings
and reaffirmed his lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we visited Monet's home in France and Sorolla's in Spain,
I saw that a lot of artists did their business at home,'' Hernandez
said. ``I loved Monet's home _ pink with green shutters. He must
have had Hispanic blood. I came home saying: `I want to live with
color, too.'''Since then he has painted the exterior of his
once-gray home a bright yellow. The living room and dining room
went from gray to peach, and he will next paint his kitchen yellow.
</P>
<P>
   These days Hernandez is working with his students on an exhibit
scheduled Feb. 26. Hernandez's paintings are moved into the studio
and the students' works, including Tiziano's, cover the living room
walls.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, he casually moved from one student to
another, talking about color, shape and form, handing out advice
and tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad offers courses that are so relaxed,'' Tiziano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's happy to help you, and there's nothing you can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Tiziano, a recent graduate of the University of
Houston Downtown, sits in on the classes and draws or helps out.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, he's a talented figurative painter, but he's
also developed his own style _ classical realism with expressionist
figures and an Asian influence picked up during a semester spent in
China.
</P>
<P>
   There's already a third generation in the wings _ Gary Jr.'s
son, Andres, 2, who has his own easel.
</P>
<P>
   Ever changing his style, Gary Hernandez next plans to try his
hand at religious and narrative art. He's proud of his
accomplishments, which include paintings exhibited in New York and
Houston galleries and at the Contemporary Arts Museum. Recently,
one of his watercolors was used on the cover of Tony Diaz's book
``Latino Heretics.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes one day to have a painting in the Museum of Fine Arts
collection. That would make his life come full circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe then I would inspire someone, just like I was
inspired,'' he said.

 &HT;    USE OF SUPPLEMENTS FOR MORNING SICKNESS IS DEREGULATED
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Monday
gave manufacturers the right to sell herbal remedies and other
``natural'' products to treat morning sickness without first
proving that the preparations are safe for unborn children.
</P>
<P>
   The rule went into effect despite objections from health
advocates and experts on birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   The agency declared that the bouts of nausea which plague at
least one-third of all pregnant women are not actually a disease.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, when supplement makers say their preparations relieve
it, they will not be legally claiming to treat a disease.
</P>
<P>
   That means they will not have to prove in advance that the
products are effective, or even safe, as drug manufacturers must.
</P>
<P>
   The exemption also applies to leg edema, or bloating, associated
with pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle has only begun,'' Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the
Public Citizen Health Research Group, said Monday. ``We are going
to keep pressing on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe and Dr. Godfrey Oakley Jr., a birth defects expert at
Emory University in Atlanta, wrote to FDA Commissioner Jane Henney
last week, objecting to the rule.
</P>
<P>
   They said the FDA ``seems to have thrown caution to the wind and
appears willing to endanger unborn babies by pretending that
medical condition such as morning sickness and edema of pregnancy
are not diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the products have never been tested in pregnant
women,'' Oakley said Monday. ``Something that might be viewed as
generally safe in an adult could be quite harmful to a fetus,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate letter to Henney, Dr. Philip J. Landrigan of Mt.
Sinai Medical Center in New York warned that the FDA was failing
``to recognize the unique vulnerability of the fetus and infants to
patent medications.''
</P>
<P>
   Landrigan, former chairman of a National Academy of Sciences
committee on the effect of pesticides on the diets of children and
infants, said the rule ``fails to recognize the unique
vulnerability of the fetus and infants to patent medications,'' or
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   The provision was included in new supplement labeling
requirements. The burgeoning food supplements industry had lobbied
against regulating pregnancy as a ``disease.''
</P>
<P>
   When the FDA published a preliminary draft of the labeling rule
in 1998, it did not include the language declaring that morning
sickness and edema are not diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The agency received more than 220,000 comments on the draft
rule, including many from supplement users who thought it would
restrict their access to the preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Dickinson, vice president for scientific and regulatory
affairs of the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a supplements
industry trade group, said she hoped the industry could work with
concerned physicians such as Wolfe and Oakley to develop labeling
requirements to protect fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that some supplements, such as vitamins and folic
acid, are recommended for pregnant women.

   His necktie was defiantly ripped away. His old-fashioned
mustache was shaved off. All but rocking on the soles of his feet
and snapping his fingers to illustrate his with-it-ness, the new
boss of AOL Time Warner Inc. announced to the world, ``I am a
 &UR; broadband &LR;  person.''
</P>
<P>
   As if that transmogrification were not enough, Gerald M. Levin,
age 60{ _ and until now a fairly dignified executive _ added
plaintively that ``I'm an interactive guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But  &UR; interactive &LR;  is yesterday's word, for years meaning
``acting upon each other'' and then meaning ``reciprocating by
electronic means''; now used mainly by aging Wunderkinder straining
to keep pace, it awaits the coinage of its opposite,
 &UR; interinactive &LR; , ``a one-way flow of data.'' Hip, connected
e-lexies in this winter of our content provision focused on his
 &UR; broadband &LR;  personhood.
</P>
<P>
   That word has a glorious history in the northern dialects of
Britain. ``The verie euill thoughts of the wicked,'' wrote Zachary
Boyd in ``Last Battell,'' his 1629 masterpiece, ``in that day
shalbe spread out and laide in  &UR; broad-band &LR;  before the face of
God.'' James O. Halliwell, in his 1847 Dictionary of Archaic and
Provincial Words, reminded us that a  &UR; band &LR;  was a space 20 yards
square, and  &UR; broad-band &LR;  was ``corn laid out in the sheaf on the
band, and spread out to dry after rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Over three centuries, the  &UR; band &LR;  evolved from a marked-out strip
of land into ``a range of radio frequencies or wavelengths.'' In
1956, W.A. Heflin's U.S. Air Force Dictionary defined  &UR; broadband &LR; 
as ``a band having a wide range of frequencies.''
</P>
<P>
   In our time, it morphed into a medium that not only transmits a
wide range of radio, video and data signals, but also can carry
other independent channels in their own bandwidths, or space on the
band. (On these multiple spaces the communicators still seem to lay
out wet corn.)
</P>
<P>
   Then metaphor began to beat the  &UR; broadband &LR; . The adjective
(sometimes hyphenated) is still used to describe multiplex
communications networks, but in more sweeping terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a  &UR; broad-band &LR;  world,'' wrote Andrew Sullivan in The New
York Times, ``even the distinctions among telephone wires, cables
and satellites will be erased. There will be one cultural-economic
tube.'' The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel wrote of ``the  &UR; broad-band &LR; 
war, the struggle over who will control the ability to deliver
seamless streams of data to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, in an interinactive linguistic breakthrough, Levin has
extended the metaphor from networks to human beings. ``I am a
 &UR; broadband &LR;  person'' means more, in my view, than ``I work in an
industry characterized by simultaneous transmission of multiple
channels.'' It means that he sees himself as a person with
 &UR; broadband &LR;  personal characteristics _ able to think, speak,
gesture, persuade, broadcast and data-disseminate in an unlimited
way, while chewing gum at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Look at yourself, dear reader. Are you a  &UR; narrowband &LR;  person,
cribbed, cabin'd and confined in a strait gate _ or are you the
sort whose mind ranges far out over the amber waves of corn? By
rejecting the ``verie euill thoughts of the wicked,'' you, too, can
mega-merge yourself into a  &UR; broadband &LR;  person.
</P>
<P>
   If that's your choice, move quickly to so identify yourself,
because telecommuning lingo changes fast, and  &UR; broadband &LR;  is sure
to be crowded out soon.
</P>
<P>
   THE AGNOSTIC BIT
</P>
<P>
   ``Bits are  &UR; agnostic &LR; ,'' Bill Gates, self-dethroned boss of
Microsoft, told Forbes' ASAP magazine. ``They don't care how they
get where they are going _ only that they arrive in the right order
and at the right moment.''
</P>
<P>
   William Marmon of Chevy Chase, Md., demands a ruling as soon as
possible: ``Has  &UR; agnostic &LR;  _ `holding the belief that the ultimate
reality on matters such as the existence of God is unknowable' _
been successfully morphed by high tech to mean `indifferent'?
Everywhere one hears the word used in this perverted manner. Where
do you stand?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hier stehe ich &LR; , in the phrase of one unwaveringly opinionated
Worms dieter. In theology and usage, I react religiously.
</P>
<P>
   The etymology of  &UR; agnostic &LR;  is plain. It's Greek for ``not
known.'' Here's how it was coined to describe the position held by
people who are neither atheists nor believers: ``It was suggested
by Professor ((Thomas)) Huxley at a party ... one evening in 1869,
in my hearing,'' wrote R.H. Hutton in 1881. ``He took it from St.
Paul's mention of the altar to `the Unknown God.'''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Kissinger, in his 1979 memoirs, ``The White House Years,''
was among the first to give the word a metaphoric stretch: ``I
favored European unity, but I was  &UR; agnostic &LR;  about the form it
should take.'' The intended meaning (I have always been able to
read Henry's mind) was more ``noncommittal'' than either
``undecided'' or ``indifferent.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 Warren Buffett, the investor, treated the word as a
verbal shrug: ``I look at stocks, not markets. I am a market
 &UR; agnostic &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Broadbandniks in the computer world have adopted that stretch
toward neutrality. ``We will deliver `infrastructure  &UR; agnostic &LR; '
solutions,'' announced Steven Francesco, CEO of N(x) Networks,
``that can handle both voice and data and be deployed over
virtually any network.'' (The odd-looking company name is
pronounced ``nex'' or ``nix''; the new  &UR; agnostics &LR; , professing a
hands-off attitude, sometimes take a negative approach.)
</P>
<P>
   Another computer executive, holding that the alliance of Dell
and Red Hat came as no surprise, commented, ``They've always been
operating-system  &UR; agnostic &LR; .'' At Microsoft, Gates' usage gives the
reheated term about bits a sense of ``indifferent'' to the point of
``uncaring.''
</P>
<P>
   Can we ever know if this new meaning _ as in ``Frankly,
Scarlett, I'm  &UR; agnostic &LR; '' _ will overtake the theological sense?
</P>
<P>
   Sure we can. Give the voguish jargon a little time; this
anomie-tooism will pass because it is a highbrow term that lacks
specificity.  &UR; Neutral &LR;  passively takes no side;  &UR; noncommittal &LR; 
suggests a more active refusal to take a side;  &UR; indifferent &LR; 
describes a mild state of apathy;  &UR; unconcerned &LR;  imputes aloofness;
and  &UR; uncaring &LR;  has a hint of cruelty. But the new  &UR; agnostic &LR; 
wanders all over the lot.

&HT;     GROUP CLAIMS TO HAVE NEW EVIDENCE IN WACO SIEGE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DICK J. REAVIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Volunteers rebuilding David Koresh's chapel at the
Branch Davidian compound near here say they found an incendiary
device, allegedly fired by government agents trying to end the
standoff with the cult leader in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But the volunteers, who announced the discovery on an Internet
page, have declined to turn the alleged evidence over to the
authorities. And it appears to be about the size of a D-cell
battery.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Branch Davidian church and residential complex
burned to the ground on April 19, 1993, there has been speculation
that government agents, not Koresh or his followers, ignited the
fire that killed some 80 people, including several children.
</P>
<P>
   Similar charges are being raised in a wrongful death lawsuit
brought by survivors of the assault.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, scheduled for trial in mid-May, alleges that
pyrotechnic rounds fired by federal agents, ``probably caused
and/or contributed to the spread and intensity of the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the search for a fire-starting device has produced at
least three promising objects, the plaintiffs' charges have yet to
be confirmed. Last summer, Colorado filmmaker Michael McNulty, one
of the figures behind the Emmy-award-winning documentary, ``Waco:
The Rules of Engagement,'' claimed to have found the mystery
devices.
</P>
<P>
   While searching through the contents of a vault of evidence kept
at the Texas Department of Public Safety headquarters in Austin,
McNulty found three objects, 40mm in diameter, labeled by the Texas
Rangers as rifle silencers.
</P>
<P>
   McNulty said they are flash-bang grenades, capable of igniting
fires. The documentary filmmaker explained his findings to the
Rangers, who in August promised to confirm, or deny, his charges _
but the Rangers have not yet said what their examination concluded.
</P>
<P>
   McNulty's claims led to confirmation by retired FBI agents that
pyrotechnic 40mm tear gas rounds had been used at the Branch
Davidian compound. But they said the rounds were not used against
wooden buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has appointed a special counsel, former
Sen. John C. Danforth of Missouri, to investigate the government's
handling of the assault at the Branch Davidian compound near Waco.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-January, while rebuilding the church, volunteers found a
burned artifact that they took to be the remains of an incendiary
device, an illumination round, or maybe, a flash-bang grenade. They
promptly posted a photo on the group's site,
``rebuildthechurch.com,'' identifying the object as a ``pyrotechnic
grenade recently unearthed during clean up.''
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers say they do not trust the government to
investigate the item and are hiding it.
</P>
<P>
   The item is about 2 inches tall, and in the pile of rubble where
they found it, there was a wad of crusty gray material, which the
volunteers suspect is the remnant of a propellant charge.
</P>
<P>
   But its base measures 32mm in diameter, not 40mm _ the size of
D-cell batteries, not military pyrotechnic rounds. On the inner
side of the object's base is a plastic ring, marked by its
manufacturer into five sections. One of the sections bears the
letters ``APC,'' and adjacent section, the notation ``JI.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a technical adviser for the Eveready Battery Co. said
that APC is a code on its products, denoting ``a contractor that we
used for subassembly.'' The wadding found with the alleged
incendiary includes a small strip of cloth, like the cloth strips
that are used to envelop the electrolytes in batteries today.

1.6 MILLION CYBERLINGS GO A-HUNTING FOR ALIENS

   Earthlings are so enamored of aliens that 1.6 million of them in
224 countries have recently joined an effort that harnesses home
and office computers to the job of sifting through a few zillion
radio bands to hunt for signs of intelligent life among the stars.
</P>
<P>
   The SETI(AT)home project of the University of California at
Berkeley uses idle computers linked to the Internet to plow through
signals collected by the huge dish at Arecibo, Puerto Rico,
searching for intelligently made radion signals amid the celestial
static. The biggest of all the world's radio telescopes, at 1,000
feet in diameter, it is also the best single antenna for gathering
faint signals.
</P>
<P>
   Through the Internet, the project distributes software that
enables home computer users to help scientists crunch Arecibo data
in what its creators call the world's largest ad hoc supercomputer.
The software works as a screen saver, analyzing data only when
computers are idle. Once the data have been analyzed, a process
that can take days, they are returned to Berkeley for another slice
of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Since May, when the project started, volunteers have donated
165,000 years of computing time to analyzing radio emissions from
outer space.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top performers listed on the website: Sun Microsystems
(287 years of computer time), Intel Performance Labs (199 years),
the Computer Aided Engineering lab at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison (89 years), America Online (71 years), Microsoft
(41 years), Fermi National Laboratory (59 years), Pixar (29 years),
Compaq Telecom Engineering (26 years), A.W. Spence Middle School in
Dallas (25 years), Frank Terhaar in Yonkers, N.Y. (24 years) and
someone named Jean-Luc Picard (six years).
</P>
<P>
   ``So far we don't have any really exciting signals,'' said Dan
Werthimer, the project's chief scientist. ``But it's early in the
game. We've only just begun and Earthlings are pretty primitive in
this field. We're just scratching the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Free hunt software can be downloaded from
www.setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu, which has been done 1.6 million
times, Werthimer said. Among the effort's sponsors are the
Planetary Society, the University of California, Sun Microsystems,
Fuji Film, Paramount Pictures, Intel, the SETI Institute and
private donors.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Austria's far right poses concerns
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have Western Europe and U.S. capitals gone overboard in reaction
to the new coalition government in Austria? Have they shunned it
diplomatically as if it were a pariah just because one of the
principals in its new regime has a history of soft-on-Nazi
utterances?
</P>
<P>
   No to both questions. While it is true that Joerg Haider, the
controversial leader of the new-to-power Freedom Party, won't hold
a position in the coalition, he is expected to have a profound
influence on policy-making in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   And that bodes no good. Here is a man whose parents were rabid
Nazis and who presides over an estate once owned by Jews who had to
flee. Here is a man who complimented Adolf Hitler's ``orderly''
employment policies, who saluted veterans of Waffen SS death squads
as ``decent people of good character'' and put a reverse spin on
places like Auschwitz and Dachau, calling them ``punishment
camps.''
</P>
<P>
   All those remarks, he says, were mistakes, and he's sorry about
them.
</P>
<P>
   But Haider's word isn't worth much. Last weekend, for instance,
no sooner had he signed a declaration forced on him by Austrian
President Thomas Klestil in which Haider had to denounce
xenophobia, anti-Semitism and racism than he repudiated the
declaration as ``an affront to the Austrian public.''
</P>
<P>
   He then went on to startle history-sensitive Europeans by
suggesting Sudeten Germans expelled from Czechoslovakia after World
War II were entitled to the same sympathy and compensation as Jews
rousted by the Nazis. No doubt he also caused a ripple of fear in
Vienna by hinting that Klestil should be investigated for treason.
</P>
<P>
   Why should the West be concerned over Austria? Partly because it
never came to grips with its Nazi past as Germany had to do after
World War II. Partly because the ultranationalist, anti-immigrant
sentiment that lured thousands of Austrians to Haider's party
resonates in more important countries like France, Italy, Germany
and Britain, threatening years of effort toward economic
integration and away from cross-border frictions.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that it's OK to bring elements into a government that
only pay lip service to democracy and the rule of law should have
no place in a civilized Europe. And the place to make that point is
Austria.

 &HT;    Clinical tests offer alternatives
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There must be something more I can do.'' It's a common
reaction in health care, both from people just diagnosed with a
potentially life-threatening illness and from patients and family
members dealing with a long-lasting chronic problem.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the ``something else'' turns out to be enrolling in a
clinical trial: a test of a new medicine or treatment on a group of
volunteers that allows limited enrollment and is performed under
strict medical and ethical guidelines. Members of trials can have
access to drugs or dosages that are not yet on the market, though
they usually don't know what they're taking and are given no
assurance that it will work.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, though time-consuming, to find clinical trials by
talking to specialists and calling medical centers. A new Web site,
drugMonitor (drugmonitor.com/default.htm), offers to make that
process easier by providing a free nationwide gateway to trials
that are recruiting patients. The site allows you to search for
trials by disease or by geographical location, and it offers
automatic e-mail notification of new trials as they are registered.
The site, launched in January, is well-designed but looks
low-traffic; at the moment, it lists only trials for allergies,
arthritis, asthma, back pain, heart disease, depression and
insomnia.

 &HT;    Make sure romantic soak in hot tub is clean, safe
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With Valentine's Day around the corner, it's the
season of tub.
</P>
<P>
   But before lovebirds take a romantic dip in a whirlpool or a hot
tub, perhaps they should share a little special time with rubber
gloves and bleach.
</P>
<P>
   Some public health officials and physicians are concerned that
people simply looking for a soak could walk away with respiratory
problems, urinary tract infections, rashes or even life-threatening
illnesses from unsanitary or improperly cleaned tubs and baths in
hotels, resorts and inns.
</P>
<P>
   Little research has been done on the subject. But critics say
few of these hot tubs _ or the newly promoted individual jet tubs _
outside the home are maintained diligently. And unlike therapeutic
tubs used in health care settings, which have strict guidelines and
inspections, there is far less oversight over similar hotel
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real lack of data in this area,'' said Matthew
Arduino, a hospital-infections specialist with the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. ``I would like to say the risk is
low. But the problem is, it is hard for us to gauge even that,
since we're only called in during outbreaks.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two decades, Arduino said public whirlpools and hot
tubs have been the primary source of several confirmed outbreaks of
disease. Among the culprits: Pontiac fever, a flulike illness
caused by the same water-dwelling organism that causes
Legionnaires' disease; folliculitis, an itchy skin rash; and
respiratory illnesses such as bronchitis. One case also involved a
10-year-old girl who contracted atopic eczema _ a skin inflammation
_ after sharing a hot tub with a friend who had fever blisters
caused by herpes simplex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to ruin anybody's romantic evening, but I have no idea why
anyone would want to sit in all that yuck,'' said Dr. Dean Edell, a
syndicated San Francisco talk-show host and physician who has
crusaded against public hot tubs. His show airs from 8 p.m. to 1
a.m. Saturdays on WGST.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is high enough that medical facilities have rigorous
standards for cleaning and maintaining hot tub equipment. CDC
guidelines require sufficient chlorine levels in medical tubs and
recommend that they be drained and disinfected between patients,
Arduino said.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel and motel tubs are a different matter. More hotels are
buying whirlpools, jet and hot tubs in recent years, according to
leading manufacturers (although they would not release sales
figures). But it's unclear how well they are being cleaned and
monitored, Edell said.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, local health departments are required to inspect
hotels and motels for cleanliness and check their pools and tubs
for proper chlorination. But each county determines how often that
occurs, according to Barbara Joye, state health department
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only been one outbreak in the past five years that was
brought to our attention,'' Joy said. ``But we don't know about
everything that goes on out there.'' The outbreak of Pontiac fever
infected a handful of people in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And individual jet tubs, as opposed to larger, more powerful and
complex whirlpools and hot tubs, can be even more problematic.
Although health inspectors in Georgia do spot-checks of the tubs as
part of a hotel bathroom's general cleanliness, there is no special
procedure for checking the jet tubs' pipes, Joye said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, these devices are a breeding ground for microorganisms.
``Bio-film'' _ the slime of soap, body oils and other trapped
debris that clings to the pipes _ can promote such growth.
</P>
<P>
   So where do hotels learn how to keep these tubs clean? The
American Hotel and Motel Association has standards for swimming
pools, but not tubs. The National Spa and Pool Institute, an
industry group, offers a brochure for homeowners but does not
typically address commercial use of hot tubs and whirlpools. In
addition, uniform cleaning guidelines don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution called 10 hotels for
information about their cleaning procedures. Only one _ the Four
Seasons Hotel in Midtown_ called back with a detailed explanation.
At the Ritz-Carlton Atlanta, such cleaning information is
``proprietary,'' according to spokeswoman Sandra Ryder. In Stone
Mountain, Ga., a Holiday Inn receptionist who would not give her
name, said the hotel's jet tubs were cleaned ``with a toothbrush by
the pool guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining seven metro Atlanta hotels _ a Hampton Inn, a
Comfort Inn, a Best Western, a Courtyard By Marriott, a Drury Inn,
a La Quinta Inn and a Hyatt Hotel _ did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   So what can you do to make sure the only gifts you get during
Valentine's Day are flowers and candy?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask the hotel management how it cleans and maintains its
whirlpools and hot tubs. And if it's a communal hot tub, ask them
when they last changed the water and checked the pH levels,
according to Jack Cergol, director of communications for the
National Spa and Pool Institute. The pH levels should fall between
7.2 and 7.8.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure that the drain is topped with what's known as an
``anti-vortex cover,'' which can prevent suction injuries. Although
the cover doesn't have anything to do with germs, its absence
indicates a serious lack of maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If all else fails, lovebirds can take the same steps
manufacturers recommend homeowners take to clean their private jet
tubs: Pour 2 ounces of bleach into the filled tub and let it run
through the system. Then drain the water and refill the tub before
using.

 &HT;    McCain stands tall on this week's covers
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judging from the covers of the newsweeklies, you'd think John
McCain was the Man of the Century. Instead, the war hero, Arizona
senator and presidential candidate is simply the man of the hour in
the wake of his surprise victory in the New Hampshire primary. Can
he sustain the momentum? That's the question all the pundits are
asking. One factor in his favor, says Time ($3.50), is that half
the state primaries through March 14 allow independents _ who seem
to be favoring McCain _ to vote Republican or Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   In Newsweek's ($3.50) analysis package, Jonathan Alter examines
the candidate's wild ride and wonders whether his refreshingly
straight-talking, spontaneous approach will lead to pitfalls or the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More Rocker reaction: Speaking of outspokenness and
spontaneity, U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($3.50) columnist John Leo
weighs in on the John Rocker controversy and major-league
baseball's punishment. Though not defending Rocker (he calls him
``a bigoted oaf''), Leo takes exception to Commissioner Bud Selig's
role as arbiter of politically correct behavior. Asks Leo: Why
punish speech when you don't punish actions?
</P>
<P>
   ``Selig didn't suspend the Colorado Rockies pitcher who recently
pleaded guilty to beating his wife or the Arizona Diamondbacks
reliever charged with smacking his wife around as their young child
watched. Surely these cases, too, had a negative effect on the
salability of baseball as a wholesome product.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Peanuts and pop-ups: The New Yorker ($3) has long been known
as much for its humor as its serious pieces. Two brilliant examples
in the current issue are ``Abstract Thought Is a Warm Puppy,'' Art
Spiegelman's illustrated elegy for Charles Schulz's ``Peanuts,''
and Georgia writer Frank Gannon's version of VH1's pop-up video as
it applies to English literature.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-page strip, Spiegelman brings together his Maus
creation with Schulz's Snoopy. Perched atop Snoopy's house, Maus
reflects on ``Peanuts'' and its influence: ```Peanuts' was `about
nothing' years before Jerry Seinfeld was even born.''
</P>
<P>
   Gannon, meanwhile, adds pop-up humor to three famous literary
passages: John Donne's ``Holy Sonnet 10,'' Andrew Marvell's ``To
His Coy Mistress'' and Dylan Thomas' ``Do Not Go Gentle Into That
Good Night.'' For example, Gannon's pop-up to Marvell's opening
lines, ``Had we but world enough and time, this coyness, Lady, were
no crime,'' is ``Sodomy is still a crime in Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Ramsey business: In the year after JonBenet Ramsey's
death, Brill's Content ($3.95) reports, 804 children age 12 or
younger were murdered in the United States. Why, then, did the
Boulder, Colo., case become such a media sensation? Brill's
reporter Katherine Rosman attributes it to the media's hunger for
the ``Next Big Story'' after O.J. Simpson and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a cottage industry of books and TV shows. A
CBS TV movie based on Lawrence Schiller's book ``Perfect Murder,
Perfect Town'' is scheduled to air Feb. 17 and March 1. Seven books
about the case are already on the shelves, with two more on the way
this spring. Former Boulder police Detective Steve Thomas'
``JonBenet: Inside the Ramsey Murder Investigation'' is due in
April, and John and Patsy Ramsey's book, ``Death of Innocence,'' is
scheduled for March publication.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean the Ramseys expect to profit from their child's
murder? The Ramseys' lawyer insists that any proceeds will be used
to pay off legal debts, with the remainder donated to the JonBenet
Ramsey Children's Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Slimmer singer: Look up the word ``diva'' in the dictionary,
and you're likely to find a picture of Mariah Carey. At least
that's the portrait Mim Udovitch paints in an entertaining Rolling
Stone ($3) interview. Carey, shot in several revealing poses, talks
about her music, her affair with New York Yankees star Derek Jeter
and her dieting obsession after Joan Rivers' catty remark about her
weight at last year's Academy Awards. Also of note is a guide to
the hottest spring-break destinations for college students. Yes,
Panama City Beach is still on the list, along with South Padre
Island, Texas, and Daytona Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Big news: Noting that more than 13 million Americans report
having vision problems, Time has introduced a large-print edition.
The easier-to-read version also is aimed at those who like to read
while working out on a stationary bike or StairMaster. Time Large
is available, by subscription only, for $79.97 annually.

geology and paleontology, the two argue that humans might be alone,
at least in the stellar neighborhood, and perhaps in the entire
cosmos. They say modern science is showing that Earth's composition
and stability are extraordinarily rare. Most everywhere else, the
radiation levels are too high, the right chemical elements too rare
in abundance, the hospitable planets too few in number and the rain
of killer rocks too intense for life ever to have evolved into
advanced communities. Alien microbes may survive in many places as
a kind of cosmic shower scum, they say, but not extraterrestrials
civilized enough to be awash in technology. By William J. Broad.

almost as central as the gunfire itself. Two witnesses for the
prosecution have testified to a pause in the 41 shots fired, and
more are expected to do so. While defense lawyers say the pause is
meaningless, prosecutors maintain the pause could have given the
officers the opportunity to think about their actions before firing
again. By Amy Waldman.

   In theory, anyone can grow up to be president. In practice, the
next president is going to be a graduate of Harvard, Yale,
Princeton or the Naval Academy. He will also be either the son of a
senator, the son of a president and grandson of a senator, the son
and grandson of an admiral, or -- the humblest background and
longest shot in the group -- the son of a Midwestern banker. Given
the small slice of the population these privileged backgrounds
represent, we have here a spectacular breakdown in the law of
averages. Either that or an interesting perspective on American
society.

</P>
<P>
   Why do so many people support George W. Bush? Because they think
he's electable, because Republican leaders support him, and because
Republican donors have united behind him. In short, people support
him because other people support him. This is what stock market
analysts call a speculative bubble. Prick the confidence and the
bubble bursts. Think of Bush as an Internet company. What are his
expenses so far? Reportedly $35 million. And what are his earnings?
An 11-point win in Iowa and an 18-point defeat in New Hampshire. So
why do people keep buying his stock? Because it keeps going up, as
measured by polls and campaign-finance reports.

</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so long ago that sports fields were the devil's
playground. Babe Ruth could commit five of the seven deadly sins
before noon and hit three home runs by dinner. But today there are
Angels in the Outfield, and God seems to be following pro football
more intently than any Vegas bookie. Post-game prayer circles
include players from both teams. Every NFL team has a chaplain --
invariably an evangelical -- who holds Bible studies and weekend
chapels. Coaches like religion in the locker room because it can
straighten out otherwise wild or reprobate players. And
evangelicals are thrilled about it. ``They believe that God has
raised up big-time sport as a means to evangelism,'' says Wheaton
College Professor James Mathisen, co-author of Muscular
Christianity: Evangelical Protestants and the Development of
American Sport.

   4. RELATIVISM DIDN'T START WITH EINSTEIN, by David Greenberg
</P>
<P>
   According to Time, person of the century Albert Einstein is
responsible for the 20th century's moral relativism and artistic
modernism. What hooey! Amid December's bickering over whether
Einstein deserved Time's person of the century accolades, no one
stopped to question the sweeping claims the magazine made on the
genius's behalf. Einstein himself often insisted that his theories
had no relevance for anything except science. He called the
hullabaloo surrounding his findings ``psychopathological'' and he
disabused those who would misapply his ideas. You might argue that
even if the pioneers of modernism misunderstood Einstein, they were
still reflecting his influence in working with bowdlerized versions
of his theories. Alas, that's also wrong. Most of the great works
of modernism began (and some were completed) before Einstein's
ideas entered the culture.

mistake to think that investors, as individuals, are devoting
almost no attention to the riskiness of their investments. Somehow,
the fact that the price you pay for the possibility of a high
upside is the possibility of a very real downside has eluded
investors. The consequences of this are not going to be pleasant.

 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are a number of things government should not do. Pushing
religion is one of them; telling people when and how to pray is
another. Some Colorado legislators, however, don't see a problem
with state government intruding on its citizens' private religious
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Legislature is set to vote on a measure that would
mandate the posting of the Ten Commandments in every public school
classroom and in the main entryway of every public school in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Eight other states are currently considering legislation to
authorize state governments to push the Ten Commandments on the
citizens of their states: Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky,
Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Whose Ten Commandments _ the Jewish, Catholic, Lutheran,
Protestant?
</P>
<P>
   The text of the Ten Commandments that must be posted, according
to the Colorado bill, ``is a compromise version.'' Neither this nor
that, neither Jewish nor Protestant. The Colorado legislature's
version of the Ten Commandments more closely conforms to the
Catholic version.
</P>
<P>
   That's what you get when government tells you what the Ten
Commandments are _ a mishmash that glosses over the deep
theological questions and controversies involved in the wording and
selection from the 16 laws set down in Exodus.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Colorado legislation also mandates a brief period
of ``quiet reflection'' at the start of every school day, ``with
the participation of all the pupils therein assembled.'' The law
requires teachers to announce the period of reflection with these
words: ``The class will now observe a moment of silence for
reflection on our heritage as a free people in one nation under
God.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that the period of quiet reflection is
meant as a moment of prayer. The legislative declaration makes it
clear by creating the context in which this bill's mandates exist.
The declaration mentions a ``Supreme Being and the authority of
transcendent standards for human conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the requirement to post the Ten Commandments in public
schools and the mandated brief period of quiet reflection for
public school students are in direct conflict with the state's
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In Article II, Section 4, the Colorado Constitution states: ``No
person shall be required to attend or support any ministry or place
of worship, religious sect or denomination against his consent. Nor
shall any preference be given by law to any religious denomination
or mode of worship.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the issue of a state
requiring a moment of silence at the beginning of the public school
day. An Alabama law required the moment of silence to be used for
``meditation or voluntary prayer.'' In Wallace vs. Jaffree, the
high court found the state law had a religious purpose and was
therefore unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Children can pray in public schools, on their own initiative, as
long as no student is coerced into joining or listening and the
activity does not interfere with the normal running of the school.
But the state cannot force anyone to pray or to join others in
prayer, even silent prayer. Religion is not within the state's
province.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's proposed legislation's mandated version of the Ten
Commandments seems, by default, to give preference to the Catholic
religion. It certainly doesn't conform to the Jewish version of the
Ten Commandments in which the first commandment states, ``I am the
Lord your God'' and the sixth commandment states, ``You shall not
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it conform to the Protestant version of the Ten
Commandments, which includes in the second commandment a
prohibition against graven images. The 10th commandment in the
Protestant version forbids coveting your neighbor's house and
coveting your neighbor's wife. The Colorado Legislature's version
separates those prohibitions into the ninth and the 10th
commandments, as does the Catholic version of the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature's mandated Ten Commandments definitely violates
the Colorado Constitution's requirement: ``Nor shall any preference
be given by law to any religious denomination or mode of worship.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it didn't show preference to Catholicism, it would show
preference to Judeo-Christian religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Of the other eight states considering Ten Commandments
legislation, seven _ Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky,
Mississippi, Missouri, South Dakota _ have state constitutions
forbidding state government from intruding upon the religious
consciences of their citizens or giving preference to any religion.
Oklahoma is the only exception.
</P>
<P>
   However, the U.S. Supreme Court spoke to this issue in 1980 with
the case, Stone vs. Graham. A Kentucky statute had required the
posting of the Ten Commandments on the wall of every public school
classroom in the state. The high court struck down the Kentucky law
for violating the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The high court wrote: ``The Ten Commandments are undeniably a
sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faith, and no legislative
recitation of a supposed secular purpose can blind us to that fact.
The Commandments do not confine themselves to arguably secular
matters, such as honoring one's parents, killing or murder,
adultery, stealing, false witness, and covetousness. Rather, the
first part of the Commandments concerns the religious duties of
believers: worshiping the Lord God alone, avoiding idolatry, not
using the Lord's name in vain, and observing the Sabbath Day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ten Commandments is a religious document. However, there is
no agreement on exactly what constitutes the Ten Commandments.
There is no standard version. The Bible lists more than 10
commandments. And Jewish and Christian theologians have debated the
issues involved for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   States have no right to push any religion's version of the Ten
Commandments on their citizens. That's precisely what the
Establishment Clause means. States cannot favor any religion or set
of beliefs. This nation is home to nearly 2,000 different
religions, denominations and religious beliefs. Any preference
shown toward one or a group of religions discriminates against the
others.
</P>
<P>
   Public schools and public buildings must show neutrality toward
all religions so that none are favored or are seen to be favored.
Children and citizens of all religious faiths have a right to equal
treatment by all government agencies, including the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable that state legislatures may be reacting to
the tragedies suffered as a result of a number of school shootings
around the nation. However, posting the Ten Commandments in public
schools is merely a symbolic gesture and not a solution to the
troubling social problems that cry to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than spending thousands of dollars to purchase tens of
thousands of copies of the Ten Commandments, it would be wiser to
use that money to pay for in-depth sociological and psychological
studies of the school-shooting incidents to see whether it is
possible to discern the reasons behind those disasters. That would
be a first step to finding a real solution.

`GERTRUDE AND CLAUDIUS': GERTRUDE FINDS TRUE LOVE IN UPDIKE'S
VERSION OF `H' 
</HEADLINE>
 (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.) &HT;    (DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Updike's last two efforts to work variations on
classic stories were low points in a dazzling career: ``Brazil''
(1994) turned the legend of Tristan and Isolde into a cartoonish
soap opera, full of sexual and racial stereotypes; and ``S'' (1988)
turned Hawthorne's ``Scarlet Letter'' into a sour, cliche-ridden
sendup of the women's movement. Updike's latest literary renovation
project is considerably more successful. In writing a kind of
prequel to ``Hamlet'' that tells the story of the melancholy
prince's mother, he has succeeded in creating one of his most
sympathetic and persuasive female characters yet.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, however, Updike gives the reader a decidedly warped
reading of the characters in Shakespeare's play. ``Gertrude and
Claudius'' often reads like one of Updike's slighter tales of
suburban jealousy and adultery done in costume dress. It is less a
playful improvisation upon Shakespeare's play like Tom Stoppard's
``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern'' than a simple filching of
characters and plot for Updike's own ends.
</P>
<P>
   In Updike's telling, Gertrude (or Gerutha or Geruthe, as she is
called here) is a gentle if somewhat gullible woman who falls madly
in love with her husband's sexy younger brother. The King Hamlet
character is a stolid, self-absorbed man, more concerned with his
work than his wife. Claudius is a dashing adventurer, jealous of
his older brother's power. Hamlet is a sullen, spoiled brat who
mocks and undermines his mother long before discovering her
adulterous affair. They are, to say the least, one very
dysfunctional family.
</P>
<P>
   Based in part upon source material that Shakespeare probably
used himself, Updike's novel is set in a fictionalized Middle Ages,
at a time when ``Christ was on all lips but in their hearts the
Danes still adored Tyr, god of sport and war and fertility.'' In
Updike's telling, Gertrude's father, Rorik, is an avatar of the old
order, a king who pays lip service to the Christian faith but who
remembers the days when heathen altars dotted the land. Her husband
reveres ``Harald Bluetooth, the father of modern Denmark, whose
conversion deprived the German emperor of his favorite excuse for
invasion, the conquest of pagans.'' As for her wayward son, Hamlet,
he is a harbinger of the coming Renaissance with its humanistic
faith in the individual.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Gertrude and Claudius,'' Updike uses all his considerable
powers of persuasion to turn the woman Shakespeare's Hamlet accuses
of foul lust (living ``in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,/
Stewed in corruption, honeying and making love/Over the nasty
sty'') into a modern romantic who finds true love with her
husband's brother.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Updike's efforts to write from a woman's point of
view tended to result in heroines who were little more than
caricatures: All three ``Witches of Eastwick'' were laughable
parodies of feminism, while the heroine of ``S'' was a bitter
man-hater who put her own selfish whims before her family. His
portrait of Gertrude, in contrast, is informed by the same
dialectic between freedom and duty, passion and domesticity that
animated such sympathetically portrayed heroes as Harry (Rabbit)
Angstrom and Henry Bech. Though Updike occasionally burdens
Gertrude with clumsy generalizations about women (``the flow of a
woman's love, once started, can be stanched but with great pain''),
he has managed to create in her a genuinely compelling character, a
woman who is, by turns, vulnerable and outspoken, daring and naive.
</P>
<P>
   When Gertrude was 3, Updike tells us, her mother died. When she
was 17, her father married her off to an older man. Though her new
husband is gentle and kind, Gertrude finds him oddly impersonal:
There is something ``pat and coldly expedient'' about his decision
to marry her, and after he succeeds her father on the throne, he
grows even more remote.
</P>
<P>
   Gertrude's relationship with her son is equally fraught. This
Hamlet is not Shakespeare's model prince _ ``the expectancy and
rose of the fair state,'' whose ``noble mind'' is overthrown by
grief over his father's death and his mother's hasty remarriage.
Instead, he's a ``high-strung, quick-tongued child'' who is
``disrespectful to his elders and callous to his inferiors.''
</P>
<P>
   Her own love, Gertrude thinks, spills down on Hamlet but remains
``on his surface, gleaming like beads of mercury, unabsorbed'':
``he was of his father's blood _ temperate, abstracted, a Jutish
gloom coated over with the affected manners and luxurious skills of
a nobleman.'' He makes her feel like ``an utter failure as a
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Gertrude slowly comes to understand that she has ``never lived''
for herself, and in her quest for self-fulfillment, she realizes
that Claudius, her husband's charming younger brother, is the mate
she has always dreamed of. She thinks of him as ``her redeemer from
lawful life's deadening emptiness, her own self turned inside out
and given a man's bearish, boyish form.''
</P>
<P>
   When the King discovers their affair, Claudius _ unbeknownst to
Gertrude _ plots his brother's murder. He coldbloodedly poisons
him, assumes the throne and marries his brother's widow. Thus is
the stage readied for the opening of Shakespeare's play.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with his distinctly odd take on the playwright's
characters, Updike does not blame Claudius for setting in motion
these events that will lead to the bloody conclusion of ``Hamlet.''
Instead, he blames Hamlet for deciding to avenge his father. In an
afterword he writes: ``Putting aside the murder being covered up,
Claudius seems a capable king, Gertrude a noble queen, Ophelia a
treasure of sweetness, Polonius a tedious but not evil counselor,
Laertes a generic young man. Hamlet pulls them all into death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting aside the murder being covered up'' is a rather large
caveat, the reader might protest, but then Updike seems intent, in
this volume, not on re-inventing Shakespeare's play _ or even
providing a commentary upon it _ but on telling a tale of sexual
jealousy and marital discord not unlike the ones he has told many
times before.

 &HT;    Strengthen enforcement of gun laws
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, the National Rifle Association and its allies have
insisted America needs no new gun restrictions, only stricter
enforcement of laws already on the books. At last, President
Clinton is challenging the movement's minions on Capitol Hill to
put a substantial sum of money where their mouth is. The
president's budget includes a request for more money to help
federal agents enforce current laws.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the president requests $280 million to
reinvigorate the drive against gun violence, which has been
weakened by years of budget reductions and staff shortages. Part of
the increased funding would go to hire 500 Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms agents and inspectors and more U.S. attorneys; part would
be made available to state and local jurisdictions so they could
hire additional prosecutors. Gun-lobby defenders who must face the
voters this year could find Clinton's offer one they dare not
refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also would spend $30 million for a national ballistics
database for the FBI, the ATF and state and local authorities to
share. He also wants $10 million to accelerate development of
weapons designed so that only the owners can fire them. The idea
behind these ``smart-guns'' is to minimize accidental shootings and
gun thefts.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the ATF produced fresh evidence that a minority of gun
dealers are giving a black eye to law-abiding brethren in the
trade. Its study showed a mere 1.2 percent of firearms dealers and
pawnbrokers are to blame for marketing 57 percent of the guns used
in crimes. The Clinton crackdown would concentrate ATF scrutiny on
dealers who sold 10 or more weapons involved in crimes last year.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the NRA's top Washington lobbyist dismissed the
change in emphasis as ``just the latest installment in the
Clinton-Gore plan to drive lawful and licensed gun dealers out of
business'' _ as if to say those targeted vendors are upstanding
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   True, Clinton still would like to see some more gun restrictions
enacted _ for instance, requiring gun-show vendors to run
background checks on buyers and prohibiting the importation of
large-capacity ammunition clips. Still, he could consider his last
year in office a success on this score if he can persuade Congress
to get serious about enforcement.

   Q. I got a brace when I was 7 to correct idiopathic scoliosis.
Is this still the standard practice? Is it true that this problem
is disproportionately common in girls? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Idiopathic scoliosis, a sideways curve of the spine of
unknown cause in adolescence, is now believed to require active
treatment in only about 10 percent of cases, according to ``The
Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy.'' When treatment is called
for, a cast or a device called a Milwaukee brace is widely used.
</P>
<P>
   At least 60 percent to perhaps 80 percent of the cases are in
girls, and girls tend to have worse curves and greater progression.
</P>
<P>
   A review of studies on scoliosis and its treatment, by Dr.
Stuart L. Weinstein of the department of orthopedic surgery of the
University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, found that the Milwaukee
brace, which has been in wide use since the late 1940s, has been
the subject of few long-term studies to evaluate its results.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein also noted that most of the studies did not keep track
of the progression of the curvature, making it uncertain whether
patients with braces would have gotten worse without it.
</P>
<P>
   Bracing tends to stop the curve's progression in 85 percent to
90 percent of patients, but there is wide variation in response,
Weinstein said; most common is a moderate correction while the
brace is worn with slow, steady progression back to the original
curve after its use is tapered off. &QL;

MYSTERY OF BALL LIGHTNING  
 FOLLOW THAT HONEYBEE  
 A BEE'S EYE-VIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ball lightning is one of nature's odder, and rarer, phenomena.
Few people have seen it, but those who have do not quickly forget
it. It appears in a thunderstorm as a floating luminous sphere,
usually about the size of a honeydew melon, that shines like a
light bulb for 10 seconds or so and then either explodes or fades
from view. Scientists have been at a loss to explain it
satisfactorily.
</P>
<P>
   But two researchers at the University of Canterbury in New
Zealand have come up with a promising new model for the phenomenon.
Essentially, to paraphrase one of Elvis' greatest hits, ball
lightning is just a hunk _ a hunk of burning silicon.
</P>
<P>
   When ordinary lightning strikes the ground, it produces intense
heat. The researchers, writing in Nature, argue that if the soil
has the proper ratio of carbon to silicates, a lightning strike can
produce extremely small particles of silicon and silicon-containing
compounds in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers propose that the particles could then link up
into chains and then into loose fluffy clusters that would float in
the air. Oxygen in the air would eventually cause the silicon
compounds to oxidize, or burn up, and the researchers calculated
that the brightness, duration and color of the glow would match
reported observations. The heat of the ball, they suggest, would
determine whether it fades or explodes.
</P>
<P>
   Although the scientists were able to create chains of tiny
particles by simulating lightning strikes in the laboratory, they
caution that they were unable to recreate the total ball lightning
effect. So their theory remains just that, for now. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOLLOW THAT HONEYBEE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The flight of a honeybee is notoriously difficult to track. Even
the most sharp-eyed researcher cannot follow a bee for more than
100 feet or so.
</P>
<P>
   But bee tracking is now a lot easier, thanks to a radar
technique in which the insect is outfitted with a tiny
antenna-transponder. A signal received by the antenna is sent back
as a harmonic, or multiple of the initial frequency, enabling
researchers to sort out the tiny bee from background echoes.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the University of Illinois have used the technique
to study the orientation flights young bees make to develop their
homing ability.
</P>
<P>
   The radar data, reported in Nature, produced some intriguing
results. Successive trips are of the same duration as earlier ones,
but the bees fly faster, so a larger area is covered. And the bees
rarely fly completely around the hive; they usually explore only
one or two quadrants at a time. All this suggests that the bees
learn the local landscape progressively viewing it from different
positions with each flight. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A BEE'S EYE-VIEW &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The honeybees at the Australian National University in Canberra
do not wear antennas. But they do have to fly into narrow, wooden
tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   That technique was used by researchers to determine how a bee
calculates how far it had to travel to a food source, which the bee
then communicates to others through a ``waggle dance.'' One theory
holds that distance is gauged by the amount of energy consumed;
another holds that it is the movement of ground images in the eyes
that provides the cues.
</P>
<P>
   By using the tunnels, the scientists were able to show that
distance calibration is visual. In the tunnel, which is less than
five inches wide, a bee is far closer to the ``ground'' (in this
case, tunnel walls) than it would be in open air. For a given
distance, the movement of the ground image across the eyes would be
far quicker in the tunnel than in open air (just as, from an
airplane, the ground appears to move faster the lower the plane is
flying).
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, writing in the journal Science, compared how
far the bees thought they had traveled (as measured by the duration
of the waggle dance) to how far they actually traveled, and found
that a flight of about 20 feet in a tunnel seemed, to the bees,
more like 600 feet.

 HAITI'S RENEWAL SLOW, AND PAINFUL  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti - Somehow he slept. He slept despite a
stomach-turning stench. He slept through the roar of televisions,
radios, and other prisoners yelling across the room. He slept on a
threadbare cot.
</P>
<P>
   It was a passing moment in a prison regarded as Haiti's finest,
inside a 1,200-square-foot cell where 154 prisoners are locked up
23 hours a day. They steal sleep when they can, and if they are
fortunate, like the man with his right arm over his ear and eyes,
they get to use one of the 11 beds.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds miserable, and it is, yet this is better than it was a
few years ago. Before, the prison held 400 men in a single room,
none of whom had hope of freedom without a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies a hidden truth about Haiti today: The misery is so
profound that it often masks the signs of incremental progress as
the country tries to build a democratic and civil society from
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after 20,000 US troops invaded the nation in order to
restore a democratically elected government ousted in a military
coup, the task is increasingly being left to the Haitians
themselves. International donors are pulling back because the
crisis has passed and the results of their giving, as measured by
yardsticks used in the developed world, have been so meager.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, the largest single donor, infused more than
$2 billion in assistance to Haiti in the last four years, and it
will put up another $100 million next year. But keeping the funding
at that level in the future could prove difficult, as Republicans
in Congress have increasingly questioned whether US funds are
netting positive change.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's prisons, long regarded as the worst in the hemisphere,
stand as a telling example of the steps already taken, and the
leaps still needed. The room stuffed with 154 prisoners, for
instance, is one of the few areas in the National Penitentiary that
has not been rebuilt. The rest were constructed with $2.4 million
in foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prisons used to be a place where human beings were put and
kept like animals,'' said Jean-Paul Lupien, a Canadian prison
reform specialist who has led efforts here for the past four years.
``People would die, and no one would know. It's much better now.
It's day and night.'' In late 1994, when the US troops landed, no
one even knew how many prisons there were under Haiti's brutal
military regime. No one had a count of the prisoners themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, authorities have completed the arduous tasks of
exploring the prisons, investigating the prisoners' cases, putting
together a bureaucratic structure, rebuilding cellblocks,
constructing infirmaries, installing pipes for water and plumbing
and wires for electricity, and then training guards.
</P>
<P>
   But huge problems remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into jails here is still like going back to a few
centuries ago,'' said Lupien, 56, a former warden at a
medium-security prison in Cowansville, Quebec, 15 miles north of
the Vermont border.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of needed projects have not been touched. Six jails do
not have a single vehicle, so guards transport prisoners to court
on foot. One jail has no roof because the walls can not support
one. Another lockup has no walls: Freedom is a step away outside
the cellblocks.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Penitentiary in downtown Port-au-Prince, which
holds 2,040 prisoners, nearly half the population of Haiti's 19
jails, the drop in international funds is already apparent. For a
year, there has been no money to train guards, and the number of
foreign advisers working on improving the prisons has slipped from
nine to one: Lupien.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, he has commitments of just $422,000
toward a proposed $6 million foreign assistance package for
prisons. He fears that they will lose much of what they had gained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are already starting to considerably slide backward now,''
he said as he walked along the national jail's two-story high
walls. ``It's particularly apparent here.'' With agitation, he
pointed out several places where things have gotten worse, not
better. Inmates lounged inside guardhouses. Prisoners wandered into
areas once off-limits. And when Lupien entered a brand-new,
three-story jailhouse that inmates have called the Titanic, he
pointed out that some cellblocks had plenty of beds, but others did
not. Rich prisoners buy mattresses from poor inmates. The prison
system does not have enough money for beds.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest problem for the prisons is outside the walls in
the form of the rest of Haiti's dysfunctional system of justice.
Some 80 percent of all prisoners have yet to be sentenced. Some are
awaiting trials four years after arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Justice Minister Camille Leblanc asked 15 civil
court judges and prosecutors to resolve all pending cases before
the end of the year. No one believed that would happen.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in a rare interview,
said he believes it should not happen. The reason, he said, was
that the system was already riddled with corruption, and speeding
up the process risked complete collapse. One of the most pervasive
indicators of corruption has been the widespread and suspiciously
quick releases of people arrested on drug trafficking charges, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of corruption we have in the system is so ugly, so
rooted in the years of dictatorship,'' Aristide said in his home
office. ``It took years for the Jewish to see the light of
justice'' after the Holocaust, ``and it may take some time for
Haitians to see justice coming from the judicial system. I prefer
to go slower rather than going too fast using illegal means.'' In
1995, Aristide experienced bitter results when he tried to
circumvent the Haitian constitution, which was written in 1986 at
the end of the Duvalier family dictatorship. He attempted to shift
the prisons from police to civilian control, but parliament
overruled Aristide on constitutional grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Democracies around the world are careful not to have police
control prisons because of the obvious conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   For prisoners, the issue of police or civilian control matters
little now.
</P>
<P>
   What matters is getting a court date.
</P>
<P>
   In the National Penitentiary's courtyard, one old prisoner sat
by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Under prison regulations, Lupien said, he shouldn't have been
there. He was Ernst Bennett, 74, the wealthy one-time father-in-law
to Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier. Bennett, attired in pressed
slacks and a shirt, said he was arrested for not paying taxes on
buildings seized long ago by the government.
</P>
<P>
   He laughed quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've waited 16 months for trial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether if he was a political prisoner, Bennett said, ``No
comment.'' He looked away and changed the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to Miami when I am released. I will spend one month
in Miami and then go to France. I don't have any visitors here. I
don't want any. I send somebody out to get my food. That's how I
live.'' He lives on the top floor of the Titanic, a floor reserved
for the prison's wealthiest and most notorious inmates. Three
police officers charged with killing 11 people in May are there. A
former French soldier was in another, sharing it with five other
inmates, including Henri-Robert Laforest, who operated a security
company. He was charged with attempted murder, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am for justice for everybody,'' he said through the bars.
``I am a democrat. The system is not working. They should give
grace to 99 percent of us. Because people are here for nothing.
There's a guy who stole a bike and he's been here for three
years.'' Lupien said the prisons will probably see a new flood of
inmates in coming years because of increases in economic crimes and
drug-related crimes. Haiti is a major transshipment point for drugs
from Colombia on their way to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped into the cell with 154 prisoners and spoke easily in
French to a few of the inmates. Chenetmu Metellus, 32, stepped
forward and welcomed the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are one or two too many of us here,'' Metellus said, a
smile spreading across his face. He stood above the man who slept
on the prized cot.
</P>
<P>
   He stood above another man who slept on a sheet on the concrete
floor. The sleepers didn't stir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sleep good, too,'' Metellus said. ``I have one of the beds.
We get into quite a few fights, though, because, you know, there
are a few of us here.''

THE DANISH GIRL 
By David Ebershoff 
Viking, 270 pp., $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1930, Einar Wegener, a Danish artist, became the first known
recipient of gender reassignment, or what is more commonly called a
sex-change operation. For years, Wegener had teetered on the
increasingly fragile divide between his life as husband to fellow
painter Gerda Wegener, and as Lili Elbe, the woman within who would
come to overshadow Einar.
</P>
<P>
   Within this factual framework, David Ebershoff has fashioned
``The Danish Girl,'' an extraordinary work of fiction that imagines
the lives of the Wegeners as they come to terms with Lili, the
other woman in their marriage whose presence could no longer be
denied. Heartbreaking and unforgettable, it is a complete triumph,
and also a tribute to a wife's unconditional love for her husband.
</P>
<P>
   It is 1925, and Einar and Greta (as she is called here) are
painters living in Copenhagen. They are six years into their
marriage when Greta requests a favor from her husband. Her model
has canceled an afternoon session, so Greta asks Einar to slip into
the woman's stockings and shoes so that she may complete the legs
of the portrait. At first, Einar is reluctant, yet something stirs
within him as he imagines ``the wrinkled roll of the stocking
gliding over the white bone of his ankle. Over the small cushion of
his calf. Clicking into the hook of a garter.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he would agree to also try on the model's dress, its silk
caressing his hips, its lace bib resting gently on his chest. To
Greta it's all a bit of a laugh to see the near-hairless legs of
her husband, whom she has always considered ``a pretty man,'' clad
in a pair of her stockings. But Einar is transformed, even before
Greta says in jest, ``Why don't we call you Lili?''
</P>
<P>
   Einar, his childhood friend Hans Axgil would later recall, had
always been ``a little boy with secrets.'' As a child, he would
make his way into the pickled-ash wardrobe of his dead mother,
wrapping her beads around his small neck or draping his head with
one of her scarves. If his father discovered him among the felt
skirts and gabardine dresses, he would yell at Einar, ``You can't
do that! Little boys can't do that!''
</P>
<P>
   But with the realization of Lili, Einar indulged in what little
boys were forbidden to do. At times, Greta would come home
expecting her husband and instead would find Lili in a dress
accessorized with Greta's jewelry. And when Einar would return, he
would always seek Greta's permission for Lili to visit again.
</P>
<P>
   ``All she wanted to do was to allow him his desires, but at the
same time she had the irrepressible urge to hold him in her arms
and tell him what to do about Lili,'' Ebershoff writes of Greta's
reaction. ``Eventually, she said _ but only as it occurred to her _
`It's up to Lili. It's whatever she wants to do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the lexicon of modern pop psychology, Greta would be called
an enabler, a coconspirator in Einar's masquerade. But as time goes
on and Lili becomes a regular part of their lives (Lili even
becomes Greta's muse), both husband and wife understand that this
is neither a masquerade nor a game. With each passing week, there
is more of Lili, less of Einar. Lili even falls in love with a
fellow artist, Henrik Sandahl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Einar sensed how he was turning the world on its head by
dressing as Lili,'' Ebershoff writes. ``He could eliminate himself
by pulling the camisole with the scallop-lace hem over his head.
Einar could duck out of society by lifting his elbows and clasping
the triple strand of Spanish pearls around his neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Einar and Greta finally seek medical advice to explain
Einar's condition. One doctor suggests Einar suffers from ``pelvic
tumors'' that have compromised his manhood. In Paris (where they
move to further Greta's career, after her portraits of Lili become
all the rage), there's another who recommends a procedure ``so full
of promise'' called a lobotomy. Then Greta finally meets Professor
Bolk of the Dresden Municipal Women's Clinic in Germany: This is
the man who would free ``the pretty girl with the stemlike throat
trying to break out of the dry, sick skin of old Einar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Danish Girl'' is a remarkably daring leap for a first-time
novelist, yet Ebershoff accomplishes it with grace, beauty, and
intelligence. What could have been freakish and exploitative in
less compassionate hands unfolds as a probing exploration of sexual
identity. Yet even more so, it is a sublime psalm to an unusual and
enduring love, as a woman must choose between holding on to the
husband she adores and honoring his innermost desires, which will
inevitably and forever unravel their life together.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dry and somewhat milder weather will be the rule Tuesday from
the central Rockies to the Atlantic Seaboard. In fact, only a
portion of New England, parts of the Southeast and California will
notice readings below seasonal levels. The rest of the country will
have above to much above normal temperatures. A split in the jet
stream will keep the supply of moisture separate from the potent
disturbances along the polar front. As a result, no significant
storms will affect the nation for the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure will stretch from the northern Appalachians to
central Texas and westward into Utah. Much of this region will
experience ample sunshine and light breezes. The morning will dawn
frigid in New England, but milder air will arrive on a freshening
breeze from the southwest Tuesday afternoon. Meanwhile, a push of
chilly air into the Southeast will combine with a weak jet stream
disturbance over the Gulf States to produce varying amounts of
clouds along with scattered showers or drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Warmer air will be lifted over the cold snow-covered terrain of
the upper Middle West leading to thickening clouds and a few
patches of light snow or freezing drizzle. Temperatures may
approach record values in the western Plains as gusty winds from
the west descend the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   A stream of moisture from the eastern Pacific will cause dull
and damp conditions in south-central California and Nevada. Another
current of moisture will bring showers to the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Bitter Winter
</P>
<P>
   By Alaskan standards, the town of Cold Bay has a moderate
climate. Located near the beginning of the Aleutian archipelago,
arctic air masses are typically modified by surrounding waters
before reaching Cold Bay. However, this winter is setting records
for severity. Last year ended with the coldest December ever
measured there. In January, blizzard conditions occurred on a
record-setting 13 days. The snow depth reached 46 inches in
January, 26 inches more than the previous record. Finally, the
month came to a bitter end as the all-time record low temperature
of -13 was tied on January 30.

<P>
   Our parents called it baby fat. In those days, chubby kids were
considered cute and cuddly, with pudgy cheeks meant for pinching
and round tummies ripe for a rub. Not anymore. Today it's called
childhood, or pediatric, obesity, and it's the No. 1 one
nutrition-related health problem troubling American kids. One in
four children in this country is overweight or obese, a statistic
that has grown more than 50 percent in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Baby fat is also no longer something children grow out of. A
third of overweight preschoolers and half of overweight school-age
kids will be obese adults _ a fate heavy kids are twice as likely
to suffer as their lean counterparts are. What's more, ``There is
every reason to believe this trend will continue; in fact, it will
probably get worse unless we make serious changes in our
lifestyles,'' said Tom Baranowski, a professor of behavioral
nutrition at the Children's Nutrition Research Center at the Baylor
College of Medicine in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consequences of childhood obesity go far beyond
cosmetics,'' said Dr. William Dietz, the director of nutrition and
physical activity for the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta. The longer a child remains obese, the
greater the likelihood that he will stay that way, escalating his
risk of diabetes, gallbladder disease, hypertension, arthritis,
sleep problems and even cancer. And according to a study from the
New England Medical Center and Tufts University in Boston, excess
body fat in childhood also lays the groundwork for heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the health ramifications lie the social issues: Bullies
are more likely to ridicule larger kids, who tend to have fewer
friends than their peers do, and teachers often view heavy students
as lazy and not as smart. Thus obese kids face discrimination
throughout school, in sports, at college entrance _ and even into
adulthood, when they join the work force. All of this can take its
toll on a youngster's already fragile self-image.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity begets obesity. Children whose parents are both obese
have an 80 percent chance of piling on the pounds; that figure is
cut in half if only one parent is significantly overweight _ yet
the stats plummet to 7 percent if Mom and Dad are lean. However,
this weight epidemic is not genetic in origin; obesity rates are
rising far too quickly for that to be the case. ``It takes eons for
our genes to adapt to changes in our environment,'' Baranowski
said. ``Escalating obesity among children is a phenomenon of the
past few decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Many kids simply consume more calories than they burn. They are
eating more fat, sugar and processed foods, and are moving less
than ever. In a study of 125 youngsters between the ages of 3 and
7, Baranowski found that the overweight kids took in more fat and
calories. Other research concludes the same thing: Children who
follow high-fat diets are most likely to be fat, while those on
low-fat diets stay lean. Then there's the problem of anxiety-driven
eating: From school pressure to divorce, children face more stress
today than did previous generations.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of exercise also plays a role. Gone are the days when kids
walked to school and rode their bikes until sundown. Today children
sit. They watch three hours of television a day, and that's not
counting the time spent surfing the Net or playing Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   But whether your child is a bit pudgy or downright too big for
his britches, use common sense. Don't fall for the restrictive
weight-loss diets that can escalate a weight problem into an eating
disorder later on. Here are a few suggestions for putting your best
food forward:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cultivate a child's taste for nutritious foods early on.
Emphasize smart choices rather than calories or fat grams: frozen
blueberries instead of ice cream, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Help kids get in touch with their bodies' hunger and satiety
signals. ``Part of our children's problem with obesity comes from
eating when they're not hungry,'' said Debra Waterhouse, a
registered dietitian and the author of ``Like Mother, Like
Daughter: Breaking Free From the Diet Trap.'' Don't force
youngsters to eat if they don't want to, and don't require that
they clean their plates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Switch from soda to water. Children consume 8 percent of their
calories from soft drinks. Substituting water for high-calorie soda
is an important step in controlling weight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Replace French fries with baby carrots. Only one in every five
children meets the minimum recommendation for vegetables (five or
more servings daily). Making the switch from ketchup and fries to
raw veggies with fat-free ranch dip cuts calories by 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Review your menus. According to researchers at the University
of Maryland, four of the five dinners most often served in the
United States _ fried chicken, pasta, hamburgers, hot dogs and
pizza _ are high-fat. Just switching from fried to baked chicken
would cut calories by almost half.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never use food as a reward or a punishment. If you tell your
son he can't have cake until he's finished his spinach, you teach
him that greens are punishments and sweets are rewards. This can
lead to overeating or using treats to fill emotional needs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nurture an appreciation for health. Don't focus on weight as
much as on how eating well gives your child energy, shiny hair and
a clear complexion while it boosts brain power and athletic
performance.
</P>
<P>
   According to the North American Society for Physical Education,
children need a minimum of one hour of daily robust physical
activity. An overweight child requires even more. That means making
exercising as automatic as brushing teeth.
</P>
<P>
   The most effective way to encourage kids to exercise is through
what James Sallis, a professor of psychology at San Diego State
University, calls the ``chauffeur function.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The children who are most active are the ones whose parents
take them someplace where they can play,'' Sallis said, ``whether
it's to the park, the YMCA, soccer practice or a tae kwon do or
dance class.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   On a hillside in Tuscany, 12 art students work at their
canvases, shaded by brightly striped umbrellas. They have gathered
in Italy to study the intricacies of plein air, or open air,
landscape painting _ to capture in oils the fugitive light, the
contours of hills, the luminous greens of vineyards and olive
groves. Their teacher, Maddine Insalaco, wanders from easel to
easel and thoughtfully critiques her students' work, suggesting a
brush stroke here, a dab of color there.
</P>
<P>
   For Insalaco, a gifted painter and teacher, art is at the center
of her life. She divides her time between a home in Italy, where
she runs landscape-painting workshops six months a year, and a
studio in New York, where she concentrates on developing her own
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is very rich,'' said the 41-year-old. ``I've never felt
more satisfied.'' Her contentment has been hard-won, however: It
took years of inner conflict before she felt comfortable turning
her dream of living an artist's life into a reality.
</P>
<P>
   After completing a sound education with academic honors _ which
included internships in Luxembourg, with the European Parliament,
and in Brussels, the headquarters of the European Economic
Community; followed by a master's in international affairs from
Columbia University _ Insalaco landed a high-powered banking
position with a shipping company on New York's Park Avenue. ``I was
in my mid-20s and already on the treadmill,'' she recalled. ``Even
then I was anxious and sensed that the world of international
finance wasn't for me. But I had no idea what to do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since she was a child Insalaco had loved sketching and painting,
so, once settled in the job, she decided to provide a
counterbalance to her professional responsibilities by pursuing her
art, enrolling in evening classes at New York's Art Students
League. Upon receiving an offer in 1985 to work with the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization, she accepted the Rome-based position,
in part for the opportunity to develop her art abroad.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 years, Insalaco lived at the foot of the pine-shaded
Palatine Hill, drinking in the historical, cultural and visual
riches of the city. She strolled daily past the ruins of imperial
palaces and the Coliseum's travertine arcades, drank in the toasty
aromas of cappuccino and espresso wafting from corner cafes and
delighted in the Mediterranean light as it intensified the
ocher-and-mustard hues of buildings lining cobblestone streets. At
night, she studied art at the Scuola delle Arti Ornamentali, where
she had access to a painting space.
</P>
<P>
   The dry routine of her workdays _ authorizing payments, signing
checks, writing memos, analyzing accounts and supervising staff _
began to make her feel ill at ease, however. Despite a good title,
and the kind of financial security she had not known growing up in
a single-parent household, Insalaco could not ignore a hollowness
at her core.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down, I knew that I'd never feel truly fulfilled if
creativity were not at the center of my life,'' she said. But
having devoted years to her professional training, she couldn't yet
fathom veering off in a new direction.
</P>
<P>
   But her dissatisfaction only grew. ``I started to envy people
who enjoyed what they were doing professionally,'' she said. ``Work
was sapping all my creative energies. I simply couldn't sustain the
division in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Confused and anxious, Insalaco took a leave of absence and
returned to Manhattan, where she studied intensely for an MFA at
the New York Academy of Art. ``I hadn't burned any bridges, so I
was still risk-free,'' she explained. ``The thought of giving up my
lovely 15th century Italian apartment, my Palatine Hill, and the
image of myself as a U.N. professional _ everything I had so
carefully protected _ was very threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   While continuing her coursework, Insalaco weighed the pros and
cons of her structured career against those of an artist's life.
``But all my list-making, all my efforts at reason, brought me no
clarity,'' she recalled. Her dilemma still unresolved, she returned
to Italy at the end of nine months to face yet more office
politics, plus the same workaday concerns and disgruntled faces.
</P>
<P>
   During one of her walks in the city she loved, she lit upon a
plan: ``I decided to paint my way through my crisis.'' On New
Year's Eve of 1994, she resolved to paint every weekend at the same
site _ the ruins of the Circus Maximus, ancient Rome's grandest
chariot racecourse. She did so religiously and in five months had
produced 20 paintings. But her consistency and faith in the process
held even greater rewards: ``By May, something in me had shifted,
and I knew what I had to do.'' She left her U.N. job three months
later, gave up her cherished Rome apartment and returned to New
York to complete her MFA.
</P>
<P>
   What actually occurred during her weekend ritual, a meditation
of sorts? ``In the process of painting consistently and honoring my
personal commitment, I identified with myself as an artist,''
Insalaco said. During her Circus Maximus sessions, Insalaco gained
a new perspective. ``Painting made me feel alive and happy. Picture
making became really meaningful. In those months, I realized that
life wouldn't work if I didn't recognize and respect my values. I
came to understand that I was protecting myself falsely.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that relinquishing the security of her life in Rome was
easy. ``It was agonizing. I tried on the idea of teaching landscape
painting, and it scared me. But I knew that's what I wanted to
do,'' she said. ``And the idea of teaching painting in Italy was
the only way that I could face the sacrifice of leaving my beloved
home abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to her financial training, Insalaco was able to develop a
business plan for Etruscan Places, her landscape-painting program
in Tuscany. Of the $12,000 she'd saved, she dedicated $5,000 to the
business itself. She organized and advertised workshops from New
York and set up a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Insalaco traveled to Tuscany for her first two
workshops, each attended by just two students. By the following
year, she was conducting six workshops, and, after a write-up in
The New York Times, her classes swiftly reached their maximum
enrollment of 12. She hired an assistant and, in time, purchased a
van and more painting equipment. Finally, Insalaco signed a
long-term rental on an apartment in San Gimignano, where she lives
when conducting her 10 annual Tuscan workshops.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Insalaco married artist Joe Vinson, with whom she now
runs Etruscan Places. ``It is significant, though, that I was
single at the time of my decisions and transition,'' she said.
``While being alone had the familiar drawbacks, I was in a position
of complete freedom to decide my fate myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the arduous process of allowing her passion for art to
guide her, Insalaco has come to recognize a truth she holds dear:
``To be creative, you must learn to be comfortable by yourself. I
learned the value of an interior world. It's so dynamic and has its
own vitality. It has given me strength and resources. Having made
this transition, I now feel that I can take on just about
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Does she miss her financial security and the luxuries of an
affluent lifestyle? ``I was not very materialistic to begin with,
so apart from exotic travel, which I miss, I don't think I
sacrificed a lot,'' she said. ``I live a simple life with much less
money. Freedom has a high value, and from that point of view I am
very wealthy. And just think, everything I love is a tax
write-off.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   There is good news on the nutrition front. Nuts _ yes, fatty
nuts _ are back on the menu, even for people on diets to prevent
heart disease or cancer or to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   Packed with nutrients needed to start a new generation of
plants, nuts are increasingly being recognized as powerhouses of
health-promoting substances, especially for people who need to
lower their cholesterol, triglycerides or blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   And despite their high fat content and caloric richness, nuts
and nut products, which provide satiety often missing from fat-free
carbohydrate foods, have been shown to help people adhere to
weight-loss diets and to maintain their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, nuts are loaded with fat, far more than would seem
appropriate for those limiting fat to 30 percent of their calorie
intake. Depending on the type, 72 percent to 90 percent of the
calories in nuts comes from fat. But most of it is unsaturated,
which helps to lower low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol,
which can clog arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Except for walnuts, most of the unsaturated fat in nuts is
monounsaturated, the kind that predominates in canola and olive
oils and in avocados. It is celebrated for its ability to lower
harmful cholesterol without affecting the beneficial
high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol that acts as arterial
Dran-O.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike diets low in fat and high in carbohydrates, a higher-fat
diet that emphasizes monounsaturated fats does not raise blood
levels of triglycerides, another risk factor for heart disease. The
walnut, while somewhat short on monounsaturates, is a good source
of omega-3 fatty acids, the kind of fat in fish that counters the
blood clots that can cause heart attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   To help prevent their fats from becoming rancid, nuts are potent
sources of antioxidants, including vitamin E, which protects
LDL-cholesterol from being oxidized to the form that attaches
itself to blood vessel walls. Two other antioxidants in nuts,
quercetin and campferol, may suppress the growth of cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Most nuts are also fairly good sources of protein, which is why
peanut butter and almond butter are often used as protein foods.
One ounce of peanuts supplies 7.2 grams of protein, nearly as much
as a glass of milk. More important from a health standpoint,
however, may be the fact that the protein in nuts is especially
rich in an amino acid called arginine.
</P>
<P>
   It aids in the body's synthesis of nitric oxide, which causes
blood vessels to widen. This, in turn, would lower blood pressure,
counteract the stiffness of cholesterol-clogged arteries and
perhaps reduce further clogging. Peanuts, almonds, walnuts and
hazelnuts are good sources of arginine.
</P>
<P>
   The cholesterol found in animal foods clogs blood vessels, while
nuts contain plant-based sterols that counter atherosclerosis, the
accumulation of fatty deposits in blood vessels. Phytosterols,
soluble only in fats, are now being used in some commercial
margarines to reduce the risk of heart disease. In animal studies,
phytosterols have also been shown to have anti-cancer properties.
Pistachio nuts are especially rich in phytosterols.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts contain several vitamins and minerals that protect against
heart disease, high blood pressure and stroke, including folate,
which lowers blood levels of homocysteine. Elevated homocysteine
levels can triple the risk of heart attacks. Peanuts are the best
nut sources of folate, followed by hazelnuts and walnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Beneficial minerals in nuts include calcium, magnesium and
potassium, and all protect against high blood pressure. Pistachios
followed by almonds are the richest nut sources of potassium, and
almonds are the best nut source of calcium. Brazil nuts are rich in
selenium, which may prevent prostate cancer. Peanuts contain
resveratrol, the compound in red wine that may protect against
heart disease and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference in London convened last month by Oldways
Preservation and Exchange Trust, a nonprofit organization that
studies and promotes traditional healthful diets, medical
researchers described several large studies linking frequent nut
consumption to better health.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank B. Hu at the Harvard School of Public Health said that
among 86,016 participants in the Nurses' Health Study, fatal and
nonfatal heart attacks were 35 percent less likely to occur among
women who consumed nuts five or more times a week than among women
who rarely ate nuts. An earlier study of 34,192 Seventh-Day
Adventist men and women in California, most of whom are
vegetarians, revealed a 50 percent reduction in coronary risk among
frequent nut eaters.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lawrence Kushi, now at Columbia, reported that in the Iowa
Women's Health Study, women who ate nuts two to four times a week
had less than half the coronary risk of women who almost never ate
nuts. And Dr. Joan Sabate of Loma Linda University in California
showed that among 18 healthy men with normal cholesterol levels,
eating a diet in which 20 percent of the calories came from walnuts
improved cholesterol levels more than the low-fat diet recommended
by the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Another clinical trial by Dr. Gene Spiller, who directs the
Health Research and Studies Center in Los Altos, Calif., showed
that when 27 men and women with high cholesterol ate three ounces
of almonds a day in place of other fat sources, LDL-cholesterol
dropped 12 percent without lowering HDL or raising triglycerides.
</P>
<P>
   And in a new study presented in London by Dr. Penny M.
Kris-Etherton, a nutritionist at Pennsylvania State University, a
diet that provided 36 percent of its calories from fat, mostly from
peanuts and peanut butter, lowered LDL-cholesterol and
triglycerides by more than 10 percent, whereas a standard low-fat
cholesterol-lowering diet raised triglycerides by 15 percent. In
neither the almond nor the peanut study did the participants gain
weight.
</P>
<P>
   But, you say, nuts have long been no-no's on weight-loss diets.
As energy-dense foods, nuts can easily become a source of excess
calories, especially nibbled semiconsciously. However, when nuts
and nut products are included in a calorie-controlled diet, they
may actually improve dieting success.
</P>
<P>
   In a most telling study, Dr. Kathy McManus, who directs clinical
nutrition at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, assigned about
half of 101 obese participants to a standard low-fat
weight-reducing diet in which 20 percent of the calories came from
fat. The others were assigned to a diet in which 35 percent of
calories were from fat, which mainly came from tree nuts, peanuts,
olives and olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Although both groups at first lost about the same amount, after
18 months, only 20 percent of the low-fat group was still on the
diet, whereas 54 percent of the higher-fat group had stuck with it.
The net result: a weight loss of nine pounds in the high fat group
and a gain of more than six pounds in the low-fat group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The participants in the nut-eating group reported that they
did not feel like they were dieting, even though they consumed
controlled portions of food,'' McManus said.
</P>
<P>
   Be Wary of Nut Allergies
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 3 million Americans are allergic to peanuts, tree
nuts or both, experts say. Nut allergies can be life-threatening,
so anyone who develops symptoms, described below, should refrain
and be tested to determine which nuts to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Allergies to peanuts and walnuts are the most common, but any
kind of nut may be the culprit. Since the protein in nuts is the
allergen, pure nut oils are not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms include itchy mouth, hives, tight throat, wheezing,
difficulty breathing, vomiting and diarrhea. In severe cases,
anaphylactic shock and death may occur unless epinephrine is given.
</P>
<P>
   If an infant or child has other food allergies or if allergies
run in the family, experts recommend postponing feeding children
peanuts until after age 3. Also, pregnant women and nursing mothers
who have allergies (or if the father or siblings do) should avoid
peanuts.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican Sen. John McCain's political idol is
Theodore Roosevelt, a popular military hero whose presidency nearly
a century ago was marked by an irrepressible personality, a strong
sense of leadership and an instinct for bold reform.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   Could McCain be the next TR? We should get so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt, usually ranked at the top of the near-great in our
White House pantheon, is remembered today as much for his colorful
persona as for his practical achievements over two terms, although
he had plenty of them. He is a worthy role model for an ambitious
21st century conservative determined to defy right-wing Republican
orthodoxy and reshape national politics along centrist lines.
</P>
<P>
   McCain likes Roosevelt's reputation for taking on the special
interests, believing in an active government and slugging it out
fearlessly in a fight. McCain jokes that while he admires
Roosevelt's mantra of speaking softly but carrying a big stick,
perhaps he himself has not been speaking as softly as might be
prudent. He does not mention the heft of his own stick, growing
more formidable since his stunning New Hampshire triumph.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in fact, has embarked on a campaign that holds the
promise of building his own TR-like political legend. When
Roosevelt, as vice president, succeeded the assassinated President
William McKinley in 1901, Ohio GOP Sen. Mark Hanna cried, ``Now
that damned cowboy is in the White House.'' The reaction from
powerful Washington GOP insiders to McCain's sudden rise in the
polls reflects similar despair.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, like TR, is simply too independent for their taste. He
knows how to use the ``bully pulpit'' to get out his message, just
as TR did. The pulpit is wherever he happens to be. Roosevelt
talked to reporters while shaving. McCain talks nonstop to them on
a bus.
</P>
<P>
   McCain likes to rattle the established order. But he's not
crazy. He doesn't go so far that the lobbyists he wants to curb
will instead curb him. His campaign needs all the help it can get,
running on pennies compared with the nearly $70 million that Texas
Gov. George W. Bush has amassed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is attacking his rival in South Carolina for that
pragmatism, calling McCain a hypocrite for taking campaign funds
from a system he deplores and says he wants to dismantle.
</P>
<P>
   But in this too, TR provides an example. In his first three
years as president he muted his support for political reforms until
he consolidated his control over the Republican Party and was
assured of the 1904 presidential nomination. He did not
aggressively push economic and social legislation to regulate the
``malefactors of wealth'' until his second term.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt, according to biographer David McCullough, loved
politics and being president. McCullough describes TR as
``picturesque, noisy, colorful in ways that amused and absorbed the
press, worried the elders of his party and delighted the country.''
He was also busy. He built the Panama Canal, filed antitrust suits
against monopolies, won the Nobel Peace Prize for mediating the
Russo-Japanese war, strengthened the Navy and established the
national park system.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt the pulse of the people, TR replied brashly,
``I don't know the way the people DO feel, I only know how they
OUGHT to feel.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain operates as though he has the same self-confidence. He
calls the campaign ``fun.'' Reporters traveling with him contend he
wings it much of the time, so secure in the correctness of his
instincts that he is willing to risk making mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   If he pulls a blooper, as he has several times, he merely says
he changed his mind. Bush backers describe this as flip-flopping,
but it strikes many voters as refreshingly candid. How boring it
would be if presidential candidates were perfect. Not that we've
ever had one.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing is that McCain, like Roosevelt, comes across
as a substantive person with a substantive vision of the country.
He is a transitional figure en route from the shopworn Reagan
supply-side conservatism to a fresh configuration of politics that
is less rigidly ideological.
</P>
<P>
   As one political consultant observed, McCain has become more
than a candidate. He has morphed into a powerful idea.
</P>
<P>
   Bush by contrast clings to a reckless tax cut that nobody except
the rich really wants, right-wing social positions that divide the
Republican Party as well as the country and the notion that a
president's son can pass himself off as an outsider. He is trying
to paint McCain as a closet liberal, a Democrat at heart, a
dishonest Senate lightweight out of his depth. McCain is
``Clintonesque,'' Bush adviser Haley Barbour says.
</P>
<P>
   If supporting a tax increase on tobacco or being sufficiently
sensible to compromise on issues is Clintonesque, McCain is guilty.
He is very conservative, too much so for my taste. But he's a
rational conservative, as Clinton is a reasonable Democrat. There's
nothing wrong with that.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, however, is not Clintonesque in character, thank
goodness. He is the opposite. And in today's prosperous economy,
strength of character is what will count.

INDONESIAN PRESIDENT CHANGES COURSE WITH MILITARY LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Easing a strange long-distance
confrontation with his top general, President Abdurrahman Wahid has
suddenly taken a new tack, saying in newspaper reports Monday that
he trusts the general and is ready to forgive him.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks in Rome over the weekend, the president reportedly
asserted that several years ago when he was a dissident religious
leader, the general, Wiranto, saved his life by warning him of a
government plot to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust Mr. Wiranto,'' the president said in Rome, in an
interesting twist on his recent warnings that military officers
were planning a coup against his government.
</P>
<P>
   Then, according to the local reports, he said, ``If Mr. Wiranto
is judged guilty by a court I will forgive him.'' But Wahid left it
unclear whether this was an expression of personal sentiment or
whether he had an official pardon in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The president first demanded that Wiranto step down one week
ago, when a government commission named the general as one of five
military leaders responsible for the violence and destruction in
East Timor last year.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's detailed report, which named 33 people, was
turned over to the attorney general for prosecution. By moving
aggressively, Indonesia is trying to avoid international
prosecution for crimes against humanity during the violence and
destruction that followed an independence vote in the former
Portuguese colony last August.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report and the president's demand for Wiranto's
resignation brought fears of a military backlash here, with the
army commander saying he was trying to persuade his officers not to
stage a coup.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the new tone of his remarks, newspapers reported
that the president, who is halfway through a two-week foreign trip,
also seemed to repeat his demand for Wiranto to quit, saying: ``I
hope he resigns before I come back. But if not, we will implement
what we said before: those who face prosecution should be
`non-active' and be replaced temporarily.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's seemingly impulsive comments have shifted the
atmosphere in Jakarta from one of tension over fears of a military
backlash to bemusement over the garrulous leader.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the speaker of the house, Akbar Tandjung, said, ``We
are reminding the president not to make statements that could cause
confusion among the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jakarta Post, in an editorial Monday, suggested that
Indonesians need to accept Wahid's unceremonious style and what it
called his ``talent for stepping on people's toes.'' It called the
president a refreshing change from the obscure and mumbling
imperial presidency of the country's former strongman leader,
Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   ``His penchant for making seemingly ambiguous statements about
all kinds of issues, from the most immaterial to the most serious,
has of late particularly come under fire,'' the newspaper said in
the editorial. ``We believe Indonesians would do best to get used
to this peculiar style of leadership which, after all, is and
always has been uniquely Abdurrahman Wahid's.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely in this time of national crisis, with separatist
movements flaring in several areas and Muslim-Christian violence
surging, the president has spent a large portion of his first three
months in office abroad. But this has not stopped him from stirring
the political pot at home, for reasons that often seem unclear.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After his demand for Wiranto's resignation last week, the
president announced that he had reached a cease-fire agreement with
separatist rebels in the province of Aceh. A separatist leader
hotly denied this and the matter seems to have been dropped.
</P>
<P>
   On a previous trip, Wahid called ``three or four'' unnamed
members of his Cabinet corrupt and said that they must resign or
face termination when he returned. He then seemed to forget about
his threat.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, newspapers reported that he said Wiranto had telephoned
him several days ago to complain about his warnings of a possible
coup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you believe such rumors?'' Wahid quoted the general as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the president seems to have become one of the general's
defenders. ``I believe in Mr. Wiranto,'' he reportedly said. ``Why?
Because I know him. It is other people who know nothing about him
who make generalizations about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the common initials for the Indonesian military, the
president added: ``I am asking the people not to see all TNI
members as bad guys who always do wrong. There are two kinds of TNI
_ those who obey and those who are rogues.''

<P>
   For women who are facing difficult decisions because they carry
a gene that heightens their risk of breast cancer, doctors have
developed a bracingly rational, cut-to-the chase method of helping
them weigh the pros and cons of various strategies for reducing
risk.
</P>
<P>
   The new method, based on statistics and mathematical modeling,
looks at different options for cancer prevention and gives
approximate answers to one crucial question: How much time will
each option add to a woman's life?
</P>
<P>
   The technique, described last week in The Journal of the
American Medical Association, was devised specifically for women
who have already had breast cancer and have been found to carry
mutations in the genes BRCA1 or BRCA2, which play a role in 5
percent to 10 percent of the 180,000 cases of breast cancer a year
in the United States. The mutations predispose women to both breast
and ovarian cancer, and a woman with a mutation who has already had
cancer in one breast also has a higher than average risk of
developing cancer in the other breast.
</P>
<P>
   The degree of risk varies, but for a young woman with breast
cancer and one of the mutations, the generally accepted lifetime
risk of a second breast cancer can run as high as 65 percent, and
the risk of ovarian cancer can be more than 40 percent. By
contrast, young women with breast cancer but no BRCA mutation have
a 10 percent lifetime risk of cancer in the second breast, and only
a 2 percent risk of ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are difficult issues to discuss,'' said Dr. Deborah
Schrag, first author of the journal article and an oncologist in
the department of epidemiology and statistics at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. ``No one wants to tell
someone who's been hit over the head with one cancer diagnosis,
`Oh, gee, you have to worry about a second cancer.' You don't want
to scare them. On the other hand, you don't necessarily do people a
favor if you don't give them the information they need to take
charge of their health.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difficulty is that the options for women with BRCA
mutations are not appealing. Some women choose to watch and wait,
scheduling frequent examinations and mammograms to be ever on the
lookout for tumors. But that approach cannot prevent breast cancer;
the best it can do is catch the disease early.
</P>
<P>
   Women who want a more active approach can consider removing the
healthy breast, removing the ovaries or taking a five-year course
of the estrogen-blocking drug tamoxifen, which has been proved to
reduce the rate of breast cancer in high-risk women. Or, they can
combine two or even all three of those strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Feelings about the options vary widely. Women who have had
children may be glad to get rid of their ovaries, unlike those
still hoping for families. Many women consider mastectomy too
drastic. Some are wary of medication. Others find watching and
waiting too nerve-wracking.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of their emotional responses, Schrag said, women want
facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come in and say, `I know it's about my personal
preferences, but how do I think about just the objective component
of this?''' Schrag said.
</P>
<P>
   She and her colleagues developed a computer model that included
data from published studies: probabilities of cancer in the second
breast, of ovarian cancer, or of dying from those cancers or from
the original breast cancer. The model also included estimates of
the reduction in cancer incidence and death rates from removing the
breasts or ovaries, or taking tamoxifen, as well as the risks from
taking those measures.
</P>
<P>
   From that information, the model estimated how much a woman
could expect to gain in life expectancy from the various options.
According to the model, those with the lowest risk, logically, gain
the least because they live the longest on their own.
</P>
<P>
   On average, for a 30-year-old woman with a BRCA mutation and an
early-stage breast cancer, tamoxifen would add 0.4 to 1.3 years,
ovary removal 0.2 to 1.8 years and removal of the healthy breast
0.6 to 2.1 years. Having both operations would add 0.8 to 4.2
years, and combining both operations with tamoxifen would add 0.8
to 4.4 years.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the wide range of the estimates is that
different mutations confer different degrees of risk, and so do
early stage cancers, depending on the type of tumor and on how many
lymph nodes the cancer has invaded. Generally, women with early
cancers and the highest-risk mutations stand to gain the most from
preventive strategies.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors cannot always tell how dangerous a particular
mutation is. The clearest evidence is from families in which one
mutation is linked to many cancer cases, but not every patient has
enough relatives for doctors to make that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these estimates can say what will happen to any one
woman,'' Schrag said. ``They're probabilities. My goal is that they
should be used as a catalyst for discussion of this difficult
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every patient finds probabilities useful, she acknowledged.
``For some, it's gobbledygook,'' she said. ``But others feel they
gain a sense of control by knowing every number and estimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrag emphasized that the figures are averages, and that the
gains for an individual woman could be far greater or smaller.
``Let's consider a hypothetical woman,'' she said, suggesting a
woman of 40 with BRCA1 or BRCA2, who has her ovaries removed.
``It's possible she was going to get bad ovarian cancer at 43 and
succumb at 45.'' But, because she had her ovaries removed, she
never got the ovarian cancer and lived to be 75. Therefore her gain
in life expectancy could be 35 years. Her sister has the same
procedure, but even though she had the mutation, she was never
going to get ovarian cancer. She gets zero additional life
expectancy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, she said, many women choose to watch and wait,
take tamoxifen or have their ovaries removed.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Hartmann, an oncologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn., who has studied cancer prevention in high risk women, said
Schrag's model had some great strengths, but also serious
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like is that this broadens our approach,'' Hartmann
said. ``When a young woman comes in with breast cancer, sometimes
our focus is on that breast, and we forget what else she is at risk
for. This incorporates several competing risks that a woman is
facing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the limitation, Hartmann said, is that the model is
hypothetical, based on assumptions, some of which she questioned.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, she cited one assumption: that with watching and
waiting, 80 percent of breast cancers would be caught before they
spread to the lymph nodes, when the odds of cure are high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no evidence that our surveillance strategies are that
good in a young, high-risk population,'' Hartmann said. If in real
life the cancers are detected at a later stage, they have a greater
chance of being fatal, which means that a woman would be more
likely than the model predicts to benefit from taking preventive
measures.

</P>
<P>
   TUSTIN, Calif. _ Bill Cunerty, a college teacher and coach in
Southern California, has always had trouble picking
color-coordinated clothes and socks that match. Like many
``colorblind'' people, he tells the color of a traffic light by its
position, not its hue.
</P>
<P>
   But Cunerty has been trying out new glasses that, he says, allow
him to distinguish colors better. ``For me this has been like
watching `The Wizard of Oz,''' he said. ``The first half is in
black and white, and the second half is in color.''
</P>
<P>
   The glasses, made by ColorMax Technologies Inc. of Tustin, were
approved by the Food and Drug Administration in November, becoming
the first lenses specifically authorized for color deficient
vision.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts caution that such lenses do not make people see
colors as people with normal vision do. While the lenses can help
people tell some colors apart, they can make it harder to
distinguish other colors.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency has already warned ColorMax not to exaggerate
its claims for its $700 lenses. The agency says that the technology
is merely a variation of a century-old idea and that the lens
coatings are no different from what is found on some sunglasses
that have that colored mirror look.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven E. Faith, an optometrist in Livermore, Calif., who
has been selling the lenses, said the technology ``definitely
works,'' in that people are able to distinguish colors better. He
and others said the lenses had practical value for certain people,
like electronics workers who need to tell red wires from green ones
but do not care whether the wires look red or green.
</P>
<P>
   True colorblindness is extremely rare. But about 8 percent of
American men and 0.5 percent of women have some deficiency in color
vision, usually difficulty distinguishing red from green.
</P>
<P>
   For many of these people, the problem is so mild that they are
not even aware of it unless they take a color vision test. But
inadequate color vision can block people from being pilots and from
getting jobs in certain areas of law enforcement, the military and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Poor red-green color vision is mainly an inherited condition
controlled by a gene on the X chromosome, which is why it is mainly
in men. (Since women have two X chromosomes, a defective color
vision gene on one will usually be compensated for by a good gene
on the other.)
</P>
<P>
   The eye has three sets of cones that perceive color: one
sensitive to blue light, one to green and one to red. Most colors
are a combination of these, so when a person sees something, the
three types of cones are stimulated by different amounts. The brain
uses this information to determine the color.
</P>
<P>
   In some people with color deficiencies, one set of cones does
not work. But in most cases, the cones work but respond to shades
of red and green that are too close to each other in wavelength,
giving the brain less ability to distinguish between them.
</P>
<P>
   The lenses cannot fix this problem. Rather, they try to change
the color of light entering the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Red lenses, for instance, let in red light but block out most
blue and green light. A green object viewed through a red lens will
appear darker because light from it is not getting to the eye, thus
allowing it to be distinguished from a red object. This allows
someone to pass a color test in which a number is written as a
pattern of green dots on a background of colored dots.
</P>
<P>
   If a person cannot distinguish between, say, an orange and a
greenish yellow, filtering out green will change the appearance of
the greenish yellow while not affecting the orange much, allowing
them to be distinguished.
</P>
<P>
   James Clerk Maxwell, the Scottish physicist, provided red and
green lenses for a colorblind colleague as far back as 1850. For
about the last three decades, some people with color vision
problems have used red tinted contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that by blocking all the blue and green light,
such lenses make it harder to tell blues, greens and violets apart.
The lenses also reduce the overall amount of light coming into the
eye, so, like sunglasses, they are not recommended for use at
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, they make your color vision worse, but they can help
you distinguish certain colors,'' said Dr. Wayne A. Verdon, an
assistant professor of clinical optometry at the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ColorMax says its lenses are more selective in blocking out
light and more tailored to the individual patient's color vision
problem, with 10 varieties available.
</P>
<P>
   The company is guarded about its technology and its origins.
ColorMax is a publicly-traded company but is controlled by Kimrose
Holdings, a privately owned company in Hong Kong. Julie Kim, a
director of the California company and daughter of one of the
Kimrose executives, declined to provide information about Kimrose.
Donald Hansen, ColorMax president, is an optometrist in Iowa, one
of seven in the nation offering the ColorMax lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat similar lenses are being sold in other countries and
are coming to the United States. These include glasses developed by
Coloryte, a Hungarian company with an office in Norcross, Ga., and
the Chromagen contact lens developed in Britain and offered by
Fichte Eye Associates in Amherst, N.Y..
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jay M. Cohen, a professor at the State University of New
York College of Optometry in Manhattan, said many patients ordered
plain pairs of tinted lenses for $20 rather than the ColorMax
lenses for $700. ColorMax is ``a little better, but it's not $700
better,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Other patients, after trying the ColorMax lenses, decide they
would rather stick with the more monochromatic world they are used
to.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The biggest demand comes from people who want certain jobs for
which color vision is required. Danny Molvik, a college student in
Las Vegas, said he wanted to pursue a military career and liked his
ColorMax glasses. ``Everything's more bright, a lot fuller,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The glasses may be of limited use to him: Most organizations
that require color tests, like the Federal Aviation Administration,
do not allow people to use the lenses for the test. They see a
difference between being able to pass the test and having adequate
color vision.
</P>
<P>
   If the newest lenses prove better than the old ones, pressure
could mount to change such restrictions. But so far, people with
color vision problems do not seem to have formed strong groups to
push for access to jobs or to demand that signs, publications and
computer screens be understandable to people with weak color
vision.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lindsay T. Sharpe, a professor of ophthalmology at
University Eye Hospital in Tuebingen, Germany, says that people
have espoused all sorts of unproven treatments for colorblindness,
including cobra venom. Since colorblindness is a genetic problem,
he said, the best long-term hope for a cure is gene therapy. &QL;

YEP, THE MOVIES KNOW ALL ABOUT LOVE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: note italics) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of us learn an awful lot about love by watching the movies.
(The operative word here being ``awful.'') This explains where we
pick up all our romanticized notions about dating and marriage. It
also explains why our divorce rate is so high, but let's not dwell
on that.
</P>
<P>
   What do movies teach us? Basically, the same things fairy tales
do. Only in the movies, sometimes Cinderella is a prostitute and
her Prince Charming is a soulless corporate raider.
</P>
<P>
   Ain't love grand?
</P>
<P>
   But Hollywood's love lessons aren't all that twisted. In fact,
some of them, remarkably, have a ring of truth to them. So read on
for further instruction about how movies enlighten us about
passion, devotion and the prevention of gum disease.
</P>
<P>
   SOMETIMES, LOVE JUST ISN'T ENOUGH. You know the drill. Men are
from Mars; women are from Venus. And try as we might, the planets
just don't always line up. Deep-rooted personality conflicts can
wreak havoc with even the most consuming of loves; look at
Streisand and Redford in ``The Way We Were.'' (Then again, maybe
Redford simply became weary of listening to Streisand talk all the
time.)
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, accidents can happen (``An Affair to Remember'') or
the Grim Reaper can make an untimely appearance. It's hard to
sustain even the best of relationships when one half is bobbing
like a Popsicle in the ocean (``Titanic'') or coming down with some
darned terminal illness (``Love Story'').
</P>
<P>
   By far, the most tragic example of this maxim comes in ``Old
Yeller,'' when the faithful frontier dog contracts rabies after
saving a boy's life, and the boy has to load up his gun and take
Old Yeller ... and ... well ... we can't even bring ourselves to
think about what happens next.
</P>
<P>
   But if love can't save a hero like Old Yeller, what chance do we
mere mortals have?
</P>
<P>
   MEN AND WOMEN CAN'T SIMPLY BE ``FRIENDS.'' By the way, a woman
(Nora Ephron) wrote this line, so don't blame the messenger. But if
``When Harry Met Sally ...'' taught us anything (besides the fact
that women can fake a great many things), it's that the ``sex part
always gets in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry and Sally are friends until they sleep together. Then
they're adversaries _ until Harry asks Sally to marry him. And then
they're married. Certainly, they can still be friends after the
nuptials. But not ``just friends.'' It's an important distinction.
Which brings us to ...
</P>
<P>
   MARRIAGE PROPOSALS NEED NOT BE ELABORATE TO WORK. Hollywood has
long fueled the idea that an invitation to marriage must be
accompanied by a little box from Tiffany's and a fireworks show.
But movies have also shown that a simple heartfelt speech can do
the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they aren't always as sweet as Harry's speech to
Sally at that New Year's Eve party. In Alfred Hitchcock's
``Rebecca,'' Maxim, a wealthy widower played by Laurence Olivier,
makes this kind offer to Joan Fontaine's wallflower:
</P>
<P>
   ``Either you go to America with Mrs. Van Hopper or you come home
to Manderly with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean, you need a secretary or something,'' Fontaine
submissively replies.
</P>
<P>
   Olivier then utters the words every woman dreams of hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm asking you to marry me, you little fool!''
</P>
<P>
   Now, what woman could say no to that?
</P>
<P>
   A couple of generations later in ``Modern Romance,'' Albert
Brooks freaks out when he thinks his girlfriend (Kathryn Harrold)
is going to dump him. ``Marry me,'' he begs. That she ultimately
agrees to walk down the aisle instead of head for the hills speaks
more to the fact that Brooks wrote and directed the movie than it
does to any real-life plausibility.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a man can hope, can't he?
</P>
<P>
   Which leads us to the ever-popular ... MEN ARE PIGS. This
perennial favorite could be considered a bit of a surprise, given
that most movies are made by men. Maybe it's part of an
indoctrination program for women. Maybe they're telling women what
they want to hear. Or, heck, maybe it's true.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to Daniel Stern share with Steve Guttenberg his
romantic view of marriage in Barry Levinson's ``Diner'':
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the big part of the problem? When we were dating, we
spent most of our time talking about sex. Everything was about
getting sex or planning our wedding. Then when you're married it's
crazy. You can have it whenever you want. You wake up. She's there.
You come home from work. She's there. So, all the sex-planning talk
is over. And the wedding-planning talk. (You and I) can sit up and
(talk) the night away, but I can't have a five-minute conversation
with Beth. But I'm not putting the blame on her. We've just got
nothing to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Crystal's aforementioned Harry offered this insight in
``When Harry Met Sally ...'' about what men think about after sex:
</P>
<P>
   ``You have sex, and the minute you're finished, you know what
goes through your mind? How long do I have to lie here and hold her
before I can get up and go home? Is 30 seconds long enough?''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder so many women in movies believe that A GOOD GIRLFRIEND
AND A PINT OF PREMIUM ICE CREAM CAN EASILY TAKE THE PLACE OF A MAN.
``Beaches'' is the mother of all female friendship movies, a film
so full of estrogen that the mere mention of it sends men running
for the nearest sports bar. (Don't even ask what happens when a man
(BEGIN ITAL)sees(END ITAL) a copy of it lying around the house.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie's philosophy was neatly encapsulated in the scene
where Hillary (Barbara Hershey) whines to her boyfriend about the
growing rift between her and her best friend, CC (Bette Midler). A
rift that was _ you guessed it _ caused by a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would I do without a best friend?'' Hillary laments.
</P>
<P>
   Boyfriend: ``You have me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary: ``It's not the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why some men like to dream that $3,000 UP FRONT
AND ANOTHER BILLION OR SO IN THE BANK WILL FIND YOU TRUE LOVE WITH
THE PROSTITUTE OF YOUR DREAMS.
</P>
<P>
   That was the inspirational message behind ``Pretty Woman,''
wasn't it? Or maybe it was: Always floss before going to bed.
Remember Julia Roberts telling Richard Gere that you shouldn't
neglect your gums, making her unique in the vast universe of
Hookers With Hearts of Gold. (BEGIN ITAL)She(END ITAL) was an
outspoken advocate of proper dental hygiene.
</P>
<P>
   LOVE IS ALL FOREPLAY. Think about it. With precious few
exceptions (``Two for the Road'' comes to mind), movies tell us
plenty about romance, but very little about what it takes to stay
together. If we do see a movie marriage, it usually involves the
couple from hell (``The War of the Roses,'' ``The Story of Us'')
whose ways are more destructive than instructive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepless in Seattle'' stands as the ultimate example of the
foreplay genre. The film's lovers (Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan) don't
meet until the very last scene, and yet were supposed to believe
that they'll live happily ever after. Who knows? Maybe they will.
But don't you think Hanks should at least find out if Meg watches
``Ally McBeal'' instead of Monday Night Football before he goes and
does anything crazy?
</P>
<P>
   LOVE MEANS NEVER HAVING TO SAY YOU'RE SORRY. Unless you made
``Love Story.'' Or ``Pretty Woman.'' Or, especially, ``Beaches.''
Then you have a lot to answer for, and a simple apology will not
suffice. &QL;

 &HT;    CONGRESS COOL TO CLINTON MEDICARE, SOCIAL SECURITY PLANS
 &HT;    With FEDBUD.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - President Clinton's Medicare and Social Security
proposals received a cool reception from congressional leaders
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would trim Medicare spending by $70 billion over
the next 10 years and use nearly $300 billion of the projected
federal surplus to extend the program's lifetime to about 2025.
</P>
<P>
   The president also proposed using the surplus to pay off more
than $3 trillion of federal debt owed to the public by 2013. Using
the interest saved by paying off the debt would extend the life of
the Social Security program until about 2050, he said. Clinton
proposed to invest a portion of that money in private equity
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the House Ways and Means
subcommittee on health, which oversees the Medicare program, noted
that Congress had rejected proposals last year to trim $72 billion
from Medicare, ``which is why I can't understand why he would again
propose cuts in Medicare to the tune of nearly $70 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when seniors are struggling with the high costs of
prescription drugs and other treatments, we should be increasing
their access to benefits while lowering their out-of-pocket costs,
not the other way around as the president proposes,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   But Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said
Clinton's budget ensure's the program's viability for an additional
10 years while providing much-needed reforms to make the program
operate more efficiently and providing a prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of Medicare as a blank check are over,'' Shalala
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would use nearly $300 billion of the projected
surplus over the next 10 years to bolster the Medicare hospital
trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton would spend $160 billion over 10 years for
a voluntary prescription drug benefit. In addition, Clinton
proposed a $35 billion ``catastrophic drug fund'' that would help
pay drug costs in excess of $2,500 a year by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Under the president's plan, the federal government would pay
half the cost of prescription drugs up to $2,000 in 2003 (the
federal share would be $1,000) and up to $5,000 (the federal share
would be $2,500) when fully phased in by 2009.
</P>
<P>
   Premiums for the drug benefit would begin at $26 a month in 2003
and increase to $51 a month by 2009.
</P>
<P>
   Low-income beneficiaries, those with income below 135 percent of
poverty level at that time, would not pay premiums. Those with
incomes between 135 and 150 percent of poverty level would pay
reduced premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Special
Committee on Aging, said Clinton deserves credit for proposing a
Medicare prescription drug benefit, but his proposal ``needs
revision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Adding a prescription drug benefit without rebuilding
Medicare's foundation won't help older Americans in the long run,''
Grassley said. ``Medicare can't continue indefinitely in its
current form. We have to restructure Medicare to save it for future
generations. We should add a prescription drug benefit only in that
context.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal to invest a portion of the surplus savings in
the equities market also drew complaints from GOP leaders. The
president had dropped the equities plan from a Social Security
reform proposal he offered last fall, but he restored it in the
budget offered Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any reasonable observer would have to wonder: why?'' said Rep.
E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., chairman of the House Social Security
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman ``Alan Greenspan called government
investing 'very dangerous.' Which leads to another question: Is the
president serious about saving Social Security? His 'now you see
it, now you don't' approach on government investing suggests not,''
Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget also proposes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Expanded preventive care by eliminating co-insurance and
deductibles for colorectal cancer screening, bone mass measurement,
pelvic examinations, prostate cancer screening, diabetes
self-management and mammographies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allowing persons aged 55 to 65 to ``buy into'' the Medicare
program.
</P>
<P>
   _ A demonstration project to make it easier for Medicare
patients to participate in cancer clinical trials.

HOSPITAL IN BOSTON HALTS GENE THERAPY EXPERIMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times) 
 &HT;    (DW) 
 By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston has
temporarily suspended a gene therapy experiment to permit further
discussion of the issues underlying such work after a young man's
death last year in a similar trial in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Rosenblatt, interim president of the hospital, said
there have been no problems associated with the experiment, which
involved 12 patients with hemophilia. But Rosenblatt said the
climate of uncertainty suggested that ``we should push the pause
button for a time.'' He added: ``We decided to say, let's review
this, we don't have to hurry here. There is no information or
medical or scientific event that is grounds for stopping the trial,
but why not slow things down a bit?''
</P>
<P>
   The suspension follows a decision on Jan. 21 by the Food and
Drug Administration to shut down all gene therapy experiments at
the University of Pennsylvania after an 18-year-old man in a gene
therapy experiment there died. The action by the agency and the
unexpected death of the relatively healthy patient in the Penn
experiment have generated nervousness across the field of gene
therapy. After that incident, members of a committee at the
National Institutes of Health found that scientists were not
routinely reporting problems with gene therapy experiments.
</P>
<P>
   There have been about 300 gene therapy experiments in the United
States over the past decade, experts estimate. Some scientists have
said it was not clear that they were required to report to the
National Institutes of Health committee.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer at Beth Israel, in a different gene therapy
experiment, three of the first six patients enrolled died, and
those deaths were not reported to the NIH. Since that time, said
Rosenblatt, FDA officials who looked at the experiment said the
three deaths were unrelated to the research. The patients enrolled
in the study, as is traditional in early experiments with a
treatment, were the sickest of cancer patients, those not expected
to live for more than a few weeks to a few months in any case.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Mulligan, director of the gene therapy program at
Children's Hospital in Boston and chairman of the Harvard Gene
Therapy Initiative at all the Harvard-affiliated hospitals, said in
a telephone interview Monday that other hospitals have not taken so
cautious an approach, and that in most cases it was not needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This field has developed with a lot of baggage because of the
hype surrounding it,'' Mulligan said. ``It is counted among the
most promising of all areas of medical research because, if it
works as a general matter, there are few human diseases or
disorders that could not use the therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   In principle, the treatment uses healthy genes to counteract the
effects of diseased ones, or fresh genes to produce specially high
levels of disease-fighting chemicals in the body. In the hemophilia
experiment, cells were taken from the patients, and genes to make a
key blood clotting factor were inserted into the cells. They were
then put back into the patients in hopes they would produce the
missing factors.
</P>
<P>
   Mulligan said that while some nervousness has developed in the
field, it is not because there are significant problems with the
research, but rather because one experiment was apparently
conducted badly, and that event was magnified by the failure to
report to NIH.
</P>
<P>
   ``But through it all,'' Mulligan said, ``the field is very much
benefiting from a resetting of the course, from a reduction in
hype, and a return to the appreciation of the core scientific
values, and the realization that the conduct of clinical
experiments can have tragic consequences if people are not careful
to conduct them properly.''

HIGH-END HOT ROD MERCEDES IS CREAM OF CONVERTIBLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Hot rods are big this year. Just look at the lofty
prices bid on vintage muscle cars, especially convertibles, at the
recent Barrett-Jackson Classic Car Auction in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz might not be known for its hot rods, but that's
what pops to mind when the CLK430 Cabriolet sprints up a freeway
ramp, top down, in all its hedonistic V-8 glory.
</P>
<P>
   Expensive, exclusive, beautiful to look at and better to drive,
the CLK430 is the cream of the compact-convertible crop, which
includes such craft as Volvo C70, Saab 9-3, Chrysler Sebring _ even
Ford Mustang. It's a high-end extravaganza of technology,
engineering and aesthetics, and signals Mercedes' newfound ability
to put great things into small packages as well as great-big ones.
</P>
<P>
   The CLK cars started off with the 1998 CLK320 coupe, adding a
convertible and a high-performance CLK430 coupe the next year.
Those familiar with Mercedes nomenclature know that the CLK320 is
powered by a 3.2 liter V-6, which delivers 215 horsepower, and the
CLK430 has a 4.3 liter V-8, which makes 275.
</P>
<P>
   The CLK430 Cabriolet is the fourth top-end CLK model. Adding V-8
performance to the convertible mix gives the Cabriolet another
dimension. Performance is not quite as sharp as the lighter CLK430
coupe, but it's still some awesome stuff.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers, zero to 60 comes in just 6.1 seconds, Mercedes
says, and the CLK has the handling and finesse to match the strong
engine power. Torque is abundant at all engine speeds, via a
two-stage intake manifold that adjusts with engine speed.
</P>
<P>
   With massive performance radials on 17-inch rims attached to a
refined multilink suspension front and rear, the ride and cornering
are balanced and responsive.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes' advanced Electronic Stability System is standard on
all CLKs, providing a technological edge to the handling prowess.
Like similar systems on other high-end cars, the stability system
applies the brake to an individual wheel, taking control when it
senses a skid. Anti-lock braking is standard on all Mercedes cars,
coupled with Brake Assist, which amplifies brake pressure if it
senses a panic-stop situation.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some additions and improvements to the CLK line
for 2000, including turn signals that flash on the outside
rear-view mirrors; a new instrument-panel design; a steering wheel
with functions for stereo and climate control; optional COMAND
system of stereo, trip computer and navigation mapping controls;
and a Touch Shift system to allow manual control of the five-speed
automatic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Touch Shift works well in those instances when more driving
control is desired. On full automatic, the transmission adjusts
electronically to individual driving styles. It really does work,
too. But I found that it made shifting unpredictable, and I'd
prefer that it just stayed put.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of the CLK430 Cabriolet is enhanced with an aero
package by Mercedes' performance arm, AMG, and that beautiful set
of 17-inch rims. Naturally, it looks best with the top down. That
top is fully automatic, operated with a single button that
unlatches it from the windshield, lifts a cover in the rear deck,
folds the top inside and closes it again, all in a mechanical
ballet that takes about 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The top does take up about half of the trunk space, though. With
the top up, the trunk is about the same size as the coupe's, which
is good-sized for a small car.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is lush and comfortable, at least for the
passengers in front. The rear passengers will find things a bit
cramped, though not as bad as some other small convertibles.
</P>
<P>
   The leather interior in the test car was kind of weird. In a
pattern called salsa leather, it's a black and red concoction that
looks out of place in this otherwise refined automobile.
</P>
<P>
   The new dash display is nice, trimmed in black bird's-eye maple.
</P>
<P>
   For those who can afford the entry fee, the CLK430 is a terrific
car. The price for the extra performance is steep, but the
high-tech standard features are impressive. And like most other
Mercedes convertibles, it should be an instant collectible.
</P>
<P>
   Just skip that gaudy interior. &QL;

PROMISE AND PERIL OF NEW DRUGS FOR AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Mo., Australia)   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In less than four years, the euphoria over the
success of new drug combinations to treat AIDS has yielded to the
sobering challenge of dealing with the drugs' complications and
failures.
</P>
<P>
   Death rates for what had been an invariably fatal disease have
dropped significantly since the introduction of combinations of
protease inhibitors and other drugs. Many people with HIV, the AIDS
virus, including some who were near death when they began taking
the drug combinations in 1996, continue to lead more or less normal
lives, though they must take a number of pills at specified times
throughout the day, at costs that can exceed $10,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   And a short course of drugs can stop transmission of HIV from a
mother to her newborn, though this important gain is not being
delivered in many countries for lack of money and public health
services.
</P>
<P>
   But the unflagging optimism that AIDS scientists displayed at an
international meeting on AIDS in Vancouver in 1996 was absent at
the Seventh Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections
here from Jan. 30 through Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the infection is spreading through many parts
of the world. Another is that many of the participants at the
conference were doctors who treat infected people for whom the drug
combinations have not worked as well. No one knows for sure how
many they are: Reports range from 30 percent to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A major cause of drug failure is HIV's uncanny knack of mutating
to become resistant to drugs. Thus, the greatest challenges now are
to develop novel classes of anti-HIV drugs and new members of older
classes that are active against resistant virus.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's conference, there were strong hints, from the
very earliest stages of research, that such potent new drugs could
eventually be developed, and experts greeted the reports with
cautious optimism.
</P>
<P>
   But since AIDS was discovered in 1981, there have been few
breakthroughs. And the findings reported here, meeting officials
said, represented incremental progress, not major advances.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies now market 14 anti-HIV drugs and a number of
other drugs for the array of infections that occur as potentially
fatal complications of AIDS. That small arsenal is an indisputable
advance over the early days of the epidemic, when there was no
effective therapy for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The relative abundance of AIDS drugs has created greater need
for expertise in prescribing the vast number of combinations.
Dealing with the complexity of HIV treatment ``is something that
cannot be expected of physicians who don't do it most of the
time,'' said Dr. Robert T. Schooley, a meeting official who is an
AIDS expert at the University of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Many AIDS doctors said they had often been confused about which
anti-HIV drugs to prescribe and when to start them. Many experts
favor beginning treatment almost as soon as HIV is detected, long
before symptoms of AIDS develop. Others favor waiting longer
because of the difficulties in adhering to the rigorous drug
regimens and the growing number of side effects. Additional
confusion can occur if resistance develops and creates a need to
change drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors must now also be alert to an increasingly complex web of
drug interactions. The web can inadvertently increase or weaken the
potency of drugs taken for other conditions, promote development of
resistant viruses, reduce chances of successful long-term therapy
and cause harm in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are learning to tailor therapy for each infected person
by using new tests that detect the genetic patterns of HIV
resistance to various drugs.
</P>
<P>
   They also monitor the amount of HIV in the blood to determine
the effectiveness of therapy.
</P>
<P>
   When combination drug therapy began to drive the amount of virus
to levels below the limits of detection in such tests, many doctors
and others jumped to the conclusion that the virus was not
replicating in the body. A prevailing opinion is that replication
of the virus must be suppressed as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes of the University of Colorado, an
invited speaker at the meeting, said, ``It is easy to get lulled
into a false sense of security that just because you can't measure
something, it is not there.''
</P>
<P>
   That point has become clear in the last year as researchers have
gained compelling evidence that viral replication still occurs,
although slowly, even when tests show no detectable virus. Now a
major question is: Will slow replication have a long-term adverse
effect on what now appears to be successful therapy?
</P>
<P>
   Growing recognition of the hazards of long-term drug therapy has
created another area of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago at this meeting, Dr. David A. Cooper of Sydney,
Australia, first reported that many patients receiving anti-HIV
therapy had developed unusual collections of body fat that created
paunches and buffalo humps on the backs of necks. Then the
complications grew to include metabolic changes like elevations in
cholesterol and triglycerides that could increase the risk of heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the list of long-term complications of anti-HIV
therapy expanded further. Teams headed by Cooper and Dr. William G.
Powderly at Washington University in St. Louis reported that many
infected people had developed thinning of bones from osteoporosis,
which can increase the risk of fractures. Though no one knows how
often drug-related osteoporosis affects HIV-infected people, the
number appears substantial.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fat, metabolic and bone abnormalities is
unclear and controversial. Initially, the problems were linked to
one or more of the protease inhibitor drugs. Now the reports are
conflicting. Some say other AIDS drugs can cause the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Still others contend that the changes result from HIV itself,
the aging process and factors unrelated to drugs. The variety of
abnormalities probably have more than one cause, the participants
said. For now, the abnormalities seem to correlate best with the
length of anti-HIV therapy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The complications have discouraged some people from starting
therapy early in the course of infection. Also, many who experience
the complications want to change drugs in hope of reversing the
effects. But deciding which mid-course correction to make can be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, studies are beginning to determine whether
lipid-lowering drugs known as statins, which lower the amount of
cholesterol and body fats, will reduce the risk of complications.
</P>
<P>
   To Cooper and others, the confusion reflects the price paid for
the Food and Drug Administration's decision to license drugs faster
in response to a public health emergency. Because many AIDS drug
trials lasted less than four months, the complications were not
recognized earlier. The lesson for the future, many participants
said, is to monitor the long-term effects of such drugs more
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   There was general agreement on one point: the need for further
laboratory research, epidemiology and rigorously controlled
clinical studies to better define the complications and find
counter measures.
</P>
<P>
   Since combination drug therapy began, there has been great
concern that taking ``drug holidays'' would increase the risk that
the virus might develop resistance. For many, the concern has
proved real.
</P>
<P>
   But anecdotal reports that a rare individual could stop therapy
and not have HIV return intrigued scientists. A few researchers
began testing a concept that cycles of starting and stopping drug
therapy might strengthen the immune system and help people battle
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard Hirschel's team from the University of Geneva
reported a modest reduction in the replication of HIV after a small
number of participants stopped drug treatment for three cycles. The
participants took combination drug therapy for eight weeks and
stopped for two weeks to test the concept, known as structured
treatment interruption.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patrick Yeni of Bichat Hospital in Paris was among the
speakers who said the preliminary findings from the Swiss and other
continuing studies were inconclusive. ``Obviously we need much more
data before we can recommend such a strategy,'' Yeni said.
</P>
<P>
   Kuritzkes said there had been ``no demonstration to date that
these transient boosts actually have any benefit'' in staving off
development of AIDS or simplifying therapy. ``It is not yet certain
that this is going to be a fruitful strategy,'' Kuritzkes said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, who directs the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the limited available
findings suggested that ``if there will be any success with
interrupted therapy, it will be among those treated within weeks
after they became infected.'' Even in that small group, only a
minority of such people might benefit, Fauci said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he and others say the hope is to identify the
immunological factor that allows such rare individuals to fight off
HIV and to manipulate it into a therapy to benefit those who do not
have it.
</P>
<P>
   Standard anti-HIV drugs are directed at two areas in HIV's life
cycle: the protease and reverse transcriptase enzymes. The drug
action makes it difficult for the virus to replicate.
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers are developing a novel class of anti-HIV drugs
that strikes a different area, blocking the entry of virus into
cells. Twice daily injections of T-20, the first member of this
class known as entry inhibitors, showed that it could work in
people with viruses resistant to other anti-HIV drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary success with T-20, which was developed by
Trimeris Inc. of Durham, N.C., will probably spur a search for
other entry inhibitors that can be taken orally, participants said.
</P>
<P>
   Reports about entry inhibitors were greeted with cautious
enthusiasm because as experimental drugs are tested, researchers
often encounter hazards that delay or stop progress. Some
experimental drugs that showed much promise at last year's meeting
have since fallen by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the point, Merck &AMP; Co., the drug maker,
canceled a report scheduled for this year's closing session because
scientists recently detected unexpected kidney damage in rodents
given one of its experimental protease inhibitors. Human studies of
the drug have been put on hold, a Merck spokeswoman said.

 &HT;    EDUCATORS PRAISE CLINTON'S CALL FOR HIGHER SPENDING
 &HT;    With FEDBUD.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton pleased education groups Monday
by seeking a sharp jump in federal help for education.
</P>
<P>
   His budget for the 2001 fiscal year includes a $4.4 billion
increase in discretionary spending by the Education Department. It
offers an average of $3 billion a year in education-related tax
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, Clinton also proposed a separate $1.6 billion
increase for Head Start and other early childhood programs
supervised by the Department of Health and Human Services, said
Joel Packer, chief lobbyist for the nation's largest teacher union,
the National Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly the biggest increase in education outlays we've
ever seen, and it goes into a lot of high-need areas,'' said Edward
Kealy, executive director of the Committee for Education Funding.
His coalition coordinates the lobbying efforts of 95 national
groups that favor higher spending on education from the pre-school
level to post-doctoral research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's definitely going to challenge Congress to show
just how much they value investing in education during this
election year,'' Kealy said happily. ``I think (the
Republican-controlled) Congress will want to match (the Democratic
president's) suggestions in most areas and exceed them in some
others that are a higher priority for Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, Republicans have shown a greater interest
in funding grants for experiments in educational innovation and for
increasing the federal share of funding of special education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased by the attention the budget gives to student aid
and scientific research,'' said Paul Massey, federal relations
associate at the American Council on Education, which represents
most colleges and universities. ``It's a good blueprint.''
</P>
<P>
   Discretionary spending must be funded each year by Congress. In
the current fiscal year, the department's discretionary spending is
$35.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are requesting $40.1 billion, an increase of $4.5 billion
or 12.6 percent,'' Education Secretary Richard Riley told
reporters. ``This budget represents the biggest jump in
discretionary spending in the history of this department.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest boosts would be $1.3 billion for emergency
renovations at schools in high-poverty areas, $547 million for
after-school learning centers, $450 million to hire more teachers
in order to reduce class sizes in kindergarten through third grade,
and $416 million to help districts make major changes in their
worst-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   On the tax side, Clinton proposed deductions and credits for
educational purposes that would cost the federal treasury $839
million in the next fiscal year and $15.5 billion over a five-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   About $11 billion of that $15.5 billion would help college
students and their families by expanding the Lifetime Learning tax
credit. The other education-related tax breaks include $2.4 billion
to subsidize bonds for school construction and modernization and
$1.2 billion to ``bridge the digital divide'' by giving tax breaks
to businesses that help poor people and minorities get computers
and acquire technology skills.
</P>
<P>
   None of the education lobbyists was concerned about Clinton's
proposal for $2.9 billion in cuts next year in mandatory spending,
the kind that continues automatically until Congress changes the
law. Congress, which rejected such proposals in the past, is widely
expected to once again reject the main cut requested by Clinton,
which would restrict subsidies to student-loan guaranty agencies.

PRESCRIBE (Undated) - Rural Arizona seniors are up in arms about
lack of HMO coverage. Some are moving to Maricopa County, others
are desperately trying to figure out what to do: Pay their rent or
by their drugs. Only five of the counties in Arizona now have HMO
coverage, And the rural counties that do still have HMOs have cut
back services. By MAUREEN WEST. Story will move in the `A`

 &QL; 
SEDONA (Undated) - The U.S. Forest Service is about to start
charging for hiking the red rocks of the Sedona area as part of its
fee program to recoup money for the local Forest Service offices.
The likely fee will be $20 per year or $5 a visit. This hasn't gone
down well in the Sedona area. It also was a hot potato when the
Prescott National Forest did this last year for hiking in the
Prescott area. By MARK SHAFFER. Story will move in the `A`
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AUTO-REVIEW (Undated) - Hot rods are big this year. Just look at
the lofty prices bid on vintage muscle cars, especially
convertibles, at the recent Barrett-Jackson Classic Car Auction in
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz might not be known for its hot rods, but that's
what pops to mind when the CLK430 Cabriolet sprints up a freeway
ramp, top down, in all its hedonistic V-8 glory. By BOB GOLFEN.
Story moved in the `L` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - After three months of investigation,
``The Arizona Republic'' published a whopping two-page expose in
last Sunday's paper proving that, as far as anybody knew, U.S.
senator and presidential candidate John McCain had absolutely
nothing _ as in nada, zilch, diddly-squat _ to do with the murder
of one-time newspaper writer Ron Bianchi. After three intense . . .
hours of exhaustive investigation I'm prepared to state with equal
confidence that Sen. McCain was in no way involved with the
disappearance of Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa, the collapse of the
Arizona Cardinals and the mysterious success of ``Who Wants to be a

 &HT;    MORE ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE BY RUSSIAN SOLDIERS IN CHECHNYA
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia _ More allegations of killings, kidnappings and
looting by Russian soldiers against civilians have surfaced from
refugees who have fled the bombed-out husk of Grozny, the Chechen
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch, a New York-based watchdog group, has
documented eight incidents in the Staropromyslovsky neighborhood in
which it says a total of 22 civilians were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Still unconfirmed are reports of more than a dozen other murders
which allegedly took place during the months-long campaign by
Russian soldiers to take Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disturbing number of civilians have been murdered by Russian
troops in Grozny,'' said Peter Bouckaert, a researcher with Human
Rights Watch. ``They were willfully killed. This shows the need for
independent international observers and investigation of this
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officials did not respond to telephone calls
Monday asking for comment. Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the government
spokesman for Chechnya, said he was not aware of the cases cited by
Human Rights Watch. In the past, Russia has said that it is not
targeting civilians in its offensive aimed at eradicating
``terrorists and bandits'' in the breakaway region.
</P>
<P>
   Most reports of civilian suffering during the war have been the
result of Russian artillery and air strikes. However, there have
been reports of killings and other abuse similar to those described
by the Staropromyslovsky refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week of December, at least 14 civilians were
murdered in the village of Alkhan Yurt by Russian soldiers after
the army took control of it, Human Rights Watch and refugees claim.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents from Staropromyslovsky, one of the first
neighborhoods in Grozny to come under Russian control, are the
first such reports of human rights abuses from the capital city,
Chechnya's largest. It is estimated that 15,000 to 30,000 civilians
remained trapped in Grozny during the two months it took Russian
forces to conquer the territory.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged attacks in Staropromyslovsky took place between Dec.
22 and Jan. 21, after soldiers announced they had liberated the
neighborhood from rebel fighters. Witnesses and relatives broke
into tears as they described their experiences to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Fatimat Dangaeva, 46, told how she had lived for months, trapped
with family members in Grozny under relentless Russian air strikes
and street battles between Russian soldiers and the Chechen forces.
She would leave her invalid parents, an uncle and a neighbor _ all
more 70 years old _ at the family's two-story brick house to sleep
at night, while she took shelter in a nearby bomb shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before Christmas, Russian soldiers announced they had
complete control of the district. ``They said it was all safe,''
she recalled, rubbing her brown eyes.
</P>
<P>
   She said the soldiers forced civilians living in the bomb
shelter with her to collect corpses of dead soldiers from the
streets. ``They said if we didn't come out they would throw a
grenade in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers also harassed the family, arriving at night with
masks over their faces and demanding alcohol, she said. During one
visit, she continued, they stole a gold clock, Dangaeva's treasured
family heirloom.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 9, Dangaeva said her mother walked outside past a
soldier trying to cover his face. She confronted him, saying,
``Don't bother to cover yourself. I will remember you.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Dangaeva walked from her shelter to her home
and found her father and a female neighbor shot to death in the
kitchen, the room where they slept.
</P>
<P>
   The basement, where her mother and uncle slept, was on fire. She
said she could not open the doors because the heat was too intense.
Her mother and uncle have been missing ever since, and she assumes
they died in the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the military police station just 200 meters (60
feet) away. They said they saw nothing and heard nothing,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided then to flee,'' Dangaeva said, sighing heavily while
sitting around a rectangular wooden dining room table at a
relative's house in Nazran, just across the border from Chechnya.
``I cannot understand why they would kill these old people.''
</P>
<P>
   She insisted that Chechen rebels could not have been responsible
for the deaths, because Russian troops were heavily concentrated in
her neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Saipudin Saadulayev, 39, a former oil worker with a salt and
pepper beard, said he saw Russian soldiers shoot an elderly man at
point-blank range. The old man, Said Tugoyev, was shot when he left
the cellar he was living in with Saadulayev and a group of other
men and walked across a yard to tell two Russian soldiers that only
civilians were in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shot him with a machine-gun and then a soldier leaned
over and shot him in the head,'' Saadulayev told reporters during
an interview at a home north of Nazran, the capital of Ingushetia,
where he is living as a refugee.
</P>
<P>
   Saadulayev said the soldiers threw a grenade at him, but he
jumped back into the basement and escaped injury. Later, he said, a
second group of soldiers came to the basement and ordered everyone
out.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers took eight men prisoner and drove them across
Grozny and unloaded them into a pit where they were beaten. He said
the men made them strip and threw water over them in the sub-zero
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, the soldiers reportedly took a group of 18
Chechen men to a camp outside Grozny. Saadulayev said he escaped
and that he doesn't know what happened to the rest of the men.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate account, Magomed Kheshiyev, 59, told reporters he
found his sister Lida and her teenage son shot dead on Jan. 25. His
brother and another nephew are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Guilt weighs heavily on the man, who left his home in Grozny in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, 'I beg you to leave,' but my sister did not want
to listen. She said 'I'm not afraid of anything,''' he recalled.
``I saw her body and I wept. And I don't (usually) cry.''

 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many journalists who write about science, I have received
what might be called the delta-t lecture from Dr. J. Richard Gott,
a folksy and engaging professor of physics at Princeton. The
lecture, which revolves around survival times, or delta-t's,
explains Gott's theory that the likely future duration of anything,
from the human race to a musical playing on Broadway, can be
predicted. All you need to know is the time that has passed since
the entity in question came into being until the moment when you
asked, ``How long will this last?''
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the lecture, which lasted until the small hours
of a summer night in Princeton in 1996, I asked Gott to predict how
long it might be until the Chicago White Sox won another World
Series, knowing that the last time they had done so was in 1917.
After a quick calculation, he said there was a 95 percent chance
that the following statement was true: The White Sox would not win
a World Series in the following two years, but they would win one
before the year 5077 if the team still existed then.
</P>
<P>
   That was an awfully wide delta-t, even for a Sox fan. And
despite his having published the theory in the journal Nature in
1993, I worried that there might be something amiss in his
reasoning and never wrote about it.
</P>
<P>
   Now I wish that I had. Last July, Timothy Ferris, a science
writer, published a lucid piece in The New Yorker, titled ``How to
Predict Everything: Has the Physicist J. Richard Gott Really Found
a Way?'' The piece was read by Dr. Carlton M. Caves, a longtime New
Yorker subscriber, who also happens to be a physicist studying
information theory and statistics at the University of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Motivated by the article, Caves did a remarkable thing: He wrote
a mathematical rebuttal to the theory, which will be published by a
British academic journal, Contemporary Physics. Although Gott does
not accept many of Caves' conclusions, the new calculation does, at
least, begin to reveal both the practical limitations and the
strengths of a theory that can sometimes appear incomprehensibly
general and hence difficult to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Gott's theory is based on the Copernican principle, which can be
boiled down to his oft-repeated mantra, ``You're not special.'' The
astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus showed that the Earth is not at the
center of the universe, that it occupies no special place, and the
same idea works for more mundane things like addresses or names in
a phone book.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Gott pointed out that neither Caves,
Copernicus, Ferris, Glanz or Gott fell outside the fat 95 percent
of the phone book _ before Anno or after Wilson, say. Gott could
have predicted that that simple fact would probably be true
``without having to go and do extensive research on the size of
phone books all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he extends the Copernican principle to time. Reasoning,
after he visited the Soviet Union in 1977, that he was there not at
a special time but somewhere in the middle 95 percent of its
existence, he could figure out the Soviet Union's likely survival
time from how old it was at that moment, 55 years. It's like
guessing the total thickness of a phone book by counting the pages
backward from a typical name, like Gott.
</P>
<P>
   Simple math shows that the current age divided by 39 (based on
an area of probability of a bell curve) is the shortest likely
survival time, and the age multiplied by 39 is the longest. His
formula predicted that the Soviet Union would endure 17 months to
2,145 years. It fell 14 years later. Humanity itself, he predicts,
is likely to be around from 200,000 to 8 million years longer, but
not indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The formula is extremely useful and maybe the best estimate
you have in cases where your prior information is weak,'' Gott
said. ``The duration of intelligent species is one.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to Caves' calculation, which is based on a
rigorous formalism called Bayesian statistics, it is exactly the
availability of this ``prior,'' or supplemental, information that
makes Gott's theory incorrect in a wide variety of circumstances.
Only if one had no information about the politics, history,
leadership, industrial base and institutions of the Soviet Union
and all other countries would Gott's prediction be anything but a
lucky guess, according to the Bayesian analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put succinctly, he rejects as irrelevant the process of
rational, scientific inquiry, replacing it with a single, universal
rule,'' Caves wrote. ``That has to be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In the paper, Caves highlighted his point by compiling a
notarized list of 24 dogs owned by faculty and staff members and
students in his department at the University of New Mexico. He
selected the six dogs that were more than 10 years old, a procedure
that required prior information, and pointed out that Gott's
formula predicted that each should survive to twice its present age
with a probability of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Then Caves proposed $1,000 bets, at 2-1 odds in Gott's favor,
that each of the six dogs would not survive that long. Gott replied
that his formula would apply to the survival of all 24 dogs, but
that the selected sample was unfairly chosen. ``By the way,'' he
added, ``I just don't do bets.''
</P>
<P>
   Caves replied that ``it is inescapable that he doesn't believe
his own rule in the case of the dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of the White Sox? They have not come close to the World
Series since 1996, fulfilling the first part of Gott's prediction.
But Caves says that ``prior information,'' like knowing the natural
time spans of ballplayers' careers, cycles of ownership and the
changing fortunes of other teams would allow him to predict a
Series victory well before 5077.
</P>

   ``Even if the White Sox are wretched for 10 years or 20 years,''
Caves said, ``I think it's a real mistake to assume they'll be
wretched for 3,000 years.''

STEPS TO SMOOTH PAYING FOR FUNERAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SHANNON BUGGS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The blur of tears and phone calls to family, friends
and funeral homes can make the first 48 hours after a loved one
dies seem surreal.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do people grieve for the deceased, they worry about the
mundane and the immense.
</P>
<P>
   Who will sing at the funeral?
</P>
<P>
   How will all the bills get paid?
</P>
<P>
   Will I be able to go on?
</P>
<P>
   An answer to the first question may be found in a farewell
letter with funeral instructions, while a resolution to the third
requires fortitude and fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   The second concern, however, can only be solved by advanced
planning.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MAKE A WILL ACCESSIBLE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We all know we should prepare for the day we die by writing a
will and sharing what's in it with our families.
</P>
<P>
   But most people put off writing down their final wishes until
it's too late. If they do commit their desires to paper, very often
they don't want anyone to know how much will or won't be in the
estate. So they hide the will away in a bank safety deposit box
without a mention to family or friends.
</P>
<P>
   The result is the person places an unnecessary burden on the
people left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Families should be able to get a full accounting of your
finances within the first couple of days of your death to properly
wrap up your affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, they will need to know how much money you have
available to pay for the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true for people who believe their life savings
and worldly assets are so insignificant that they don't merit a
will. By state law, counties must bury those whose families don't
have the money to buy a burial plot. Some counties, including
Harris, which includes most of Houston, require that officials be
notified within 48 hours of the death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best remedy is to look at these things prior to a death,
so you don't add stress to people at such a difficult time,'' says
Walter Johnson, president of Johnson Funeral Home in Houston. ``But
a lot of times that doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TRACKING DECEASED'S ASSETS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you find yourself struggling to plan a funeral and to piece
together the deceased's financial history, in addition to calling
your attorney, financial planner and funeral director, here are
steps you can take:
</P>
<P>
   1. Call family members and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond sharing the sad news, you can ask everyone if they have
any knowledge of where important documents may be.
</P>
<P>
   Also ask if the deceased ever shared any thoughts about what he
or she wanted done at the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it helps to ask the other mourners if they have
requests or preferences for the funeral and burial. By taking
others into consideration, you can avoid hurt feelings later.
</P>
<P>
   2. Search the home.
</P>
<P>
   Your first priority is to locate as many financial papers as
possible. These include a will, insurance policies, bills, bank
statements, safe deposit contracts and keys.
</P>
<P>
   You should also be on the lookout for funeral instructions that
can guide your planning.
</P>
<P>
   3. Visit the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you take a death certificate, safety deposit box key
and personal identification with you. By state law, banks must
allow an immediate family member to remove wills, burial plot
contracts, insurance policies and funeral instructions from a
deceased customer's safety deposit box.
</P>
<P>
   The bank can only do this before a court probates the will and
appoints an executor to handle the estate. However, the bank can't
allow anything else to be removed from the box.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you know the person would have wanted to be buried with
the military medal or sorority pin that was kept in the box, and
you have power of attorney or have access to the box, it's best to
remove those items before you inform the bank of the death.
</P>
<P>
   That also means you should check the bank box before you run an
obituary in the newspaper. Most banks assign a staffer to read
obituaries every day and check them against a master list of
customers. When a match is found, the client's accounts are
immediately frozen.
</P>
<P>
   So, if the deceased spouse's name is the only one on all the
couple's bank accounts, the survivor may have to seek an immediate
probate of the will to get the money to pay for the funeral.
Probating a will in Texas is fairly simple, but it is still
troublesome to do it immediately after a death.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ It's late in the afternoon and there's a peaceful,
mellow feeling in artist Gary Hernandez's studio.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez and his son Tiziano have just settled down at their
easels for a few hours of quiet father/son painting and sketching.
</P>
<P>
   In the peach-colored living room that also serves as a gallery,
Josefa Hernandez serves coffee surrounded by her husband's and
son's art.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that the Gary J. Hernandez Gallery and School
of Fine Arts is a family affair. During art openings, Hernandez's
mother-in-law pours drinks and serves home-cooked food. While
father and son create their art and Gary teaches, Josefa, known to
all as Josie, holds it all together.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez admits he's a happy man. At 46, the son of blue-collar
workers, his struggles are finally behind him. He's an artist and a
teacher, living the dream he's had since he was a child growing up
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had the desire to draw,'' Hernandez said. ``My mom
gave me an eggshell pad and pencil when I was 5.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez dates his dreams to a second-grade school visit to the
Museum of Fine Arts in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally drawn into the paintings, but I didn't know how
to be an artist,'' Hernandez recalled. ``Everyone in my family
worked as laborers.''
</P>
<P>
   It took awhile for Hernandez to pull it together, but he finally
did, and he credits his mom for his determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a tough woman, and she taught me how to work,'' he
said. ``She would tell me, `Don't give up your dreams and optimism.
Go out and get what you want, don't wait for it to come
knocking.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's a sentiment he has passed on to his son Tiziano, 25, named
after the Italian artist Titian, and to his students.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's students, several of whom have been with him since
the early '90s, say they love his low-key but meticulous teaching
method.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes a serious, methodical approach, but he doesn't teach
by humiliation,'' said Diane McManus, an attorney. ``He is very
kind. And he says, `Don't be afraid to paint and take
chances.'''Equally important to many of the students is the
welcoming feeling of the Hernandez home. Both students and
collectors become part of their large, extended family and seem to
enjoy the shared camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   Classes are available year-round, Monday through Wednesday
evenings. During breaks, Josie Hernandez serves coffee and a
dessert on the lace-covered dining table. Students can take a
break, sip a cup of coffee and visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Josie is such a gracious host to us and makes us feel so
welcome,'' said Diana Rodriguez, who works with the Houston Fire
Department. ``It's like getting away to a whole other world.''
</P>
<P>
   The intimate, friendly atmosphere is one that Gary and Josie
Hernandez enjoy, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen the corporate world, and we like this one better,''
said Gary Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   But it took him years to get there. In high school, he was
involved in art classes and encouraged by a teacher to attend
college.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, after graduation, Hernandez married Josie, his
high-school sweetheart, got a job as a graphic artist at a local
sign company and began pulling his way up the corporate ladder.
</P>
<P>
   But he hung on to his dreams and kept drawing, through the
births of two sons, Gary Jr., 27, and Tiziano. When Tiziano was 2
weeks old, the family moved into the house where they still live,
in a blue-collar north Houston neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary has always had a studio, even if it was on the kitchen
table, which it was for years,'' Josie Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   His present studio, in the former attached garage, is a far cry
from the kitchen-table years, though he's still in the middle of
family life. Hernandez constructed a door to connect the living
room/gallery with his immaculate studio, lined with drawings by the
father/son team.
</P>
<P>
   The two have always worked well together, often side by side,
from the time Tiziano was a little boy. The only bone of contention
between them is their different tastes in music. While Dad prefers
the Gypsy Kings and the Buena Vista Social Club, his son is more
into Fugazi and Limp Bizkit.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '70s, Hernandez began taking classes at the Glassell
School of Art, studying with local artists such as Dick Wray. It
was then that he started working in oil and developed his
still-evolving style.
</P>
<P>
   He describes it as classical realism, with an emphasis on color,
figurative work and landscapes _ a style that defies the Hispanic
artist label.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's another myth we are trying to dispel,'' Josie Hernandez
said. ``When people see Gary, they ask him: `Do you do murals?'
Well, not every Hispanic artist does murals.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '80s, Hernandez went on his own as a graphic
artist. But by 1986, he had decided to devote all his energies to
creating art.
</P>
<P>
   It was an exciting and scary decision for Josie and Gary. Their
sons were in Catholic schools and for a while they depended solely
on Josie's salary. His extended family had a hard time grasping the
concept of his working at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started doing art, my family thought I was home
watching TV,'' Gary Hernandez recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Then Josie came down with lupus, and Gary spent more than a year
caring for his ailing wife.
</P>
<P>
   But life gradually improved. Josie got better, though she was
told she needed to live a stress-free life and was put on
disability. That freed her to manage Gary's business affairs, while
he plunged full-force into the art world.
</P>
<P>
   At first he taught art in middle school, but ultimately he
decided to focus on adults, and joined the Art League of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   For a number of years he taught evening classes and became the
group's first Hispanic president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to know the art community because I had been by
myself for so long,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he began showing his watercolors and figurative
pieces to galleries. The reaction was mixed. While gallery owners
liked his figures, they told him that landscapes sold better.
</P>
<P>
   So Hernandez went back to the drawing board and did a series of
paintings of people and Houston skylines.
</P>
<P>
   These proved more popular with galleries, but Hernandez decided
to stay on his own. In 1993, he officially opened both the gallery
and the school.
</P>
<P>
   Josie and Gary say they love the personal touch and getting to
know collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Even more precious to Gary and Josie is the freedom they have.
</P>
<P>
   Josie has moved out of the studio to her business office in the
house, where the walls are lined with paintings on layaway. And
Gary can paint whenever he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work every day, and I have a routine,'' Gary Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I like what I'm doing I will work till 2, get up at 9 and
can't wait to back to it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also given them time to travel. Since 1997, they have
visited Britain, France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, among
other places, seeing museums, tourist spots and artists' homes. The
trips have inspired Hernandez to do a series of travel paintings
and reaffirmed his lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we visited Monet's home in France and Sorolla's in Spain,
I saw that a lot of artists did their business at home,'' Hernandez
said. ``I loved Monet's home _ pink with green shutters. He must
have had Hispanic blood. I came home saying: `I want to live with
color, too.'''Since then he has painted the exterior of his
once-gray home a bright yellow. The living room and dining room
went from gray to peach, and he will next paint his kitchen yellow.
</P>
<P>
   These days Hernandez is working with his students on an exhibit
scheduled Feb. 26. Hernandez's paintings are moved into the studio
and the students' works, including Tiziano's, cover the living room
walls.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, he casually moved from one student to
another, talking about color, shape and form, handing out advice
and tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad offers courses that are so relaxed,'' Tiziano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's happy to help you, and there's nothing you can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Tiziano, a recent graduate of the University of
Houston Downtown, sits in on the classes and draws or helps out.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, he's a talented figurative painter, but he's
also developed his own style _ classical realism with expressionist
figures and an Asian influence picked up during a semester spent in
China.
</P>
<P>
   There's already a third generation in the wings _ Gary Jr.'s
son, Andres, 2, who has his own easel.
</P>
<P>
   Ever changing his style, Gary Hernandez next plans to try his
hand at religious and narrative art. He's proud of his
accomplishments, which include paintings exhibited in New York and
Houston galleries and at the Contemporary Arts Museum. Recently,
one of his watercolors was used on the cover of Tony Diaz's book
``Latino Heretics.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes one day to have a painting in the Museum of Fine Arts
collection. That would make his life come full circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe then I would inspire someone, just like I was
inspired,'' he said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican Sen. John McCain's political idol is
Theodore Roosevelt, a popular military hero whose presidency nearly
a century ago was marked by an irrepressible personality, a strong
sense of leadership and an instinct for bold reform.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   Could McCain be the next TR? We should get so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt, usually ranked at the top of the near-great in our
White House pantheon, is remembered today as much for his colorful
persona as for his practical achievements over two terms, although
he had plenty of them. He is a worthy role model for an ambitious
21st century conservative determined to defy right-wing Republican
orthodoxy and reshape national politics along centrist lines.
</P>
<P>
   McCain likes Roosevelt's reputation for taking on the special
interests, believing in an active government and slugging it out
fearlessly in a fight. McCain jokes that while he admires
Roosevelt's mantra of speaking softly but carrying a big stick,
perhaps he himself has not been speaking as softly as might be
prudent. He does not mention the heft of his own stick, growing
more formidable since his stunning New Hampshire triumph.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in fact, has embarked on a campaign that holds the
promise of building his own TR-like political legend. When
Roosevelt, as vice president, succeeded the assassinated President
William McKinley in 1901, Ohio GOP Sen. Mark Hanna cried, ``Now
that damned cowboy is in the White House.'' The reaction from
powerful Washington GOP insiders to McCain's sudden rise in the
polls reflects similar despair.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, like TR, is simply too independent for their taste. He
knows how to use the ``bully pulpit'' to get out his message, just
as TR did. The pulpit is wherever he happens to be. Roosevelt
talked to reporters while shaving. McCain talks nonstop to them on
a bus.
</P>
<P>
   McCain likes to rattle the established order. But he's not
crazy. He doesn't go so far that the lobbyists he wants to curb
will instead curb him. His campaign needs all the help it can get,
running on pennies compared with the nearly $70 million that Texas
Gov. George W. Bush has amassed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is attacking his rival in South Carolina for that
pragmatism, calling McCain a hypocrite for taking campaign funds
from a system he deplores and says he wants to dismantle.
</P>
<P>
   But in this too, TR provides an example. In his first three
years as president he muted his support for political reforms until
he consolidated his control over the Republican Party and was
assured of the 1904 presidential nomination. He did not
aggressively push economic and social legislation to regulate the
``malefactors of wealth'' until his second term.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt, according to biographer David McCullough, loved
politics and being president. McCullough describes TR as
``picturesque, noisy, colorful in ways that amused and absorbed the
press, worried the elders of his party and delighted the country.''
He was also busy. He built the Panama Canal, filed antitrust suits
against monopolies, won the Nobel Peace Prize for mediating the
Russo-Japanese war, strengthened the Navy and established the
national park system.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt the pulse of the people, TR replied brashly,
``I don't know the way the people DO feel, I only know how they
OUGHT to feel.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain operates as though he has the same self-confidence. He
calls the campaign ``fun.'' Reporters traveling with him contend he
wings it much of the time, so secure in the correctness of his
instincts that he is willing to risk making mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   If he pulls a blooper, as he has several times, he merely says
he changed his mind. Bush backers describe this as flip-flopping,
but it strikes many voters as refreshingly candid. How boring it
would be if presidential candidates were perfect. Not that we've
ever had one.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing is that McCain, like Roosevelt, comes across
as a substantive person with a substantive vision of the country.
He is a transitional figure en route from the shopworn Reagan
supply-side conservatism to a fresh configuration of politics that
is less rigidly ideological.
</P>
<P>
   As one political consultant observed, McCain has become more
than a candidate. He has morphed into a powerful idea.
</P>
<P>
   Bush by contrast clings to a reckless tax cut that nobody except
the rich really wants, right-wing social positions that divide the
Republican Party as well as the country and the notion that a
president's son can pass himself off as an outsider. He is trying
to paint McCain as a closet liberal, a Democrat at heart, a
dishonest Senate lightweight out of his depth. McCain is
``Clintonesque,'' Bush adviser Haley Barbour says.
</P>
<P>
   If supporting a tax increase on tobacco or being sufficiently
sensible to compromise on issues is Clintonesque, McCain is guilty.
He is very conservative, too much so for my taste. But he's a
rational conservative, as Clinton is a reasonable Democrat. There's
nothing wrong with that.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, however, is not Clintonesque in character, thank
goodness. He is the opposite. And in today's prosperous economy,
strength of character is what will count.

in a blue-collar north Houston neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary has always had a studio, even if it was on the kitchen
table, which it was for years,'' Josie Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   His present studio, in the former attached garage, is a far cry
from the kitchen-table years, though he's still in the middle of
family life. Hernandez constructed a door to connect the living
room/gallery with his immaculate studio, lined with drawings by the
father/son team.
</P>
<P>
   The two have always worked well together, often side by side,
from the time Tiziano was a little boy. The only bone of contention
between them is their different tastes in music. While Dad prefers
the Gypsy Kings and the Buena Vista Social Club, his son is more
into Fugazi and Limp Bizkit.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '70s, Hernandez began taking classes at the Glassell
School of Art, studying with local artists such as Dick Wray. It
was then that he started working in oil and developed his
still-evolving style.
</P>
<P>
   He describes it as classical realism, with an emphasis on color,
figurative work and landscapes _ a style that defies the Hispanic
artist label.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's another myth we are trying to dispel,'' Josie Hernandez
said. ``When people see Gary, they ask him: `Do you do murals?'
Well, not every Hispanic artist does murals.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '80s, Hernandez went on his own as a graphic
artist. But by 1986, he had decided to devote all his energies to
creating art.
</P>
<P>
   It was an exciting and scary decision for Josie and Gary. Their
sons were in Catholic schools and for a while they depended solely
on Josie's salary. His extended family had a hard time grasping the
concept of his working at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started doing art, my family thought I was home
watching TV,'' Gary Hernandez recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Then Josie came down with lupus, and Gary spent more than a year
caring for his ailing wife.
</P>
<P>
   But life gradually improved. Josie got better, though she was
told she needed to live a stress-free life and was put on
disability. That freed her to manage Gary's business affairs, while
he plunged full-force into the art world.
</P>
<P>
   At first he taught art in middle school, but ultimately he
decided to focus on adults, and joined the Art League of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   For a number of years he taught evening classes and became the
group's first Hispanic president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to know the art community because I had been by
myself for so long,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he began showing his watercolors and figurative
pieces to galleries. The reaction was mixed. While gallery owners
liked his figures, they told him that landscapes sold better.
</P>
<P>
   So Hernandez went back to the drawing board and did a series of
paintings of people and Houston skylines.
</P>
<P>
   These proved more popular with galleries, but Hernandez decided
to stay on his own. In 1993, he officially opened both the gallery
and the school.
</P>
<P>
   Josie and Gary say they love the personal touch and getting to
know collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Even more precious to Gary and Josie is the freedom they have.
</P>
<P>
   Josie has moved out of the studio to her business office in the
house, where the walls are lined with paintings on layaway. And
Gary can paint whenever he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work every day, and I have a routine,'' Gary Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I like what I'm doing I will work till 2, get up at 9 and
can't wait to back to it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also given them time to travel. Since 1997, they have
visited Britain, France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, among
other places, seeing museums, tourist spots and artists' homes. The
trips have inspired Hernandez to do a series of travel paintings
and reaffirmed his lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we visited Monet's home in France and Sorolla's in Spain,
I saw that a lot of artists did their business at home,'' Hernandez
said. ``I loved Monet's home _ pink with green shutters. He must
have had Hispanic blood. I came home saying: `I want to live with
color, too.'''Since then he has painted the exterior of his
once-gray home a bright yellow. The living room and dining room
went from gray to peach, and he will next paint his kitchen yellow.
</P>
<P>
   These days Hernandez is working with his students on an exhibit
scheduled Feb. 26. Hernandez's paintings are moved into the studio
and the students' works, including Tiziano's, cover the living room
walls.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, he casually moved from one student to
another, talking about color, shape and form, handing out advice
and tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad offers courses that are so relaxed,'' Tiziano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's happy to help you, and there's nothing you can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Tiziano, a recent graduate of the University of
Houston Downtown, sits in on the classes and draws or helps out.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, he's a talented figurative painter, but he's
also developed his own style _ classical realism with expressionist
figures and an Asian influence picked up during a semester spent in
China.
</P>
<P>
   There's already a third generation in the wings _ Gary Jr.'s
son, Andres, 2, who has his own easel.
</P>
<P>
   Ever changing his style, Gary Hernandez next plans to try his
hand at religious and narrative art. He's proud of his
accomplishments, which include paintings exhibited in New York and
Houston galleries and at the Contemporary Arts Museum. Recently,
one of his watercolors was used on the cover of Tony Diaz's book
``Latino Heretics.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes one day to have a painting in the Museum of Fine Arts
collection. That would make his life come full circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe then I would inspire someone, just like I was
inspired,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ I am plastered against the side of a large rock, 15
feet above a patch of trampled dirt in Central Park. My fingers are
wedged inside a fissure. My left toe is balanced on a protrusion
about the size of a golf ball and my right toe is balanced on . . .
I don't know what it's balanced on.
</P>
<P>
   Below me my friend, Ivan Greene, the director of climbing at
Chelsea Piers, shouts encouragement. ``Smear your right foot onto
the rock,'' he says helpfully, ``Twist your left hip in, stand up,
and grab that giant knob just above you.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm trying to ``boulder,'' a form of rock climbing that involves
more lateral than vertical movement. Unlike sports climbing, the
type of climbing in which you scale a wall, bouldering involves no
ropes, harnesses or carabiners (hooks that connect climber to
rope). All you need is a pair of climbing shoes with sticky rubber
soles, a bag of chalk to powder your hands for a better grip and a
willingness to fall.
</P>
<P>
   As Ivan explains, there's really nothing to fear. ``You're only
falling from a twist-your-ankle height, not a fall-to-your-death or
even a break-your-leg height,'' he assures me.
</P>
<P>
   The object of bouldering is to ``solve a problem.'' That is,
find a way to get from Point A on the rock to Point B. You do this
by contorting your body into heretofore unimaginable positions and
by perching atop seemingly unperchable chips and minute clusters of
rock crystal.
</P>
<P>
   It requires creative and inconceivable body contortions and, of
course, the smoother the rock, the harder the problem. The
difficulty of a route also depends on the position you start from.
A sitting start is the most difficult because it requires a great
deal of arm strength, balance and skill to pull yourself up and
along. A start that requires jumping up into the first move is a
little easier provided you're connecting with a decent grip and
secure footing. Standing is the easiest and most pleasant way to
begin.
</P>
<P>
   The problem I'm on has a standing start. It is a beginner's
route etched into ``Rat Rock,'' a grouping of boulders near the
southwest corner of the park. Stephen Harris, an instructor at
Chelsea Piers, describes it as a straightforward traverse across a
short expanse of friendly rock.
</P>
<P>
   When I'm on the ground, I believe him. I watch a few experienced
boulderers glide across it like spiders. But when I'm up on the
rock, everything seems to flatten out. One hand space that, from
below, looked big enough to hide a nest of squirrels, requires
holding on with just my fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan instructs me to ``smear'' my feet; he wants me to press the
rubber edges and soles of my shoes as hard as I can into the rock.
This, in theory, would help my feet better stick to the surface of
the stone.
</P>
<P>
   I'm on this problem for about 30 minutes. I make progress but
the spoiler is a move that requires squatting low and stretching my
right leg out until the tip of my toe settles on a group of
molecules that Ivan swears are big enough for me to balance on. I'm
ejected and fall at this point in the problem over and over again.
Stephen, my spotter, is always there to catch me.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, playing on the neighborhood jungle gym was my favorite
pastime. Bouldering is like a grown up version of the jungle gym.
It combines all the fun of using your body to solve a puzzle with
the grown up benefits of building stamina, strength, balance and
coordination. All this and not a treadmill or a weight machine in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   I also like that boulderers call each other ``dude'' _ even the
women _ and that they wear baggy pants with drawstrings and rip
cords sprouting from the pockets and waistbands. After a 10-minute
burst of intense activity, they relax. It's a refreshing change
from the spandex and headphone culture of the gym I've exercised in
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Since my Rat Rock session, I've been sharpening my skills at
Chelsea Piers, a large sports and recreation center on West Side
Highway at 23rd Street. The Piers has a decent artificial
bouldering wall made of a hard gray plastic material fashioned to
simulate stone; it's dotted with colored holds that define the
various routes and problems.
</P>
<P>
   With about three months of bouldering under my belt, I'm seeing
definite changes in my body: My shoulders and arms are slightly
bigger and more defined. My back is broader; some of my blouses are
a bit tight. My legs are stronger and more flexible. I was feeling
pretty good about myself until the other day when my husband looked
at my calloused palms and ragged cuticles and told me that I now
have ``man hands.''

AT YELLOWSTONE, AN ECOSYSTEM TEETERING ON A NUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont., Wyo., Idaho, Kansas)  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By JIM ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG SKY, Mont. _ At the very top of a rocky, wind-whipped ridge
above this sprawling ski resort west of Yellowstone National Park
stands a towering grove of ancient whitebark pine trees. They are
one of the few living things that thrive in the harshness at such
altitudes, and they produce a large nut that is rich in fat and
critical to wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   There is mounting concern among biologists and other
researchers, however, that global climate change may be creating
conditions in and around the park that are inhospitable for the
tree. If climate warming is the real, long-term phenomenon that
many experts think it is, scientists believe it could set off a
series of changes that could kill 90 percent or more of the
whitebark pine trees and possibly compromise the future of the
threatened grizzly bear.
</P>
<P>
   The whitebark pine produces cones with pea-size nuts that bears
eat in the fall. ``Of all the vegetable foods in the ecosystem,
whitebark pine is probably the most important,'' said Chuck
Schwartz, leader of Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team, a federal
agency responsible for protection of the bear. ``They are critical
to the fall fattening process to get the bears through the
winter.''
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of the tree illustrate the breadth and
complexity of the problems a warming climate could create for
natural systems. And it underscores the challenges faced by
scientists and parks officials as they try to preserve intricate
ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   The whitebark pine thrives at the top of the Yellowstone
ecosystem, the last tree before the timberline on most of the
mountain ranges in and around the park, in stands of a few acres to
thousands of acres. The cones blossom in the trees' upper reaches
and are fed on by many birds, including Clark's nutcracker, which
take the nuts and each year stash tens of thousands of them in
crevices in the craggy rocks or in the soil less than an inch deep.
Red squirrels, meanwhile, bury nut-laden cones in the duff on the
forest floor, heaps called middens, which concentrate the nuts in
piles large enough to be nutritional for grizzly bears.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of fall, when the bears are voraciously feeding
to build up a store of fat for winter, they travel to the high
country to dig up the squirrel caches. Some experts believe the
nuts are the source of as much as 40 percent of a bear's layer of
winter fat, and research shows they are important for fertility.
</P>
<P>
   Humans have become an integral part of this ecological
relationship between bear and tree. When the nut crop is poor, the
bears search out alternative sources to tide them through the
winter's sleep. Instead of climbing into the high country, they
often head into low-lying areas inhabited by humans, where they
find dog food, beehives full of honey, garbage _ and trouble.
</P>
<P>
   There is a direct correlation between poor nut production and
grizzly bear mortality, experts say. More bears die from ``human
induced'' causes _ for example, being shot _ when there are not
enough nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pine nuts are more than a food,'' said Louisa Wilcox, project
coordinator for the Sierra Club Grizzly Bear Ecosystem Project in
Bozeman, Mont. ``They are a shield for bears against human-caused
mortalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Because nutrition affects reproduction rates, a drop in nut
production can also affect birthrates, lowering the number of new
cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The exact number of bears in Yellowstone is not known, but is
estimated at 200 to 400. So a modest increase in deaths could have
serious effects.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the global warming factor and a disease that affects
whitebark pines called European blister rust. The rust, a fungus
brought over from Europe, was discovered in North America in 1906.
Windborne spores spread through the miles of whitebark pine
forests, through Idaho and into Glacier National Park in
northwestern Montana, where the disease has killed 43 percent of
the whitebark pines, and will probably kill 90 percent of those
remaining. Fortunately for the grizzlies in Glacier, there are
other fall food sources, mainly huckleberries and thimbleberries.
Berries are rare in Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   Blister rust, first noted in the park in 1948, is now present
throughout Yellowstone. Until very recently, the disease was
present at low levels and did not kill trees. The spread of rust is
dependent on moisture. Fogbanks must envelop the trees for 48 hours
for the rust to spread.
</P>
<P>
   Those conditions are common west of the Continental Divide,
where warm, moist air flows inland from the Pacific Ocean. But
those conditions stop as they bump into the wall of the northern
Rockies. The east side of the divide, the Yellowstone side, is
cooler and much drier.
</P>
<P>
   As the earth's temperature rises, the atmosphere can hold more
moisture and becomes wetter as more water evaporates from the
surface. Some scientists say that in general this is happening now,
and research is under way in the park to determine whether it is
happening there.
</P>
<P>
   While that research is not conclusive, blister rust has been
spreading in the southern part of the region in the past few years.
``We've seen increasing heavy infections over the last five
years,'' said Roy Bergstrom, a forester on the Shoshone National
Forest in Wyoming. ``Maybe we have two to three decades before it
really spreads.''
</P>
<P>
   The orange fungus, which girdles the tree and kills branches,
could virtually wipe out the nut crop. Just one in 10,000 trees are
resistant. Because the whitebark pine is not commercially valuable,
the U.S. Forest Service is not spending money for research or
solutions to the rust problem. But some researchers are discussing
a number of possible strategies, all admittedly long shots.
</P>
<P>
   One choice is to do nothing. That is the present strategy of the
National Park Service, which has a natural regulation philosophy
that allows nature to take its course.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the disease spreads over hundreds of years, the tree will
adapt,'' says John Varley, chief scientist for the park. But if the
disease explodes in the next few years ``and it looks like 90
percent of the trees are going to die, it's conceivable we'll dial
up the Forest Service and ask them for disease-resistant trees and
plant them,'' he said. ``The trees are simply too important to this
ecosystem.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing is done and the trees die quickly, it could take 500
to 700 years for the groves to regenerate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is talk of ``genetic bottlenecking'' _ waiting for the
disease to run its course through some stands of whitebark pine in
the southern part of the ecosystem, and then taking pollen from
those that survive and using it to pollinate unaffected trees in
other places. Some scientists are talking about taking pollen from
resistant trees in Glacier or Idaho and doing the same thing.
Another possibility, Bergstrom said, is to burn away areas around
groves where trees have survived to create conditions favored by
Clark's nutcracker for stashing nuts, a kind of natural replanting.
</P>
<P>
   Officials agree they cannot simply let the tree die out and
plant the seeds of the survivors. ``If we wait till they're all
gone, it could take a long time to replace them,'' said Ward
McCaughey, a research forester with the Forest Service in Bozeman.
``It takes 30 years for a tree to produce a cone, and 50 to 80
years to produce a usable crop of nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Should even worst-case situations occur, biologists expect the
bear to survive. ``The bears would not curl up and die,'' Schwartz
said. ``They would find alternative food sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are not as sure. ``If it was just the nuts, they might be
OK,'' Wilcox said. ``But it's not. When you tie in the loss of
habitat from subdivisions, possible oil and gas leasing and other
things, then the long-term survival of the bear is far less
certain.''
</P>
<P>
   As scientists learn more about the complex ecology of species in
and beyond Yellowstone, they learn how much of the equation is well
beyond the control of the managers. For example, another important
grizzly bear food source is the army cutworm moth. The nondescript,
slate-gray moths flock in large numbers to the meadows above the
timberline in the park, where they feed on the nectar of alpine
flowers. They are another critical source of fat for perhaps as
many as a third of the park's grizzly bears, which overturn rocks
to lick up the insects, as many as 40,000 per bear in a single day.
It is possible that the moths could take up some of the slack
caused by a loss of pine nuts.
</P>
<P>
   In their larval stage, however, the cutworms live in wheat
fields on the plains of Montana and perhaps as far afield as
Kansas, where farmers consider them a pernicious pest. It is a
paradox not lost on Schwartz. ``We're monitoring the number of moth
sites and working diligently to understand this critical food
source,'' he said. ``And people are working just as diligently to
eliminate it as a pest.''
</P>
<P>
   A genetically modified seed that created a strain of wheat
resistant to cutworm moths, he said, could do as much damage or
more to the long-term viability of the grizzly as European blister
rust. ``It makes it clear how the bears are tied to everything,''
Wilcox said. ``The ecosystem really has no boundaries.''

Bishop Spong will not go quietly into retirement

<P>
   Bishop John Shelby Spong, a gadfly liberal churchman from
Newark, N.J., officially retired as an active bishop last week,
much to the delight of many who see his theology as heretical.
</P>
<P>
   But the 68-year-old Spong, known as Jack by his supporters and
detractors, isn't going away. He will likely remain the nation's
most controversial Episcopalian.
</P>
<P>
   During his 23 years as a bishop, Spong has forcefully spoken out
for the right of homosexuals to be ordained. He has written
shocking books, such as ``Why Christianity Must Change or Die,''
which calls for revamping most of the doctrines of his own church.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke with him last week by phone just as he and his wife,
Chris, had moved into an apartment at Harvard University, where
Spong will lecture for the next several months. Spong will be
delivering the William Belden Noble Lectures, which will become the
basis of a new book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll also be teaching a course to young clergy on how to
preach,'' he said. ``We get about 2,000 seconds of people's time
for every sermon, more time than most people get to voice their
views. We need to make the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Spong certainly makes the most of his time.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his Harvard lectures, he will be in Texas next
week to speak in Dallas, Houston, Austin and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   He will discuss ``Overcoming the Barriers of Prejudice'' at 6
p.m. Feb. 12 at the Cathedral of Hope in Dallas, the nation's
largest predominantly gay congregation. He will also sign copies of
his new autobiography, ``Here I Stand: My Struggle for a
Christianity of Integrity, Love &AMP; Equality'' (Harper San Francisco,
$25).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel very retired, yet,'' Spong said.
</P>
<P>
   Spong's 464-page autobiography traces his evolution from a young
man growing up in the conservative South to his championship of
liberal causes.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Charlotte, N.C., and as a youth delivered
newspapers to Billy Graham's family, who lived about a mile away
from the Spongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also lived in Lynchburg, Va., in the same town with Jerry
Falwell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised a biblical fundamentalist,'' he said. ``I would
have gone over well in East Texas during my early years. But I've
come a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Spong reveals that he had trouble dressing like a bishop at
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``For five years, I could not bring myself to wear the purple
shirt of the bishop's office,'' he writes. ``It reminded me of
someone trying to be Robin Redbreast.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after becoming a bishop in 1976, Spong began advocating
the right of gays and lesbians to be ordained. He believes that
eventually everyone will agree that gays should not be banned from
the priesthood because of their sexual orientation because of
growing evidence that people do not choose their sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't choose to be a heterosexual,'' he said in the
interview. ``I just woke up when I was about 12 years old and
thought that girls were OK.''
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, he credits retired Fort Worth Episcopal
Bishop Clarence Pope, one of Spong's strongest critics, with
helping to create the international headlines surrounding Spong's
ordination of a noncelibate man.
</P>
<P>
   Pope was one of the first to issue a statement denouncing
Spong's action. His statements were reported locally and worldwide.
Spong then responded to Pope's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had known Clarence for more than 20 years. ... I genuinely
liked him,'' Spong writes. ``I had no intention, however, of
stopping this ordination to keep Clarence happy. What Clarence had
done ... was to turn the ordination into a media event. Our diocese
had hoped to avoid making this a spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the few formal denunciations, Pope and others led a
successful move in the House of Bishops to dissociate the group
from Spong's ordination of the openly gay man.
</P>
<P>
   Spong has antagonized traditional Christian thinkers at every
turn. In one of his books, ``Rescuing the Bible From
Fundamentalism,'' he speculated that the Apostle Paul might have
been gay. He suggested that Jesus might have been married to Mary
Magdalene.
</P>
<P>
   He has been called the Antichrist and the devil incarnate. But
he also has quite a following among those who are searching for a
more meaningful faith.
</P>
<P>
   Spong will be a bishop for life, and he has the right to vote
and discuss issues at this year's Episcopal General Convention. But
he has vowed not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised, though, if Spong makes waves again. He has a
lifelong habit of shooting from the hip when it comes to discussing
volatile theological, moral and ethical issues. And it is a habit
not easily broken.

CENSUS REVISIONS BRING BOTH COMFORT, CONCERNS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Fla.) 
 
By KIM COBB 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Ryan Graham testified before Congress at age 12, a
committee member belittled him for declaring himself multiracial
instead of black.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have tried to pigeonhole me all of my life,'' Ryan
says, recalling the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, the teen and his family are celebrating a
personal victory: the 2000 Census expected on their Tallahassee,
Fla., doorstep next month will for the first time allow people to
identify themselves as a combination of races.
</P>
<P>
   The old method instructed those surveyed to choose one from a
handful of racial categories. Now, Americans can check off as many
boxes as they like _ providing the Census Bureau with data on 63
different possible racial combinations, plus a separate category
for Hispanic origin.
</P>
<P>
   The racial revisions to the census forms reflect the political
climate and, in part, the changing demographics of the United
States. The answers will reveal much about how Americans define
themselves, but raise other questions about the enforcement of
civil rights protections drawn for people who fit more narrow
racial definitions.
</P>
<P>
   The questions are serious enough that some black advocacy groups
are offering their constituencies subtle encouragement toward
identifying themselves as black, rather than multiracial, to avoid
diluting their political base.
</P>
<P>
   Some question whether the change in the racial options will add
to the confusion and reluctance people already associate with the
census, further dropping participation in this national head count.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; `` &LR; We just don't know,'' admits Census Bureau race and
statistics chief Claudette Bennett. ``We explored those
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is expected to lose its white majority
sometime around 2050. For states with large immigrant populations
such as Texas and California, the change will come sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Census data show that the number of children born to parents of
different races grew from less than one-half million in 1970 to
about 2 million in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But even those who lobbied for the right to identify with more
than one race are concerned about how government agencies will
tally these new combinations _ decisions that could affect
everything from the mapping of congressional boundaries drawn to
protect minority voting strength, to monitoring protections
guaranteed under civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of groups such as the National Urban League and the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People express
fear that people deserving the legal protections due black
Americans will be missed if counted as multiethnic rather than
black. And there's money at stake _ an estimated $182 billion will
be distributed annually based on formulas using Census 2000 data.
</P>
<P>
   Every U.S. Census has measured race, with each count reflecting
the laws, politics and immigration policy in place at the time. The
first census in 1790 reflected the nation's acceptance of slavery _
dividing people into Free White Males over 16, Free White Males
Under 16, Free White Females and Other Free Persons and Slaves.
</P>
<P>
   After slavery was abolished, race was still used by the
government to the detriment of ethnic and racial groups, says
Carnegie-Mellon University statistics professor Stephen E.
Fienberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, something surprising happened,'' said Fienberg. ``With
the Civil Rights Act, and the civil rights movement of the '60s,
suddenly there was a need to measure race in order to implement
government policy in support of minority groups, instead of to
control them.''
</P>
<P>
   The racial and ethnic categories appearing on the census forms
are determined by the Office of Management and Budget, which sets a
single standard for all federal statistics and administrative
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   This year's census offers slight variation in the racial
categories that were available in the last census: white, black,
American Indian and Alaska native, Asian, native Hawaiian and
Pacific Islander and ``some other race.'' But those surveyed in
2000 can check off as many race boxes as they like, and Hispanic
origin is a separate ethnic category.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a person could mark boxes declaring himself Asian,
black and white. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Every decade there is a big push by different groups to get
added to the list because there's a perception that if you're on
the list, you're a minority group, and you might get money that's
allocated and political power,'' Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That process itself is, if not contentious, at least very
elaborate,'' Fienberg said. ``Every decade there's lots of public
hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ryan Graham, the road to those public hearings started with
his mother's unsettling experience with the Census Bureau a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I received my 1990 census form and I discovered no categories
for my children,'' Susan Graham recalled. ``I'm white, my husband
is black. My children are, at least, biracial.''
</P>
<P>
   She picked up the phone, called the Census Bureau, and asked
what box she was supposed to check for her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children take the race of the mother,'' the clerk
responded, after checking with his supervisor. Why, Graham asked?
</P>
<P>
   ``In cases like this, we almost always know who the mother is
and we don't always know who the father is,'' the clerk responded,
dropping his voice nearly to a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have since apologized for that, but it took nearly four
years,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, when Graham was registering her son, Ryan, for
kindergarten, she was told it wasn't necessary to check the race
box on the registration forms, but later found that Ryan's teacher
was told to pick a category for him. She chose based on Ryan's
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the same child was white to the census, black at school,
and multiracial at home,'' Graham said. Choosing a racial category
labeled ``other'' was no solution, she said. It made Ryan feel like
a ``space alien.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming she couldn't be the only person struggling with this
problem, she founded an organization called ``Project Race'' to
lobby for multiracial classifications at all levels of government.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she and Ryan would testify before congressional
subcommittees considering the change in federal race categories.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing people to identify themselves as a combination of races
no longer offers a clear, statistical divide between black and
white, and it makes some civil rights groups nervous about
enforcing anti-discrimination law. Further complicating matters,
the Census Bureau has not finalized how those numbers will be
tabulated for redistricting purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, the Census Bureau's race and statistics chief, says
that, at a minimum, the bureau will present the six single racial
tabulation categories and a separate category called ``two or more
races.'' This would provide a baseline of information similar to
that collected in 1990, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data is used in a voting rights perspective to see if
people who had their voting rights denied were still having their
voting rights denied and to see if people were still facing
employment discrimination,'' said William Spriggs, Urban League
Research and Policy Director.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not used in some biological sense, and it's not used in
some sort of touchy-feely sense of who are your parents, and who do
you want to recognize,'' Spriggs said. ``It's related to the
persistence of gaps born of legal segregation.''
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP is not opposed to allowing people to identify
themselves as more than one race, but fears that blacks will be
undercounted as a result. ``We're convinced a tabulation method has
to occur that's sensitive to our history and the support of civil
rights laws,'' said Hilary Shelton, director of the Washington
bureau of the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about how the Census Bureau identified my
children in 1990 (it was) white,'' Graham said. The black community
lost numbers by that arbitrary determination, she said.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, as many as 10 percent of Americans who would
have identified themselves as black in the last census will,
instead, identify themselves as members of several races. Melanie
Campbell, executive director of the National Coalition on Black
Voter Participation, said it's important for her organization
to &UR;  &LR; inform people about the potential consequences of that choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because people don't know this has anything to do with
redistricting or their potential for having a stronger voice for
electing candidates of choice, people need to be educated,''
Campbell said. ``With my conversations around the country, after
educating them, they'd rather check one box and not complicate the
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic origin is the only ethnic category specifically spelled
out in the census, which means tabulating their numbers will be a
straightforward head count. Officials for such groups as the
Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund are most
concerned that the census forms get to and are filled out in their
hardest-to-reach communities, such as migrant workers, immigrants
wary of the government and people living in nonstandard housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest hurdle is getting people to participate in the
census,'' said MALDEF census director Margaret Leal-Sotelo.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics will soon pass blacks as the largest minority group in
the United States, raising questions about the future of political
alliances between the two _ particularly in the face of the groups'
different measurements by the census.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coalitions that we currently have, especially at the
national level, are sustained because we still perceive
discrimination against our various groups,'' said the Urban
League's Spriggs. ``So they're not based on a box we check _
they're founded on a reality of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be local areas, and Houston may be one, where there
are sufficient numbers of Hispanics, that a coalition between
blacks and Hispanics doesn't hold any longer,'' Spriggs said.
``Maybe Hispanics will feel they can have political power without a
coalition. But that, again, won't happen because of a box they
check.''
</P>
<P>
   Numbers, alone, will not change the balance of power, said Luis
Plascencia, associate director of the Texas office of the Thomas
Rivera Policy Institute. ``Simply being a majority doesn't get you
anything _ it's when you mobilize that you can translate it to
something.''

 &HT;    AFTER STRIKE, MEXICO STILL DEALING WITH HUNDREDS OF DETAINED
YOUTHS AND FEAR THE GOVERNMENT WILL END FREE COLLEGE EDUCATION
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ With nearly 1,000 jailed students and university
employees facing charges of theft, vandalism and even terrorism,
the bitter conflict over a strike at one of the world's biggest
public universities isn't over yet.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of federal police here arrested 745 of the activists
Sunday when they staged a bloodless raid to take back Mexico's
National Autonomous University from striking students who had
occupied it for nearly 10 months to protest an attempt to
dramatically hike tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have no idea when the university will re-open for
classes, although some reports have quoted unnamed sources guessing
that it could be at least two weeks to a month before police
guarding the campus leave the institution.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of those arrested _ including at least 83 minors under
thew age of 18 _ remains unclear. A Reforma newspaper poll
published Monday showed that 61 percent of Mexico City residents
approved of the police action, compared to 29 percent who disagreed
with it. But Mexican Attorney General Jorge Madrazo is now under
pressure to release many of the students his office arrested and
reduce charges of terrorism and other serious crimes that carry
maximum prison sentences of 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first urgent step should be freeing the students as
quickly as possible, as well as reducing charges that I consider
excessive, like the accusation of terrorism,'' said Rene Drucker,
the chief of the Physiology Department at the university, known
here as the UNAM. Drucker was a member of a faculty team that tried
to negotiate an end to the strike that began last April.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon de la Fuente, Mexico's former health minister who took
over as UNAM rector in the middle of the strike, has also called
for all students who did not commit crimes to be given
``unconditional freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   When police raided the campus on Sunday, they were dispatched in
part to follow up on arrest warrants issued last week for 430
students wanted on a variety of charges, including terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Another 247 were also in custody in connection with a street
fight that erupted outside a university-run high school last week
after anti-strike employees attempted to break into the
student-occupied school.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the UNAM struck after administrators proposed the
first fee increase in decades at the institution which, at only
about 20 cents a semester, offers essentially free tuition. Because
more than half of all Mexicans live in poverty, the proposal to
suddenly charge $140 a year in tuition took the country by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The UNAM, where more than 270,000 students normally are
enrolled, is considered one of the only institutions in Mexico
where low-income youths have a chance at breaking through class
barriers and obtaining a higher education.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of high tuition quickly became politically
explosive. The striking students charged the government with trying
to ``privatize'' the university in its rush to push Mexico into a
more free-market economic system.
</P>
<P>
   A few months into the strike, the previous rector announced the
tuition hike would only be voluntary. But some of the students,
known here as ``ultras,'' dug in, demanding other reforms to open
access to the university and guarantees that similar fee increases
would never again be proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The students' support dwindled as their cause became murkier.
But many that did not support the strike share the students' basic
fears. Mexicans witnessed a disastrous privatization of the
country's banks in the early 90s, which is now requiring a massive
taxpayer bailout because of fraud and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   That experience has bred a current of suspicion that the
government is willing to risk cutting off higher education to many
Mexicans in its quest to reduce government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the tuition proposal believe Mexico and other Latin
American countries are bowing to pressure from the International
Monetary Fund and other international lending agencies to scrap
education subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Even Reforma newspaper, which has run editorials calling for the
strike to end, ran a cartoon Monday that plays on this fear.
</P>
<P>
   A Mexican ``image and management advisor'' boasts on the
telephone to someone that ``the dislodging (of the students) was
done in such an impeccable way that advisors at the International
Monetary Fund are suggesting that we export our know-how to Third
World governments.''

 &HT;    Peanuts appreciation: Being Charlie Brown
 &HT;    (With PEANUTS-TIMELINE. Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 13.)
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's enough to make you lie on a doghouse roof and moan, ``Why?
... Why?'' It's enough to make you sit on a curb and say, ``Rats!''
It's enough to make you stand all day on a pitcher's mound in the
rain after everyone has gone home.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make you run for therapy, but you can't _ the
crabby girl psychiatrist is ``Out,'' and never coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts'' is ambling off into the sunset; new strips end
today. Charles M. Schulz, 77 and undergoing treatment for colon
cancer, is retiring, and no amount of warm-puppy hugs or
security-blanket nuzzles will fill this cosmic void.
</P>
<P>
   For a half-century that feels about, oh, six weeks (50 years fly
when you're having fun!), ``Peanuts'' has been a boon to the
nation's mental health, providing not only laughter but also a kind
of four-panel analyst's couch. For the price of a newspaper we
could watch someone else (usually Charlie Brown) endure rejection,
mockery, bewilderment and existential angst, sometimes venting it
with an ``AUGHHHHHHH!'' but more often with a gentle ``Sigh.''
</P>
<P>
   What other comic strip would have the vision, the simplicity,
the sheer chutzpah to use ``Sigh'' as a punchline _ in the '50s,
yet? At a time when other strips used slapstick sight gags and
heroes with strong jaws and thick blue-black hair, Charlie Brown
was way ahead of his time. With no jaw at all, and little hair, he
was a postmodern abstraction of Everyboy. He was as alienated as a
James Dean character but without a speck of the charisma. He was
radically blah. He was so unassertive and round of skull that his
friends once used the back of his head to draw a map of the world.
He was the chalkboard upon which we projected our disappointments
and our fat-chance! dreams of being a baseball hero or being adored
by the little red-haired girl.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this pieface martyr had to find strength within himself, for
when he sought help with ``psychiatrist'' Lucy, she said, ``Get
over it. Five cents, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz was angry when one commentator called Charlie Brown a
loser, because, he said, ``How can you say that when he never stops
trying?''
</P>
<P>
   Snoopy as swami
</P>
<P>
   It was just as therapeutic to see Snoopy breeze through life. He
was ying to Charlie Brown's yang, as liberated from cares as his
owner was lumbered by them. Snoopy didn't sit around moaning about
fantasies _ he lived them, as hipster, novelist, Legionnaire,
surfer, golfer, vulture, World War I Flying Ace. Talk about
evolution: an ordinary beagle during the 1950s, Snoopy in 1960
stood upright and became a biped. He stopped sleeping indoors and
instead, like a swami on his bed of nails, took to balancing
trancelike on the peak of the doghouse roof. So free was Snoopy
that, when the spirit of the Flying Ace was in him, his doghouse
lifted off the ground and streaked over the skies of ``Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty mind-bending stuff for a sweet little family comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   Like St. Francis of Assisi, Snoopy was joyful enough to talk to
the birds. One of them _ that bohemian-looking, fluffy-top
Woodstock _ told Snoopy that his philosophy was ``Small is
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ``Peanuts'' was square _ proudly square _ but in its own,
slightly offbeat, Zen-like way.
</P>
<P>
   Look at any other strip running when ``Peanuts'' started in
1950, and it looks like a dinosaur, frozen in time. Cartoonist Al
Capp took pot shots at ``Peanuts'' for its neuroses in his ``Lil'
Abner'' strip, but Schulz _ as ``Abner'' fades in collective
consciousness _ has the last laugh. ``Peanuts,'' with its spare,
shapely design, still fits on a Third Millennium funnies page,
displaying the classic, timeless line of a Coke bottle or a 1965
Mustang. In the words of Patrick McDonnell, Schulz's friend and
fellow cartoonist (``Mutts''), `` `Peanuts' is so well drawn that
you always know what those kids are thinking behind those little
ink-dot eyes. `Peanuts' was always on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Little Orphan Annie had zeroes for eyes, Lucy had
worry lines around hers. There was something almost Samuel
Beckett-ish in the absurdist mini-plays involving Spike, Snoopy's
lonely brother in the desert; the Great Pumpkin, like Godot, never
comes. The ``Peanuts'' kids may live in a generic, All-American
suburb, like Dennis the Menace, but its undercurrents of
philosophical questioning and atomic-age anxiety came straight from
the Left Bank.
</P>
<P>
   A force for education
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts'' had no adults and didn't need them because the kids'
speech was so grown-up. Schulz made literacy cool and so was a
force for education. The Minnesota native's drawings were so
charming that he made kids want to read better, to understand the
jokes about Tolstoy and the Book of Job and ``Citizen Kane.''
(Remember how Lucy spoiled the movie for Linus, telling him,
``Rosebud's the sled'' and causing him to scream ``AUGHHHHHHHH!''
in anguish?)
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jones of Sylvania, Ala., wrote in an e-mail to The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, ``Charlie Brown, when I was a little boy, you
alone drew me into the world of books. Thanks for helping raise us
all.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the adult in the kid that made ``Peanuts'' a
lifelong habit for many of us, it was the kid that never left the
adult. Schulz embraced his inner child long before it became a buzz
phrase. There is a lot of Charlie Brown in Charlie Schulz _
beginning with the fact that they both had salt-of-the-earth,
barber dads. Journal-Constitution columnist Rheta Grimsley Johnson
wrote in her 1989 biography, ``Good Grief : The Story of Charles M.
Schulz,'' that the cartoonist's loneliness dates back to his
mother's untimely death _ a ``grief that he kept fingering like a
rosary.''
</P>
<P>
   In Schulz's life there really was a crabby little girl _ his
first daughter, Meredith, the model for Lucy, and it was she who
banged on the toy piano that turned up under Schroeder's precocious
hands. There really was a weird year of Schulz's boyhood in
Needles, Calif., the same barren setting for Spike and the talking
cacti. There really was a little red-haired girl (now a
white-haired Minnesota housewife) who broke Schulz's heart and got
engaged to another guy just when 20-year-old Sparky was about to
pop the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sparky feels those defeats as if they happened yesterday,''
Johnson said recently, ``examines them as if they were day-old
wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   There were fewer surprises, no major new characters, as the
strip headed into its final 25 years; younger generations seem not
to have embraced it like us baby boomers. Yet the wit never lost
its edge. Johnson declares: ``The strip never grew stale or fell
out of style because it was never `stylish' to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   Many faces of the dreamer
</P>
<P>
   There's a theory that in dreams, all characters are aspects of
the dreamer. Schulz has confessed how each ``Peanuts'' character is
a thread of himself _ including Lucy, when he's in one of his
bitter moods. Perhaps that's where the strip gets its dreamlike
quality, the sense that we're seeing the many layers of one lively
psyche being revealed, within an ironically ordinary, ``normal''
suburban setting.
</P>
<P>
   One senses, too, special closeness between Linus and his
creator. Perhaps it's because of the lovable absurdity of a
pint-sized scholar who can quote Scripture (Schulz was a devout
member of the Church of God as a young man) yet drags a ratty
blanket around all day. Hence the term security blanket, invented
by Schulz. The cartoonist knows well that under our grown-up
costumes, no matter how big our job titles or mutual funds may be,
there will always beat the heart of a needy tyke.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz writes in ``Peanuts: A Golden Celebration'' that in first
grade, everyone was assigned to make a valentine for another
student; not wanting to hurt anybody's feelings, he made one for
everyone. Then he got so self-conscious about stuffing them all
into a box in front of the class that he failed to deliver any.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider the strip in which Charlie Brown tries to steal
home and slides! ... but comes to rest in a cloud of dust only
halfway down the base line, blowing the game. Night falls. We see
Charlie Brown, still lying on his back, crying, ``Why? ... Why?''
</P>
<P>
   Linus is sent out in his pajamas to ask him to lower his voice
so everyone can sleep. The last panel is Charlie Brown saying in a
tiny voice, ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   Below the black comedy of that scene, there is unspoken
tenderness, a sense that, although no one ever bothered to tell him
directly, Charlie Brown had a secure place in his world. He was
loved.
</P>
<P>
   And so were the ``Peanuts'' readers. It seems that Charlie
Schulz _ in his shy, Charlie Brownish way _ delivered those
valentines after all. Every day, for 50 years.
</P>

   BUDGET-CLINTON (Washington) _ President Clinton sent Congress a
budget proposal Monday built on the idea that the burgeoning budget
surplus will allow the nation to have it all, from increased
spending on government programs to tax cuts and big reductions in
the national debt. The president's budget, his eighth and last,
calls for additional spending across the range of issues that have
long been central to his agenda, including health care, education
and the environment. By Richard W. Stevenson.

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Jerusalem) _ The Palestinian Authority on Monday
froze peace talks with the Israelis and then released from prison a
charismatic Islamic fundamentalist leader who is a withering
opponent of the peace effort. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-RANGEL (Washington) _ There's a jingle to Rep. Charles
Rangel's step now, a little like the ka-ching of a cash register
swallowing up dollar bills. ``They throw it at me,'' Rangel said,
only half-kidding, about the money he's collecting to win back
control of the House for the Democrats. The Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, which is in charge of raising
money and spending it strategically to win this year's crucial
House races, is awash in funds right now. In a remarkable
turnaround, the group has more than double the amount of cash in
the bank than its Republican counterpart in the House. And, in a
year of staggering warchests, it has managed to sock away more
money than any other party committee, Republican or Democrat. By
Lizette Alvarez.

   FRANCE-ABORTION-PILL (Trappes, France) _ The students stopping
in at the high school infirmary on a recent morning were making
their usual requests: Some wanted aspirin. Others cold medicine.
One just wanted a place to cry because she had flunked a math test.
Soon, however _ as soon as the nurse here gets in her supply _
students will also be able to pick up morning after pills. In
January, France became the first country in the world to give its
school nurses the right to dispense emergency contraception pills.
The pills are to be available in both high schools and junior high
schools where students are as young as 12. And although the nurses
are advised to make efforts to inform the child's parents, they do
not have to. By Suzanne Daley.

   SC-VOICES (Columbia, S.C.) _ In interviews with voters across
South Carolina, it's not so much the numbers of McCain supporters
that you notice, but it's the passion. By Nicholas D. Kristof.
(1350 words)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-DEL (Dover, Del.) _ Signaling a new, aggressive tone to his
campaign, a combative George W. Bush on Monday chipped away at the
reform mantle worn by his chief Republican rival, John McCain,
portraying the Arizona senator as someone who ``says one thing and
does another.'' With his once huge lead over McCain in the polls in
South Carolina now evaporated, Bush depicted himself as the genuine
reformer, citing his record as governor in Texas on issues such as
education, taxes and civil justice as one of ``a reformer with
results.'' He also conceded that he failed to define himself in
eyes of voters in New Hampshire and claimed that McCain distorted
his proposed tax cut plan. By Jim Yardley. (800 words)

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: CALIFORNIA, MCCAIN ON HIS WAY
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain has cut national front-runner George W. Bush's lead
among California Republicans in half, according to a poll released
today. Less than three weeks ago, Bush led McCain by 40 points in
the Field Poll. The same poll now shows Bush ahead 46-27 percent.
The poll (3.5 percentage point error margin) was conducted just
after New Hampshire. The poll also shows McCain in a statistical
tie with Al Gore in a potential general election matchup in
California, and comfortably ahead of Bill Bradley. McCain is in
Michigan today in advance of the Feb 22 primary there.
</P>
<P>
   Political reform message from Bush _ Unveiling his retooled
campaign message in Delaware today, George W. Bush called himself a
``reformer with results'' and accused John McCain of not living up
to his self-styled image as a political outsider. ``If you're tired
of no results and simple, empty rhetoric, if you're tired of people
saying one thing and doing another, come join my team,'' Bush said
as aides promised new emphasis on McCain's centerpiece issue:
political reform.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like desperation to McCain _ John McCain, campaigning in
Michigan, said today that George W. Bush's campaign is starting to
sound ``desperate,'' in the wake of the New Hampshire defeat.
McCain says Bush's new attacks on his campaign finance reform
message ``fly in the face of the facts.'' Bush has accused McCain
of engaging in ``Washington double talk'' for attacking special
interests while also courting their financial support.
</P>
<P>
   The battle of Delaware _ George W. Bush is trying to take some
of the sting out of his huge loss to John McCain in the New
Hampshire primary by bouncing back in Delaware. Bush campaigned in
The First State on Friday, and was back today. Forbes has spent
four days on a bus tour of the state, with two more town meetings
on tap today. Forbes won the state four years ago, gaining 33
percent of the vote to beat Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Spoiling for a fight _ The conventional wisdom in conservative
circles is that the longer Steve Forbes stays in the race, the more
votes he pulls away from George W. Bush. Bush adviser Ralph Reed:
By running negative attacks, he has only succeeded in hurting the
front-runner, and it is self-evident he has not helped himself.''
The University of Virginia's Larry Sabato: ``I wonder whether, at
this point, Forbes will stay in the race merely to help destroy
George W. Bush. ... There is no question Forbes dislikes Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Focus on traditional constituencies _ Aiming at the
coast-to-coast primaries of March 7, Al Gore and Bill Bradley
opened a national battle Monday for the minorities, women and union
members at the core of the Democratic Party. Bradley campaigned for
black support in Florida; Gore courted labor in New York. Bradley
is targeting minority voters for the moment, in Florida today and
then to South Carolina for a symbolic bash at the Confederate flag
flying over the Statehouse. But Gore has built strong ties
minorities over the past eight years, and analysts say it won't be
easy for Bradley to push past that.
</P>
<P>
   Impasse on debates _ Representatives of the two Democratic
campaigns failed to reach agreement on whether the candidates will
hold regular debates, according to Bill Bradley spokesman Eric
Hauser. Bradley has challenged Al Gore to debate once a week, while
Gore wants to debate twice a week _ but only if the two candidates
give up most TV ads as part of any deal. The two sides will discuss
the issue again Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to Sharpton for help
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton called on Al Gore to debate Bill Bradley on
race and urban issues, and he hinted that he would encourage black
voters in New York to support Bradley if Gore did not do so. With
Bradley at his side at the Allen AME Church in Queens on Sunday,
Sharpton said that he had found only what he characterized as
disturbing signals or indifference from the Gore campaign on racial
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Ready for prime time? _ Former Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.)
revived a charge that he and Bob Dole made in 1992: that Al Gore's
decision to vote for U.S. intervention in the Persian Gulf War was
based, at least in part, on which side would give him the better
prime time speaking slot during the televised Senate debate. Dole,
according to the Boston Globe, said Gore asked him how much time
the pro-intervention side would give him. Fifteen minutes was the
answer. Dole said Gore told him the other side had offered only
seven minutes. Gore's response to Dole, according to the Globe:
``Let me think about it.'' Says Mary Romash of the Gore campaign:
``It is wrong. It is irresponsible. The people who say it are
nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Time to get back to real life _ The New York Daily News reports
that Donald Trump _ who never was an official presidential
candidate anyway _ is ``pulling out of the race in about two
weeks,'' and, ``that may mean a public reconciliation with model
Melania Knauss.
</P>
<P>
   And that safari helmet looks great _ Ignoring a plea by the
Humane Society of the United States, George W. Bush accepted a
conservation award from an organization of trophy hunters that the
society says promotes the killing of rare species. But it was his
father, the former president, who went to Reno, Nev., as keynote
speaker to accept it. The Safari Club International was honoring
the younger Bush as ``governor of the Year.'' ``It's my
understanding they're recognizing him for his conservation efforts
in Texas,'' said Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   Shuffle off to Buffalo _ A day after announcing officially,
Hillary Rodham Clinton kicked off her first swing through upstate
New York as an official candidate for Senate. She was greeted by
about three dozen supporters this morning at a charter airstrip
outside Buffalo, where she planned to address job growth and
economic issues. ``We have a lot of work to do, but it will be
fun,'' Clinton told one supporter as she autographed campaign
signs.
</P>
<P>
   Move that spotlight a little over this way _ Long before Hillary
Rodham Clinton took the stage Sunday, Rudolph Giuliani had spent
hours in interviews, hopping from one TV studio to another to
promote his Senate candidacy on five morning news programs, and
then tending to mayoral obligations including a hospital party for
children with heart problems. At each stop, he focused relentlessly
on promoting his record as mayor, and sought to underscore the
point that Clinton has never served in elective office.

<P>
   In the last few decades, a growing number of astronomers have
promulgated the view that alien civilizations are likely to be
scattered among the stars like grains of sand, isolated from one
another by the emptiness of interstellar space. Just for Earth's
own galaxy, the Milky Way, experts have estimated that there might
be up to 1 million advanced societies.
</P>
<P>
   This extraterrestrial credo has fueled not only countless books,
movies and television shows _ not to mention hosts of Klingons,
Wookies and Romulans _ but a long scientific hunt that uses huge
dish antennas to scan the sky for faint radio signals from
intelligent aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two prominent scientists say the conventional wisdom is
wrong. The alien search, they add, is likely to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on new findings in astronomy, geology and paleontology,
the two argue that humans might be alone, at least in the stellar
neighborhood, and perhaps in the entire cosmos. They say modern
science is showing that Earth's composition and stability are
extraordinarily rare.
</P>
<P>
   Most everywhere else, the radiation levels are too high, the
right chemical elements too rare in abundance, the hospitable
planets too few in number and the rain of killer rocks too intense
for life ever to have evolved into advanced communities. Alien
microbes may survive in many places as a kind of cosmic shower
scum, they say, but not extraterrestrials civilized enough to be
awash in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Their book, ``Rare Earth'' (Springer-Verlag), out last month, is
producing whoops of criticism and praise, with some detractors
saying that the authors have made their own simplistic assumptions
about the adaptability of life forms while others call it
``brilliant'' and ``courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have finally said out loud what so many have thought for so
long _ that complex life, at least, is rare,'' said Dr. Peter D.
Ward of the University of Washington, a paleontologist who
specializes in mass extinctions and whose previous works include
``The Call of Distant Mammoths'' (Springer-Verlag, 1997). ``And to
us, complex life may be a flatworm.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's other author is Dr. Donald C. Brownlee of the
University of Washington, a noted astronomer, member of the
National Academy of Sciences and chief scientist of NASA's $166
million Stardust mission to capture interplanetary and interstellar
dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say the sun is a typical star,'' he said in an
interview. ``That's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownlee added: ``Almost all environments in the universe are
terrible for life. It's only garden of Eden places like Earth where
it can exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Geoffrey W. Marcy of the University of California at
Berkeley, a leading seeker of planets around other stars, 31 of
which have been found so far, hailed ``Rare Earth'' as likely to
spark a revolution in thinking about extraterrestrial life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's brilliant,'' Marcy said in an interview. ``It delineates
many things I've been thinking about but does a much more credible
job of listing and explaining the various issues.'' For instance,
he said, it shows how the giant planets discovered so far outside
the solar system bode ill for the development of complex life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's courageous,'' Marcy added. ``It's rare in literature and
science that a stance goes so far against the grain.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that alien civilizations are ubiquitous arose in a
scientific sense four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank D. Drake, then a young astronomer at a federal radio
observatory in West Virginia, in 1960 was the first to scan the
skies for faint alien signals, and was quickly joined by
like-minded experts, including Dr. Carl Sagan, then a brash
27-year-old astronomer. Drake laid out his ideas in 1961, in what
came to be known as the Drake equation.
</P>
<P>
   The equation made educated guesses for the rate at which stars
form, the fraction of stars with planets, the number of those
planets on which life arises and so on, including the average
lifetime of technological civilizations. By his logic, the Milky
Way had about 10,000 civilizations capable of interstellar
communication.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Sagan revised the calculation and raised the estimate to
a million alien worlds. Since the cosmos holds hundreds of millions
of galaxies, by that analysis the total number of alien societies
could be astronomical, one estimate putting the number at roughly
10 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   New findings, however, according to the authors of ``Rare
Earth,'' show that the Drake equation is riddled with hidden
optimistic assumptions. Their stance, the authors say in the
preface, is ``rarely articulated but increasingly accepted by many
astrobiologists,'' the general name for scientists who study the
likelihood of extraterrestrial life.
</P>
<P>
   Ward said he was drawn to the topic because of his studies of
mass extinctions. Increasingly, top culprits are seen as speeding
rocks from outer space that hit Earth in huge explosions, with one
65 million years ago killing off many plants and animals, including
the dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   New studies, Ward said, suggest that things could be worse. For
instance, the rate of terrestrial impacts could be as much as
10,000 times higher but for the presence of Jupiter, the solar
system's largest planet, which absorbs many killer rocks and flings
others into deep space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right on the edge of the abyss,'' Ward said, in terms of
higher bombardment rates that have probably precluded the
development of advanced life.
</P>
<P>
   Recent finds of giant Jupiterlike planets outside the solar
system offer no solace. Most of their orbits, he said, are wildly
eccentric, which would abet destructive chaos among smaller planets
rather than shielding them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Jupiters seen today are bad Jupiters,'' Ward said.
``Ours is the only good one we know of. And it's got to be good, or
you're thrown out into dark space or into your sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcy, the planet finder, said such analyses were adding to his
doubts about the existence of extraterrestrials.
</P>
<P>
   Even if some distant Jupiters are in stable, circular orbits,
Ward said, other factors might overwhelm their protective effect
and demolish any life. For instance, closer to the center of the
galaxy where star populations are far denser, the frequent passage
of one star past another could trigger cascades of comets,
trillions of which are thought to orbit most stars' icy fringes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in the interior of the galaxy,'' he said, ``you're
always getting bombarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Added to that fury, he said, is the intense radiation and
explosions of galactic interiors. The star-filled sky conveys a
false impression of immutability. New studies show that the cosmos,
especially galactic centers, are hotbeds of violence swept by
killing waves of X-rays, gamma rays and ionizing radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I don't think there's any life in the centers at all,''
Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   Brownlee, the astronomer and co-author, said the odds for
complex life were similarly bad at galactic edges.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis of starlight from the such fringes shows they are
relatively poor in elements like iron, magnesium and silicon,
partly because of less recycling of stellar materials over the eons
and partly because of the rarity in such regions of supernovas, the
stellar blasts that help make heavy elements in enormously hot
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   These elements, Brownlee said, and even heavier ones that are
radioactive and also made in supernovas, appear to be prerequisites
to the formation of terrestrial-type planets that have sufficient
gravity to retain seas and atmospheres and that have plate
tectonics, which is powered largely by the heat of radioactive
decay.
</P>
<P>
   According to the book, the slow movement and recycling of
planetary crust into a planet's hot interior are key ingredients
for the evolution of complex life. Plate tectonics, the authors
say, promotes biodiversity by producing mountain chains and other
kinds of environmental complexity, lessens the odds of extinctions,
helps keep planetary temperatures even through the recycling of
carbon and makes dry land on which advanced civilizations can
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're critically dependent on mass,'' said Brownlee. ``Being
bigger or smaller might rule out plate tectonics.''
</P>
<P>
   Whole galaxies are metal-poor and therefore probably devoid of
animal life, Brownlee added. Only spiral galaxies like the Milky
Way and its nearby neighbor in Andromeda appear rich in metals, and
even then, only in their inner regions. In contrast, elliptical and
irregular galaxies, he said, are barren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lower metal abundance means you can't make a planet as big as
the Earth,'' Brownlee said. ``It seems like something a lot of
people don't want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists discuss other planetary characteristics that are
probably rare in the universe but are increasingly seen as critical
for making Earth so favorable to complex life. Among them are
these:
</P>
<P>
   _ An orbit that keeps a planet at exactly the right distance
from its star to ensure that water remains liquid, not vapor or
ice.
</P>
<P>
   _ A large moon at just the right distance to minimize changes in
a planet's tilt, ensuring climate stability.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enough carbon to aid the development of life but not so much
to allow for runaway greenhouse conditions, as occur on superheated
Venus.
</P>
<P>
   In the book's conclusion, the authors say the ``Rare Earth''
hypothesis is testable, and they strongly encourage such work.
Powerful new telescopes will shed light not only on gas giants but
on the abundance of smaller, terrestrial planets around distant
stars, and will also show whether their orbits are stable and
protected by larger planets from cosmic bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   New telescopes also might find evidence of planets enshrouded in
ozone and oxygen, which in sufficient concentrations imply the
existence of life.
</P>
<P>
   The two scientists also call for searches of Mars, the Jovian
moons Europa and Ganymede, and Saturn's moon Titan for signs of
alien microbes. That discovery would answer the question of whether
life is an inherent property of matter, as most scientists believe.
</P>
<P>
   The two support radio hunts for signs of advanced alien
civilizations, but add that ``it is very difficult to know''
whether the search ``is an effective use of resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,
known as SETI, see the new book as a heretical assault that could
endanger the financing of the hunt. More than $100 million has been
spent to date, with most money now coming from silicon moguls and
other private donors.
</P>
<P>
   Drake, now president of the SETI Institute, a private group in
Mountain View, Calif., that is searching for alien civilizations
with the huge dish antenna at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, said the book's
main failing was undue pessimism about life's tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic flaw in all those arguments,'' Drake said, ``is that
they don't allow for the opportunistic nature of life, its ability
to accommodate or alter itself to cope with environmental change.''
</P>
<P>
   As for politics, Drake said, most SETI researchers are more
interested in honest debate than trying to suppress critics out of
fear of cuts in financing. ``Maybe we're politically naive,'' he
said. ``But we don't try to stamp out this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake added: ``The only way you can find out the truth is to
search and discover either the prevalence of intelligent life, or
its total absence.''
</P>
<P>
   If the rarity hypothesis turns out to be true, the book says, it
greatly increases the loss each time a plant or animal is driven to
extinction and strengthens the responsibility for humans to be good
stewards of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Ward remarked in an interview, if the Milky Way is truly
devoid of alien hordes, then it might be humanity's destiny over
the eons to spread into the wilderness of stars, unopposed by
ancient legions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are as rare as we think we are,'' Ward said, ``it raises
the stakes, intellectually and morally.''

MINDING THE GAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although it was hard to discern amid the veritable hailstorm of
new proposals, President Clinton's final budget proposal, released
Monday, accentuated a goal he has been pursuing more vigorously of
late: narrowing the income gap.
</P>
<P>
   This is a worthy goal. Many studies have shown the growing
disparity between the economic circumstances of the nation's
richest 20 percent of the population and the poorest 20 or 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pointed to this gap in the 1992 campaign. ``While taxes
fall and incomes rise for those at the top of the totem pole,'' he
said simply, ``middle-class families pay more and earn less.''
</P>
<P>
   During his time in office, the wealthiest have generally
prospered _ many enormously _ while those at the bottom have
stagnated or actually slipped back. The major relief has been
expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which provides
significant tax relief to low-wage workers. Still, the heavy burden
of Social Security and other payroll taxes leaves many at the low
end struggling.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's health care proposals were defeated in 1994, he
mentioned the income gap less often. But in recent months this has
changed, as he has taken business leaders around the country to
emphasize populations and regions that need investment.
</P>
<P>
   The new budget unveiled Monday contains a number of proposals
that would open opportunities for those with modest incomes. It
would increase tax credits for child care, for persons who provide
relatives with long-term care, and for working families with three
or more children. It would soften the marriage penalty in the
existing tax code, and it would encourage savings for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   A tax break for college expenses would also be helpful, if there
is a way to make sure the schools don't gobble up the money by
raising fees.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, these budget proposals for low- and moderate-income
persons amount to a modest tax cut that would use the budget
surplus to help the nation grow together.

ANTIDOTE TO SCANDAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is a primary reason for the resilience of liberal
democracies, it is that they are self-correcting. Witness the
successive revelations about corruption scandals tainting Germany's
erstwhile chancellor, Helmut Kohl, after 16 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   The first wave of scandal concerned hidden donations to his
Christian Democrat Party, money that Kohl controlled in secret
slush funds. Now come investigations of enormous payoffs to
well-connected middlemen in Germany and France who greased the
rails for a sale of German tanks to Saudi Arabia and the purchase
by a French oil company of a dilapidated oil refinery in the former
East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most telling aspect of these cases is that the
corruption alleged was not confined by national borders and is now
being pursued by prosecutors in Germany, France, and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the East German oil refinery to Elf-Aquitaine,
citizens on both sides of the Rhine are now learning, was a shady
deal that produced not only $60 million in dubious commissions for
former intelligence officials but also a package of geopolitical
payoffs: to the French government of former president Francois
Mitterrand for its acceptance of German unification and to Kohl for
his support of a European single currency and the diluting of
Germany's influence in a unified Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The refinery affair as well as the complex transaction that
resulted in the transfer of 36 German Army tanks to Saudi Arabia a
decade ago suggest a systemic penchant for corruption that would
not seem out of place in contemporary Russia. The great difference
is that the polities of France and Germany show signs of being able
to expose, cleanse, and correct their corruption.
</P>
<P>
   It is healthy that Kohl's Christian Democrats are paying a
political price for the sins of yesteryear and that the complicity
of French authorities is being illuminated. A free press and an
independent judiciary are the stabilizers that keep liberal
democracies from being capsized by leaders like Mitterrand and
Kohl.

THE MESSAGE OF RISK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since the world became aware of the dimension of the AIDS
epidemic and the role that sex plays in its transmission, health
officials have tried to make the public aware of which sex
practices were most dangerous and which less so. This is no easy
matter; with an infected partner no unprotected sex is completely
safe. On the other hand, officials have been reluctant to portray
all acts as dangerous for fear that their counsel would simply be
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   This balancing of risk and realism was shaken last week with the
report from a carefully conducted study in San Francisco showing
that, in one group of 102 gay and bisexual men with AIDS, about 8
percent were infected through oral sex. This is a huge increase in
the risk factor that AIDS specialists initially had attributed to
oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   The study caught the attention of AIDS specialists in
Massachusetts and elsewhere. Jean Maguire of the state Department
of Public Health's AIDS bureau said her office will be notifying
AIDS-prevention groups it works with about the heightened concern
over oral sex. Carisa Cunningham of AIDS Action Committee of
Massachusetts sees the study as a corrective to those who, as she
puts it, ``hear `safe' '' when they are told that something like
oral sex is ``safer'' than unprotected anal sex.
</P>
<P>
   The message about the risk of oral sex should especially be
delivered by AIDS-prevention groups and sex-education instructors
working with adolescents. As Maguire notes, this is a population
that is difficult to reach with any information about health and
sex. Better ways simply have to be found to make clear the full
danger of an act that many indulge in casually.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald Valdiserri of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention values the new study for its emphasis on preventing the
disease. ``America doesn't seem to be as engaged in prevention as
we are,'' he said. After last week's report, everyone in America _
but especially parents, teachers, doctors, and health officials _
have good reason to be more engaged.

   &UR; Day Trips From Heathrow &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a nine-hour layover at Heathrow, and would like some
tips on where to spend an afternoon without going into London
proper. I'd prefer an activity that involves some walking. And
please include information on public transportation. _ Sydney Lyle,
Rochester
</P>
<P>
   A. There are many lovely places near Heathrow where you can
stretch your legs. The following sites are about 30 to 45 minutes
from the airport and are easily accessible by public
transportation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Botanic Gardens, a few minutes' walk from the Kew
Gardens subway station on the westbound District Line, was
originally two royal estates, which George III merged in the late
18th century. The site is now a 300-acre center for science and
conservation with greenhouses, galleries, follies, a museum and a
collection of more than 30,000 plants. You'll find gardens devoted
to bluebells, roses, rhododendrons and azaleas; stands of sweet
chestnut, juniper and Japanese cedar, as well as greenhouse gardens
devoted to alpine, tropical, rain-forest and temperate species. The
gardens open at 9:30 a.m.; closing time varies from 3:30 to 6:30
p.m., depending on the season. Admission is $8, figured at a rate
of 62 pence to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond-upon-Thames, also on the District Line, is one subway
stop beyond Kew Gardens. The pretty, prosperous London suburb, with
its central Green surrounded by 17th- and 18th-century houses is
fun to explore, especially for architecture buffs. Among the
noteworthy buildings are the late 19th-century Richmond Theater (on
the Green); the 18th-century stone Asgill House at the end of Old
Palace Lane; the Museum of Richmond in Old Town Hall on Whittaker
Avenue (admission is free); and the early 18th-century Maids of
Honor Row, a collection of four three-story houses, built to house
the Maids of Honor who attended the Princess of Wales during the
time of George II. Nearby is the 2,358-acre Richmond Park, home to
herds of red and fallow deer. Information: (44-181) 940 9125.
</P>
<P>
   Another opion is Windsor Castle, one of Queen Elizabeth II's
three official residences. You can visit St. George's Chapel, the
State Apartments, Queen Mary's Dolls House, as well as the castle's
precincts. Hours are 9:45 a.m. to 4 p.m.; admission is $17.
</P>
<P>
   Signs for subway and bus stations at Heathrow are clearly
posted. If you travel after 9:30 a.m., the most economical option
for getting to Kew Gardens and Richmond-upon-Thames is to buy a
one-day unlimited London Travel Card _ good for buses and subways _
for $5.35.
</P>
<P>
   For transportation to Windsor take the No. 191 or 192 bus from
the station at Heathrow. A round-trip ticket costs $7.25.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Budget Lodgings in Belem &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you give me the names of some inexpensive, atmospheric
accommodations in Belem? I'd like to keep the price to $50 or
under. _ Jonathan Levy, Brooklyn
</P>
<P>
   A. You won't have a hard time finding atmospheric lodgings in
Belem, capital of the northern Brazilian state of Para. In fact,
large portions of this 384-year-old port city at the mouth of the
Amazon River are loaded with a distinctive Brazilian-colonial
ambience _ from the narrow streets lined with blue-tiled,
Portuguese-style buildings to the bustling market selling
everything from Amazonian fish and manioc flour to medicinal herbs
and religious potions.
</P>
<P>
   The Parque dos Igarapes, about four miles from downtown, has 15
bungalows set on 40 acres of Amazon forest. The rustic bungalows,
built of wood and straw, are air-conditioned; a double room with
private bath is $50. The hotel is at the mouth of the Ariri River
and guests have access to canoes, as well as a swimming pool,
volleyball court and soccer fields. The hotel is at Kilometer 7 of
the Augusto Montenegro Road; telephone (5591) 248-1718, fax (5591)
248-6910.
</P>
<P>
   The Manaca Hotel, in the pleasant suburb of Nazare, is a
renovated old house with 16 rooms. It is decorated in a colonial
style, with tropical hardwood furniture. The rooms have
air-conditioning, private baths, telephones and television sets.
Doubles, including breakfast, are $35. The address is 1645 Travessa
Quintino Bocaiuva. Information: (5591) 222-6227.
</P>
<P>
   Guest rooms at the Hotel Central, at 290 Avenida Presidente
Vargas (Belem's main street), have gorgeous wooden transoms on the
windows, 14-foot ceilings and a bathroom with original 1930s tiles.
Doubles are $30. Information: (5591) 241-8177.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Left Bank Tours &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm going to Paris for the first time and want to take a
walking tour of the Left Bank. Can you help? _ Sandra Liever,
Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   A. Organizations offering guided tours of the Left Bank are
plentiful. Unless otherwise noted, the companies below offer tours
in English as well as in French.
</P>
<P>
   Decouvrir Paris has many tours of Parisian neighborhoods and
buildings. Traditional Left Bank tourist haunts like
St.-Germain-des-Pres are covered, but Decouvrir Paris also visits
less well-known neighborhoods like La Butte aux Cailles, an ethnic
neighborhood with Russian and Alsatian enclaves, in the 13th
Arrondissement. Tours last 90 minutes and cost $7.50 (figured at a
rate of 6.72 francs to the dollar), plus additional entrance fees,
when applicable. Information: (33-1) 47.89.41.68.
</P>
<P>
   Paris a Pied, which is based in Minneapolis, has a Left Bank
tour that lasts three hours and covers a lot of ground, passing
through the Mouffetard quarter, the Pantheon, the Luxembourg
Gardens, the Sorbonne and and Cluny. This tour costs $45 and
includes a coffee break. Reservations: (800) 594-9535. Information
is also available at www.parisapied.com.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Marti has been leading walking tours in Paris for six
years. He is certified by the Culture Ministry, which gives his
groups access to many courtyards and interesting interiors normally
closed to the public. Marti's tours range from the winding
Mouffetard quarter in the Fifth Arrondissement to the renovated
neighborhood around the new Francois Mitterrand Library, in the
13th Arrondissement. Tours are in French only; they last two hours
and cost $7.50. Information: (33-1) 40.31.56.06.
</P>
<P>
   You might also refer to the weekly publication Pariscope, sold
at newspaper kiosks. It gives a day-by-day listing of walking tours
under the heading ``Promenades.'' Recent examples included a tour
of the St. Sulpice Quarter and the Montparnasse Cemetery.

 &HT;    Don't let the good times go to your head
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The economic expansion that started in March 1991 has raised
real gross domestic product by more than a third, put the federal
budget into a surprising surplus situation and given jobs to people
once outside the working world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best of all,'' says Business Week (Feb. 14) in a special cover
package, ``it has transformed the psyche of millions of Americans.
The pervasive gloom at the beginning of the 1990s is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Business investment in computer technology, which improved
productivity, gets credit for the boom, along with the
restructuring of corporations into lean and mean fighting machines
capable of taking on global competition.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, says Business Week, too many people have given in
to the temptation to conclude that this ``New Economy'' also means
the end of the business cycle. That is wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Many sober economic historians think the current situation is
too reminiscent of the economic boom of the 1920s, when inflation
was low, productivity was high and the stock market soared.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California
at Berkeley and leading expert on the Great Depression and the
international financial crises of the 1990s, put it this way: ``If
you believe history repeats itself, all the ingredients are there
for a stock market-led downturn.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting an early start
</P>
<P>
   About two stocks a week went on the market for the first time in
1999 and at least doubled quickly in price. Yet most individual
investors were unable to buy shares of those initial public
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   According to Worth (February), the lion's share of an IPO goes
to the 100 biggest money managers, and most of the rest goes to
institutions, leaving only a small amount for wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's package of articles on the ins and outs of IPOs
explains why the little guy has such a little chance of making a
killing in this market.
</P>
<P>
   Too much tech too fast
</P>
<P>
   The attempt by Flowers Industries to modernize production of its
Mrs. Smith's line of pies in less than 12 months backfired because
it was too much too fast, Forbes (Feb. 21) says in a profile of the
Thomasville-based snack foods company. Equipment that was supposed
to work didn't, and costs swelled as the company hired people to do
what the technology didn't, Forbes says.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Officer Amos McMullian told Forbes the company
will have ``record earnings at Mrs. Smith's and Flowers this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning
</P>
<P>
   For all the pre-Christmas hype about online buying, shoppers
were dissatisfied, says The Economist (Feb. 11). In fighting for
market share, most online retailers neglected to fulfill customer
service. The magazine says eToys failed to deliver 4 percent of its
merchandise in time for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Working Woman (February) offers a Dick-and-Jane primer on what
it takes for women _ and presumably men _ to get on headhunters'
lists of good job candidates for a career change.

CHECKS FLYING, SAN FRANCISCO BUILDS A MODERN ART COLLECTION
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Nonsubscribers

 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Four years ago, when the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art unveiled its new home, a $63 million brick-clad building
designed by the Swiss architect Mario Botta, the trustees quickly
saw their problem. The museum's painfully skimpy art collection was
dwarfed by the large, sun-filled galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors who flocked downtown to the 225,000-square-foot
structure, just across the street from the city's new arts complex,
left shaking their heads. Where, they asked, was the art?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was aware our paintings did not justify the building,''
recalled Phyllis Wattis, 94, the museum's biggest benefactor.
``After it opened, I was almost embarrassed by our collection.''
</P>
<P>
   While no other trustees dared to be as forthcoming about the
collection's deficiencies, they all agreed something had to be
done. And fast. So they dug into their deep pockets and turned
their museum into the biggest buyer in the contemporary art world.
</P>
<P>
   In less than two years the trustees have helped the museum
acquire more than $130 million worth of art by contemporary masters
like Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Ellsworth Kelly and Mark
Rothko. Their shopping habits _ paying top dollar for the best
available _ are more aggressive than those of any museum in the
world right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trustees are in it to win,'' said Matthew Marks, A New
York City dealer who has worked with the museum, helping to
negotiate the sale of 22 early works by Kelly and to organize a
show of recent works by Johns. ``People love the new in San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   While the trustees say they cannot possibly compete with the
Museum of Modern Art in New York, whose core collection was formed
in the early part of the 20th century, they would like to.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way we could be better than MOMA,'' said Donald
Fisher, founder of the Gap clothing chain and a San Francisco
trustee. ``But we'll be delighted to be recognized as an
outstanding museum worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   The force driving the museum is a group of high-profile
executives and their wives who not only love contemporary art but
also collect it with a passion. Besides Fisher and Wattis, widow of
Paul Wattis, a construction and mining magnate, the trustees
include Charles Schwab, chairman and founder of the discount
brokerage firm; Mimi Haas, the wife of Peter Haas, a former
chairman of Levi Strauss; Leanne Roberts, wife of George Roberts, a
partner in the firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co.; and Pamela
Kramlich, the wife of Richard Kramlich, the venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   In much the same way that the new rich of the last century _
Morgans and Rockefellers, Mellons and Palmers _ shaped great
museums by buying art or donating entire collections to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New
York, the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Art
Institute of Chicago, their West Coast counterparts are intent on
building a world-class museum in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a golden age here,'' said Gary Garrels, the museum's
chief curator for the last seven years, who resigned last month to
become a curator at the Modern in New York. ``San Francisco is in a
boom.''
</P>
<P>
   A gateway to the Pacific rim and barely half an hour from
Silicon Valley, San Francisco has consolidated its position as a
center of commerce and power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The locus of innovation has shifted westward in the United
States,'' Schwab, chairman of the museum's investment committee,
said in an interview in the museum's all-white boardroom, with
trial pages from the museum's updated Web site tacked on a wall.
``Entrepreneurship is a big thing in San Francisco, and the visual
arts are particularly amenable to it. The art world moves so much
more quickly than, say, music. It reflects our changing society.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when David Ross resigned from the Whitney Museum
of American Art in New York City to become director of the museum
here, popularly known as SFMOMA (pronounced S.F. MO-ma), he said
his decision had to do with San Francisco's being the only city in
the world where the No. 1 museum featured modern art. ``The idea of
modernity is congruent with San Francisco, '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For its first 60 years the modern art museum was a poor cousin
to other local attractions, especially the 106-year-old
institutions that make up the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco:
the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum, which specializes in American,
African, Oceanian and pre-Columbian art from the Americas; and the
Legion of Honor, devoted to ancient and European art.
</P>
<P>
   Housed in rented, cramped quarters upstairs in the
Depression-era War Memorial Veterans Building in the Civic Center,
the modern art museum organized some important exhibitions, but it
never had the space or the budget to do anything significant. So
its move to a new building was considered bold.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago this downtown neighborhood south of Market Street,
the major axis of downtown San Francisco, was the equivalent of
Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan, a seedy part of the city where the
museum's moneyed trustees dared not go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to do a lot of convincing that this was the right
move,'' said Wattis. ``Several key members of the board left
because of it. A lot of trustees had never crossed Market Street on
foot before. They thought I was the most adventurous person in the
world.''

   The city's Redevelopment Agency was trying to transform the
downtown area into an arts district and was looking for an
institution to become its anchor. To encourage the museum's move,
the agency offered to sell a parcel of land at Third and Mission
Streets for $1 if the money to build and operate the museum could
be raised privately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the city changing, and this was a chance to become a
part of it,'' said Fisher.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Today the neighborhood is home to the Yerba Buena Center for the
Arts, right across the street. Around the corner, on Mission
Street, the Jewish Museum is gearing up to move into a building
designed by the Polish architect Daniel Liebeskind. The Italian
architect Gae Aulenti is designing a Mexican Museum next door to
the Jewish Museum. Restaurants, shops, art galleries and
photography studios have sprouted in the neighborhood, which also
has an existing Sony entertainment complex.
</P>
<P>
   The move downtown was led by John R. Lane, the former director
of the museum who is now director of the Dallas Museum of Art, and
John Caldwell, the San Francisco museum's first curator of painting
and sculpture, who died in 1993. Ross and the trustees credit these
two men with inspiring the museum's benefactors to collect
contemporary art for its galleries and for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ross and some of the trustees are looking for creative ways
to lure gifts to the museum, especially from Silicon Valley's rich
young technology pioneers, who may collect cars and yachts but not
art. Some trustees have made partial or promised gifts of their
art, a common way of taking a tax deduction while enjoying their
collections during their lifetimes. Others, like the San Francisco
real estate investor Paul Sack and his wife, Prentice, who have a
collection of 1,000 photographs, have created trusts that yield tax
deductions equal to the full appraised value, a larger tax break
than if they had donated the collection as partial or promised
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result the museum is offered everything that comes on the
market. ``The trustees around here do not bargain,'' said Ross.
``They recognize that one of the reasons great pictures are being
offered to us is because our trustees are willing to pay. They know
what a great picture is worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Even artists are getting into the act. Both Rauschenberg and
Kelly have recently sold the museum large bodies of work that they
had long held onto. In honor of Wattis, Rauschenberg also gave the
museum ``Hiccups,'' a monumental work from 1978 consisting of 97
drawings on sheets of handmade paper fastened together and
extending 63 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Johns was flattered when Garrels asked him to exhibit his latest
works at the museum last September. The largest of them, a painting
called ``Bridge,'' was bought anonymously by a trustee. It was the
first time Johns' work had been shown in San Francisco in more than
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week an anonymous donor bought the museum a 1971 painting
by Cy Twombly. The 10-by-16-foot work came from the artist's
collection in a deal negotiated by Larry Gagosian, the Manhattan
dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The museum also keeps an eye on important gallery shows. It
recently bought ``Princess of the Posse,'' a major painting by the
Chris Ofili, part of the group known as the Young British Artists;
it was among five of his works displayed last fall at Gavin Brown
Enterprises in New York City. Ofili's ``Holy Virgin Mary,''
exhibited in the Brooklyn Museum of Art's ``Sensation'' show, was
the subject of great controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Arne Glimcher, chairman of PaceWildenstein, which has branches
in New York and Los Angeles, is responsible for the Rauschenberg
purchase. ``San Francisco moves very quickly,'' he said. ``It's
good for the artists to have museums of modern art on both
coasts.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the museums of modern art on both coasts are outwardly
collegial, it is hard not to notice the copycat acquisitions list.
In June the Modern in New York announced that it had acquired four
works by Rauschenberg; a year ago the San Francisco museum acquired
14. In May 22 works by Kelly came to San Francisco; New York's
Modern acquired 15 works on paper by him in 1997 and his `Sculpture
for a Large Wall, 1957'' in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're competitive people,'' said Fisher. ``We're in
competitive businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   There is even competition among the trustees, and Wattis has
helped egg them on. A philanthropist whose largess extends well
beyond this museum, she has led many of its most expensive art
purchases. She thinks nothing of phoning other trustees and asking
them to write big checks. And they do.
</P>
<P>
   In April the museum spent what is reported to be $60 million on
10 works by artists like Johns, Frank Stella and Roy Lichtenstein
from Fukuoka, the Japanese bank. It has also paid often
record-breaking prices at auction for artists like Rothko, Eva
Hesse and Magritte.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics think the museum is overpaying and not necessarily
buying the right things. ``They buy rich, but they don't buy
smart,'' said Francis Bowes, who along with her husband, John,
resigned from the museum's board when Ross became director.
``They're too cavalier with money, spending far more than a
collector would for things. They also don't support local
galleries.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the big spending has helped raise the institution's
profile. Attendance has grown nearly 50 percent in the last 18
months. Membership is at an all-time high, with nearly 40,000
people paying the minimum fee of $55 a year.
</P>
<P>
   On Ross' to-do list: First, stabilize the museum's $50 million
endowment with a capital campaign. Next, create a
14,000-square-foot open-air sculpture gallery on top of the new
garage; the old underground garage will become an expanded
education center. Then there are plans to build a collections and
research department to cope with the huge volume of acquisitions.
This would entail hiring scholars and researchers. And like all
museums, this one is thinking commercially, planning to expand its
store and open a satellite shop in the new San Francisco airport.
</P>
<P>
   There is also talk of expanding the gallery spaces by close to
100,000 square feet, by building wings on either side of the
building, an expansion Botta took into account as part of his
initial design.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a 10-year plan,'' said Ross. ``It all could occur
faster. But I don't want to move too fast. I inherited something
great here, and I want it to last.''

BISHOP SPONG WILL NOT GO QUIETLY INTO RETIREMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (Resending to fix summary line) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bishop John Shelby Spong, a gadfly liberal churchman from
Newark, N.J., officially retired as an active bishop last week,
much to the delight of many who see his theology as heretical.
</P>
<P>
   But the 68-year-old Spong, known as Jack by his supporters and
detractors, isn't going away. He will likely remain the nation's
most controversial Episcopalian.
</P>
<P>
   During his 23 years as a bishop, Spong has forcefully spoken out
for the right of homosexuals to be ordained. He has written
shocking books, such as ``Why Christianity Must Change or Die,''
which calls for revamping most of the doctrines of his own church.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke with him last week by phone just as he and his wife,
Chris, had moved into an apartment at Harvard University, where
Spong will lecture for the next several months. Spong will be
delivering the William Belden Noble Lectures, which will become the
basis of a new book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll also be teaching a course to young clergy on how to
preach,'' he said. ``We get about 2,000 seconds of people's time
for every sermon, more time than most people get to voice their
views. We need to make the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Spong certainly makes the most of his time.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his Harvard lectures, he will be in Texas next
week to speak in Dallas, Houston, Austin and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   He will discuss ``Overcoming the Barriers of Prejudice'' at 6
p.m. Feb. 12 at the Cathedral of Hope in Dallas, the nation's
largest predominantly gay congregation. He will also sign copies of
his new autobiography, ``Here I Stand: My Struggle for a
Christianity of Integrity, Love &AMP; Equality'' (Harper San Francisco,
$25).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel very retired, yet,'' Spong said.
</P>
<P>
   Spong's 464-page autobiography traces his evolution from a young
man growing up in the conservative South to his championship of
liberal causes.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Charlotte, N.C., and as a youth delivered
newspapers to Billy Graham's family, who lived about a mile away
from the Spongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also lived in Lynchburg, Va., in the same town with Jerry
Falwell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised a biblical fundamentalist,'' he said. ``I would
have gone over well in East Texas during my early years. But I've
come a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Spong reveals that he had trouble dressing like a bishop at
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``For five years, I could not bring myself to wear the purple
shirt of the bishop's office,'' he writes. ``It reminded me of
someone trying to be Robin Redbreast.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after becoming a bishop in 1976, Spong began advocating
the right of gays and lesbians to be ordained. He believes that
eventually everyone will agree that gays should not be banned from
the priesthood because of their sexual orientation because of
growing evidence that people do not choose their sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't choose to be a heterosexual,'' he said in the
interview. ``I just woke up when I was about 12 years old and
thought that girls were OK.''
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, he credits retired Fort Worth Episcopal
Bishop Clarence Pope, one of Spong's strongest critics, with
helping to create the international headlines surrounding Spong's
ordination of a noncelibate man.
</P>
<P>
   Pope was one of the first to issue a statement denouncing
Spong's action. His statements were reported locally and worldwide.
Spong then responded to Pope's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had known Clarence for more than 20 years. ... I genuinely
liked him,'' Spong writes. ``I had no intention, however, of
stopping this ordination to keep Clarence happy. What Clarence had
done ... was to turn the ordination into a media event. Our diocese
had hoped to avoid making this a spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the few formal denunciations, Pope and others led a
successful move in the House of Bishops to dissociate the group
from Spong's ordination of the openly gay man.
</P>
<P>
   Spong has antagonized traditional Christian thinkers at every
turn. In one of his books, ``Rescuing the Bible From
Fundamentalism,'' he speculated that the Apostle Paul might have
been gay. He suggested that Jesus might have been married to Mary
Magdalene.
</P>
<P>
   He has been called the Antichrist and the devil incarnate. But
he also has quite a following among those who are searching for a
more meaningful faith.
</P>
<P>
   Spong will be a bishop for life, and he has the right to vote
and discuss issues at this year's Episcopal General Convention. But
he has vowed not to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised, though, if Spong makes waves again. He has a
lifelong habit of shooting from the hip when it comes to discussing
volatile theological, moral and ethical issues. And it is a habit
not easily broken.

BOOK WEIGHS IN ON HEALTH ISSUE FOR BLACK WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took two pregnancies to put meat on my bones.
</P>
<P>
   Until then my weight had fluctuated between 110 and 116 pounds.
I ate like two men. I looked anorexic. Great metabolism, I used to
boast.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not overweight, but I'm not bragging anymore. Nowadays, I
have to watch my weight like the rest of America. But I don't diet,
mind you. Never have. Never will.
</P>
<P>
   When I've abstained from food, it has been strictly for
spiritual reasons. I've fasted for as many as three days at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I was a little more than intrigued recently when Kathleen
Rodgers wrote me about this new book: ``Slim Down Sister: The
African-American Woman's Guide to Healthy, Permanent Weight Loss''
by Roniece Weaver, Angela Ebron and Fabiola Gaines (E.P. Dutton,
$23.95).
</P>
<P>
   I always thought _ based on my own personal experiences, of
course _ that the best way to keep weight off was simply to watch
your waistband. If it feels tight around the waist, pull back on
your appetite a bit.
</P>
<P>
   So I didn't know what to make of Slim Down Sister. This was not
my struggle. At least not in the personal sense.
</P>
<P>
   But then, talking the other day with Ebron about the statistics
made this issue feel too close for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-two percent of us are overweight, and it doesn't show
any signs of slowing down,'' said Ebron, referring to
African-American women. ``There is tons of research that will
convince even the most skeptical person that being overweight is
linked to life-threatening diseases like hypertension, diabetes,
heart disease and certain types of cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   I had to think only of my five sisters, all overweight, most of
them suffering from one of these ailments. My mother, though not
overweight, died of a heart attack at 43. I remembered a night
recently at choir rehearsal and the prayer requests from sisters
about to undergo surgery or tests to determine the source of their
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Look at them, talk to Ebron and you know why.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times it takes a health scare to convince someone to
try to lose,'' said Ebron, a senior editor and fitness writer for
``Family Circle'' magazine. ``That's the thing that snaps a lot of
people into reality. Hopefully, sisters will pick this book up
before they have the health problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebron knows what she's talking about. Losing weight has been a
lifelong battle for her. The emotional ups and downs are like best
friends. And that's the reason, she said, she joined with Weaver
and Gaines to write what is being billed as the first weight-loss
book written especially for African-American women.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to addressing the serious health concerns of black
women, Slim Down Sister offers tips for exercising and streamlining
your diet, real-life testimonials from women who have lost weight
and kept it off, a guide to organizing a weight-loss program at
your church and how to set up a support system.
</P>
<P>
   ``As someone who identifies with the reader,'' Ebron said,
``there wasn't anything out there that addressed our specific
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Where diet is concerned, Ebron found that the majority of books
offered dietary substitutes like tofu, a bland protein foreign to
most African-American palates.
</P>
<P>
   But with Slim Down Sister, you don't have to sacrifice
traditional family meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want food that we like, that our family like, that reflect
our heritage,'' Ebron said. ``You can have pretty much any food you
want. It's about moderation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also about exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a chapter even I can use.

FOR SOME, SPEAKING TO GOD IN AN ANCIENT TONGUE PUTS FAITH ON A
HIGHER PLANE

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some years back, a student approached religious-studies
Professor Kay Read with a complaint. The student attended a
Catholic church where the prayers, which she had memorized, had
always been recited in Latin. Then one day the church switched to
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she finally understood what was going on, she didn't like
it,'' recalls Read, an associate professor at DePaul University in
Chicago. The words were not what she had thought they were.
</P>
<P>
   Billions of people across the globe pray in languages different
from the ones they speak. These sacred tongues are usually ancient
languages, often written or spoken by the religions' founders and
frozen in time. They include Arabic for Muslims, Hebrew for Jews,
Sanskrit for Hindus, Latin for Catholics and Pali for Theravada
Buddhists. But outside of Arabic, and to a far lesser extent
Hebrew, most of the languages aren't readily spoken anymore _ a few
never were.
</P>
<P>
   For some modern worshippers, the language barrier can present an
obstacle to fully embracing a faith. For others, scriptural
language offers a direct link to the divine and a connection to a
worldwide community of other believers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public prayer addressed to God should always be in the
highest, noblest style and in the most expressive, most
historically continuous language possible,'' says James Patrick,
provost of the College of St. Thomas More in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was speaking specifically about Latin, Patrick's
statement is widely applied. Most of the religions mentioned above
consider their sacred language as one befitting their god(s), if
not the actual language the deities spoke.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Islam, Muslims believe Mohammed received the
revelations from God in Arabic. To Muslims, then, the word of the
Koran IS the word and sound of God, notes Barbara von Schlegell, an
assistant professor of religion at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``The act of reciting the Koran is really the most important
thing a Muslim can do,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Though Arabic is the holy language of the world's 1.2 billion
Muslims, it is the mother tongue of just a fifth of that
population, von Schlegell notes. Yet the vast majority of Muslims
can at least recite passages from the Koran, and children from the
most devout families memorize the entire Scripture (about the
length of the New Testament), down to the length of time to hold
syllables.
</P>
<P>
   For Abdul Majeed of Euless, Texas, learning Arabic came fairly
easily, as his native languages, Urdu and Punjabi, share the Arabic
script. ``Even in government schools in Pakistan, Arabic is taught
to the extent that people can read the Koran,'' says Majeed, a
retired United Nations administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Hebrew, a sister language to Arabic, was the tongue of Moses and
King David, notes Michael Meyer, a professor of Jewish history at
Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. And it is the written language
of the Hebrew Bible, or Torah, portions of which date back 3,000
years.
</P>
<P>
   In about 400 B.C., Aramaic, the language of Jesus, replaced
spoken Hebrew, and Hebrew was relegated to literary use until the
late 19th century when Zionism, the movement to establish a Jewish
state, once again embraced it.
</P>
<P>
   The three main Jewish branches all incorporate Hebrew to varying
degrees during religious services (Orthodox Jews use it almost
exclusively in the synagogue). And Jewish children who pass through
the traditional rite of the bar/bat mitzvah usually recite Hebrew
passages from the Torah in that ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The Hebrew renaissance continues today, partly due, Meyer
believes, to the influence of Israel and partly due to a desire on
the behalf of Jews in the Diaspora to recapture tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense that the language connects you with the
people as a whole and the history of the people,'' says Meyer. ``If
you go into a synagogue anywhere in the world, you will hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the New Testament was originally written in Greek, an
``Old Latin'' translation dates back to the second century, notes
St. Thomas More's Patrick. Catholic rites were conducted
exclusively in Latin until the Second Vatican Council in the '60s,
when Rome gave its member churches the option of worshipping in the
language of their congregants.
</P>
<P>
   Certain prayers are primarily still recited or sung in Latin _
the ``Agnus Dei,'' for instance. But as a result of Vatican II,
Latin has lost some of its clout in the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of Latin in the Catholic Church is that it will
persist, but it will be, for the average Catholic, a minor
engagement and a minor tradition,'' Patrick says.
</P>
<P>
   The sacred languages of eastern religions have played similar
roles in worship. Sanskrit and Pali, like Latin, were originally
elite languages, used by scholarly priests. The lay person wasn't,
and isn't, expected to be able to read and write them. (Unlike
Latin, however, Sanskrit and Pali are the original languages of
their sacred texts, like Arabic).
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanskrit was considered the language of the gods,'' says
Andrew Fort, a Texas Christian University professor specializing in
Asian religions. The word itself means ``pure or perfect,'' he
explains.
</P>
<P>
   And Pali, literally ``texts,'' is still chanted during some
Theravada Buddhist ceremonies, he notes.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter that worshippers have only a vague idea of what
is being said?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there are some messages of religious tradition
that lose something in the translation from the original
language,'' says Richard Turner, an associate professor of religion
at DePaul, ``so that you miss some of the flavor, some of the
intricacies of the revelation.''
</P>
<P>
   But total fluency in a religion's sacred language probably isn't
essential for most of the world's believers. Culling the essence of
a prayer or ritual _ even just hearing it _ can be spiritually
satisfying, too.

   ``What you always knew (during Latin prayers) was that the
priest was talking to God on your behalf,'' Patrick says. ``And it
didn't make so much difference if you didn't understand every word
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kay Read's student, in fact, understanding the Latin liturgy
temporarily distanced her from the religion.
</P>
<P>
   The student had developed her own interpretation of the sounds
she was uttering, and not knowing Latin had allowed her to
personalize her religious experience in a way. ``If you pray in a
language that you don't understand, you can understand it in your
own way,'' Read says.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of (religion) is ritualized, and ritual isn't
necessarily about belief,'' she adds. ``It's about doing, and the
prayer itself is an action and you link with the sacred through
action.''

NEW VIEW OF MOTHERHOOD: MATERNAL STYLES MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By NATALIE ANGIER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody knows what a good mother is. She is a lot like apple
pie: reassuringly firm on the outside, but soft, sweet, warm and
bland within. A good mother gets pleasure from the comfort and
pleasure of others. A good mother gets pleasure from being sliced,
diced and eaten alive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while everybody knows what a good mother is, and everybody
wants one, nobody seems to know where to find her _ and with
reason. That good mother, who gives infinitely and unstintingly,
is, in the phrase of the primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, the
woman that never evolved, nor could have.
</P>
<P>
   Hrdy, of the University of California at Davis, knows a lot
about mothers _ real mothers with their feet on the ground, rather
than earth mothers with their feet on pedestals. She knows about
human mothers across cultures and eras, and she knows about
nonhuman mothers across phyla. She knows about the complexity,
beauty and ferocity of the bond between a mother and her young. She
knows that the bond is not a given, nor is it fixed and clean and
sweet, but instead is a barter, a supple, ever-changing push-me
pull-you negotiation between two individuals who need each other
and are closely related, but who are not clones and so do not
always see eye to eye, or breast to mouth for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hrdy has gathered her insight and research into a book,
``Mother Nature: A History of Mothers, Infants and Natural
Selection,'' published last fall by Pantheon Books. The book, which
took her more than 15 years to complete, is thick, complex,
scholarly and personal. Fastidiously documented and footnoted, yet
nonetheless beautifully and accessibly written, it is the product
of a woman who, before going into science, had considered becoming
a novelist. It is the story of the mother-infant bond told from a
nuanced but distinctly Darwinian perspective, an appraisal of how a
welter of selective forces has shaped maternal behaviors, impulses
and strategies over tens of thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Among its many narrative parries, the book challenges a bedrock
assumption of evolutionary biology, the premise that males of most
species, including humans, vary far more in reproductive success
than do their female counterparts. Some males manage to mate like
Lotharios while others are sexual duds, the theory goes, whereas
females are in such demand that they can mate as much as they need
to and thus end up with more or less the same number of offspring.
With this model of female monotony in mind, mothers have been
viewed as cookie-cutter characters, with scant variation in
maternal methods or maternal success from one female to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Calling this bit of theoretical orthodoxy into question, Hrdy
discusses the growing evidence that the variation in female
reproductive success _ in the ability of females to rear offspring
who themselves reproduce _is far greater than had been suspected.
Motherhood matters, she says, and maternal styles and decisions
matter, and why did it take people so long to see that simple,
profound truth?
</P>
<P>
   Hrdy talks about the extraordinary demands of human mothering.
Most primate mothers can rear their infants on their own, but human
mothers cannot. They need help, and throughout history and
prehistory they have gotten it however and from whomever they can _
from mothers, grandmothers, brothers, aunts, cousins; from one man,
or more than one man.
</P>
<P>
   New research, Hrdy says, has revealed the prevalence of a
practice called partible paternity _ the idea that a baby is a
patchwork quilt of the various men a woman sleeps with during
pregnancy. Found among the traditional peoples of lowland Amazonia,
eastern and southern Africa, New Guinea and elsewhere, partible
paternity and customs like it turn out to be of advantage to women
and their offspring. If a woman's primary husband dies or deserts
her, the other second-tier mates are expected to help protect and
provide for her children. As one young Zambian woman is quoted as
saying: ``Why put all your eggs in one basket?''
</P>
<P>
   Hrdy does not flinch from the brutal side of human motherhood.
As a communal breeder beholden to the assistance of others in
rearing her young, a woman must be a true political animal. She
must be calculating, sometimes ruthlessly so. Hrdy delves into the
subject of infanticide, revealing the practice to be a sorry staple
of humanity's efforts to plan and manage their families.
</P>
<P>
   If a baby is born feeble, or handicapped, or the wrong sex, or
too soon after the last child, the parents may choose to kill,
abandon or neglect it, rather than struggle to rear it against all
odds and thus put their other children's futures at risk. Sometimes
they dropped the child in the river. At other times, they committed
infanticide passively, by depositing the unwanted progeny at a
Dickensian-like orphanage, for example, or shipping it off to a
distant and overburdened wet nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Many cultures postpone until several days or weeks after an
infant's birth official rituals like baptism, circumcision and
naming ceremonies, Hrdy points out, perhaps in recognition that not
every newborn is destined to be reared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I consider this material to be part of what I do
for a living,'' said Dr. Lee Cronk, an evolutionary anthropologist
at Rutgers, ``Sarah presented a huge amount of information on the
history of child abandonment practices with which I wasn't
familiar. It's a terrific book.''
</P>
<P>
   A fifth-generation Texan who retains a trace of twang, Hrdy
(pronounced HUR- dee) is 53, almost six feet tall and strappingly
handsome, yet with limbs and neck just elongated enough to give her
an almost balletic air. She is the daughter of considerable wealth
and prominence _ Dallas banking on the maternal side, Texaco oil on
the patriline _ but she fled from her background as quickly as
possible. ``I wanted out of there,'' she said. ``When I went off to
college at 16, it was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Married to Daniel Hrdy, a infectious disease doctor and farmer
(to whom she dedicates her latest book as ``the wisest choice this
female ever made''), she has three children: Katrinka, a varsity
rower who graduates from Harvard in the spring; another daughter,
Sasha, who will enter Harvard in the fall; and a 13-year-old son,
Niko, named after the great naturalist Niko Tinbergen and the only
one, Hrdy said, ``who shows signs of becoming a naturalist.''

PRESENTING MOM'S NEW DEAL 2000
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A little bit of Monica in his life,
</P>
<P>
   a little bit of Beta Al by his side,
</P>
<P>
   a little bit of Hillary he did need,
</P>
<P>
   a little impeachment, he did see.''
</P>
<P>
   When a beleaguered Bill Clinton saw an instant rise in his
approval rating following last year's State of the Union address, I
had an idea. I called together my two small constituents _ Reps.
Jack and Hadley _ for our first State of the Family speech. I
figured my own approval rating could use a boost, too.
</P>
<P>
   I delivered an inspirational speech on health care, clutter
reform and sibling relations. While I failed to have either Sammy
Sosa or Rosa Parks in the audience, my children were nevertheless
clearly moved by my efforts, interrupting my impassioned prose just
twice to ask for milk.
</P>
<P>
   Based on this record of resounding success, I decided to follow
with a 2000 State of the Family address. Again, Clinton was my
inspiration. His speech this year marked a return to an activist
agenda, an ``era of big government'' that just four years ago he
said was over.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it seems like a time for some ``big parenting,'' as well.
</P>
<P>
   I downloaded his speech, and began cribbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Master Jack, Ms. Hadley, honored pets. We are fortunate to be
alive at this moment in history. Never before has our family
enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and social progress with so
few external threats.''
</P>
<P>
   I paused. Maybe Clinton could get away with a sweeping statement
like that. But I'd have to break it down:
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, I asked that we meet our responsibility to the
tax man by maintaining our fiscal discipline. Thanks largely to the
recent decline in Pokemon popularity, the complete removal of all
Beanie Babies from the market, and our public school's new
mandatory uniform policy, we are finally beginning to follow that
path.
</P>
<P>
   To enhance those positive financial efforts, I am asking you to
embrace my new Friday-night pizza policy. After much analysis, I
have discovered that adding both cheese sticks and bread sticks to
the weekly order to accommodate picky palates has meant a 34.3
percent increase in our bills, and also a 50 percent increase in
the leftovers that sit in the fridge for a week and never get
eaten. From this moment on, only one sort of ``stick'' will be
approved on a weekly basis.
</P>
<P>
   I also ask you to welcome our new ``Birthdays are for Giving''
campaign. In the past, as you know, trips to Noodle Kidoodle to buy
presents for other children's parties have resulted in small
purchases for each of you, too. Last year, a total of $200 was
spent on ``why can't I have something, too'' impulse buys. This
year, the money that would go toward those inane purchases will
instead go into something known as a ``savings account'' that will
one day help to ensure the American Dream for you both. If we stay
on this path, we can make our family debt-free for the first time
since Andrew Jackson was president in 1835. Please, hold your
applause.''
</P>
<P>
   Social progress &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that Hadley did not get the
just-five-easy-payments phonics program advertised on Nickelodeon
that she insisted she needed to learn to read, she has indeed made
progress on that front within the traditional framework of her
overcrowded kindergarten class. I applaud her for recognition of
all initial consonants. Jack, too, is to be commended for his
educational efforts this year. Thanks to the Harry Potter books, he
completed his personal commitment toward the school's Million
Minutes of Reading program without any parental angst. In addition,
his memorization of the complete ``Hamlet'' soliloquy, which
neither parent was able to learn, was an unequivocal highlight of
the year. What does all that mean? That you children are capable of
success, when it is something that interests you. To this end, I
insist that we begin a ``Your Homework is YOUR Homework''
initiative. While some of you may see this as a last-minute effort
on my part to remove myself from this month's overwhelming
fourth-grade Texas history project, I assure you that my goals are
for the greater good. So draw the Alamo on your own and make your
own collage this time. You will be a better person, and our family
will be stronger. That's the spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   External threats &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``To realize the full possibilities of this family, we must
reach beyond our own borders. We have to be at the center of every
vital global network, as a good neighbor. To this end, and to
ensure that the lease on our duplex is not revoked by our landlords
who live next door, I ask you to support my ``Speak Quietly and
Don't Carry a Hula Hoop'' policy. Any child found screaming or
throwing hula hoops or, for that matter, basketballs against the
living room wall on Saturday mornings, shall be required to spend
the rest of the morning in his or her room, contemplating world
peace.
</P>
<P>
   While this passive good neighbor policy shall dictate our
behavior at home, in the face of demonstrated aggression at school
on the behalf of one adversary known as ``the school bully,'' I
shall endorse a new tattle-tale policy. I recognize that
tattle-taling is what prompted the bully to start his ``Make Jack
Eat Dirt'' afterschool program in the first place (Why did you have
to tell the principal about the kid's contraband Pokemon cards,
anyway, Jack?). Nevertheless, should the bully act again, I insist
that you tell me about this when it happens instead of waiting
three months and mentioning it in casual conversation. With this
new policy, I will be able to take immediate parental action.
</P>
<P>
   With a commitment to these goals, I feel sure we can make this
family more liberal _ I mean, livable.
</P>
<P>
   This is big business. This is a big issue. This is big
parenting.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, and now and only now, you may have your milk.''

 &HT;    CHappaqua's abuzz, or is it New Castle?
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. _ The high-powered flash of light emanating from
one of the official vehicles was mercifully brief, but the message
was abundantly clear: Move along.
</P>
<P>
   On a Saturday night in the suburbs seemingly designed for
dropping in on neighbors, a wooden sawhorse, several police cars
and a couple of imposing-looking unmarked vans guarded Old House
Lane.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the car slowing down for a look might have been a
tourist, or a distinguished, longtime resident of this upscale
community located some 35 minutes from Manhattan. No matter. In the
suddenly topsy-turvy world of Chappaqua, the newest residents are
by far the most important, and things are very, very different from
just a few short months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live two roads over from where he lives,'' said Jonas
Curchack, 14. ``And just getting to school when he's here is really
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'' is President Bill Clinton, who comes to this Westchester
County town complete with Secret Service agents, traveling staff
and press, and, of course, his wife. First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton formally announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate from
New York on Sunday, a little over a month after she had begun
moving boxes and furniture into the newly-purchased,
residency-establishing, house at 15 Old House Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left Chappaqua behind Monday as she launched her first
offical campaign swing in upstate New York, telling supporters in
Buffalo, ``We have a lot of work to do, but it will be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of her new hometown may disagree about the fun
part.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the president joined her for their first night
together there, news that the First Couple had purchased the $1.7
million Georgian-style home created such a media and tourist
frenzy, it sometimes threatend to paralyze the town of 17,000
residents and quaint four-way stop sign intersections.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you needed was three big press vans for it to get very
disruptive to people's lives,'' said Linda Peterson, town clerk and
tax receiver for the Town of New Castle. (Like virtually everything
involving the Clintons, even the matter of their new town's name is
complicated. New Castle is the government seat of a 24-square mile
area that also includes the ``hamlets'' of Chappaqua and Millwood.)
</P>
<P>
   In the period since what more than one resident terms the
``invasion'' really began, Chappaqua _ actually, New Castle _ has
reacted in a way that the longtime government servant Clintons
should understand: By enacting legislation. The town has passed one
law prohibiting non-residents of Old House Lane from parking there,
as well as an ordinance requiring police department permission to
conduct demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can demonstrate, but they will have to get a parade
permit,'' said Peterson, adding that the ordinance has already
affected one large gathering completely unrelated to politics or
world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Historical Society has a holiday lighting every year, but
because they had too many people coming, they had to get a permit
from the police,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a public hearing is set for Feb. 22 on yet another
proposed law to turn Old House Lane into a tow-away zone. And this
past Friday _ two days before Mrs. Clinton's splashy candidacy
announcement in nearby Purchase _ U.S. Rep. Sue Kelly, a Republican
whose district includes Chappaqua, introduced federal legislation
that would provide the area's police forces with up to $1 million
to deal with costs associated with the Clintons' move.

 UNDATED: a naturalist.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hrdy first gained recognition as a graduate student at Harvard
in the 1970s for her studies of langur monkeys in Abu, India, in
particular infanticide by males. She described how, when a new male
langur entered a troop, one of his first actions would be to
slaughter the infants of the males he deposed, the sooner to put
the females into estrus and thus to give himself a shot at mating.
She also told of how females would try to protect their young by
quickly and repeatedly mating with the invading male, apparently in
hopes that he would be confused enough to view the existing infants
as his own.
</P>
<P>
   Hrdy's reports of calculated infanticide and counter-infanticide
were greeted with skepticism, or dismissed as the pathological
responses of monkeys to the press of human populations around them.
But since then male infanticide has been observed in many species,
and its importance in shaping male and female behavior alike has
been widely accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her work on infanticide was revolutionary,'' said Dr. Meredith
Small, a primatologist at Cornell. ``Now, we've had 30 years of
hypothesis-testing, and she's right. There aren't many people who
can propose a paradigm shift in their lifetime and watch it
unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   Hrdy also has gained fame for questioning the idea that males
are naturally ardent and females naturally coy, and she has worked
mightily to present the female animal as an active player rather
than a passive one in evolution, an effort delineated in her
landmark 1981 book, ``The Woman That Never Evolved,'' which brought
her popular as well as professional fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother Nature'' continues the effort, as she puts it, to
``raise Darwin's consciousness.'' She upends stereotypes about
maternal instinct and what women ``really'' want. For example, as
Hrdy sees it, a woman's career ambition is not a thing apart from
her nurturing, maternal feelings, or an expression of vestigial
``masculinity,'' or the delusional products of contemporary
feminism, as some have suggested. Instead, ambitiousness can be a
reflection of the fact that, among many species, the more powerful
and politically dominant the individual, the greater is her or his
reproductive success.
</P>
<P>
   Hrdy cites the example of Flo, the famous Gombe chimpanzee
studied by Dr. Jane Goodall. Flo's high social rank not only
allowed her to appropriate enough resources to raise many offspring
to adulthood, but also to found a fief, in which her daughters
remained in their birthplace and inherited their mother's alpha
status, rather than being forced to disperse at puberty, as female
chimpanzees usually are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother chimps like Flo were not simply doting nurturers but
entrepreneurial dynasts as well,'' Hrdy writes. ``A female's quest
for status _ her ambition, if you will _ has become inseparable
from her ability to keep her offspring and grand-offspring alive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These data strongly suggest,'' she adds, ``that generalized
striving for local clout was genetically programmed into the
primate female's psyche during a distant past when status and
motherhood were totally convergent.'' Today, she says, many women
don't know what to do with their zeal to succeed. On the one hand,
they no longer need men to support them, nor will they necessarily
manage to achieve high status and its trappings on their partner's
salary alone. Moreover, many women have noticed that a reliance on
male income in a world of no-fault divorce can leave them and their
children impoverished. And so, in the tradition of Flo, human
mothers today may wish for standing, accomplishment and clout of
their own, which is easier fantasized than realized.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of modern life put women in a bind, Hrdy
argues, ``because jobs, status and resource defense occur in
separate domains from child-rearing.'' Flo could strive for high
rank while keeping her infant by her side; a modern mother cannot.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is not between maternal feelings and ambitiousness,
Hrdy says, but between the needs of a human infant for constant,
attentive, extended care; and the fact that a woman's ambitions
must be played out in workplaces with no tolerance for children.
</P>
<P>
   An infant's needs can be met in day care, Hrdy emphasizes. But
that surrogate care must be far better than what we have managed,
on average, to offer. What we need in our day care centers are
well-paid and highly respected ``allomothers,'' she said, a cadre
of ``as-if'' mothers, who can be either male or female, so long as
they are stable, conscientious and treat the children like their
closest kin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're worrying about global warming, the destruction of the
rain forest, the ozone layer,'' she said. ``Nobody is worrying
about the future of Homo sapiens in terms of day care issues. And
I'm saying we really should. If we care about the future of the
human race, and the future of the planet, this is the place to
start.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, Mother knows best.

<P>
   I was a lousy American and skipped the Super Bowl this year _
the prospect of strolling my empty stomach down empty aisles at the
grocery store was simply too tempting to pass up _ so I missed the
much-talked-about commercial featuring Christopher Reeve.
</P>
<P>
   The ad, set in the future, depicted the actor walking onto a
stage to present awards for research on spinal cord injuries. Some
viewers said the spot offered false hope. Others complained that
the computer-generated image was confusing; they initially thought
the actor, who was paralyzed in a horse-riding accident in 1995,
had somehow been healed.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Nuveen Investments, the ad's sponsor, sounded a bit
flummoxed by the criticism. Nuveen spokesman Chris Allen said the
spot, which urged people to ``invest well,'' was meant ``to inspire
a dialogue on money, to have a new dialogue and get away from
buying bigger boats and bigger cars and think about the impact that
money can have on the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, well, well. Is it too late to give Allen the game ball? I
think it's high time we started a dialogue on money.
</P>
<P>
   My mother taught me when I was a little boy that it's impolite
to point at people, and I suppose there's a corollary somewhere
that says it's impolite to point at people spending their own
money. Lately, though, my finger's been itching.
</P>
<P>
   As we all know by now, we live in an era of unprecedented
economic growth _ 161 months and counting. It's hard not to cheer
that, particularly on the way to the bank. But we also live in an
era of wretched excess, a time when wealth and greed are
back-slapping common sense and decency a little too hard.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump and Steve Forbes are running for president. The TV
event that unites us these days, aside from a football game with
$2.2 million-per-30-second ads, is a game show with a prize of $1
million, hosted by a guy whose regular TV partner used to make
headlines as a sweat-shop entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   We're striking it rich on Internet companies that produce little
and lose wads of cash, yet somehow are deemed valuable. Meanwhile,
charities are scraping for donations at Christmas, and bankruptcy
and debt are hitting record levels.
</P>
<P>
   We're living in a sequel to the Gilded Age, and the gild is
being glopped on several coats at a time. Two recent examples of
gloppery pop to mind.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was a report by the St. Petersburg Times on a house
that basketball star Matt Geiger is building in Pinellas County.
Fla. It's 26,000 square feet, not counting a 4,158-square-foot
guest house. It will be the biggest abode in the county's history,
bigger even than Hulk Hogan's 16,000-square-foot home.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of Geiger's house is $5 million, which sounds rather
economical, considering what it will include _ among other things,
a 270,000-gallon swimming pool with a water slide, three diving
boards and a spa; a fireplace big enough to stand in; an outdoor
kitchen designed by Outback Steakhouse; and at least 12 bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   I know. It's none of my business. Last year, Geiger signed a
six-year contract worth $52 million with the Philadelphia 76ers,
and it's his money to spend as he pleases. For all I know, he's a
wonderful guy who gives to charity, signs autographs for kids, and
helps old ladies cross the street.
</P>
<P>
   But I can't help but wince at the image of an
$8.7-million-a-year, 7-foot-1 guy in basketball shorts building a
fireplace in Florida that's big enough for him to stand in. Could
it be our society's priorities are a little more whacked than
usual?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe ``a little'' is overly generous, judging from another
story I read last week. This one was about Virgin Atlantic's plans
to offer beds to passengers on trans-Atlantic flights. The
round-trip price: $9,000 per person, $18,000 per couple.
</P>
<P>
   Yup, $18,000. Enough to buy a car, send a kid to a state college
for at least a year, or _ I'm guessing _ buy quite a few cords of
firewood for a fireplace you can stand in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to put the romance back into flying,'' explained
Richard Branson, the head of the airline. (Great. Then maybe we can
put the leg room back in coach? Or safety back in the air?)
</P>
<P>
   A dialogue on money, indeed. Perhaps I'm harboring false hopes,
but I think that would be just super.

FOR ASTEROID, ODDS ARE ONE IN A MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Mass.)  (jw) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the fifth time in two years, astronomers have discovered an
asteroid hurtling through space that might collide with the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The projected date of impact is 2022, but the likelihood of
collision is considered slim _ one chance in a million. Astronomers
say additional observations, if acquired, would allow them to
better calculate the orbit of the asteroid and perhaps rule out a
collision, at least in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The asteroid, named 2000 BF19, is about a half mile wide,
relatively small by cosmic standards, and would threatening a
regional disaster on Earth rather than planetwide destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Its discovery was made by astronomers using the Spacewatch
Telescope at the Steward Observatory on Kitt Peak in Arizona. They
spotted the object on Jan. 28 and tracked it until Feb. 3, at which
point an announcement of its existence was made for the
International Astronomical Union by the Minor Planet Center of
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement did not mention the possibility of a collision
but suggested that the asteroid was potentially dangerous and worth
watching. On Monday, the possibility of impact was raised by Benny
J. Peiser, who runs the Cambridge-Conference Network, or CCNET, a
Internet newsletter about astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current impact probability of one in a million can easily
and quickly go up or down,'' Peiser wrote. In all likelihood, the
asteroid will turn out to be no risk, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only further observations can provide us with the information
to assess the potential danger,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Peiser reported that the calculation of the current risk factor
and projected impact date had been done by Andrea Milani, an
astronomer at Pisa University in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted Milani as saying that the object should raise no
alarms. ``Nevertheless,'' Milani added, ``shame on the astronomical
community if we lose this dangerous fellow, which is unfortunately
quite dim and fading.''
</P>
<P>
   The asteroid is expected to pass near the Earth every 11 years,
next in 2011 and again in 2022.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a wide variety of orbits that can fit the
observations,'' said Gareth V. Williams, an astronomer at the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, who wrote the asteroid's
official birth announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people who should be concerned are astronomers who
should be trying to get additional observations,'' Williams said.
``Since the arc of observation is so short, it is highly possible
that any additional observations will be sufficient to reject the
2022 impact solution. However, it is possible that another possible
impact scenario will turn up for a later date.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that in other instances follow-up observations
have let astronomers rule out collisions with the Earth. In one
case observations were too limited to let them do so before the
object disappeared from the world's telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000 BF19, he said, with the asteroid fading fast, a
clarification might take years rather than weeks or days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hefty object,'' Williams said. ``We would not like an
object of this size to hit us.''

 &HT;    Chappaqua's abuzz, or is it New Castle?
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. _ The high-powered flash of light emanating from
one of the official vehicles was mercifully brief, but the message
was abundantly clear: Move along.
</P>
<P>
   On a Saturday night in the suburbs seemingly designed for
dropping in on neighbors, a wooden sawhorse, several police cars
and a couple of imposing-looking unmarked vans guarded Old House
Lane.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the car slowing down for a look might have been a
tourist, or a distinguished, longtime resident of this upscale
community located some 35 minutes from Manhattan. No matter. In the
suddenly topsy-turvy world of Chappaqua, the newest residents are
by far the most important, and things are very, very different from
just a few short months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live two roads over from where he lives,'' said Jonas
Curchack, 14. ``And just getting to school when he's here is really
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'' is President Bill Clinton, who comes to this Westchester
County town complete with Secret Service agents, traveling staff
and press, and, of course, his wife. First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton formally announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate from
New York on Sunday, a little over a month after she had begun
moving boxes and furniture into the newly-purchased,
residency-establishing, house at 15 Old House Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left Chappaqua behind Monday as she launched her first
offical campaign swing in upstate New York, telling supporters in
Buffalo, ``We have a lot of work to do, but it will be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of her new hometown may disagree about the fun
part.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the president joined her for their first night
together there, news that the First Couple had purchased the $1.7
million Georgian-style home created such a media and tourist
frenzy, it sometimes threatend to paralyze the town of 17,000
residents and quaint four-way stop sign intersections.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you needed was three big press vans for it to get very
disruptive to people's lives,'' said Linda Peterson, town clerk and
tax receiver for the Town of New Castle. (Like virtually everything
involving the Clintons, even the matter of their new town's name is
complicated. New Castle is the government seat of a 24-square mile
area that also includes the ``hamlets'' of Chappaqua and Millwood.)
</P>
<P>
   In the period since what more than one resident terms the
``invasion'' really began, Chappaqua _ actually, New Castle _ has
reacted in a way that the longtime government servant Clintons
should understand: By enacting legislation. The town has passed one
law prohibiting non-residents of Old House Lane from parking there,
as well as an ordinance requiring police department permission to
conduct demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can demonstrate, but they will have to get a parade
permit,'' said Peterson, adding that the ordinance has already
affected one large gathering completely unrelated to politics or
world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Historical Society has a holiday lighting every year, but
because they had too many people coming, they had to get a permit
from the police,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a public hearing is set for Feb. 22 on yet another
proposed law to turn Old House Lane into a tow-away zone. And this
past Friday _ two days before Mrs. Clinton's splashy candidacy
announcement in nearby Purchase _ U.S. Rep. Sue Kelly, a Republican
whose district includes Chappaqua, introduced federal legislation
that would provide the area's police forces with up to $1 million
to deal with costs associated with the Clintons' move.
</P>
<P>
   It's all enough to spark plenty of heated discussion _ both on
the streets of Chappaqua and in cyberspace. On New Castle's
official website (www.newcastle-ny.org), residents have been
weighing in on the Clintons since the couple completed their house
purchase in November. For every posting by a ``Paul'' _ ``If
Hillary and Bill really cared about our town, they would make a
public statement asking the press to hold off when it comes to
covering them when they are here'' _ there's one from a ``Larry
B.'' musing, ``I supposed any pride we may have in Chappaqua being
chosen by the First Family must be tempered by the occasional
disruption and crowds.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the new First Residents have plenty of defenders in
Chappaqua, a town of vast lawns edged by low stone walls, SUVs
tooling past deer crossing signs and a small, but thriving downtown
of non-chain stores and no fast-food places.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Starbucks, where the president and White House press
secretary Joe Lockhart popped in this past Sunday morning; just
across Greeley Avenue, a sign still up in a florist's window
welcomed the Clintons, adding, ``Good Luck to the Future Senator.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Union supermarket parking lot has become the new
gathering place for the TV satellite trucks now banned from Old
House Lane. While some residents grumble about not being able to
get in there at times, others admit to being thrilled that Hillary
Clinton has gone in, shopped and stood on line just like one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why isn't it good for us that they're here?'' exulted Richard
Lange, owner of Lange's Little Store, which sits across King Street
from the Grand Union. ``Now, everybody comes here from Europe just
to look at them and us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, but what about all that traffic?
</P>
<P>
   ``Gimme a break!'' Lange chortled. ``There's always traffic!''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some people wonder why the Clintons chose to settle in
suburban, child-centered Chappaqua.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy that they picked this place with all the taxes we
pay for a good school system and their daughter nearly grown,''
said Laura Bays, who recently moved here from Manhattan with her
husband and two young children. ``Plus, most of the women here are
stay-at-home moms.''
</P>
<P>
   Give most everyone here credit, though. They're trying. The
First Lady recently joined the New Castle League of Women Voters,
the New Castle Town Board passed a resolution welcoming the First
Family and groups ranging from the historical society to the
Chappaqua Neighbors Club have sent Mrs. Clinton membership or party
invitations.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, perhaps, the Clintons' property tax check,
signed by the First Lady, has already arrived in Peterson's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is, they have a right to live anywhere,'' Peterson
said of the Clintons. ``Besides, when I go places now and people
ask where I'm from, I say Chappaqua and they laugh. Not in a bad
way. Because now, everyone knows where Chappaqua is.''

INNOCENT MOSCOW MAN IS TERRORIZED FOR BEING A GROZNY NATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Timur Dakhkilgov is a soft-spoken man who toils for
long hours in a gritty dye factory to support his pregnant wife and
two small children. He is also a victim of the Kremlin's war
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of mysterious bombings rocked the Russian capital
in September, Dakhkilgov was publicly identified as the leading
suspect in the case and cast into prison, where he says he was
tortured and warned that his family would be turned over to a
vengeful mob if he did not confess.
</P>
<P>
   His only offense, it turned out, was that he was born in Grozny,
the capital of the breakaway region of Chechnya in southern Russia.
After three long months in jail, he was finally exonerated and
released.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police were not interested in my explanation,'' he said in
an interview last week. ``Their only goal was to get me to tell
them what they wanted to hear, especially after we were shown on
television as terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Dakhkilgov's detention shows one dark aspect of Russia's
struggle against the militants who are still battling Russian
forces from strongholds in the Caucasus mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Four months after explosions devastated apartment houses in
Moscow and other parts of Russia, killing almost 300 people, the
authorities have yet to find the culprits.
</P>
<P>
   While officials still contend that Chechen militants are
responsible, the Federal Security Service, Russia's domestic
intelligence service, said last month that it was investigating 14
suspects, none of them Chechen. There has been speculation in the
Russian press that the security services may have planted the bombs
to build popular support for the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   None of that has eased the anxiety of people from the Caucasus,
who even before the bombings were routinely stopped here for
document checks, forced to pay bribes to corrupt policemen and
apprehended on the slightest suspicion. Even after his release,
Dakhkilgov and his family are uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are praying that nothing worse happens to us or that he is
taken to prison again,'' said Dakhkilgov's wife, Lidiya. ``I am
afraid that our candor will do us more harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall, lean and with a dark complexion, the 32-year-old
Dakhkilgov is Ingush by nationality, with forebears from a region
that borders Chechnya. He is a double victim of the wars in
Chechnya. He and his wife fled their home in Grozny in 1994 after
the first war with the Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Dakhkilgov took his family to Moscow the next year and landed a
job at a dye factory. The job paid 1,200 rubles a month ($43 at
current exchange rates). And with fumes of sulfuric acid and
chemical dyes in the air, the working conditions were rough.
</P>
<P>
   But Dakhkilgov was more apprehensive about life outside the
factory gates. He registered with the Moscow police, a requirement
for all newcomers to the city, and carried proof of his
registration. That did not protect him or his wife from being
harassed by the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you have registered, you are in trouble if you are
stopped,'' Mrs. Dakhkilgov said. ``When they see in your passport
that you used to live in Grozny, blood rushes to their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the trouble, Dakhkilgov decided to avoid commuting and
live in a rundown hostel near the factory. His entire family lives
in a tiny but clean room filled with worn furniture, almost all of
which belongs to the hostel. The only item they own is a secondhand
crib for the baby who is due in April.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The door to their room was recently repaired. The police broke
it down when they began their search in September. It was an
ominous sign of what was to come. The investigative techniques used
by the Moscow police included torture, isolation and threats
against Dakhkilgov's family, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   His ordeal began after an apartment house was leveled in a
explosion on Sept. 8. He was summoned to a local police station,
where he was fingerprinted and photographed.
</P>
<P>
   After a second blast occurred a few days later, Dakhkilgov and
his brother-in-law were arrested and taken to the police station in
the Butovo section of Moscow. The next day Russian television
reported that the terrorists had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Dakhkilgov had an excellent alibi. He was working the night
shift at the factory when the second blast occurred. His neighbors
vouched for his character. But the police were suspicious of the
traces of chemical dyes that were left on his hands from his work
in the factory, speculating that they might be the residue of
bomb-making ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Denied access to a lawyer, he was later transferred to the main
Moscow police station on Petrovka Street. He was there less than a
week, but the police seemed to be intent on forcing a confession
before the federal security officials entered the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put a plastic bag over my head and kept it there until I
began suffocating,'' he said. ``Then they would take it off just
long enough so I could take a couple of breaths and put it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Dakhkilgov was also beaten repeatedly, he said, but what scared
him most were the threats against his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they would take my wife and kids to the blast site
and tell people they are the family of the terrorists,'' he said.
``Imagine what the crowd would do to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dakhkilgov insisted on his innocence and was transferred on
Sept. 22 into the custody of officials from the Federal Security
Service, one of the heirs of the KGB. He was jailed in the
Lefortovo prison. As frightening as the experience was, he said the
treatment in the federal prison was far better than at the hands of
the Moscow police.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators later concluded that the traces of chemicals on
his hands had nothing to do with bomb making. A lawyer was found
who contested the charges. And Dakhkilgov was finally released on
Dec. 10. His brother-in-law was also cleared and freed.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Security service officials later told The Moscow Times they were
satisfied that Dakhkilgov was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Dakhkilgov and his wife said it would be pointless to ask for
compensation or file a protest. They say that they could never win
and that their complaints would simply attract more attention from
the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dakhkilgov and his family leave the neighborhood near the
factory as rarely as possible, going only to the market when
supplies of food run low. Though they are practicing Muslims, they
are too scared to go to a mosque.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what the policemen usually say?'' Mrs. Dakhkilgov
said. ``They say, `We shall send you back to your motherland.' But
where is that motherland, and what did they turn it into?''

FOR SOME SEQUELS, THIRD TIME'S THE CHARM. OTHER NO. 3'S ARE SERIAL
KILLERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For some reason, our society is fascinated by threes. They're
good: The third time's a charm. They're bad: Three on a match means
bad luck. They're ambiguous: Good things and bad things come in
threes; a three-ring circus can be fun, but it can also signify,
say, an incoherent staff meeting. In baseball, it's good to get a
three-base hit, bad to get three strikes. Beginning writers learn
about a ``rule of threes'': when illustrating a point, use three
examples. Whoops, messed that one up.
</P>
<P>
   We are also a society that doesn't know when to quit, which
could explain why a movie that merits a sequel merits two sequels _
and sometimes, more. This is the case with Scream 3, which opened
to generally positive reviews that still classed it as the weakest
entry in the Scream horror-comedy series. Scream 3 will make a
boatload of money, thanks to magazine-cover hype and little
box-office competition last weekend, but as far as quality goes, it
looks like a victim of the law of diminishing returns.
</P>
<P>
   You can only return to the same well so often before it runs
dry, and the strategy of the Batman and Lethal Weapon series _ add
new characters while keeping old ones _ only serves to make for
noisier, more incoherent movies. Scream 3 manages to avoid this.
Although stars Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox
Arquette and Liev Schrieber (a good actor who probably wants to
break this cycle) return, screenwriter Ehren Kruger doesn't
overcrowd his script with new characters and director Wes Craven
brings the movie in at a mere 90 minutes _ a half-hour less than
Scream 2.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't make Scream 3 necessary, but it was probably
inevitable. Francis Ford Coppola, who created 1970s masterpieces
with The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, couldn't leave well
enough alone and tried to bring the saga to completion with 1990's
The Godfather Part III. Edie Falco, as The Sopranos' Carmela
Soprano, summed up Godfather III best: ``What happened there?''
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1990, The Exorcist novelist/screenwriter William Peter
Blatty tried to undo the damage done by 1977's Exorcist II: The
Heretic by taking the reins on another installment, Exorcist III.
Although it wasn't considered an embarrassment, it didn't have the
hair-frying cultural impact of the 1973 original, which was so
frightening that it scared people who didn't even see it.
</P>
<P>
   Not all movie series have succumbed to this. After the
travesties of Grease 2 and Caddyshack II, the minds behind those
films had the good sense to call it quits. And Gremlins 2, the rare
sequel to surpass its original (and make fun of it), was content
with being the last word in that series. Some of the movies below
(we didn't include all series) should have learned from other
sequel bombs; others were better than we had any right to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Die Hard With a Vengeance: After the adrenaline punch of Die
Hard and the meanness of Die Hard 2, this series (with Bruce Willis
as the world's unluckiest cop) began to show signs of self-parody
with this third installment, despite strong support from Samuel L.
Jackson and Jeremy Irons.
</P>
<P>
   Godfather III: Not really as bad as its reputation indicates,
this is still an example of an ordinary movie standing in the
shadow of two classics.
</P>
<P>
   Return of the Jedi: Again, a movie that's only weak in
comparison with its predecessors (Star Wars and The Empire Strikes
Back), marred with a cuteness that would also infect Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.
</P>
<P>
   Friday the 13th Part III: An exception to the rule, this is
arguably the best movie in this disreputable series, although it's
still pretty blah if you can't see it in 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween III: Season of the Witch: This renegade Halloween
movie has nothing to do with the series' villain, Michael Myers.
And nobody should have anything to do with the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: Yet another movie that's not
that bad, this still suffered from a five-year gap between it and
its predecessor, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Beautifully
cast, though, with Sean Connery as Indiana Jones' dad and River
Phoenix as a younger version of Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Lethal Weapon III: The beginning of the decline of this series,
this installment turned a once dark, angry police drama laced with
humor into a glorified Three Stooges comedy with more graphic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Naked Gun 331/3: The formula for this police farce seemed ripe
for burnout, what with its goofy, joke-a-minute humor. That didn't
stop its makers, the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team, from milking the
formula in a bunch of other movies.
</P>
<P>
   National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation: Another exception, this
Chevy Chase vehicle is funnier than anyone had a right to expect,
largely thanks to a persistent, conniving squirrel.
</P>
<P>
   Police Academy III: Look, we're not even going to pretend to
have watched this. We'll cop to watching the original, which was a
funny guilty pleasure, and to No. 2, which wasn't. That should be
enough. And they made seven of these!
</P>
<P>
   Rocky III: The first Rocky was an underdog that proved cliches
aren't always bad, just as long as you put 'em together correctly.
Rocky 2 was a sentimental favorite. Rocky 3 was at least less
gloppy than the next two entries, but aside from introducing the
world to Mr. T, it's pretty ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Star Trek III: The Search for Spock: The common belief about
Star Trek movies is that the even-numbered ones are pretty good,
while the odd-numbered ones are weak. III is actually OK, it just
doesn't hold up to II and IV. Think of it as a good,
extended-length version of the TV show, and it holds up better.

CRITICS SAY `FLO' ADS PROVIDE COVER FOR DRUG COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CARL HULSE   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is a bit shocking to hear someone at an AARP
meeting wish harm upon a nice older lady.
</P>
<P>
   But at the just-concluded national legislative board meeting of
the senior group, council member Ben Cook suggested he and others
would not be unhappy if Flo, star of a television ad campaign on
Medicare drug coverage, ended one of the spots by ``falling into an
open manhole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She is an individual that seniors will not buy,'' said the
AARP leader from Texas about the Golden Girl-style character who
last year warned ``big government'' to stay out of her medicine
cabinet but now wants lawmakers to ``join hands'' for a bipartisan
solution on Medicare prescription insurance.
</P>
<P>
   AARP and others in Washington are also not buying the idea that
Citizens for Better Medicare, the group financing the Flo ads, is
anything more than a way for drug companies and corporate America
to influence the evolving debate over Medicare prescription drug
coverage from behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The name may be Citizens for Better Medicare, but among its
chief members are the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a phony coalition, there is no question about it,'' said
Martin Corry, chief lobbyist for AARP. ``Nobody has any illusions
about who is behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   The group illustrates an increasingly popular approach to
advocacy advertising. Special interests know their message will
pack more punch if it is seen as coming from an independent,
grass-roots source. The result is groups like Citizens for Better
Medicare. Another recent example is Americans for Responsible
Alcohol Access, a group funded by liquor wholesalers fighting
Internet wine sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard sometimes to determine who the people are and
who is funding them,'' said Peter Eisner, an official of the Center
for Public Integrity, a watchdog group that tracks advocacy
campaigns. He said audiences can be easily misled about the agendas
of such groups.
</P>
<P>
   Corry said some people even assume AARP is part of Citizens for
Better Medicare though it differs with the group on how to achieve
a drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the coalition dispute that there is anything
misleading about the multimillion-dollar ad campaign. They said
more than 100,000 people have joined Citizens for Better Medicare
since the advertising effort was first launched last year on
television and in print.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't purport to represent the number of seniors that AARP
does but we do represent a lot of seniors,'' said Tim Ryan,
executive director of the coalition. ``Tens of thousands have
signed up in the last couple of weeks after having seen our ads and
our materials.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Holmer, president of the pharmaceutical trade group,
questioned why anyone would quibble with the new spots, which
promote congressional consensus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think the bipartisan tone of the ads, the interest in
being able to have a solution to this issue, is what we all need to
be able to accomplish,'' he told the AARP audience after Cook's
barb about Flo's hoped-for demise.
</P>
<P>
   But the group wasn't always open to compromise. Last year, when
President Clinton first launched his drug coverage plan, Citizens
for Better Medicare went on the attack with its first Flo ads.
</P>
<P>
   They raised the specter of retirees losing their private drug
coverage and government bureaucrats making decisions about
prescriptions. The industry said it was motivated to start the
campaign by fears that government price controls could cut into
profits needed for research into drug advancements.
</P>
<P>
   Facing criticism for rising drug prices, the industry last month
changed its tone, signaling in public statements and the latest
round of Flo ads that it is willing to work with Washington to
shape drug coverage. It supports a mainly GOP-backed approach that
would extend full drug benefits only to poorer Medicare
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The group won't disclose how much it is spending on the ad
campaign, but it is reported to be as much as $30 million, with ads
running on national cable outlets such as CNN and regional stations
in California, Florida, Texas, Colorado and elsewhere around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is national in scope,'' said Ryan, who until the
coalition was formed was director of advertising at the
pharmaceutical trade group. He attributed AARP's criticism to its
unhappiness at having a competing voice in the drug debate.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the corporate interests, the coalition includes some
conservative senior advocacy groups as well as a few patient and
health care organizations such as the Alliance for Aging Research,
a respected member of Washington's senior advocacy network.
Executive director Dan Perry said the alliance's aim is to make
sure drug research continues apace.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site promoted in the Flo ads, www.bettermedicare.org,
lists the members of the coalition but does not divulge their
respective financial contributions. Holmer said drug companies are
the chief source of money.
</P>
<P>
   As for Flo, he said she draws a positive reaction from seniors
despite the sentiments expressed at the AARP session.
</P>
<P>
   Though the woman playing Flo is a paid professional, Ryan said
she suffers from a hip condition that required her to draw on the
private drug benefits of her husband's retiree health plan, giving
her an appreciation for the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is an actress,'' he said, ``but her story is real.''

ANTI-E.U. FERVOR GROWS IN SWITZERLAND
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Resentment against what is viewed as European Union
meddling in Austrian affairs has given isolationist groups in
Switzerland an unexpected push. After months of trying, opponents
have quickly gathered enough signatures to try to derail
long-planned Swiss ties to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   A petition for a referendum with 70,000 signatures was delivered
on Thursday to the governing council in the capital, Bern,
accompanied by a donkey draped with the European Union flag, a
field of blue with a circle of yellow stars.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of 11 groups, including two right-wing parties, said
they had gathered the bulk of the signatures last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never had a dictator and we don't need to have one now
from Brussels,'' said Flavio Maspoli, an official in a right-wing
party.
</P>
<P>
   The drive for a referendum has been led by Rudolf Keller, a
former member of Parliament who, at the height of the controversy
over Holocaust victims' money in Swiss banks, called for a boycott
of American and Jewish companies. (He later backed down from the
statement.)
</P>
<P>
   As recently as early last month, Keller and his supporters had
attracted only half the number of signatures needed to force a
referendum _ 50,000. And it looked as if the effort had failed.
</P>
<P>
   But a surge in signers from the eastern part of Switzerland,
closest to Austria and considered the most conservative region, has
forced the government to set the voting date for May 21.
</P>
<P>
   Contention over neutral Switzerland's links with neighbors has
been simmering for a decade. In 1992, the country voted against
joining an economic grouping tied to the 15-member European Union,
leaving it a political and economic island in the center of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, views appeared to have shifted in favor of closer
ties, in the face of prodding from the central government and
changing economic realities. Polls now show that two-thirds of
Swiss support closer relations with surrounding countries. But the
referendum will be the first time that sentiment is measured at the
ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, the center-left government was threatened by a
better-than-expected showing by the country's most nationalist
party, the People's Party, led by Christoph Blocher, in elections
held after a series of unflattering disclosures about Switzerland's
actions in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss are quick to say that Blocher's brand of nationalism is
less strident than that of Joerg Haider, who has taken his
far-right Freedom Party into the government in Austria. But the
Austrian situation has drawn adamant commentary here that the
European Union is interfering.
</P>
<P>
   ``To sanction a country solely because of the political
composition of its executive is a serious and unacceptable
precedent,'' Eric Hoesli, editor of a daily in Geneva, Le Temps,
wrote in a front-page editorial on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the European Union here insist that by spurning
Austria the organization has shown that it is not democratic enough
and is too big and bureaucratic for small countries like
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   One organizer of the petition drive, Bernhard Hess, said that
realization caused voters to sign for a referendum that would
decide by a simple majority whether Switzerland should adhere to
bilateral accords with the European Union. The Parliament has
already approved the accords, which are to take effect next year.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiated over four years, they are seen as a steppingstone to
eventual membership. The agreements would ease tough border
controls and immigration rules and eliminate trade barriers. In an
unusual alliance with the conservative groups, Swiss
environmentalists oppose the accords, in part because they would
allow 40-ton trucks on trans-Alpine routes.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the accords, which include many businesses, banks
and unions, see them as crucial for Switzerland to gain access to
the vast European Union market.
</P>
<P>
   Economics Minister Pascal Couchepin pledged to lead the fight to
win approval of the accords, which he maintains would allow
Switzerland to be treated as an equal but would not require the
country to be involved with decisions from Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Taking note of the donkey that delivered the signatures in Bern,
Couchepin said, ``It's necessary to know whether the donkey
represents those seeking the referendum or those fighting it.''

YOUNG, EDUCATED ANGLERS ARE HOOKED ON BASSMASTERS TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., N.C., Ala.)  (jw) 
 By DEL MILLIGAN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ Tim Horton has made a habit of outsmarting bass
when it counts and of finishing high in Bass Anglers Sportsman
Society tournaments. His competitors say he will stay there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good looking, he's intelligent, he's well-spoken. I think
he's going to be one of the superstars of fishing,'' said Shaw
Grigsby of Gainesville, Fla., one of today's superstar bass pros at
age 43.
</P>
<P>
   Horton, a 27-year-old from Spruce Pine, Ala., is one of the new
breed in pro bass fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Horton and North Carolinian Dustin Wilks, 22, are pro bassing's
young guns _ in their 20s, clean-cut, college-educated and driven
to be the best at the sport of their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Increases in prize purses over the last five years provide much
to dream about.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma cattle rancher Darrel Robertson, 49, pocketed
consecutive winner's checks of $250,000 and $600,000 last year for
winning the Wal-Mart FLW Tour championship and then the Ranger
Millennium Tournament in Winter Haven, Fla. Five years ago,
$100,000 was the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   With the inflated prize money and increased sponsor interest,
pro anglers agree that leaders like Grigsby can take home at least
$250,000 per year. And that may be a conservative estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Grigsby won $100,000 in one tournament on Jan. 15 at the Bass
Anglers Sportsman Society's Top 150 circuit at Lake Toho in
Kissimmee. He is on two television shows, and he rakes in
endorsements for everything from baits to bass rigs.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsors are eager to get behind the future of the
sport, making pros like Horton and Wilks hot properties who might
build a name as Grigsby and a select few others have done.
</P>
<P>
   There are a half dozen others among this new breed including
Chad Brauer, 27, who has won on the BASS trail; Michael Iaconelli,
27, a front-runner who graduated summa cum laude from Rowan
University with a degree in advertising and public relations; and
Chris Elliott, a friend of Wilks from North Carolina State
University, who qualified for the Classic at age 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for young pros with marketing degrees,'' said
pro bass angler Art Ferguson, 35, who guides on Lake Okeechobee in
the offseason. ``I wish I'd got my degree.''
</P>
<P>
   The importance of a college diploma is emphasized by this new
breed. They may never have to rely on a sheepskin, but sponsors
want the guys who have one.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Brauer, the all-time leading money-winner on the BASS
trail, insisted that his son, Chad, go to college even though he
wanted to follow in dad's footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``He insisted on trying it, and I told him if he went ahead and
got his college education, I'd be his No. 1 sponsor and back him
until he got his feet on the ground,'' Brauer, 50, said.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for the younger Brauer to win a tournament,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a great future in front of him, as a lot of these
young anglers do,'' Denny Brauer said. ``The sport is growing so
fast it's just neat to see these kids having success.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle-aged men who worked long hours and sacrificed family life
to fish weekends and build their dream on the professional bass
trail are seeing these young guns rise to the pinnacle of the sport
faster than they can reel in a 10-inch bass.
</P>
<P>
   Horton was No. 1 on the elite BASS Top 150 trail going into the
tournament on the Kissimmee Chain Jan. 12-15, and placed 22nd. He
went to Okeechobee for another BASS event the next weekend and tied
for 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Wilks won the points championship on the Eastern Division trail
to qualify for the Bassmasters Classic as a rookie last year _ at
age 21.
</P>
<P>
   Horton and Wilks were certain this was what they wanted to do
before they even realized the value of money.
</P>
<P>
   Horton knew he wanted to be a bass pro when he was in the 10th
grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my second year of college, I started competing locally
and had some success,'' Horton said. ``And it grew to a statewide
deal and it kind of just kept going.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilks first had the dream when he was 12, and fished his first
tournament at 13. He gave up baseball in high school _ because he
didn't want to hurt his casting arm.
</P>
<P>
   Wilks even tailored his college education around a career in
bass fishing with a major in fisheries and wildlife science from
N.C. State.
</P>
<P>
   Horton said his goal at tournaments is to fish as much territory
as possible in the shortest amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to cover a lot of water and find big groups of fish,
instead of learning a pattern and plucking out one or two here and
there,'' Horton said.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have a favorite style. He doesn't concentrate on
sight fishing, like Grigsby, or flippin' like Denny Brauer, or
cranking, like David Fritts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of your younger fishermen learn to be
versatile,'' Horton said. ``I think a lot of the older generation
fishermen are specialists.''
</P>
<P>
   To search as much water as he can, Horton usually employs a
crankbait for starters. Bomber's Fat Free Shad is a favorite. He
prefers ``anything chartreuse'' and insists on an orange belly.
``If it doesn't have it on there, I always paint it on there,'' he
said.

TIPS FOR `FAST FOOD MANNERS MONTH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday, Feb. 9)  
(nk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not a moment too soon, but quite possibly several decades too
late, February has been declared ``Fast Food Manners Month.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not often that you see the words ``fast food'' and
``manners'' used in the same sentence, but the etiquette experts at
At Ease Inc., in Cincinnati, seem to be of the opinion that the two
concepts are not mutually exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us seem to view the fast-food experience in much the
same way we view our careers, namely as something we want to be
done with as quickly and painlessly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   This is the notion from which much bad fast-food etiquette
springs, according to the folks at At Ease.
</P>
<P>
   A common fast-food faux pas (literally: McRib Sandwich), is
ordering food with your eyes locked on the menu behind the cashier.
This is discourteous to the cashiers, even if they happen to be
staring out the window at the time or examining something stuck to
the sole of their shoes.
</P>
<P>
   I agree that making eye-contact with your personal fast-food
server is an important and courteous thing to do during the four or
five seconds that you are interacting, but it is not as easy as it
sounds. For one thing, the huge, illuminated menu is hard to
ignore, featuring as it does plump, colorful food items that bear
no resemblance whatsoever to the flat, gray wads of food-like
substance that your personal fast-food server will plop on your
tray.
</P>
<P>
   One might argue that it is best for all involved in this fraud
to avert our eyes out of sheer embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   I have less of a problem with the second etiquette suggestion,
which is that diners should avoid shoving more than two French
fries into their mouth at the same time or taking such big bites of
their hamburger that their cheeks resemble those of Marlon Brando's
in ``The Godfather.'' This unappetizing spectacle could be avoided
if American fast-food restaurants would adopt the French custom of
the ``baguette,'' a cloth feeding sack that covers the entire face
and clips behind the ears.
</P>
<P>
   These suggestions are fine, as far as they go, but I think the
problem of bad manners at fast-food restaurants goes beyond chewing
ice and inhaling french fries, even when done at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, I think the managers of drive-through restaurants
should invest a dollar and buy some speakers that do not make the
person talking sound like he is choking on a chicken bone. We have
digital televisions, cell phones that can hook up the Internet and
computers that can type what we dictate. Is it so difficult to
design an outdoor loudspeaker that doesn't make every spoken work
sound like it's coming from someone in need of the Heimlich
Maneuver?
</P>
<P>
   Also, while we're on the subject of drive-through sound systems,
would it be possible to turn the volume down a little bit? We can't
understand what you're saying anyway; all you're doing is scaring
us to death. Often this causes us to jump so high in our seats that
we bang our head on the roof, which is not a good way to start the
day, especially if we're holding a cup of hot coffee. Also, if
there were a real emergency, there would be no way for us to know
because the loud, garbled sound of ``Evacuate the area immediately!
The deep-fryer's about to explode!'' sounds very much like ``Good
morning! Would you like to try our Value Meal?''
</P>
<P>
   If the managers of America's many fine fast-food restaurants
agree to this modest and long-overdue investment in speaker
quality, I agree to look directly into the eyes of the person
taking my order, no matter how many tongue-studs or nose-rings he
may be sporting.
</P>
<P>
   I refuse to look at the other customers, though, especially
while they're eating. They're way too disgusting.

CLINTON'S DOMESTIC GOALS BOUNCE BACK IN NEW PROPOSALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BUDGET-CLINTON) 
(js) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The budget unveiled Monday by President Clinton
shows the extraordinary persistence of his domestic policy: In
health care and other social programs, he is pursuing many of the
same goals as in 1993, though often by different means.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is still trying to expand health coverage, still trying
to expand eligibility for food stamps and other nutrition programs,
still trying to increase the Earned-Income Tax Credit, one of the
nation's biggest anti-poverty programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't call him the comeback kid for nothing,'' said
Edward M. Cooney, a special assistant to the secretary of
agriculture, noting how Clinton had pressed on despite setbacks and
detours.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Clinton proposed a big expansion of the food stamp
program under the Agriculture Department, and Congress approved it.
The 1996 welfare law cut food stamp spending, especially benefits
for legal immigrants. Clinton won restoration of some of the cuts
for legal immigrants in 1998, and on Monday he asked Congress to
restore the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, on health policy.
</P>
<P>
   No longer does Clinton try to guarantee health insurance for all
by redesigning the health care system from top to bottom. Rather,
he is proposing more modest steps to insure a dozen different
groups including workers between jobs, people age 55 to 64,
uninsured parents of children eligible for Medicaid, legal
immigrants and low-income women with breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In his new budget request, Clinton proposed to expand plans that
failed in recent years, and he offered to spend more money on those
proposals in the hope that Congress would now accept them.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, for the third year in a row, Clinton proposed to let
people age 55 to 64 buy Medicare coverage. Stung by criticism that
the premiums would be too high, he is now proposing tax credits to
offset 25 percent of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   So too with his prescription drug proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Congress last year balked at Clinton's proposal to have Medicare
cover prescription drugs _ half the annual drug expenses, up to a
maximum federal payment of $2,500 a year. Monday Clinton enlarged
his original proposal, adding coverage for the costs of people with
Medicare coverage who have extraordinarily high prescription drug
expenses. He gave no details of how he would design or finance
coverage for such ``catastrophic'' expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The first bill Clinton signed in 1993 was the Family and Medical
Leave Act. Under that law, people who work for a company with 50 or
more employees are generally entitled to 12 weeks of unpaid leave
to care for newborn children or sick relatives or to tend to
medical problems of their own. But many have a problem: They cannot
afford to take unpaid leave. So Monday Clinton proposed a modest
new initiative to provide financial assistance to those who need
it.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Clinton last year proposed a $1,000 tax credit for
people providing long-term care to relatives with chronic
illnesses. The proposal was well received in Congress, but never
became law. Monday Clinton proposed to triple the amount of the
credit, in the hope of winning more support.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise on the Earned-Income Tax Credit, a refundable credit
available to poor working families. In 1993, Clinton proposed an
expansion of the credit costing $28 billion over five years;
Congress approved $20 billion, providing help to 15 million
low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Clinton proposed a further expansion of the
Earned-Income Tax Credit, providing tax relief to 6.8 million
families at a cost of $2 billion a year.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: An employee who reports to me does not
lie, but he tends to withhold information that I need. When
problems later develop and I ask him if he knew about what was
happening, he tells me that he did, but felt that it was not
important to mention it to me at the time. How do I get him to give
me complete information? H.M.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: This employee is unbelievable, literally. Even if he did
not technically tell a lie and even that is debatable
</P>
<P>
   there is no debating his actions: they were either designed to
deceive, mislead and misrepresent, or he is judgment-challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, once the bond of trust is broken between you and
your employee, everything that he or she says, or in this case does
not say, comes into question. This lack of trust can undercut the
entire working relationship, and will ultimately destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   You should sit down with this employee and walk step-by-step
through a specific situation in which he held back information that
you needed. Show him exactly what he should have said, and let him
know that you need absolute openness in your discussions with him.
If he is unsure as to whether a particular point or issue should be
mentioned, he should err on the side of communicating too much.
</P>
<P>
   He also needs to understand that it is essential for him to
rebuild his credibility in the company. If there are further
situations in which he holds back key information, the truth of the
matter is that the company is not going to hold onto him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An employee who throws a temper tantrum, screams, shoves
boxes out the door, swears, and then walks over to a table and
punches a box would probably be immediately escorted out the door.
But what do you do when the owner of the company does that? P.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: You work for an explosive owner who throws, screams, shoves
and punches, and you wonder what to do in an economy that is
bursting with jobs? It is true that if an employee were engaging in
these types of behaviors, he or she would most likely be escorted
out the door, but when the owner is doing this, perhaps it is time
to escort yourself out the door.
</P>
<P>
   You can certainly approach this individual between storms and
tell him or her about the wide range of costly problems caused by
the outbursts, such as the increases in turnover, dissatisfaction
and accidents, along with decreases in productivity, loyalty and
commitment. However, one meeting is not likely to have much of an
impact on this aspect of the owner's personality. And, obviously,
since this individual is the owner, you cannot appeal to his or her
manager.
</P>
<P>
   A related problem that occurs when an owner acts like a classic
2-year-old is that he or she is sending a message to all of the
employees that such behavior is acceptable. As a result, you will
most likely find other employees, including those in managerial
positions, modeling the tantrums of the owner.
</P>
<P>
   While the company owner may scream, swear, punch and shove boxes
out the door, one day he or she will realize that such actions
shove something more valuable out the door.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ As he struggled to fix a tractor by the side of
the road, Donald Hall underscored why South Carolina is sometimes
called ``Bush country,'' but also why Gov. George W. Bush may be
vulnerable here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to choose one right now,'' said Hall, a telephone
repairman, ``then I reckon it'd be Bush, because he's the only one
I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet when he was pressed on why he favored Bush, Hall simply
paused, shrugged and said, ``I haven't thought about it much.''
Finally he added, ``I like Bush because I like his dad.'' But he
also said that he liked what little he knew about Bush's rival,
Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's got a military background, and I like that about
him,'' he said. ``He ain't had a gravy train all his life, that's
for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving the back roads of South Carolina and talking to ordinary
voters, there were many people like Hall who said they were leaning
to Bush _ but whose support seemed just an inch deep. The weakness
of Bush's base, however broad it may be, could leave a major
opportunity for McCain here in the next key battleground in the
presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   In several days of interviews on a meandering trip across South
Carolina, from the gorgeous beaches of Hilton Head in the southeast
to the hills around Greenville in the northwest, backers of Bush
were often tentative and unexcited. In contrast, supporters of
McCain tended to be more passionate. Often, they loved their man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a TV documentary, and it said McCain was a prisoner of
war in Vietnam, and he could have gotten out because his father was
an admiral,'' said Barbara Culbertson, a grandmother working
part-time at Greenville Technical College. ``That speaks volumes to
me. I'd like to go out and campaign for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time I talk to my mom, I'll ask her about the
election,'' Mrs. Culbertson said. ``I'll encourage her to vote for
McCain. You bet!''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Young, a co-worker in the next room, came out at the mention
of McCain and was even more passionate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't clean up our government, then I think it'll
destroy our nation,'' Young said, praising McCain's proposal to
change the campaign finance system. ``When Bush started, he had $54
million, and I know people didn't give him that money for no reason
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The candidates other than McCain, they always dodge the
questions. Only McCain will answer straight,''
</P>
<P>
   Young said he had sent a $25 contribution to McCain's campaign a
few days ago. Then he and Mrs. Culbertson began to discuss who they
could call to volunteer to campaign for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that many people in South Carolina had not thought
much about the election and had not made up their minds, even among
those who insisted that they always vote and would vote again in
the Feb. 19 primary. Many, it seemed, were inclined toward Bush _
South Carolina generally supported his father, former President
George Bush _ but McCain's sweeping victory in New Hampshire had
made people begin to think of him as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``His name's going around the room more often now,'' said Bill
Greene, a Honda dealer in Hilton Head. ``His win in New Hampshire
opened up a lot of people's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene said he would probably vote for McCain, and he cited many
of the same reasons as other McCain supporters. Rather than
McCain's stance on the issues, what appears to attract voters is an
aura of strength, character and leadership _ and above all his
past. One of the first things to come up in conversation after
conversation is McCain's experience as a prisoner of war in
Vietnam, resisting his captors despite torture and refusing to
return to America before others who had been captured earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've been through what he's been through,'' Greene
paused as he reached for words, ``well, that showed his
fortitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene also praised McCain for speaking honestly, instead of
telling people what they want to hear. Greene and others often came
close to hailing McCain for being ornery and not doing what voters
want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is letting public opinion sway him, but McCain's not like
that,'' Greene said. ``He's his own man. And you want somebody
who's going to do what he says, who, when he says something, is
totally honest with the people.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has less backing from the South Carolina political
establishment than Bush, and he has less money and fewer resources.
This may make it difficult for him to exploit the softness in
Bush's support, and he does not have the time to repeat the
retail-style politicking that worked so well for him in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's reputation as an underfunded maverick seems to be
precisely part of his appeal for many Republicans, and few appeared
troubled by his lack of support among statewide party officials.
Indeed, some said that they had been turned off by Bush's huge war
chest and by the way his campaign seemed heavily scripted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got Bush surrounded by too many advisers,'' complained
E. Bryan McCollum, an insurance broker in Walterboro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, I was all Bush, but now I'm thinking of McCain,''
McCollum added. ``If the election was today, I'd probably go with
Bush, but I'm starting to look at McCain and I like what I see.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw that he was a Vietnam veteran and what he went
through, I had respect for him,'' McCollum said. ``He went through
hell, and still came through with his senses. People say he has a
temper, but you know what? I think we need a guy with a temper in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Several supporters of Bush said that they liked his emphasis on
education and respected what he had accomplished in Texas. But some
voters seemed happy to go along with Bush because everybody else
was _ or so they thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my neighborhood, lots of folks support Bush,'' said Ed
Souls, a computer repairman in Walterboro. ``But I don't know
anybody who supports McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the risks for Bush is that in the next couple of weeks,
as McCain campaigns in South Carolina and gets more attention, he
will win over people like Mike Young, a truck repairman who was
fairly typical of those interviewed. Dressed in green coveralls,
Young stopped in Wolfton to pick up a hot dog for lunch, and he was
taken aback when he was asked about the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been following it a bit,'' he said. ``If it were
today, I'd go with Bush. He's the only one I know anything about.
But I haven't made up my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   What about McCain?
</P>
<P>
   Young shrugged and said, ``I don't know anything about McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   At a construction site near Greenville, dusk was settling over
the hills and a group of tired workers leaned against a truck and
talked about the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Whitt, a big 54-year-old with twinkling eyes, said he
would probably vote for Bush. ``If he's like his daddy, he'll be
better than what we've got now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A co-worker, William Lee, 23, said he, too, was supporting Bush,
but he became puzzled by the talk about Bush's father. Further
conversation had his eyebrows knitted almost in knots, and then
finally he had an epiphany. ``Oh!'' he said. ``You mean it's George
Bush's son who is running this time? It's not President Bush again?
Is that right?''

   &UR; PREVENTION: Cutting the Risk of AIDS in Infants &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In a study of pregnant monkeys and their offspring, researchers
have given the offspring temporary immunity to a form of the AIDS
virus, using a procedure that could offer a more effective way of
blocking HIV transmission during delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Most children who become infected with HIV do not contract it
from the blood of their mothers, but from contact with mucous
membranes before and during delivery. While the drug AZT has been
shown to reduce the odds of such transmission, it is ineffective in
8 percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston
turned to a form of vaccination called passive immunization, in
which already formed antibodies are injected instead of harmless
forms of the virus that teach the body to make its own antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, scientists have isolated and reproduced
antibodies from a tiny group of people who for some reason seem to
have a natural immunity to HIV. In experiments reported in the
February issue of Nature Medicine, Dr. Ruth Ruprecht and colleagues
at Dana-Farber gave four pregnant macaques a combination of three
of these human antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   After delivery, tests showed that the antibodies had made their
way into the fetal bloodstream. The newborns were given a second
dose, then were exposed to a hybrid form of HIV. Eight days later,
they received an antibodies booster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never found the virus in the four babies over six months of
testing,'' Ruprecht said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAUSE &AMP; EFFECT: A Warm Wind and a Bad Headache &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Cold winds cause headaches everywhere. Out in western Canada,
there's a warm winter wind called the Chinook that many blame for
migraines.
</P>
<P>
   A neurologist at the University of Calgary decided it could
present an opportunity to test a new method of figuring out what
mechanisms set off migraines in particular people. A growing body
of literature has identified a number of factors that create a
predisposition for migraines, but what actually sets them off has
been left more to patients' guesses.
</P>
<P>
   Patients at the university's Headache Research Clinic are often
asked to keep written records of their pains, so Dr. W.J. Becker,
the neurologist, compared 75 of these diaries with weather reports,
looking for correlations between a Chinook and severe headaches.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in January in the journal Neurology, he reported
first that the typical patient was a poor judge of trigger
mechanisms. Seventy-nine percent said they thought that Chinooks
caused migraines. But in only 20 percent of the cases did he find
evidence that the two actually coincided.
</P>
<P>
   In that group, the link proved not to be simple. And, they fell
into two distinct camps: those whose headaches began just before a
Chinook arrived and those whose pains rose and fell with the winds.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Richard B. Lipton of the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine noted that the diary approach
could offer a more reliable way to help patients identify their
particular headache causes and in turn help them determine when to
take medicine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONSEQUENCES: When Cold Pills Don't Stop at the Nose &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The American Heart Association has issued a reminder that colds
can be bad for high blood pressure, or at least that many
decongestants can be.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, said Dr. Kathryn A. Taubert, director of the
association's cardiovascular science division, is that most
decongestants go to work by reducing the swelling of inflamed sinus
tissues, but ``don't know that they're just supposed to act on the
nose.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they can constrict blood vessels throughout the
body, raising blood pressure. In other cases, they can interfere
with the working of blood pressure medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Many patients are only moderately aware of this danger, a recent
survey found. The survey showed that while 86 percent of patients
with high blood pressure said they checked the labels of
over-the-counter medicines, half of them reported taking cold or
flu drugs that are not recommended for people with hypertension.
The survey was conducted by Schering-Plough Health Care Products,
which makes a decongestant, CoricidinHBP, that does not constrict
blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Taubert said that peering at drugstore shelves through watery
eyes was not the best way to choose an appropriate cold medicine.
People with high blood pressure ``should talk to their physician
before they get sick,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSCLE GROUPS: A Therapist's Touch on Arthritic Knees &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A twice-a-week, monthlong program of physical therapy and
exercise training significantly reduced pain levels and surgery
rates among patients with arthritic knees, according to a study in
this month's issue of The Annals of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The study, from the Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam
Houston, Texas, put 83 patients, most over 60, into randomized
trials. Half were given physical therapy and training in knee
exercises to be done in the clinic and at home; the other half
received a placebo treatment _ ultrasound too weak to have an
effect.
</P>
<P>
   After eight weeks, those receiving the real treatment had
increased the distance they could walk in six minutes by 6 percent.
Over the year that followed, only 5 percent of the treatment group
needed knee surgery compared with 20 percent of the placebo group.
Members of the treatment group also said the pain was reduced by as
much as 40 percent after only three sessions, wrote the study's
lead author, Col. Gail D. Deyle.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AT RISK: Snow Shoveling Imperils Young Men, Too &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy snow and heart attacks go together like sidewalks and ice,
health officials have long known. But how deep does the snow have
to be for the risk to go up? Not all that deep, a study of winter
deaths in Pennsylvania has found: A combination of just over an
inch of snow and temperatures below 20 degrees caused death rates
from heart attacks to triple among men 35 to 49 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The risks went up for men of all age groups. Even men younger
than 35 faced a significant increase under those conditions,
according to the study, a joint project of epidemiologists from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Pennsylvania
Department of Health. In the study, published late last year in the
American Journal of Epidemiology, mortality records and weather
records were compared to establish relationships between snow and
cold and deaths from heart attack, strokes and respiratory
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Women fared better, the study found. The only significant
increase in death rates from bad winter weather were for women
older than 65, who faced higher risks of fatal respiratory illness
or stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier research has established that prolonged exposure to cold
makes the blood more likely to clot and cause a heart attack or
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hazard, the researchers said, is probably snow
shoveling, which the article labeled ``a traditional male
activity.''

A FLEDGLING PUBLISHER WILL RUSH YELTSIN BOOK INTO PRINT
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than a month after ceding power, Boris Yeltsin is preparing
to publish his memoirs of two tumultuous terms as president of the
Russian republic with a new American publisher that has offered the
enticement of speed rather than an outsize advance.
</P>
<P>
   With a handshake at his villa outside Moscow, Yeltsin, 69,
agreed last month to publish his memoirs, tentatively titled
``Midnight Diaries,'' with the co-writer from his previous two
books, Valentin Yumashev, a former Russian magazine journalist who
was a chief of staff in Yeltsin's administration. The book is
scheduled to appear in stores in October.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was a coup for the 2-year-old publisher PublicAffairs,
which was the only American company considered by Yeltsin's
London-based literary agent, Andrew Nurnberg, who shunned the
traditional ritual of courting the richest publishers for the most
generous advance. In October, Nurnberg approached Peter Osnos, the
publisher of PublicAffairs, with a proposal, and a few months later
Osnos, who is fluent in Russian, was flying to Moscow to meet with
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is of the essence for a memoir of this kind,'' Nurnberg
said. ``This is not going to be a long, portentous philosophical
tract. This is going to be a personal, vivid account told from the
heart about his recent years in office, trials and tribulations,
the disappointments. And that should be published as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? It was Harold Wilson, the British prime minister, who
once said that `a week in politics is a long time.' The publishing
industry has seen to it, regrettably over the years, that if they
leave political memoirs too long in the making the sales are very
much lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Nurnberg and Osnos would not reveal the amount of Yeltsin's
advance, although Nurnberg said it was significant. Nurnberg
retained the power to sell the foreign rights to the book, which
are considered likely to generate more income than Yeltsin would
earn from his American sales.
</P>
<P>
   Osnos, who was a foreign correspondent in the Soviet Union for
The Washington Post before becoming an editor at Random House,
edited Yeltsin's last book, ``The Struggle for Russia,'' which was
published in 1993 by Times Books, then an imprint of Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Osnos left Random House to found PublicAffairs, which
specializes in nonfiction titles that the company can publish
quickly. For example, PublicAffairs produced copies of the Starr
report, about President Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, hours after it became available. It also published a
title by the international financier George Soros after he
abandoned a slower-moving publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin is expected to provide a much more personal account in
this memoir than he did in his previous books, written when he was
constrained by his political positions. The book grows out of
late-night conversations between Yeltsin and Yumashev while he was
in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``He intends to talk about everything, including the allegations
of corruption,'' Osnos said, adding that Yeltsin envisioned a book
that he described as being ``fresh like a great meal so it should
make people want more.''
</P>
<P>
   Osnos said: ``It's very clear that it's not meant to be some
theoretical tract, but a personal account of these first two terms
in Russian democracy. And he clearly wants to tell that story in a
very personal way.''
</P>
<P>
   That means that Yeltsin will also explore the dramas in his
recent political career, from the conflict in Chechnya to his
health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Are these health problems behind the rush to publish Yeltsin's
memoirs? Nurnberg and Osnos said that Yeltsin appears to be
thriving since leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Yeltsin regularly, two or three times a year,'' Nurnberg
said. ``He was doing quite poorly in the autumn, but when I saw him
the other day he literally looked like a man with a weight that had
been lifted from his shoulders. He was energetic, joking all the
while and very, very spirited. His health has been a problem, a
considerable problem.''

 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lately, it has become increasingly clear to scientists that in
the 10,000 years since the last ice age ended, the world's climate
has often served up droughts far surpassing anything seen in the
last 150 years, resulting in some cases in the collapse of entire
ancient civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new study has found that over the last millennium in
equatorial East Africa, decades-long droughts far longer and more
severe than any in recorded weather history have alternated with
periods when rainfall was heavier than today.
</P>
<P>
   The droughts dwarfed any experienced by humans in the 20th
century, including the American Dust Bowl of the 1930s and the
African Sahel drought of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the earlier droughts, some of which lasted as long as
80 years, according to oral traditions cited in the study, famine
ravaged the land, provoking social and political upheaval and
forcing large-scale migrations of people.
</P>
<P>
   Given this pattern of naturally occurring, long-term variability
in precipitation, say the scientists who performed the study, there
is a ``very high probability'' that a devastating dry period,
possibly lasting decades, will visit tropical Africa again in the
next 50 to 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it would affect a human population that has doubled
in the last 25 years and is increasing its use of water even
faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to anticipate that a major catastrophic drought will
happen sooner or later, and we must prepare for such an event,''
said Dr. Dirk Verschuren, a scientist at the University of
Minnesota and the University of Ghent, in Belgium, who headed the
study.
</P>
<P>
   While such a drought would not necessarily be unremitting, he
said, it could result in large-scale crop failures lasting 10 to 15
years at a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The study by Verschuren and Kathleen R. Laird and Professor
Brian F. Cumming of Queens University in Kingston, Ontario,
appeared in a recent issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Natural long-term variations in precipitation, especially dry
periods, have long had a major impact on human societies.
Researchers have linked a 300-year drought starting about 4,200
years ago to the collapse of the world's first great empire, that
of the Akkadians in Mesopotamia.
</P>
<P>
   Drought is also believed responsible for the collapse of several
pre-Inca civilizations in South America, and to have been a major
contributor to the disappearance of the Mayan civilization in
Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 3,500 years, according to one study, drought has
been the rule in what is now California, with some dry periods
lasting as much as two centuries; today's California climate,
despite occasional dry spells, is a relatively wet exception.
</P>
<P>
   Droughts as severe as that of the 1930s Dust Bowl, according to
a recent study by federal scientists, have occurred once or twice a
century over the last 300 to 400 years. And even more severe dry
periods have in the past periodically converted big stretches of
the Great Plains to Sahara-like conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists draw such conclusions on the basis of indirect
evidence, since widespread direct measurements of weather and
climate have been in use only since the mid-19th century.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent African study, Verschuren and two associates
examined clues contained in sediments in Lake Naivasha, Kenya. Over
the centuries, the shallow lake has collected runoff from its
immediate surroundings. In the middle of the lake is a deeper
depression formed by the rim of an ancient volcano. Sediment in the
runoff has been deposited there in such a way that it has been
protected from disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   Verschuren and his colleagues extracted a 20-foot core from the
protected sediments. The strata of sediment preserved in the core
reached back 1,100 years. The scientists analyzed the core for
three types of indicators of wetness and dryness: varying kinds of
soils, the pattern of different species of algae (some thrive in
low, saltier water, others in high, fresher water), and patterns of
different species of tiny insects called midges, which are also
sensitive to salinity.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis enabled the researchers to reconstruct the climatic
history of the region, and all three indicators told the same
story: over the last millenniums, the region has experienced a
constant succession of wetter and drier periods. Most recently,
there were serious droughts in the 1870s, just before Europeans
colonized the region, and in the late 18th and early 19th
centuries. Both of these were much longer and more severe than the
Dust Bowl and the 1970s Sahel drought, which threatened millions
with starvation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the precipitation scale, rainfall was found
to have been significantly higher than today in the 17th and early
18th centuries. This coincides with some of the colder periods of
what was called, in Europe, the little ice age, a five-century span
in which unusual cold afflicted parts of the Northern Hemisphere
from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, one of the major drought periods coincided with a
relatively warm time in Europe, which lasted from about A.D. 1000
to 1270.
</P>
<P>
   The practical question raised by the findings, Verschuren said,
is that of how to plan for the eventuality of a future megadrought
in Africa, where the survival of the populace depends mostly on
rain-fed agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``These emerging agricultural economies all do their best in
trying to feed their populations, but they do so at a major cost of
water use,'' Verschuren said. ``In many cases, there is serious
overexploitation of available water resources.''
</P>
<P>
   In countries where water availability is chancy and directly
dependent on climate, he said, ``you're basically setting yourself
up for a catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to prepare for a coming megadrought, he said, would be
to switch to drought-resistant crops. Another would be to reduce
dependence on irrigation, which requires large quantities of water.
</P>
<P>
   A broader lesson to be drawn from the findings, he said, is that
irrespective of any human impact on the world's climate, there is
great natural variability in rainfall, and this variability may
swamp the effects of any global warming produced by industrial
emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   The average surface temperature of the globe is rising, and the
dominant view among scientists is that it will increase by 2 to 6
degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 if emissions of the greenhouse gases are
not reduced. While attention in the global warming debate has
focused mostly on temperature, many experts say the warming's
effect on precipitation may be more striking.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the absence of any impact by greenhouse gases,
precipitation is often of greater concern than temperature. ``Human
societies suffer much more from declining or irregular water
resources than from changes in temperature,'' Dr. Frank Oldfield,
director of the international Past Global Changes project in Bern,
Switzerland, wrote in a commentary in Nature.
</P>
<P>
   In general, a warmer atmosphere causes more water to evaporate
from the earth's surface. This phenomenon can produce heavier
rains, but it can also make droughts worse. Scientists expect both
of these to happen in the future, but they are at a loss to predict
where and when it will rain less or more.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Verschuren said, the effect of global warming on
rainfall will probably be small in comparison with the natural
variations reported in the new study. Warming in theory could
either exacerbate an African drought or alleviate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even if it does alleviate the problem,'' he said, ``it is
not going to solve it, because the beneficial effects might be
relatively minor compared to the natural variability.''

   Q. I got a brace when I was 7 to correct idiopathic scoliosis.
Is this still the standard practice? Is it true that this problem
is disproportionately common in girls? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Idiopathic scoliosis, a sideways curve of the spine of
unknown cause in adolescence, is now believed to require active
treatment in only about 10 percent of cases, according to ``The
Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy.'' When treatment is called
for, a cast or a device called a Milwaukee brace is widely used.
</P>
<P>
   At least 60 percent to perhaps 80 percent of the cases are in
girls, and girls tend to have worse curves and greater progression.
</P>
<P>
   A review of studies on scoliosis and its treatment, by Dr.
Stuart L. Weinstein of the department of orthopedic surgery of the
University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, found that the Milwaukee
brace, which has been in wide use since the late 1940s, has been
the subject of few long-term studies to evaluate its results.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein also noted that most of the studies did not keep track
of the progression of the curvature, making it uncertain whether
patients with braces would have gotten worse without it.
</P>
<P>
   Bracing tends to stop the curve's progression in 85 percent to
90 percent of patients, but there is wide variation in response,
Weinstein said; most common is a moderate correction while the
brace is worn with slow, steady progression back to the original
curve after its use is tapered off. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   TSABONG, Botswana _ How can you possibly patrol this blazing hot
desert, wondered the British colonialists who once ruled this
sleepy patch of the Kalahari as their police horses dropped dead
from thirst and disease.
</P>
<P>
   The answer came in a letter dated Aug. 30, 1889.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Sir,'' wrote Cecil Rhodes, the British diamond magnate
and founder of Rhodesia, in his graceful script. ``I am willing to
defray the cost of the purchase of twenty camels and the cost of
the engagement of six camel drivers to be employed in the service
of the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, 32 years passed before the camels arrived at the police
station here, but when they did, the officers sang their praises.
Camels, they rhapsodized, live longer than horses. Camels carry
heavier loads than horses. Camels walk longer distances than
horses. And, the clincher, camels drink little water and cheerfully
eat nettles and prickly shrubs, the plants that seemed to grow here
in great abundance.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1959, the allure had begun to fade. And in neatly typed
reports to their commanders, the department's Committee on Police
Camel Corps started delicately suggesting that camels might be a
bit passe, what with the increasing popularity of the motor car and
all.
</P>
<P>
   Which just might explain Lemme Talampe's dour face.
</P>
<P>
   He is the man leading the Tsabong police station into the 2000s,
the station commander who in 1997 inherited a modern red-brick
building, five sport utility vehicles, 50 smartly dressed officers
and, yes, nearly 200 camels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about camels?''
</P>
<P>
   Talampe fell silent as he glumly considered the animals, now
down to 20, that together consume more than $28,000 a year in food,
medicine and training, money that some police officers suspect
might be better put toward cell phones, radios or new Land Rovers.
</P>
<P>
   He pondered and pondered as his sweating junior officers saddled
the grunting, snorting, grimacing camels during a training exercise
in the burning sun. And then he gave up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer a vehicle,'' Talampe said finally. ``With a vehicle,
you can go on patrol and come back the very same day. With a camel,
you have to spend days on patrol. It's a very slow animal. You
don't rush it. Otherwise it gets tired and doesn't move.''
</P>
<P>
   In this tiny outpost of a town, where goats still prance along
the tar road and the only motel lacks a telephone, these living,
breathing relics of another century seem mostly unwanted and
unloved.
</P>
<P>
   The young officers, who occasionally ride camels on patrol, sit
comfortably in the saddle, but openly hanker for the flashier
rides, the sports utility vehicles, which have the added benefit of
air-conditioning _ no small matter in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not comfortable,'' Officer Ditshweu Ditshweu, 27, said
of the camels.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Letsosa Namane, 29, said, ``The first time, I was afraid
to see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the longtime camel trainer, who seemed offended by all the
disparaging talk about his charges, confessed that camels could be
a bit ornery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some can be funny,'' said the trainer, Shabi Dikhakhe, who has
been working with police camels for 16 years. ``They can
deliberately walk into low tree branches to knock you off.''
</P>
<P>
   Talampe, who wears starched white shirts and neatly pressed
trousers, was offended, too, when asked whether he patrolled on a
camel himself. (``You think senior officers ride camels?`` he
asked, astonished.) But he was pleased to discuss a happier topic,
the camel auction that had been planned for last year.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the police department here had nearly 200 camels,
and someone decided that selling them might be a good idea,
especially since the animals are rarely used these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people were interested, so many people!'' Talampe
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some wanted them for commercial use,'' he said. ``Some just
wanted to ride them. They used to telephone from all over, from
even as far as Cape Town.''
</P>
<P>
   But leaders in the local community protested, insisting that the
camels stay here so they could be used to attract tourists for
desert safaris. In the end, most of the camels were transferred to
the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the police brass in the national capital, Gaborone, decided
that the department here should keep 20 camels. Talampe said they
are used mostly when the station runs short of vehicles or to
patrol far off cattle posts, where there are no paved roads, only
sand roads.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the department should have simply gotten rid of
the animals once and for all, the junior officers looked nervously
at Talampe and Talampe looked nervously at them. Finally, after
they all chuckled nervously, Talampe said such sensitive questions
should be referred to national headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The camels themselves, with their big brown eyes and long
eyelashes, seemed totally indifferent to whether they patrolled or
not.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The brands on their rumps _ ``BP'' for Botswana Police _ clearly
identify them as police property, which protects them from theft.
Not that there is any real risk of theft. The government, after
all, is the only big camel owner in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The animals have numbers, not names, which are also branded into
their hides. ``They all look the same to me,'' said Talampe,
although the trainer politely disagreed, noting differences in
their color, facial expressions and teeth.
</P>
<P>
   After the training session was over, Talampe cheerfully left
Camels 237, 239, 287 and 266 to their own devices, relieved to
settle back in his air-conditioned office, where he could dream
about what his police station might have been like if the animals
had all been sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have made a fortune,'' he said wistfully. ``We could
have bought more Land Rovers.''

   Earthlings are so enamored of aliens that 1.6 million of them in
224 countries have recently joined an effort that harnesses home
and office computers to the job of sifting through a few zillion
radio bands to hunt for signs of intelligent life among the stars.
</P>
<P>
   The SETI(AT)home project of the University of California at
Berkeley uses idle computers linked to the Internet to plow through
signals collected by the huge dish at Arecibo, Puerto Rico,
searching for intelligently made radion signals amid the celestial
static. The biggest of all the world's radio telescopes, at 1,000
feet in diameter, it is also the best single antenna for gathering
faint signals.
</P>
<P>
   Through the Internet, the project distributes software that
enables home computer users to help scientists crunch Arecibo data
in what its creators call the world's largest ad hoc supercomputer.
The software works as a screen saver, analyzing data only when
computers are idle. Once the data have been analyzed, a process
that can take days, they are returned to Berkeley for another slice
of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Since May, when the project started, volunteers have donated
165,000 years of computing time to analyzing radio emissions from
outer space.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top performers listed on the website: Sun Microsystems
(287 years of computer time), Intel Performance Labs (199 years),
the Computer Aided Engineering lab at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison (89 years), America Online (71 years), Microsoft
(41 years), Fermi National Laboratory (59 years), Pixar (29 years),
Compaq Telecom Engineering (26 years), A.W. Spence Middle School in
Dallas (25 years), Frank Terhaar in Yonkers, N.Y. (24 years) and
someone named Jean-Luc Picard (six years).
</P>
<P>
   ``So far we don't have any really exciting signals,'' said Dan
Werthimer, the project's chief scientist. ``But it's early in the
game. We've only just begun and Earthlings are pretty primitive in
this field. We're just scratching the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Free hunt software can be downloaded from
www.setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu, which has been done 1.6 million
times, Werthimer said. Among the effort's sponsors are the
Planetary Society, the University of California, Sun Microsystems,
Fuji Film, Paramount Pictures, Intel, the SETI Institute and
private donors.

MYSTERY OF BALL LIGHTNING  
 FOLLOW THAT HONEYBEE  
 A BEE'S EYE-VIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ball lightning is one of nature's odder, and rarer, phenomena.
Few people have seen it, but those who have do not quickly forget
it. It appears in a thunderstorm as a floating luminous sphere,
usually about the size of a honeydew melon, that shines like a
light bulb for 10 seconds or so and then either explodes or fades
from view. Scientists have been at a loss to explain it
satisfactorily.
</P>
<P>
   But two researchers at the University of Canterbury in New
Zealand have come up with a promising new model for the phenomenon.
Essentially, to paraphrase one of Elvis' greatest hits, ball
lightning is just a hunk _ a hunk of burning silicon.
</P>
<P>
   When ordinary lightning strikes the ground, it produces intense
heat. The researchers, writing in Nature, argue that if the soil
has the proper ratio of carbon to silicates, a lightning strike can
produce extremely small particles of silicon and silicon-containing
compounds in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers propose that the particles could then link up
into chains and then into loose fluffy clusters that would float in
the air. Oxygen in the air would eventually cause the silicon
compounds to oxidize, or burn up, and the researchers calculated
that the brightness, duration and color of the glow would match
reported observations. The heat of the ball, they suggest, would
determine whether it fades or explodes.
</P>
<P>
   Although the scientists were able to create chains of tiny
particles by simulating lightning strikes in the laboratory, they
caution that they were unable to recreate the total ball lightning
effect. So their theory remains just that, for now. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOLLOW THAT HONEYBEE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The flight of a honeybee is notoriously difficult to track. Even
the most sharp-eyed researcher cannot follow a bee for more than
100 feet or so.
</P>
<P>
   But bee tracking is now a lot easier, thanks to a radar
technique in which the insect is outfitted with a tiny
antenna-transponder. A signal received by the antenna is sent back
as a harmonic, or multiple of the initial frequency, enabling
researchers to sort out the tiny bee from background echoes.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the University of Illinois have used the technique
to study the orientation flights young bees make to develop their
homing ability.
</P>
<P>
   The radar data, reported in Nature, produced some intriguing
results. Successive trips are of the same duration as earlier ones,
but the bees fly faster, so a larger area is covered. And the bees
rarely fly completely around the hive; they usually explore only
one or two quadrants at a time. All this suggests that the bees
learn the local landscape progressively viewing it from different
positions with each flight. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A BEE'S EYE-VIEW &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The honeybees at the Australian National University in Canberra
do not wear antennas. But they do have to fly into narrow, wooden
tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   That technique was used by researchers to determine how a bee
calculates how far it had to travel to a food source, which the bee
then communicates to others through a ``waggle dance.'' One theory
holds that distance is gauged by the amount of energy consumed;
another holds that it is the movement of ground images in the eyes
that provides the cues.
</P>
<P>
   By using the tunnels, the scientists were able to show that
distance calibration is visual. In the tunnel, which is less than
five inches wide, a bee is far closer to the ``ground'' (in this
case, tunnel walls) than it would be in open air. For a given
distance, the movement of the ground image across the eyes would be
far quicker in the tunnel than in open air (just as, from an
airplane, the ground appears to move faster the lower the plane is
flying).
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, writing in the journal Science, compared how
far the bees thought they had traveled (as measured by the duration
of the waggle dance) to how far they actually traveled, and found
that a flight of about 20 feet in a tunnel seemed, to the bees,
more like 600 feet.

 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is good news on the nutrition front. Nuts _ yes, fatty
nuts _ are back on the menu, even for people on diets to prevent
heart disease or cancer or to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   Packed with nutrients needed to start a new generation of
plants, nuts are increasingly being recognized as powerhouses of
health-promoting substances, especially for people who need to
lower their cholesterol, triglycerides or blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   And despite their high fat content and caloric richness, nuts
and nut products, which provide satiety often missing from fat-free
carbohydrate foods, have been shown to help people adhere to
weight-loss diets and to maintain their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, nuts are loaded with fat, far more than would seem
appropriate for those limiting fat to 30 percent of their calorie
intake. Depending on the type, 72 percent to 90 percent of the
calories in nuts comes from fat. But most of it is unsaturated,
which helps to lower low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol,
which can clog arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Except for walnuts, most of the unsaturated fat in nuts is
monounsaturated, the kind that predominates in canola and olive
oils and in avocados. It is celebrated for its ability to lower
harmful cholesterol without affecting the beneficial
high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol that acts as arterial
Dran-O.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike diets low in fat and high in carbohydrates, a higher-fat
diet that emphasizes monounsaturated fats does not raise blood
levels of triglycerides, another risk factor for heart disease. The
walnut, while somewhat short on monounsaturates, is a good source
of omega-3 fatty acids, the kind of fat in fish that counters the
blood clots that can cause heart attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   To help prevent their fats from becoming rancid, nuts are potent
sources of antioxidants, including vitamin E, which protects
LDL-cholesterol from being oxidized to the form that attaches
itself to blood vessel walls. Two other antioxidants in nuts,
quercetin and campferol, may suppress the growth of cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Most nuts are also fairly good sources of protein, which is why
peanut butter and almond butter are often used as protein foods.
One ounce of peanuts supplies 7.2 grams of protein, nearly as much
as a glass of milk. More important from a health standpoint,
however, may be the fact that the protein in nuts is especially
rich in an amino acid called arginine.
</P>
<P>
   It aids in the body's synthesis of nitric oxide, which causes
blood vessels to widen. This, in turn, would lower blood pressure,
counteract the stiffness of cholesterol-clogged arteries and
perhaps reduce further clogging. Peanuts, almonds, walnuts and
hazelnuts are good sources of arginine.
</P>
<P>
   The cholesterol found in animal foods clogs blood vessels, while
nuts contain plant-based sterols that counter atherosclerosis, the
accumulation of fatty deposits in blood vessels. Phytosterols,
soluble only in fats, are now being used in some commercial
margarines to reduce the risk of heart disease. In animal studies,
phytosterols have also been shown to have anti-cancer properties.
Pistachio nuts are especially rich in phytosterols.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts contain several vitamins and minerals that protect against
heart disease, high blood pressure and stroke, including folate,
which lowers blood levels of homocysteine. Elevated homocysteine
levels can triple the risk of heart attacks. Peanuts are the best
nut sources of folate, followed by hazelnuts and walnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Beneficial minerals in nuts include calcium, magnesium and
potassium, and all protect against high blood pressure. Pistachios
followed by almonds are the richest nut sources of potassium, and
almonds are the best nut source of calcium. Brazil nuts are rich in
selenium, which may prevent prostate cancer. Peanuts contain
resveratrol, the compound in red wine that may protect against
heart disease and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference in London convened last month by Oldways
Preservation and Exchange Trust, a nonprofit organization that
studies and promotes traditional healthful diets, medical
researchers described several large studies linking frequent nut
consumption to better health.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank B. Hu at the Harvard School of Public Health said that
among 86,016 participants in the Nurses' Health Study, fatal and
nonfatal heart attacks were 35 percent less likely to occur among
women who consumed nuts five or more times a week than among women
who rarely ate nuts. An earlier study of 34,192 Seventh-Day
Adventist men and women in California, most of whom are
vegetarians, revealed a 50 percent reduction in coronary risk among
frequent nut eaters.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lawrence Kushi, now at Columbia, reported that in the Iowa
Women's Health Study, women who ate nuts two to four times a week
had less than half the coronary risk of women who almost never ate
nuts. And Dr. Joan Sabate of Loma Linda University in California
showed that among 18 healthy men with normal cholesterol levels,
eating a diet in which 20 percent of the calories came from walnuts
improved cholesterol levels more than the low-fat diet recommended
by the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Another clinical trial by Dr. Gene Spiller, who directs the
Health Research and Studies Center in Los Altos, Calif., showed
that when 27 men and women with high cholesterol ate three ounces
of almonds a day in place of other fat sources, LDL-cholesterol
dropped 12 percent without lowering HDL or raising triglycerides.
</P>
<P>
   And in a new study presented in London by Dr. Penny M.
Kris-Etherton, a nutritionist at Pennsylvania State University, a
diet that provided 36 percent of its calories from fat, mostly from
peanuts and peanut butter, lowered LDL-cholesterol and
triglycerides by more than 10 percent, whereas a standard low-fat
cholesterol-lowering diet raised triglycerides by 15 percent. In
neither the almond nor the peanut study did the participants gain
weight.
</P>
<P>
   But, you say, nuts have long been no-no's on weight-loss diets.
As energy-dense foods, nuts can easily become a source of excess
calories, especially nibbled semiconsciously. However, when nuts
and nut products are included in a calorie-controlled diet, they
may actually improve dieting success.
</P>
<P>
   In a most telling study, Dr. Kathy McManus, who directs clinical
nutrition at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, assigned about
half of 101 obese participants to a standard low-fat
weight-reducing diet in which 20 percent of the calories came from
fat. The others were assigned to a diet in which 35 percent of
calories were from fat, which mainly came from tree nuts, peanuts,
olives and olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Although both groups at first lost about the same amount, after
18 months, only 20 percent of the low-fat group was still on the
diet, whereas 54 percent of the higher-fat group had stuck with it.
The net result: a weight loss of nine pounds in the high fat group
and a gain of more than six pounds in the low-fat group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The participants in the nut-eating group reported that they
did not feel like they were dieting, even though they consumed
controlled portions of food,'' McManus said.
</P>
<P>
   Be Wary of Nut Allergies
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 3 million Americans are allergic to peanuts, tree
nuts or both, experts say. Nut allergies can be life-threatening,
so anyone who develops symptoms, described below, should refrain
and be tested to determine which nuts to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Allergies to peanuts and walnuts are the most common, but any
kind of nut may be the culprit. Since the protein in nuts is the
allergen, pure nut oils are not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms include itchy mouth, hives, tight throat, wheezing,
difficulty breathing, vomiting and diarrhea. In severe cases,
anaphylactic shock and death may occur unless epinephrine is given.
</P>
<P>
   If an infant or child has other food allergies or if allergies
run in the family, experts recommend postponing feeding children
peanuts until after age 3. Also, pregnant women and nursing mothers
who have allergies (or if the father or siblings do) should avoid
peanuts.

<P>
   For women who are facing difficult decisions because they carry
a gene that heightens their risk of breast cancer, doctors have
developed a bracingly rational, cut-to-the chase method of helping
them weigh the pros and cons of various strategies for reducing
risk.
</P>
<P>
   The new method, based on statistics and mathematical modeling,
looks at different options for cancer prevention and gives
approximate answers to one crucial question: How much time will
each option add to a woman's life?
</P>
<P>
   The technique, described last week in The Journal of the
American Medical Association, was devised specifically for women
who have already had breast cancer and have been found to carry
mutations in the genes BRCA1 or BRCA2, which play a role in 5
percent to 10 percent of the 180,000 cases of breast cancer a year
in the United States. The mutations predispose women to both breast
and ovarian cancer, and a woman with a mutation who has already had
cancer in one breast also has a higher than average risk of
developing cancer in the other breast.
</P>
<P>
   The degree of risk varies, but for a young woman with breast
cancer and one of the mutations, the generally accepted lifetime
risk of a second breast cancer can run as high as 65 percent, and
the risk of ovarian cancer can be more than 40 percent. By
contrast, young women with breast cancer but no BRCA mutation have
a 10 percent lifetime risk of cancer in the second breast, and only
a 2 percent risk of ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are difficult issues to discuss,'' said Dr. Deborah
Schrag, first author of the journal article and an oncologist in
the department of epidemiology and statistics at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. ``No one wants to tell
someone who's been hit over the head with one cancer diagnosis,
`Oh, gee, you have to worry about a second cancer.' You don't want
to scare them. On the other hand, you don't necessarily do people a
favor if you don't give them the information they need to take
charge of their health.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difficulty is that the options for women with BRCA
mutations are not appealing. Some women choose to watch and wait,
scheduling frequent examinations and mammograms to be ever on the
lookout for tumors. But that approach cannot prevent breast cancer;
the best it can do is catch the disease early.
</P>
<P>
   Women who want a more active approach can consider removing the
healthy breast, removing the ovaries or taking a five-year course
of the estrogen-blocking drug tamoxifen, which has been proved to
reduce the rate of breast cancer in high-risk women. Or, they can
combine two or even all three of those strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Feelings about the options vary widely. Women who have had
children may be glad to get rid of their ovaries, unlike those
still hoping for families. Many women consider mastectomy too
drastic. Some are wary of medication. Others find watching and
waiting too nerve-wracking.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of their emotional responses, Schrag said, women want
facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come in and say, `I know it's about my personal
preferences, but how do I think about just the objective component
of this?''' Schrag said.
</P>
<P>
   She and her colleagues developed a computer model that included
data from published studies: probabilities of cancer in the second
breast, of ovarian cancer, or of dying from those cancers or from
the original breast cancer. The model also included estimates of
the reduction in cancer incidence and death rates from removing the
breasts or ovaries, or taking tamoxifen, as well as the risks from
taking those measures.
</P>
<P>
   From that information, the model estimated how much a woman
could expect to gain in life expectancy from the various options.
According to the model, those with the lowest risk, logically, gain
the least because they live the longest on their own.
</P>
<P>
   On average, for a 30-year-old woman with a BRCA mutation and an
early-stage breast cancer, tamoxifen would add 0.4 to 1.3 years,
ovary removal 0.2 to 1.8 years and removal of the healthy breast
0.6 to 2.1 years. Having both operations would add 0.8 to 4.2
years, and combining both operations with tamoxifen would add 0.8
to 4.4 years.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the wide range of the estimates is that
different mutations confer different degrees of risk, and so do
early stage cancers, depending on the type of tumor and on how many
lymph nodes the cancer has invaded. Generally, women with early
cancers and the highest-risk mutations stand to gain the most from
preventive strategies.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors cannot always tell how dangerous a particular
mutation is. The clearest evidence is from families in which one
mutation is linked to many cancer cases, but not every patient has
enough relatives for doctors to make that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these estimates can say what will happen to any one
woman,'' Schrag said. ``They're probabilities. My goal is that they
should be used as a catalyst for discussion of this difficult
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every patient finds probabilities useful, she acknowledged.
``For some, it's gobbledygook,'' she said. ``But others feel they
gain a sense of control by knowing every number and estimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrag emphasized that the figures are averages, and that the
gains for an individual woman could be far greater or smaller.
``Let's consider a hypothetical woman,'' she said, suggesting a
woman of 40 with BRCA1 or BRCA2, who has her ovaries removed.
``It's possible she was going to get bad ovarian cancer at 43 and
succumb at 45.'' But, because she had her ovaries removed, she
never got the ovarian cancer and lived to be 75. Therefore her gain
in life expectancy could be 35 years. Her sister has the same
procedure, but even though she had the mutation, she was never
going to get ovarian cancer. She gets zero additional life
expectancy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, she said, many women choose to watch and wait,
take tamoxifen or have their ovaries removed.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Hartmann, an oncologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn., who has studied cancer prevention in high risk women, said
Schrag's model had some great strengths, but also serious
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like is that this broadens our approach,'' Hartmann
said. ``When a young woman comes in with breast cancer, sometimes
our focus is on that breast, and we forget what else she is at risk
for. This incorporates several competing risks that a woman is
facing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the limitation, Hartmann said, is that the model is
hypothetical, based on assumptions, some of which she questioned.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, she cited one assumption: that with watching and
waiting, 80 percent of breast cancers would be caught before they
spread to the lymph nodes, when the odds of cure are high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no evidence that our surveillance strategies are that
good in a young, high-risk population,'' Hartmann said. If in real
life the cancers are detected at a later stage, they have a greater
chance of being fatal, which means that a woman would be more
likely than the model predicts to benefit from taking preventive
measures.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton sent a $1.84 trillion 2001 budget
proposal Monday to Capitol Hill, where congressional Republicans
immediately denounced it as a budget-busting election-year
political manifesto with little chance of passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is dead on arrival,'' said House Budget Committee
Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio. ``It's a fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   His Senate counterpart, Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., was equally dismissive, declaring that Clinton's calls for
increased spending ``would bring back the era of big government
with a vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric set the stage for what promises to be months of
partisan battling over how to deal with budget surpluses variously
projected to range from $800 billion to more than twice that amount
over the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   While presidents get first crack at the budget debate, by
proposing the spending blueprint for the massive federal
government, only the Congress, which is empowered by the
Constitution to levy taxes and approve spending, has the actual
power of the purse.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and his Republican foes have pledged to use
projected budget surpluses to pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   They differ, though, over whether there would be enough money
left over to fund broad tax cuts, as Republicans favor, or
increased spending, as Clinton has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This president has sent to us a 'Let's spend it all budget,'
'' Domenici told reporters during a joint press conference with
Kasich, meant to be the official Republican response to Clinton's
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The House Budget Committee asserted that Clinton's proposals
would set the country on a course that would expand spending by
nearly $1 trillion over the next 10 years, a plan Domenici and
Kasich said would eat up much of the expected surplus.
</P>
<P>
   One spending item drew praise from a prominent Republican
opponent of Clinton, however. Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia praised as a
``victory'' the president's request for $5.4 billion for research,
development and purchase of the F-22 fighter and Pentagon support
for production of at least four C-130J transport aircraft each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has criticized Republican tax cut plans as just about as
costly. He vetoed a plan last summer that would have cut taxes $792
billion over ten years, warning that such reductions would turn the
country back toward policies that resulted in decades of budget
deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget calls for $1.84 trillion in spending during the
fiscal year beginning next October. That would be an increase of
$45 billion, or 2.5 percent, over anticipated spending during the
current year, fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposed $350 billion over 10 years in tax cuts aimed at
helping low-income families build a savings account and pay for
health care, college tuition and child care.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Clinton's proposal, however, lies a plan to
dedicate projected budget surpluses to paying down $3.6 trillion in
publicly held debt by the year 2013.
</P>
<P>
   That, said Clinton, would whittle down to zero the amount of
money the government owes to private banks and investors. Paying
interest on that debt cost taxpayers $230 billion last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the way to an achievement that only a few years ago
would have been
</P>
<P>
   inconceivable,'' Clinton told reporters during a White House
ceremony, ``making America debt-free for the first time since
Andrew Jackson was president in 1835.''
</P>
<P>
   Another $2 trillion in debt is held by government agencies. They
essentially pay interest to each other, so the payments don't
register as a cost to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Kasich said Republicans were considering offering a plan that
would provide ``a lot more debt relief'' than what Clinton has
proposed. He said Republicans would propose doing so, however,
without raising taxes and without the sort of spending hikes
contained in Clinton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This document is a non-starter,'' Kasich said. ``It's not
going to be adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   Domenici went further, calling Clinton's proposal ``a political
document'' designed to ``help some friends of Bill Clinton get
elected to public office.'' this fall.
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton backed the key elements of
Clinton's approach _ using anticipated tax revenues to pay down the
federal debt, giving tax breaks to low-income Americans and shoring
up Social Security _ on Sunday when she announced her candidacy for
the U.S. Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   And Vice President Al Gore has portrayed himself as the
political heir to the heart of Clinton's economic policies in his
own campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton shrugged off the criticism of his foes, clearly
relishing the chance to wind up his presidency by taking credit for
wiping clean a slate of national debt piled up largely under
Republican presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really does matter what you do and what the specifics
are,'' Clinton said in a White House address. ``The new economic
policy, as now we all know, has helped to create a new economy.''
Clinton went on to boast of the country's dazzling economic
performance, mostly on his watch: nearly nine years of growth that
has created almost 21 million new jobs and delivered the lowest
unemployment rate, 4 percent, in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth has been driven by private-sector investment, not
public-sector spending, as was the case in the previous 12 years,''
Clinton said, referring to the periods when Presidents Reagan and
Bush, both Republicans, were in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't mention that Republicans didn't control Congress
during any of those years and, in fact, hadn't controlled both
chambers in a generation until they won majorities in the House and
Senate in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's version of economic history overlooked also the
benefits of a decade of cheap oil following the U.S. victory in the
Persian Gulf war the year before Clinton was elected or the reduced
defense requirements, sometimes called the ``peace dividend,''
following the end of the Cold War and the 1991 collapse of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our progress reflects a number of factors,'' including
economic circumstances and policy decisions, said Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers. ``It's like the blades of a scissors.
Without each of them, we would not have had the progress.''

 &HT;    GOLD-KIST SAYS CHICKEN NUGGETS 'SAFE TO EAT'
 &HT;    By ELLIOT JASPIN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Claiming the public is being ``misled'' by
disgruntled government food safety inspectors, the president of
Gold Kist Inc. released a statement Monday defending the safety of
his company's chicken nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gold Kist poultry products are safe to eat,'' said John
Bekkers, president of the Atlanta-based processor.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department inspectors at two of the company's plants
in Alabama have said that school lunch programs in 31 states were
using chicken nuggets made in part from diseased poultry processed
by Gold Kist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no factual support for their claims and there have
been no incidents of chicken-related illness reported to us or the
USDA,'' Bekkers said. He did not specifically deny the allegations
that diseased poultry was made into chicken nuggets, but called
them ``gross exaggerations.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors themselves said the diseased poultry was unlikely
to make anyone sick. Instead, they said chicken nuggets made from
poultry that had pus, scabs and sores was not wholesome.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Newspapers has also obtained copies of U.S. government
inspection records for a single day last month at Gold Kist's
Guntersville, Ala., plant that appear to contradict Bekkers'
statement. The records show that on that day, inspectors repeatedly
found carcasses with sores, scabs and infections that had
apparently been missed by company employees.
</P>
<P>
   Gold Kist did not respond to repeated requests for an interview
before an article on the chicken nuggets was published last
weekend. In addition, no one at Gold Kist returned repeated
telephone calls Monday to discuss Bekkers' statement, the
allegations of the federal inspectors or the federal records
showing diseased poultry at the Guntersville plant.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Bekkers noted that there is constant sampling
during production and ``that samples are taken from each hour's
production and are eaten by quality assurance employees.'' However,
Bekkers did not disclose the results of either his or the
government's sampling program.
</P>
<P>
   Government logs from Jan. 15 show one sample taken at 4:55 p.m.
found that seven out of 10 birds sampled had serious defects. The
exact nature of the defects was not listed but can include sores
and scabs. Another 10-bird sample taken at 8:30 p.m. turned up six
carcasses with some kind of poultry disease.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors said that about 50 percent of the poultry being
delivered to the Guntersville plant has some kind of disease.
Bekkers' statement did not discuss if the company was having
problems with disease in the flocks being delivered to the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bekkers accused ``union-activist USDA poultry
inspectors'' of making false accusations about the ``quality of
Gold Kist poultry products.'' At the same time, Bekkers cited the
inspections by U.S. Agriculture department as proof there is
nothing wrong with his company's products.

 &HT;    UPS Web subsidiary launched
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Can United Parcel Service Inc. move digital bits as
well as it moves boxes?
</P>
<P>
   That's the challenge the Sandy Springs-based shipper faces in
the launch, announced Monday, of a new Internet subsidiary called
UPS eVentures.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidiary's assignment is to make UPS as big a presence in
electronic commerce as it is now in package delivery.
</P>
<P>
   That means translating the company's expertise in tracking and
logistics into Web-based software that can help other companies
coordinate everything from the purchase of raw materials to the
ordering of paper clips.
</P>
<P>
   ``UPS is looking to help companies virtualize themselves,'' says
Mark Rhoney, president of UPS eVentures. ``We can do everything for
them from execution of delivery to customer care.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, eVentures announced its first new offering, UPS
e-Logistics. The company plans to offer Internet-based software to
electronic commerce companies that help them track inventory, order
supplies and manage every aspect of their business.
</P>
<P>
   But eVenture's initiatives will not be limited to electronic
commerce. ``We plan to offer our services to any company,'' says
Rhoney.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Internet-based services play part of a larger
strategy to leverage off the company's core competency of
delivering packages worldwide. It delivers 12.5 million packages
globally every day. More than 6 percent of the U.S. gross domestic
product is shipped via UPS.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic management of goods and services is a natural for
UPS, according to some company observers. ``UPS is an ideal spot,
given their expertise in managing the delivery of goods for small
and midsize businesses,'' says Peter Coleman, the analyst who
covers the company for Bank America Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rhoney says that, in launching eVentures, UPS is taking
what it has already done for itself and selling that to others.
</P>
<P>
   The company first embraced the Internet in the management of its
business. ``Then we realized that the Internet wasn't just about
our business but enabled global commerce,'' says Rhoney. ``That's
when the Internet became part of a new global strategy for us.''
</P>
<P>
   With eVentures, UPS is entering a business that remains wide
open. That business is called logistics by analysts, and it
generates $1 billion annually in revenue for scores of companies.
</P>
<P>
   Basically these companies try to marshal the Internet to help
companies control costs and manage operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a zillion players out there, but no one has emerged to
provide an end-to-end solution through the Internet,'' says
Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   It is a market, Coleman believes, in which UPS could hold an
advantage. The biggest buyers of third-party logistics software are
small to midsized companies and home offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' says Coleman, ``is UPS' bread and butter.''

</P>
<P>
   TUSTIN, Calif. _ Bill Cunerty, a college teacher and coach in
Southern California, has always had trouble picking
color-coordinated clothes and socks that match. Like many
``colorblind'' people, he tells the color of a traffic light by its
position, not its hue.
</P>
<P>
   But Cunerty has been trying out new glasses that, he says, allow
him to distinguish colors better. ``For me this has been like
watching `The Wizard of Oz,''' he said. ``The first half is in
black and white, and the second half is in color.''
</P>
<P>
   The glasses, made by ColorMax Technologies Inc. of Tustin, were
approved by the Food and Drug Administration in November, becoming
the first lenses specifically authorized for color deficient
vision.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts caution that such lenses do not make people see
colors as people with normal vision do. While the lenses can help
people tell some colors apart, they can make it harder to
distinguish other colors.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency has already warned ColorMax not to exaggerate
its claims for its $700 lenses. The agency says that the technology
is merely a variation of a century-old idea and that the lens
coatings are no different from what is found on some sunglasses
that have that colored mirror look.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven E. Faith, an optometrist in Livermore, Calif., who
has been selling the lenses, said the technology ``definitely
works,'' in that people are able to distinguish colors better. He
and others said the lenses had practical value for certain people,
like electronics workers who need to tell red wires from green ones
but do not care whether the wires look red or green.
</P>
<P>
   True colorblindness is extremely rare. But about 8 percent of
American men and 0.5 percent of women have some deficiency in color
vision, usually difficulty distinguishing red from green.
</P>
<P>
   For many of these people, the problem is so mild that they are
not even aware of it unless they take a color vision test. But
inadequate color vision can block people from being pilots and from
getting jobs in certain areas of law enforcement, the military and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Poor red-green color vision is mainly an inherited condition
controlled by a gene on the X chromosome, which is why it is mainly
in men. (Since women have two X chromosomes, a defective color
vision gene on one will usually be compensated for by a good gene
on the other.)
</P>
<P>
   The eye has three sets of cones that perceive color: one
sensitive to blue light, one to green and one to red. Most colors
are a combination of these, so when a person sees something, the
three types of cones are stimulated by different amounts. The brain
uses this information to determine the color.
</P>
<P>
   In some people with color deficiencies, one set of cones does
not work. But in most cases, the cones work but respond to shades
of red and green that are too close to each other in wavelength,
giving the brain less ability to distinguish between them.
</P>
<P>
   The lenses cannot fix this problem. Rather, they try to change
the color of light entering the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Red lenses, for instance, let in red light but block out most
blue and green light. A green object viewed through a red lens will
appear darker because light from it is not getting to the eye, thus
allowing it to be distinguished from a red object. This allows
someone to pass a color test in which a number is written as a
pattern of green dots on a background of colored dots.
</P>
<P>
   If a person cannot distinguish between, say, an orange and a
greenish yellow, filtering out green will change the appearance of
the greenish yellow while not affecting the orange much, allowing
them to be distinguished.
</P>
<P>
   James Clerk Maxwell, the Scottish physicist, provided red and
green lenses for a colorblind colleague as far back as 1850. For
about the last three decades, some people with color vision
problems have used red tinted contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that by blocking all the blue and green light,
such lenses make it harder to tell blues, greens and violets apart.
The lenses also reduce the overall amount of light coming into the
eye, so, like sunglasses, they are not recommended for use at
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, they make your color vision worse, but they can help
you distinguish certain colors,'' said Dr. Wayne A. Verdon, an
assistant professor of clinical optometry at the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ColorMax says its lenses are more selective in blocking out
light and more tailored to the individual patient's color vision
problem, with 10 varieties available.
</P>
<P>
   The company is guarded about its technology and its origins.
ColorMax is a publicly-traded company but is controlled by Kimrose
Holdings, a privately owned company in Hong Kong. Julie Kim, a
director of the California company and daughter of one of the
Kimrose executives, declined to provide information about Kimrose.
Donald Hansen, ColorMax president, is an optometrist in Iowa, one
of seven in the nation offering the ColorMax lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat similar lenses are being sold in other countries and
are coming to the United States. These include glasses developed by
Coloryte, a Hungarian company with an office in Norcross, Ga., and
the Chromagen contact lens developed in Britain and offered by
Fichte Eye Associates in Amherst, N.Y..
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jay M. Cohen, a professor at the State University of New
York College of Optometry in Manhattan, said many patients ordered
plain pairs of tinted lenses for $20 rather than the ColorMax
lenses for $700. ColorMax is ``a little better, but it's not $700
better,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Other patients, after trying the ColorMax lenses, decide they
would rather stick with the more monochromatic world they are used
to.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The biggest demand comes from people who want certain jobs for
which color vision is required. Danny Molvik, a college student in
Las Vegas, said he wanted to pursue a military career and liked his
ColorMax glasses. ``Everything's more bright, a lot fuller,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The glasses may be of limited use to him: Most organizations
that require color tests, like the Federal Aviation Administration,
do not allow people to use the lenses for the test. They see a
difference between being able to pass the test and having adequate
color vision.
</P>
<P>
   If the newest lenses prove better than the old ones, pressure
could mount to change such restrictions. But so far, people with
color vision problems do not seem to have formed strong groups to
push for access to jobs or to demand that signs, publications and
computer screens be understandable to people with weak color
vision.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lindsay T. Sharpe, a professor of ophthalmology at
University Eye Hospital in Tuebingen, Germany, says that people
have espoused all sorts of unproven treatments for colorblindness,
including cobra venom. Since colorblindness is a genetic problem,
he said, the best long-term hope for a cure is gene therapy. &QL;

HOSPITAL IN BOSTON HALTS GENE THERAPY EXPERIMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times) 
 &HT;    (DW) 
 By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston has
temporarily suspended a gene therapy experiment to permit further
discussion of the issues underlying such work after a young man's
death last year in a similar trial in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Rosenblatt, interim president of the hospital, said
there have been no problems associated with the experiment, which
involved 12 patients with hemophilia. But Rosenblatt said the
climate of uncertainty suggested that ``we should push the pause
button for a time.'' He added: ``We decided to say, let's review
this, we don't have to hurry here. There is no information or
medical or scientific event that is grounds for stopping the trial,
but why not slow things down a bit?''
</P>
<P>
   The suspension follows a decision on Jan. 21 by the Food and
Drug Administration to shut down all gene therapy experiments at
the University of Pennsylvania after an 18-year-old man in a gene
therapy experiment there died. The action by the agency and the
unexpected death of the relatively healthy patient in the Penn
experiment have generated nervousness across the field of gene
therapy. After that incident, members of a committee at the
National Institutes of Health found that scientists were not
routinely reporting problems with gene therapy experiments.
</P>
<P>
   There have been about 300 gene therapy experiments in the United
States over the past decade, experts estimate. Some scientists have
said it was not clear that they were required to report to the
National Institutes of Health committee.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer at Beth Israel, in a different gene therapy
experiment, three of the first six patients enrolled died, and
those deaths were not reported to the NIH. Since that time, said
Rosenblatt, FDA officials who looked at the experiment said the
three deaths were unrelated to the research. The patients enrolled
in the study, as is traditional in early experiments with a
treatment, were the sickest of cancer patients, those not expected
to live for more than a few weeks to a few months in any case.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Mulligan, director of the gene therapy program at
Children's Hospital in Boston and chairman of the Harvard Gene
Therapy Initiative at all the Harvard-affiliated hospitals, said in
a telephone interview Monday that other hospitals have not taken so
cautious an approach, and that in most cases it was not needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This field has developed with a lot of baggage because of the
hype surrounding it,'' Mulligan said. ``It is counted among the
most promising of all areas of medical research because, if it
works as a general matter, there are few human diseases or
disorders that could not use the therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   In principle, the treatment uses healthy genes to counteract the
effects of diseased ones, or fresh genes to produce specially high
levels of disease-fighting chemicals in the body. In the hemophilia
experiment, cells were taken from the patients, and genes to make a
key blood clotting factor were inserted into the cells. They were
then put back into the patients in hopes they would produce the
missing factors.
</P>
<P>
   Mulligan said that while some nervousness has developed in the
field, it is not because there are significant problems with the
research, but rather because one experiment was apparently
conducted badly, and that event was magnified by the failure to
report to NIH.
</P>
<P>
   ``But through it all,'' Mulligan said, ``the field is very much
benefiting from a resetting of the course, from a reduction in
hype, and a return to the appreciation of the core scientific
values, and the realization that the conduct of clinical
experiments can have tragic consequences if people are not careful
to conduct them properly.''

PROMISE AND PERIL OF NEW DRUGS FOR AIDS

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In less than four years, the euphoria over the
success of new drug combinations to treat AIDS has yielded to the
sobering challenge of dealing with the drugs' complications and
failures.
</P>
<P>
   Death rates for what had been an invariably fatal disease have
dropped significantly since the introduction of combinations of
protease inhibitors and other drugs. Many people with HIV, the AIDS
virus, including some who were near death when they began taking
the drug combinations in 1996, continue to lead more or less normal
lives, though they must take a number of pills at specified times
throughout the day, at costs that can exceed $10,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   And a short course of drugs can stop transmission of HIV from a
mother to her newborn, though this important gain is not being
delivered in many countries for lack of money and public health
services.
</P>
<P>
   But the unflagging optimism that AIDS scientists displayed at an
international meeting on AIDS in Vancouver in 1996 was absent at
the Seventh Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections
here from Jan. 30 through Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the infection is spreading through many parts
of the world. Another is that many of the participants at the
conference were doctors who treat infected people for whom the drug
combinations have not worked as well. No one knows for sure how
many they are: Reports range from 30 percent to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A major cause of drug failure is HIV's uncanny knack of mutating
to become resistant to drugs. Thus, the greatest challenges now are
to develop novel classes of anti-HIV drugs and new members of older
classes that are active against resistant virus.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's conference, there were strong hints, from the
very earliest stages of research, that such potent new drugs could
eventually be developed, and experts greeted the reports with
cautious optimism.
</P>
<P>
   But since AIDS was discovered in 1981, there have been few
breakthroughs. And the findings reported here, meeting officials
said, represented incremental progress, not major advances.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies now market 14 anti-HIV drugs and a number of
other drugs for the array of infections that occur as potentially
fatal complications of AIDS. That small arsenal is an indisputable
advance over the early days of the epidemic, when there was no
effective therapy for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The relative abundance of AIDS drugs has created greater need
for expertise in prescribing the vast number of combinations.
Dealing with the complexity of HIV treatment ``is something that
cannot be expected of physicians who don't do it most of the
time,'' said Dr. Robert T. Schooley, a meeting official who is an
AIDS expert at the University of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Many AIDS doctors said they had often been confused about which
anti-HIV drugs to prescribe and when to start them. Many experts
favor beginning treatment almost as soon as HIV is detected, long
before symptoms of AIDS develop. Others favor waiting longer
because of the difficulties in adhering to the rigorous drug
regimens and the growing number of side effects. Additional
confusion can occur if resistance develops and creates a need to
change drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors must now also be alert to an increasingly complex web of
drug interactions. The web can inadvertently increase or weaken the
potency of drugs taken for other conditions, promote development of
resistant viruses, reduce chances of successful long-term therapy
and cause harm in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are learning to tailor therapy for each infected person
by using new tests that detect the genetic patterns of HIV
resistance to various drugs.
</P>
<P>
   They also monitor the amount of HIV in the blood to determine
the effectiveness of therapy.
</P>
<P>
   When combination drug therapy began to drive the amount of virus
to levels below the limits of detection in such tests, many doctors
and others jumped to the conclusion that the virus was not
replicating in the body. A prevailing opinion is that replication
of the virus must be suppressed as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes of the University of Colorado, an
invited speaker at the meeting, said, ``It is easy to get lulled
into a false sense of security that just because you can't measure
something, it is not there.''
</P>
<P>
   That point has become clear in the last year as researchers have
gained compelling evidence that viral replication still occurs,
although slowly, even when tests show no detectable virus. Now a
major question is: Will slow replication have a long-term adverse
effect on what now appears to be successful therapy?
</P>
<P>
   Growing recognition of the hazards of long-term drug therapy has
created another area of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago at this meeting, Dr. David A. Cooper of Sydney,
Australia, first reported that many patients receiving anti-HIV
therapy had developed unusual collections of body fat that created
paunches and buffalo humps on the backs of necks. Then the
complications grew to include metabolic changes like elevations in
cholesterol and triglycerides that could increase the risk of heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the list of long-term complications of anti-HIV
therapy expanded further. Teams headed by Cooper and Dr. William G.
Powderly at Washington University in St. Louis reported that many
infected people had developed thinning of bones from osteoporosis,
which can increase the risk of fractures. Though no one knows how
often drug-related osteoporosis affects HIV-infected people, the
number appears substantial.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fat, metabolic and bone abnormalities is
unclear and controversial. Initially, the problems were linked to
one or more of the protease inhibitor drugs. Now the reports are
conflicting. Some say other AIDS drugs can cause the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Still others contend that the changes result from HIV itself,
the aging process and factors unrelated to drugs. The variety of
abnormalities probably have more than one cause, the participants
said. For now, the abnormalities seem to correlate best with the
length of anti-HIV therapy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The complications have discouraged some people from starting
therapy early in the course of infection. Also, many who experience
the complications want to change drugs in hope of reversing the
effects. But deciding which mid-course correction to make can be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, studies are beginning to determine whether
lipid-lowering drugs known as statins, which lower the amount of
cholesterol and body fats, will reduce the risk of complications.
</P>
<P>
   To Cooper and others, the confusion reflects the price paid for
the Food and Drug Administration's decision to license drugs faster
in response to a public health emergency. Because many AIDS drug
trials lasted less than four months, the complications were not
recognized earlier. The lesson for the future, many participants
said, is to monitor the long-term effects of such drugs more
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   There was general agreement on one point: the need for further
laboratory research, epidemiology and rigorously controlled
clinical studies to better define the complications and find
counter measures.
</P>
<P>
   Since combination drug therapy began, there has been great
concern that taking ``drug holidays'' would increase the risk that
the virus might develop resistance. For many, the concern has
proved real.
</P>
<P>
   But anecdotal reports that a rare individual could stop therapy
and not have HIV return intrigued scientists. A few researchers
began testing a concept that cycles of starting and stopping drug
therapy might strengthen the immune system and help people battle
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard Hirschel's team from the University of Geneva
reported a modest reduction in the replication of HIV after a small
number of participants stopped drug treatment for three cycles. The
participants took combination drug therapy for eight weeks and
stopped for two weeks to test the concept, known as structured
treatment interruption.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patrick Yeni of Bichat Hospital in Paris was among the
speakers who said the preliminary findings from the Swiss and other
continuing studies were inconclusive. ``Obviously we need much more
data before we can recommend such a strategy,'' Yeni said.
</P>
<P>
   Kuritzkes said there had been ``no demonstration to date that
these transient boosts actually have any benefit'' in staving off
development of AIDS or simplifying therapy. ``It is not yet certain
that this is going to be a fruitful strategy,'' Kuritzkes said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, who directs the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the limited available
findings suggested that ``if there will be any success with
interrupted therapy, it will be among those treated within weeks
after they became infected.'' Even in that small group, only a
minority of such people might benefit, Fauci said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he and others say the hope is to identify the
immunological factor that allows such rare individuals to fight off
HIV and to manipulate it into a therapy to benefit those who do not
have it.
</P>
<P>
   Standard anti-HIV drugs are directed at two areas in HIV's life
cycle: the protease and reverse transcriptase enzymes. The drug
action makes it difficult for the virus to replicate.
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers are developing a novel class of anti-HIV drugs
that strikes a different area, blocking the entry of virus into
cells. Twice daily injections of T-20, the first member of this
class known as entry inhibitors, showed that it could work in
people with viruses resistant to other anti-HIV drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary success with T-20, which was developed by
Trimeris Inc. of Durham, N.C., will probably spur a search for
other entry inhibitors that can be taken orally, participants said.
</P>
<P>
   Reports about entry inhibitors were greeted with cautious
enthusiasm because as experimental drugs are tested, researchers
often encounter hazards that delay or stop progress. Some
experimental drugs that showed much promise at last year's meeting
have since fallen by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the point, Merck &AMP; Co., the drug maker,
canceled a report scheduled for this year's closing session because
scientists recently detected unexpected kidney damage in rodents
given one of its experimental protease inhibitors. Human studies of
the drug have been put on hold, a Merck spokeswoman said.

 &HT;    Earthlink Inc. says it nearly doubled its revenues
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Atlanta-based Internet service provider, Earthlink
Inc., said it nearly doubled its revenues in the fourth quarter,
but its loss nearly tripled as the company spent millions on
advertising and marketing and the merger between it and Mindspring.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies reported combined pro-forma earnings Monday.
Their merger was completed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At an analysts' meeting at the Palace Hotel in New York, Chief
Executive Garry Betty said that, for the quarter ending Dec, 31,
1999, the combined company reported a pro-forma loss of $60.8
million, or 55 cents a share, compared with a loss of $21.6
million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding merger
costs, the loss was 22 cents a share in the latest quarter.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose to $199.1 million from $97.8 million a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a good quarter and a very good year for EarthLink,''
Betty said. ``We are executing our vision to be the number one
ISP.'' He defended the expense of intense marketing as part of the
effort to catch up to America Online, which, with 22 million
subscribers, is far and away the nation's largest ISP, but
EarthLink has its sights on closing or at least narrowing that gap.
</P>
<P>
   The new company now has 3.1 million subscribers, including
322,000 new subscribers added during the last quarter. The company
expects to have 4.5 million subscribers by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Original projections called for 5 million subscribers in that
time, but EarthLink president Michael McQuary said the figure was
revised because of stiff competition from the ISP rebate offers
many computer makers are offering (''sign up for three years of ISP
service and get $400 discount on a new computer'') and increasing
consumer demand for high-speed broadband services.
</P>
<P>
   To combat those pressures, EarthLink's plans call for increased
marketing efforts to raise awareness of the compan, as well as to
enlarge its broadband service areas. EarthLink currently offers
high-speed DSL service in some parts of metro Atlanta, as well as
15 cities around the country.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink said it had examined the idea of working with computer
makers to offer rebates in exchange for subscription commitments
but rejected it. McQuary has said that customers who come for a
rebate don't become longterm subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will try to find the best place to optimize our growth,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Betty also said the company's primary growth method would be to
gain new subscribers from what he called the ``switcher'' market _
current Internet users unhappy with their service provider. He said
figures indicate that users shopping for a new ISP are a larger
percent of the ISP market than are new users.
</P>
<P>
   McQuary said high speed Internet access provided by telephone
and cable companies accounted for 40 per cent of ``churn'' or
customers who leave EarthLink for another ISP. He said that only 6
or 7 percent of users who leave go to free ISPs, which don't charge
customers for access but generate revenue from advertising
delivered to users.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink and MindSpring have so far rejected the idea of
offering free access to users. ``It's something we keep an eye
on,'' McQuary said. ``Free ISPs are getting a lot of press right
now. If it makes sense to offer it, we can and we will, but the
economics don't make much sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty added that free ISPs don't offer the customer service and
support that EarthLink is known for. ``We don't get five million
calls to our call centers because people like to call,'' he said.
``They have questions, and we will answer them.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty also outlined the company's four target areas for the
company in the coming year: adding traditional dial-up customers,
increasing its ability to provide high-speed broadband acccess,
adding to its Web hosting business and adding content, commerce and
advertising partners to the EarthLink Web site.

<P>
   Like many journalists who write about science, I have received
what might be called the delta-t lecture from Dr. J. Richard Gott,
a folksy and engaging professor of physics at Princeton. The
lecture, which revolves around survival times, or delta-t's,
explains Gott's theory that the likely future duration of anything,
from the human race to a musical playing on Broadway, can be
predicted. All you need to know is the time that has passed since
the entity in question came into being until the moment when you
asked, ``How long will this last?''
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the lecture, which lasted until the small hours
of a summer night in Princeton in 1996, I asked Gott to predict how
long it might be until the Chicago White Sox won another World
Series, knowing that the last time they had done so was in 1917.
After a quick calculation, he said there was a 95 percent chance
that the following statement was true: The White Sox would not win
a World Series in the following two years, but they would win one
before the year 5077 if the team still existed then.
</P>
<P>
   That was an awfully wide delta-t, even for a Sox fan. And
despite his having published the theory in the journal Nature in
1993, I worried that there might be something amiss in his
reasoning and never wrote about it.
</P>
<P>
   Now I wish that I had. Last July, Timothy Ferris, a science
writer, published a lucid piece in The New Yorker, titled ``How to
Predict Everything: Has the Physicist J. Richard Gott Really Found
a Way?'' The piece was read by Dr. Carlton M. Caves, a longtime New
Yorker subscriber, who also happens to be a physicist studying
information theory and statistics at the University of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Motivated by the article, Caves did a remarkable thing: He wrote
a mathematical rebuttal to the theory, which will be published by a
British academic journal, Contemporary Physics. Although Gott does
not accept many of Caves' conclusions, the new calculation does, at
least, begin to reveal both the practical limitations and the
strengths of a theory that can sometimes appear incomprehensibly
general and hence difficult to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Gott's theory is based on the Copernican principle, which can be
boiled down to his oft-repeated mantra, ``You're not special.'' The
astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus showed that the Earth is not at the
center of the universe, that it occupies no special place, and the
same idea works for more mundane things like addresses or names in
a phone book.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Gott pointed out that neither Caves,
Copernicus, Ferris, Glanz or Gott fell outside the fat 95 percent
of the phone book _ before Anno or after Wilson, say. Gott could
have predicted that that simple fact would probably be true
``without having to go and do extensive research on the size of
phone books all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he extends the Copernican principle to time. Reasoning,
after he visited the Soviet Union in 1977, that he was there not at
a special time but somewhere in the middle 95 percent of its
existence, he could figure out the Soviet Union's likely survival
time from how old it was at that moment, 55 years. It's like
guessing the total thickness of a phone book by counting the pages
backward from a typical name, like Gott.
</P>
<P>
   Simple math shows that the current age divided by 39 (based on
an area of probability of a bell curve) is the shortest likely
survival time, and the age multiplied by 39 is the longest. His
formula predicted that the Soviet Union would endure 17 months to
2,145 years. It fell 14 years later. Humanity itself, he predicts,
is likely to be around from 200,000 to 8 million years longer, but
not indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The formula is extremely useful and maybe the best estimate
you have in cases where your prior information is weak,'' Gott
said. ``The duration of intelligent species is one.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to Caves' calculation, which is based on a
rigorous formalism called Bayesian statistics, it is exactly the
availability of this ``prior,'' or supplemental, information that
makes Gott's theory incorrect in a wide variety of circumstances.
Only if one had no information about the politics, history,
leadership, industrial base and institutions of the Soviet Union
and all other countries would Gott's prediction be anything but a
lucky guess, according to the Bayesian analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put succinctly, he rejects as irrelevant the process of
rational, scientific inquiry, replacing it with a single, universal
rule,'' Caves wrote. ``That has to be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In the paper, Caves highlighted his point by compiling a
notarized list of 24 dogs owned by faculty and staff members and
students in his department at the University of New Mexico. He
selected the six dogs that were more than 10 years old, a procedure
that required prior information, and pointed out that Gott's
formula predicted that each should survive to twice its present age
with a probability of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Then Caves proposed $1,000 bets, at 2-1 odds in Gott's favor,
that each of the six dogs would not survive that long. Gott replied
that his formula would apply to the survival of all 24 dogs, but
that the selected sample was unfairly chosen. ``By the way,'' he
added, ``I just don't do bets.''
</P>
<P>
   Caves replied that ``it is inescapable that he doesn't believe
his own rule in the case of the dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of the White Sox? They have not come close to the World
Series since 1996, fulfilling the first part of Gott's prediction.
But Caves says that ``prior information,'' like knowing the natural
time spans of ballplayers' careers, cycles of ownership and the
changing fortunes of other teams would allow him to predict a
Series victory well before 5077.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the White Sox are wretched for 10 years or 20 years,''
Caves said, ``I think it's a real mistake to assume they'll be
wretched for 3,000 years.''

ATTACKED ON FUNDRAISING, GORE LABELS BRADLEY A QUITTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vice President Al Gore did not respond Monday to Bill
Bradley's call to explain more fully his role in the 1996 White
House fundraising scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he fired back, portraying the former New Jersey senator
as a quitter who left the Senate rather than fight the Republican
right in Congress and who lacks the vision needed to lead the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a labor union hall Monday, Gore also sought to take
a share of credit for the Clinton-Gore economic record, noting he
had cast the tie-breaking vote on Clinton's 1993 budget plan that
some observers say helped revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that you can run for the Democratic nomination
by running down the progress and achievements of the Democratic
Party over the past seven years, because, in fact, our policies
have been good for this counry,'' Gore said in a speech to the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees at the
group's DC-37 headquarters in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was still in the Senate when the budget vote was taken,
_ he did not retire until 1996 _ but it was hard to discern as much
from Gore's description of the timeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he retired from the Senate during President Clinton's
first term, Senator Bradley spoke about what he called a budget
stalemate and a process that was in his words, `paralyzed, a
continual deadlock,' and so he decided to leave,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was wrong. We broke that deadlock. We got over that
paralysis and we brought the progress based on Democratic policies
that have produced this prosperity today,'' Gore said, adding,
``We've got many fights ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore then revived his portrayal of Bradley as a quitter, asking,
``But if Senator Bradley could not foresee the progress that we
made, when we decided to stay and fight against the Gingrich
Republicans, what else does he not see now? How can he be counted
to see what is right for working families today?''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also continued hammering away at Bradley's
plan to provide near-universal health care, calling it
``ill-conceived'' and saying it would hurt New York more than any
other state. ``He talks about big ideas, but on big decisions, he's
made some wrong choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Before speaking to AFSCME supporters Gore held a closed-door
meeting with union leaders from across New York state. Later, he
donned a green hardhat from United Botherhood of Carpeters Local
608 and walked through a site where a 41-story apartment building
is under construction. ``I need your help on March 7,'' he told
workers over and over again. Forty percent of registered voters in
New York are union members.
</P>
<P>
   The primary here could perhaps be one of the most competitive.
Bradley, a former basketball star who used to play for the New York
Knicks and represented New Jersey for 18 years in the Senate, and
is expected to do well here.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, for his part, is counting on a massive effort by organized
labor to get his supporters to the polls. And, after conspicuously
distancing himself from Hillary Rodham Clinton in the state for
months, he is apparently counting on some of her supporters to help
him.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, for the first time, Gore put in a plug for her bid to
the US Senate, telling the predominantly minority audience at
AFSCME, ``Let's join together now to elect Hillary Rodham Clinton
as the next senator from New York.'' AFSCME was the first New York
union to endorse Gore, doing so last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the role of organized labor in this race, Gore said,
``Working men and women are the backbone of this country, and
organized labor is important in the primaries.'' He quickly added,
``But all working families are important in the primaries, and so
I'm working very hard to get the message out.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG SKY, Mont. _ At the very top of a rocky, wind-whipped ridge
above this sprawling ski resort west of Yellowstone National Park
stands a towering grove of ancient whitebark pine trees. They are
one of the few living things that thrive in the harshness at such
altitudes, and they produce a large nut that is rich in fat and
critical to wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   There is mounting concern among biologists and other
researchers, however, that global climate change may be creating
conditions in and around the park that are inhospitable for the
tree. If climate warming is the real, long-term phenomenon that
many experts think it is, scientists believe it could set off a
series of changes that could kill 90 percent or more of the
whitebark pine trees and possibly compromise the future of the
threatened grizzly bear.
</P>
<P>
   The whitebark pine produces cones with pea-size nuts that bears
eat in the fall. ``Of all the vegetable foods in the ecosystem,
whitebark pine is probably the most important,'' said Chuck
Schwartz, leader of Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team, a federal
agency responsible for protection of the bear. ``They are critical
to the fall fattening process to get the bears through the
winter.''
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of the tree illustrate the breadth and
complexity of the problems a warming climate could create for
natural systems. And it underscores the challenges faced by
scientists and parks officials as they try to preserve intricate
ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   The whitebark pine thrives at the top of the Yellowstone
ecosystem, the last tree before the timberline on most of the
mountain ranges in and around the park, in stands of a few acres to
thousands of acres. The cones blossom in the trees' upper reaches
and are fed on by many birds, including Clark's nutcracker, which
take the nuts and each year stash tens of thousands of them in
crevices in the craggy rocks or in the soil less than an inch deep.
Red squirrels, meanwhile, bury nut-laden cones in the duff on the
forest floor, heaps called middens, which concentrate the nuts in
piles large enough to be nutritional for grizzly bears.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of fall, when the bears are voraciously feeding
to build up a store of fat for winter, they travel to the high
country to dig up the squirrel caches. Some experts believe the
nuts are the source of as much as 40 percent of a bear's layer of
winter fat, and research shows they are important for fertility.
</P>
<P>
   Humans have become an integral part of this ecological
relationship between bear and tree. When the nut crop is poor, the
bears search out alternative sources to tide them through the
winter's sleep. Instead of climbing into the high country, they
often head into low-lying areas inhabited by humans, where they
find dog food, beehives full of honey, garbage _ and trouble.
</P>
<P>
   There is a direct correlation between poor nut production and
grizzly bear mortality, experts say. More bears die from ``human
induced'' causes _ for example, being shot _ when there are not
enough nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pine nuts are more than a food,'' said Louisa Wilcox, project
coordinator for the Sierra Club Grizzly Bear Ecosystem Project in
Bozeman, Mont. ``They are a shield for bears against human-caused
mortalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Because nutrition affects reproduction rates, a drop in nut
production can also affect birthrates, lowering the number of new
cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The exact number of bears in Yellowstone is not known, but is
estimated at 200 to 400. So a modest increase in deaths could have
serious effects.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the global warming factor and a disease that affects
whitebark pines called European blister rust. The rust, a fungus
brought over from Europe, was discovered in North America in 1906.
Windborne spores spread through the miles of whitebark pine
forests, through Idaho and into Glacier National Park in
northwestern Montana, where the disease has killed 43 percent of
the whitebark pines, and will probably kill 90 percent of those
remaining. Fortunately for the grizzlies in Glacier, there are
other fall food sources, mainly huckleberries and thimbleberries.
Berries are rare in Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   Blister rust, first noted in the park in 1948, is now present
throughout Yellowstone. Until very recently, the disease was
present at low levels and did not kill trees. The spread of rust is
dependent on moisture. Fogbanks must envelop the trees for 48 hours
for the rust to spread.
</P>
<P>
   Those conditions are common west of the Continental Divide,
where warm, moist air flows inland from the Pacific Ocean. But
those conditions stop as they bump into the wall of the northern
Rockies. The east side of the divide, the Yellowstone side, is
cooler and much drier.
</P>
<P>
   As the earth's temperature rises, the atmosphere can hold more
moisture and becomes wetter as more water evaporates from the
surface. Some scientists say that in general this is happening now,
and research is under way in the park to determine whether it is
happening there.
</P>
<P>
   While that research is not conclusive, blister rust has been
spreading in the southern part of the region in the past few years.
``We've seen increasing heavy infections over the last five
years,'' said Roy Bergstrom, a forester on the Shoshone National
Forest in Wyoming. ``Maybe we have two to three decades before it
really spreads.''
</P>
<P>
   The orange fungus, which girdles the tree and kills branches,
could virtually wipe out the nut crop. Just one in 10,000 trees are
resistant. Because the whitebark pine is not commercially valuable,
the U.S. Forest Service is not spending money for research or
solutions to the rust problem. But some researchers are discussing
a number of possible strategies, all admittedly long shots.
</P>
<P>
   One choice is to do nothing. That is the present strategy of the
National Park Service, which has a natural regulation philosophy
that allows nature to take its course.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the disease spreads over hundreds of years, the tree will
adapt,'' says John Varley, chief scientist for the park. But if the
disease explodes in the next few years ``and it looks like 90
percent of the trees are going to die, it's conceivable we'll dial
up the Forest Service and ask them for disease-resistant trees and
plant them,'' he said. ``The trees are simply too important to this
ecosystem.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing is done and the trees die quickly, it could take 500
to 700 years for the groves to regenerate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is talk of ``genetic bottlenecking'' _ waiting for the
disease to run its course through some stands of whitebark pine in
the southern part of the ecosystem, and then taking pollen from
those that survive and using it to pollinate unaffected trees in
other places. Some scientists are talking about taking pollen from
resistant trees in Glacier or Idaho and doing the same thing.
Another possibility, Bergstrom said, is to burn away areas around
groves where trees have survived to create conditions favored by
Clark's nutcracker for stashing nuts, a kind of natural replanting.
</P>
<P>
   Officials agree they cannot simply let the tree die out and
plant the seeds of the survivors. ``If we wait till they're all
gone, it could take a long time to replace them,'' said Ward
McCaughey, a research forester with the Forest Service in Bozeman.
``It takes 30 years for a tree to produce a cone, and 50 to 80
years to produce a usable crop of nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Should even worst-case situations occur, biologists expect the
bear to survive. ``The bears would not curl up and die,'' Schwartz
said. ``They would find alternative food sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are not as sure. ``If it was just the nuts, they might be
OK,'' Wilcox said. ``But it's not. When you tie in the loss of
habitat from subdivisions, possible oil and gas leasing and other
things, then the long-term survival of the bear is far less
certain.''
</P>
<P>
   As scientists learn more about the complex ecology of species in
and beyond Yellowstone, they learn how much of the equation is well
beyond the control of the managers. For example, another important
grizzly bear food source is the army cutworm moth. The nondescript,
slate-gray moths flock in large numbers to the meadows above the
timberline in the park, where they feed on the nectar of alpine
flowers. They are another critical source of fat for perhaps as
many as a third of the park's grizzly bears, which overturn rocks
to lick up the insects, as many as 40,000 per bear in a single day.
It is possible that the moths could take up some of the slack
caused by a loss of pine nuts.
</P>
<P>
   In their larval stage, however, the cutworms live in wheat
fields on the plains of Montana and perhaps as far afield as
Kansas, where farmers consider them a pernicious pest. It is a
paradox not lost on Schwartz. ``We're monitoring the number of moth
sites and working diligently to understand this critical food
source,'' he said. ``And people are working just as diligently to
eliminate it as a pest.''
</P>
<P>
   A genetically modified seed that created a strain of wheat
resistant to cutworm moths, he said, could do as much damage or
more to the long-term viability of the grizzly as European blister
rust. ``It makes it clear how the bears are tied to everything,''
Wilcox said. ``The ecosystem really has no boundaries.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I am plastered against the side of a large rock, 15
feet above a patch of trampled dirt in Central Park. My fingers are
wedged inside a fissure. My left toe is balanced on a protrusion
about the size of a golf ball and my right toe is balanced on . . .
I don't know what it's balanced on.
</P>
<P>
   Below me my friend, Ivan Greene, the director of climbing at
Chelsea Piers, shouts encouragement. ``Smear your right foot onto
the rock,'' he says helpfully, ``Twist your left hip in, stand up,
and grab that giant knob just above you.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm trying to ``boulder,'' a form of rock climbing that involves
more lateral than vertical movement. Unlike sports climbing, the
type of climbing in which you scale a wall, bouldering involves no
ropes, harnesses or carabiners (hooks that connect climber to
rope). All you need is a pair of climbing shoes with sticky rubber
soles, a bag of chalk to powder your hands for a better grip and a
willingness to fall.
</P>
<P>
   As Ivan explains, there's really nothing to fear. ``You're only
falling from a twist-your-ankle height, not a fall-to-your-death or
even a break-your-leg height,'' he assures me.
</P>
<P>
   The object of bouldering is to ``solve a problem.'' That is,
find a way to get from Point A on the rock to Point B. You do this
by contorting your body into heretofore unimaginable positions and
by perching atop seemingly unperchable chips and minute clusters of
rock crystal.
</P>
<P>
   It requires creative and inconceivable body contortions and, of
course, the smoother the rock, the harder the problem. The
difficulty of a route also depends on the position you start from.
A sitting start is the most difficult because it requires a great
deal of arm strength, balance and skill to pull yourself up and
along. A start that requires jumping up into the first move is a
little easier provided you're connecting with a decent grip and
secure footing. Standing is the easiest and most pleasant way to
begin.
</P>
<P>
   The problem I'm on has a standing start. It is a beginner's
route etched into ``Rat Rock,'' a grouping of boulders near the
southwest corner of the park. Stephen Harris, an instructor at
Chelsea Piers, describes it as a straightforward traverse across a
short expanse of friendly rock.
</P>
<P>
   When I'm on the ground, I believe him. I watch a few experienced
boulderers glide across it like spiders. But when I'm up on the
rock, everything seems to flatten out. One hand space that, from
below, looked big enough to hide a nest of squirrels, requires
holding on with just my fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan instructs me to ``smear'' my feet; he wants me to press the
rubber edges and soles of my shoes as hard as I can into the rock.
This, in theory, would help my feet better stick to the surface of
the stone.
</P>
<P>
   I'm on this problem for about 30 minutes. I make progress but
the spoiler is a move that requires squatting low and stretching my
right leg out until the tip of my toe settles on a group of
molecules that Ivan swears are big enough for me to balance on. I'm
ejected and fall at this point in the problem over and over again.
Stephen, my spotter, is always there to catch me.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, playing on the neighborhood jungle gym was my favorite
pastime. Bouldering is like a grown up version of the jungle gym.
It combines all the fun of using your body to solve a puzzle with
the grown up benefits of building stamina, strength, balance and
coordination. All this and not a treadmill or a weight machine in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   I also like that boulderers call each other ``dude'' _ even the
women _ and that they wear baggy pants with drawstrings and rip
cords sprouting from the pockets and waistbands. After a 10-minute
burst of intense activity, they relax. It's a refreshing change
from the spandex and headphone culture of the gym I've exercised in
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Since my Rat Rock session, I've been sharpening my skills at
Chelsea Piers, a large sports and recreation center on West Side
Highway at 23rd Street. The Piers has a decent artificial
bouldering wall made of a hard gray plastic material fashioned to
simulate stone; it's dotted with colored holds that define the
various routes and problems.
</P>
<P>
   With about three months of bouldering under my belt, I'm seeing
definite changes in my body: My shoulders and arms are slightly
bigger and more defined. My back is broader; some of my blouses are
a bit tight. My legs are stronger and more flexible. I was feeling
pretty good about myself until the other day when my husband looked
at my calloused palms and ragged cuticles and told me that I now
have ``man hands.''

RUSSIANS SEEK TO QUESTION MISSING JOURNALIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The mystery over the fate of Radio Liberty's missing
war correspondent, Andrei Babitsky, deepened Monday when Russian
prosecutors said he was wanted for questioning on suspicion of
joining separatist rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Just days earlier the Kremlin had said that Russian military
officials, who had been holding Babitsky, had turned him over to
Chechen rebels in exchange for Russian prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Sergei Prokopov, a spokesman for the Russian
prosecutor, said Babitsky would be arrested if he did not show up
for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky, 35, a reporter for the US-funded Radio Liberty,
disappeared on Jan. 15 after leaving Chechnya's capital Grozny,
where he was covering Russia's war against separatist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Widely respected by colleagues for his hard-hitting reporting
and unwillingness to yield to Kremlin pressure, Babitsky appears to
have gotten caught in a conflict between the truth about Russia's
war in Chechnya and what Moscow wants the public to know.
</P>
<P>
   His withering reports from the war zone have contradicted the
Kremlin's official statements and infuriated military officials.
Many in Moscow say that Babitsky has become the target of a Kremlin
campaign to control information, intimidate the media and whitewash
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Panfilov of the Glasnost Defense Fund, a Moscow-based
free-speech advocacy group, said the Kremlin was moving toward a
crackdown on the media and was making an example of Babitsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a long-standing battle between the security
services and journalists there. Only now has the game become
dangerous,'' the daily newspaper Izvestia wrote last week.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to understand why the Russian military might want to
silence Babitsky.
</P>
<P>
   When they claimed that Grozny was sealed, surrounded and
impenetrable, Babitsky filed reports about how he stealthily
slipped through Russian lines. When Moscow said Russian forces had
captured a strategic square in central Grozny with minimal
casualties, it was Babitsky who filed reports of massive troop
losses _ and provided video footage to a Russian television station
to support his reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Since Babitsky's disappearance, the Kremlin has issued a series
of confusing, contradictory and often strange statements.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, authorities in Moscow denied any knowledge of his
whereabouts. Then, after news reports came out of Chechnya that
Babitsky was being held by Russian troops, the Kremlin acknowledged
that the journalist had been arrested for lacking accreditation to
work in the war zone. Law-enforcement officials also said Babitsky
was suspected of aiding and abetting Chechnya's separatist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last week, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, a spokesman for acting
President Vladimir V. Putin, said Babitsky had been handed over to
Chechen rebels in exchange for Russian prisoners of war. A video
released Friday showed Russian soldiers handing a clearly
distraught Babitsky over to unidentified armed and masked men.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky's wife, Lyudmila, said the video only added to her
concerns about her husband's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have watched that video one hundred times. I have never seen
Andrei so distraught,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday, Yastrzhembsky said Putin was
informed of the move only ``after the exchange took place.''
Yastrzhembsky would not say who authorized the exchange and told
reporters not to ask any more questions about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen rebel President Aslan Maskhadov, meanwhile, said he was
unaware of the exchange or Babitsky's whereabouts. He suggested
that the military may have killed him and is now trying to put the
blame on the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babitsky was inconvenient. Many methods could have been used
to liquidate him,'' news agencies quoted Maskhadov as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Patrushev, director of the Federal Security Service _
successor to the Soviet KGB _ was quoted by news agencies as saying
that Babitsky was alive. Patrushev added, however, that he did not
know where the journalist was located.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see these officials saying that Andrei is alive and well,
well where is he?'' Babitsky's wife said. ``I see that they are
alive and well, but I want to see my husband here with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyudmila Babitsky said she hasn't left her modest two room
Moscow apartment since his disappearance. She sleeps with a
telephone by her pillow as she waits for news of her husband's
fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit at home and wait Andrei to call, or somebody with news
about him,'' she said, holding the couple's two-year-old daughter
Revekka. ``I jump every time the phone rings. What else can I do?''
she added.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the last few decades, a growing number of astronomers have
promulgated the view that alien civilizations are likely to be
scattered among the stars like grains of sand, isolated from one
another by the emptiness of interstellar space. Just for Earth's
own galaxy, the Milky Way, experts have estimated that there might
be up to 1 million advanced societies.
</P>
<P>
   This extraterrestrial credo has fueled not only countless books,
movies and television shows _ not to mention hosts of Klingons,
Wookies and Romulans _ but a long scientific hunt that uses huge
dish antennas to scan the sky for faint radio signals from
intelligent aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two prominent scientists say the conventional wisdom is
wrong. The alien search, they add, is likely to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on new findings in astronomy, geology and paleontology,
the two argue that humans might be alone, at least in the stellar
neighborhood, and perhaps in the entire cosmos. They say modern
science is showing that Earth's composition and stability are
extraordinarily rare.
</P>
<P>
   Most everywhere else, the radiation levels are too high, the
right chemical elements too rare in abundance, the hospitable
planets too few in number and the rain of killer rocks too intense
for life ever to have evolved into advanced communities. Alien
microbes may survive in many places as a kind of cosmic shower
scum, they say, but not extraterrestrials civilized enough to be
awash in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Their book, ``Rare Earth'' (Springer-Verlag), out last month, is
producing whoops of criticism and praise, with some detractors
saying that the authors have made their own simplistic assumptions
about the adaptability of life forms while others call it
``brilliant'' and ``courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have finally said out loud what so many have thought for so
long _ that complex life, at least, is rare,'' said Dr. Peter D.
Ward of the University of Washington, a paleontologist who
specializes in mass extinctions and whose previous works include
``The Call of Distant Mammoths'' (Springer-Verlag, 1997). ``And to
us, complex life may be a flatworm.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's other author is Dr. Donald C. Brownlee of the
University of Washington, a noted astronomer, member of the
National Academy of Sciences and chief scientist of NASA's $166
million Stardust mission to capture interplanetary and interstellar
dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say the sun is a typical star,'' he said in an
interview. ``That's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownlee added: ``Almost all environments in the universe are
terrible for life. It's only garden of Eden places like Earth where
it can exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Geoffrey W. Marcy of the University of California at
Berkeley, a leading seeker of planets around other stars, 31 of
which have been found so far, hailed ``Rare Earth'' as likely to
spark a revolution in thinking about extraterrestrial life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's brilliant,'' Marcy said in an interview. ``It delineates
many things I've been thinking about but does a much more credible
job of listing and explaining the various issues.'' For instance,
he said, it shows how the giant planets discovered so far outside
the solar system bode ill for the development of complex life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's courageous,'' Marcy added. ``It's rare in literature and
science that a stance goes so far against the grain.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that alien civilizations are ubiquitous arose in a
scientific sense four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank D. Drake, then a young astronomer at a federal radio
observatory in West Virginia, in 1960 was the first to scan the
skies for faint alien signals, and was quickly joined by
like-minded experts, including Dr. Carl Sagan, then a brash
27-year-old astronomer. Drake laid out his ideas in 1961, in what
came to be known as the Drake equation.
</P>
<P>
   The equation made educated guesses for the rate at which stars
form, the fraction of stars with planets, the number of those
planets on which life arises and so on, including the average
lifetime of technological civilizations. By his logic, the Milky
Way had about 10,000 civilizations capable of interstellar
communication.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Sagan revised the calculation and raised the estimate to
a million alien worlds. Since the cosmos holds hundreds of millions
of galaxies, by that analysis the total number of alien societies
could be astronomical, one estimate putting the number at roughly
10 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   New findings, however, according to the authors of ``Rare
Earth,'' show that the Drake equation is riddled with hidden
optimistic assumptions. Their stance, the authors say in the
preface, is ``rarely articulated but increasingly accepted by many
astrobiologists,'' the general name for scientists who study the
likelihood of extraterrestrial life.
</P>
<P>
   Ward said he was drawn to the topic because of his studies of
mass extinctions. Increasingly, top culprits are seen as speeding
rocks from outer space that hit Earth in huge explosions, with one
65 million years ago killing off many plants and animals, including
the dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   New studies, Ward said, suggest that things could be worse. For
instance, the rate of terrestrial impacts could be as much as
10,000 times higher but for the presence of Jupiter, the solar
system's largest planet, which absorbs many killer rocks and flings
others into deep space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right on the edge of the abyss,'' Ward said, in terms of
higher bombardment rates that have probably precluded the
development of advanced life.
</P>
<P>
   Recent finds of giant Jupiterlike planets outside the solar
system offer no solace. Most of their orbits, he said, are wildly
eccentric, which would abet destructive chaos among smaller planets
rather than shielding them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Jupiters seen today are bad Jupiters,'' Ward said.
``Ours is the only good one we know of. And it's got to be good, or
you're thrown out into dark space or into your sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcy, the planet finder, said such analyses were adding to his
doubts about the existence of extraterrestrials.
</P>
<P>
   Even if some distant Jupiters are in stable, circular orbits,
Ward said, other factors might overwhelm their protective effect
and demolish any life. For instance, closer to the center of the
galaxy where star populations are far denser, the frequent passage
of one star past another could trigger cascades of comets,
trillions of which are thought to orbit most stars' icy fringes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in the interior of the galaxy,'' he said, ``you're
always getting bombarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Added to that fury, he said, is the intense radiation and
explosions of galactic interiors. The star-filled sky conveys a
false impression of immutability. New studies show that the cosmos,
especially galactic centers, are hotbeds of violence swept by
killing waves of X-rays, gamma rays and ionizing radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I don't think there's any life in the centers at all,''
Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   Brownlee, the astronomer and co-author, said the odds for
complex life were similarly bad at galactic edges.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis of starlight from the such fringes shows they are
relatively poor in elements like iron, magnesium and silicon,
partly because of less recycling of stellar materials over the eons
and partly because of the rarity in such regions of supernovas, the
stellar blasts that help make heavy elements in enormously hot
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   These elements, Brownlee said, and even heavier ones that are
radioactive and also made in supernovas, appear to be prerequisites
to the formation of terrestrial-type planets that have sufficient
gravity to retain seas and atmospheres and that have plate
tectonics, which is powered largely by the heat of radioactive
decay.
</P>
<P>
   According to the book, the slow movement and recycling of
planetary crust into a planet's hot interior are key ingredients
for the evolution of complex life. Plate tectonics, the authors
say, promotes biodiversity by producing mountain chains and other
kinds of environmental complexity, lessens the odds of extinctions,
helps keep planetary temperatures even through the recycling of
carbon and makes dry land on which advanced civilizations can
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're critically dependent on mass,'' said Brownlee. ``Being
bigger or smaller might rule out plate tectonics.''
</P>
<P>
   Whole galaxies are metal-poor and therefore probably devoid of
animal life, Brownlee added. Only spiral galaxies like the Milky
Way and its nearby neighbor in Andromeda appear rich in metals, and
even then, only in their inner regions. In contrast, elliptical and
irregular galaxies, he said, are barren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lower metal abundance means you can't make a planet as big as
the Earth,'' Brownlee said. ``It seems like something a lot of
people don't want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists discuss other planetary characteristics that are
probably rare in the universe but are increasingly seen as critical
for making Earth so favorable to complex life. Among them are
these:
</P>
<P>
   _ An orbit that keeps a planet at exactly the right distance
from its star to ensure that water remains liquid, not vapor or
ice.
</P>
<P>
   _ A large moon at just the right distance to minimize changes in
a planet's tilt, ensuring climate stability.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enough carbon to aid the development of life but not so much
to allow for runaway greenhouse conditions, as occur on superheated
Venus.
</P>
<P>
   In the book's conclusion, the authors say the ``Rare Earth''
hypothesis is testable, and they strongly encourage such work.
Powerful new telescopes will shed light not only on gas giants but
on the abundance of smaller, terrestrial planets around distant
stars, and will also show whether their orbits are stable and
protected by larger planets from cosmic bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   New telescopes also might find evidence of planets enshrouded in
ozone and oxygen, which in sufficient concentrations imply the
existence of life.
</P>
<P>
   The two scientists also call for searches of Mars, the Jovian
moons Europa and Ganymede, and Saturn's moon Titan for signs of
alien microbes. That discovery would answer the question of whether
life is an inherent property of matter, as most scientists believe.
</P>
<P>
   The two support radio hunts for signs of advanced alien
civilizations, but add that ``it is very difficult to know''
whether the search ``is an effective use of resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,
known as SETI, see the new book as a heretical assault that could
endanger the financing of the hunt. More than $100 million has been
spent to date, with most money now coming from silicon moguls and
other private donors.
</P>
<P>
   Drake, now president of the SETI Institute, a private group in
Mountain View, Calif., that is searching for alien civilizations
with the huge dish antenna at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, said the book's
main failing was undue pessimism about life's tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic flaw in all those arguments,'' Drake said, ``is that
they don't allow for the opportunistic nature of life, its ability
to accommodate or alter itself to cope with environmental change.''
</P>
<P>
   As for politics, Drake said, most SETI researchers are more
interested in honest debate than trying to suppress critics out of
fear of cuts in financing. ``Maybe we're politically naive,'' he
said. ``But we don't try to stamp out this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake added: ``The only way you can find out the truth is to
search and discover either the prevalence of intelligent life, or
its total absence.''
</P>
<P>
   If the rarity hypothesis turns out to be true, the book says, it
greatly increases the loss each time a plant or animal is driven to
extinction and strengthens the responsibility for humans to be good
stewards of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Ward remarked in an interview, if the Milky Way is truly
devoid of alien hordes, then it might be humanity's destiny over
the eons to spread into the wilderness of stars, unopposed by
ancient legions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are as rare as we think we are,'' Ward said, ``it raises
the stakes, intellectually and morally.''

FLU-STRICKEN KENNEDY FACES SEVERAL MORE DAYS IN HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Apparently striken with a bad case of the flu,
Senator Edward M. Kennedy is expected to remain in the hospital for
a few more days to recover, his aides say.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 67, is suffering from a fever, muscle aches, chills and
a cough. He was admitted to Sibley Memorial Hospital on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's physician, Dr. Mark Abbruzzese, released a statement
Monday saying Kennedy has a viral illness, and ``is responding
nicely to treatment. His symptoms are typical of such cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbruzzese said he wanted to keep Kennedy in the hospital for
several more days for observation and treatment _ a decision backed
by Kennedy's wife, Victoria Reggie Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted is well on his way to a speedy recovery,'' Mrs. Kennedy
said in a statement. ``He's feeling better today than yesterday,
and is itching to go home. But he is still running a temperature,
and his doctors and I have convinced him that another few days of
rest is the best treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was visited by his sons, Edward Jr. and Representative
Patrick Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode Island, and by his daughter,
Kara. The senator has been in contact with his office and requested
briefing books, spokesman Will Keyser said.
</P>
<P>
   Keyser said Kennedy had had a flu shot.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a week ago, Kennedy was visibly energetic and
apparently healthy, revving up the crowd at a rally in new
Hampshire for Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Kennedy called a senior aide to say he didn't think
he would be able to make it to the office the next day. He ended up
checking into the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' other senator, Democrat John F. Kerry, is also
ill with what he described as walking pneumonia. Kerry has been at
work, but said he spent the holiday season and congressional break
with a terrible cough.

NEW VIEW OF MOTHERHOOD: MATERNAL STYLES MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By NATALIE ANGIER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody knows what a good mother is. She is a lot like apple
pie: reassuringly firm on the outside, but soft, sweet, warm and
bland within. A good mother gets pleasure from the comfort and
pleasure of others. A good mother gets pleasure from being sliced,
diced and eaten alive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while everybody knows what a good mother is, and everybody
wants one, nobody seems to know where to find her _ and with
reason. That good mother, who gives infinitely and unstintingly,
is, in the phrase of the primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, the
woman that never evolved, nor could have.
</P>
<P>
   Hrdy, of the University of California at Davis, knows a lot
about mothers _ real mothers with their feet on the ground, rather
than earth mothers with their feet on pedestals. She knows about
human mothers across cultures and eras, and she knows about
nonhuman mothers across phyla. She knows about the complexity,
beauty and ferocity of the bond between a mother and her young. She
knows that the bond is not a given, nor is it fixed and clean and
sweet, but instead is a barter, a supple, ever-changing push-me
pull-you negotiation between two individuals who need each other
and are closely related, but who are not clones and so do not
always see eye to eye, or breast to mouth for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hrdy has gathered her insight and research into a book,
``Mother Nature: A History of Mothers, Infants and Natural
Selection,'' published last fall by Pantheon Books. The book, which
took her more than 15 years to complete, is thick, complex,
scholarly and personal. Fastidiously documented and footnoted, yet
nonetheless beautifully and accessibly written, it is the product
of a woman who, before going into science, had considered becoming
a novelist. It is the story of the mother-infant bond told from a
nuanced but distinctly Darwinian perspective, an appraisal of how a
welter of selective forces has shaped maternal behaviors, impulses
and strategies over tens of thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Among its many narrative parries, the book challenges a bedrock
assumption of evolutionary biology, the premise that males of most
species, including humans, vary far more in reproductive success
than do their female counterparts. Some males manage to mate like
Lotharios while others are sexual duds, the theory goes, whereas
females are in such demand that they can mate as much as they need
to and thus end up with more or less the same number of offspring.
With this model of female monotony in mind, mothers have been
viewed as cookie-cutter characters, with scant variation in
maternal methods or maternal success from one female to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Calling this bit of theoretical orthodoxy into question, Hrdy
discusses the growing evidence that the variation in female
reproductive success _ in the ability of females to rear offspring
who themselves reproduce _is far greater than had been suspected.
Motherhood matters, she says, and maternal styles and decisions
matter, and why did it take people so long to see that simple,
profound truth?
</P>
<P>
   Hrdy talks about the extraordinary demands of human mothering.
Most primate mothers can rear their infants on their own, but human
mothers cannot. They need help, and throughout history and
prehistory they have gotten it however and from whomever they can _
from mothers, grandmothers, brothers, aunts, cousins; from one man,
or more than one man.
</P>
<P>
   New research, Hrdy says, has revealed the prevalence of a
practice called partible paternity _ the idea that a baby is a
patchwork quilt of the various men a woman sleeps with during
pregnancy. Found among the traditional peoples of lowland Amazonia,
eastern and southern Africa, New Guinea and elsewhere, partible
paternity and customs like it turn out to be of advantage to women
and their offspring. If a woman's primary husband dies or deserts
her, the other second-tier mates are expected to help protect and
provide for her children. As one young Zambian woman is quoted as
saying: ``Why put all your eggs in one basket?''
</P>
<P>
   Hrdy does not flinch from the brutal side of human motherhood.
As a communal breeder beholden to the assistance of others in
rearing her young, a woman must be a true political animal. She
must be calculating, sometimes ruthlessly so. Hrdy delves into the
subject of infanticide, revealing the practice to be a sorry staple
of humanity's efforts to plan and manage their families.
</P>
<P>
   If a baby is born feeble, or handicapped, or the wrong sex, or
too soon after the last child, the parents may choose to kill,
abandon or neglect it, rather than struggle to rear it against all
odds and thus put their other children's futures at risk. Sometimes
they dropped the child in the river. At other times, they committed
infanticide passively, by depositing the unwanted progeny at a
Dickensian-like orphanage, for example, or shipping it off to a
distant and overburdened wet nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Many cultures postpone until several days or weeks after an
infant's birth official rituals like baptism, circumcision and
naming ceremonies, Hrdy points out, perhaps in recognition that not
every newborn is destined to be reared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I consider this material to be part of what I do
for a living,'' said Dr. Lee Cronk, an evolutionary anthropologist
at Rutgers, ``Sarah presented a huge amount of information on the
history of child abandonment practices with which I wasn't
familiar. It's a terrific book.''
</P>
<P>
   A fifth-generation Texan who retains a trace of twang, Hrdy
(pronounced HUR- dee) is 53, almost six feet tall and strappingly
handsome, yet with limbs and neck just elongated enough to give her
an almost balletic air. She is the daughter of considerable wealth
and prominence _ Dallas banking on the maternal side, Texaco oil on
the patriline _ but she fled from her background as quickly as
possible. ``I wanted out of there,'' she said. ``When I went off to
college at 16, it was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Married to Daniel Hrdy, a infectious disease doctor and farmer
(to whom she dedicates her latest book as ``the wisest choice this
female ever made''), she has three children: Katrinka, a varsity
rower who graduates from Harvard in the spring; another daughter,
Sasha, who will enter Harvard in the fall; and a 13-year-old son,
Niko, named after the great naturalist Niko Tinbergen and the only
one, Hrdy said, ``who shows signs of becoming a naturalist.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hrdy first gained recognition as a graduate student at Harvard
in the 1970s for her studies of langur monkeys in Abu, India, in
particular infanticide by males. She described how, when a new male
langur entered a troop, one of his first actions would be to
slaughter the infants of the males he deposed, the sooner to put
the females into estrus and thus to give himself a shot at mating.
She also told of how females would try to protect their young by
quickly and repeatedly mating with the invading male, apparently in
hopes that he would be confused enough to view the existing infants
as his own.
</P>
<P>
   Hrdy's reports of calculated infanticide and counter-infanticide
were greeted with skepticism, or dismissed as the pathological
responses of monkeys to the press of human populations around them.
But since then male infanticide has been observed in many species,
and its importance in shaping male and female behavior alike has
been widely accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her work on infanticide was revolutionary,'' said Dr. Meredith
Small, a primatologist at Cornell. ``Now, we've had 30 years of
hypothesis-testing, and she's right. There aren't many people who
can propose a paradigm shift in their lifetime and watch it
unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   Hrdy also has gained fame for questioning the idea that males
are naturally ardent and females naturally coy, and she has worked
mightily to present the female animal as an active player rather
than a passive one in evolution, an effort delineated in her
landmark 1981 book, ``The Woman That Never Evolved,'' which brought
her popular as well as professional fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother Nature'' continues the effort, as she puts it, to
``raise Darwin's consciousness.'' She upends stereotypes about
maternal instinct and what women ``really'' want. For example, as
Hrdy sees it, a woman's career ambition is not a thing apart from
her nurturing, maternal feelings, or an expression of vestigial
``masculinity,'' or the delusional products of contemporary
feminism, as some have suggested. Instead, ambitiousness can be a
reflection of the fact that, among many species, the more powerful
and politically dominant the individual, the greater is her or his
reproductive success.
</P>
<P>
   Hrdy cites the example of Flo, the famous Gombe chimpanzee
studied by Dr. Jane Goodall. Flo's high social rank not only
allowed her to appropriate enough resources to raise many offspring
to adulthood, but also to found a fief, in which her daughters
remained in their birthplace and inherited their mother's alpha
status, rather than being forced to disperse at puberty, as female
chimpanzees usually are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother chimps like Flo were not simply doting nurturers but
entrepreneurial dynasts as well,'' Hrdy writes. ``A female's quest
for status _ her ambition, if you will _ has become inseparable
from her ability to keep her offspring and grand-offspring alive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These data strongly suggest,'' she adds, ``that generalized
striving for local clout was genetically programmed into the
primate female's psyche during a distant past when status and
motherhood were totally convergent.'' Today, she says, many women
don't know what to do with their zeal to succeed. On the one hand,
they no longer need men to support them, nor will they necessarily
manage to achieve high status and its trappings on their partner's
salary alone. Moreover, many women have noticed that a reliance on
male income in a world of no-fault divorce can leave them and their
children impoverished. And so, in the tradition of Flo, human
mothers today may wish for standing, accomplishment and clout of
their own, which is easier fantasized than realized.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of modern life put women in a bind, Hrdy
argues, ``because jobs, status and resource defense occur in
separate domains from child-rearing.'' Flo could strive for high
rank while keeping her infant by her side; a modern mother cannot.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is not between maternal feelings and ambitiousness,
Hrdy says, but between the needs of a human infant for constant,
attentive, extended care; and the fact that a woman's ambitions
must be played out in workplaces with no tolerance for children.
</P>
<P>
   An infant's needs can be met in day care, Hrdy emphasizes. But
that surrogate care must be far better than what we have managed,
on average, to offer. What we need in our day care centers are
well-paid and highly respected ``allomothers,'' she said, a cadre
of ``as-if'' mothers, who can be either male or female, so long as
they are stable, conscientious and treat the children like their
closest kin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're worrying about global warming, the destruction of the
rain forest, the ozone layer,'' she said. ``Nobody is worrying
about the future of Homo sapiens in terms of day care issues. And
I'm saying we really should. If we care about the future of the
human race, and the future of the planet, this is the place to
start.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, Mother knows best.

FOR ASTEROID, ODDS ARE ONE IN A MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Mass.)  (jw) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the fifth time in two years, astronomers have discovered an
asteroid hurtling through space that might collide with the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The projected date of impact is 2022, but the likelihood of
collision is considered slim _ one chance in a million. Astronomers
say additional observations, if acquired, would allow them to
better calculate the orbit of the asteroid and perhaps rule out a
collision, at least in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The asteroid, named 2000 BF19, is about a half mile wide,
relatively small by cosmic standards, and would threatening a
regional disaster on Earth rather than planetwide destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Its discovery was made by astronomers using the Spacewatch
Telescope at the Steward Observatory on Kitt Peak in Arizona. They
spotted the object on Jan. 28 and tracked it until Feb. 3, at which
point an announcement of its existence was made for the
International Astronomical Union by the Minor Planet Center of
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement did not mention the possibility of a collision
but suggested that the asteroid was potentially dangerous and worth
watching. On Monday, the possibility of impact was raised by Benny
J. Peiser, who runs the Cambridge-Conference Network, or CCNET, a
Internet newsletter about astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current impact probability of one in a million can easily
and quickly go up or down,'' Peiser wrote. In all likelihood, the
asteroid will turn out to be no risk, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only further observations can provide us with the information
to assess the potential danger,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Peiser reported that the calculation of the current risk factor
and projected impact date had been done by Andrea Milani, an
astronomer at Pisa University in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted Milani as saying that the object should raise no
alarms. ``Nevertheless,'' Milani added, ``shame on the astronomical
community if we lose this dangerous fellow, which is unfortunately
quite dim and fading.''
</P>
<P>
   The asteroid is expected to pass near the Earth every 11 years,
next in 2011 and again in 2022.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a wide variety of orbits that can fit the
observations,'' said Gareth V. Williams, an astronomer at the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, who wrote the asteroid's
official birth announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people who should be concerned are astronomers who
should be trying to get additional observations,'' Williams said.
``Since the arc of observation is so short, it is highly possible
that any additional observations will be sufficient to reject the
2022 impact solution. However, it is possible that another possible
impact scenario will turn up for a later date.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that in other instances follow-up observations
have let astronomers rule out collisions with the Earth. In one
case observations were too limited to let them do so before the
object disappeared from the world's telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000 BF19, he said, with the asteroid fading fast, a
clarification might take years rather than weeks or days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hefty object,'' Williams said. ``We would not like an
object of this size to hit us.''

AKAMI BUYING INTERVU FOR $2.89 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Akamai Technologies Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. is spending $2.8
billion to acquire San Diego-based Intervu Inc., in a bid to lock
in leadership of the booming Internet content delivery market.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai runs a network of 2,000 Internet servers that stores
copies of popular Web sites. When a Web user requests data from a
site, it's sent to him from the nearest Akamai server, rather than
from the site's own server. This results in faster access to the
information. Hundreds of major Web sites, such as Lycos, Yahoo, and
CNN use Akamai to speed data delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Intervu also speeds data delivery. But while Akamai specializes
in text- and graphics-based Web sites, Intervu's network of servers
are designed for streaming media _ audio and video programs on the
Net. A number of major Web sites, such as CNN and Microsoft
Network, use Intervu servers to deliver audio and video data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike Akamai, Intervu has been exclusively focused on on-line
streaming, both audio and video,'' said Akamai president Paul
Sagan. Akamai also wanted to enter the business, and decided to
acquire Intervu rather than build a new network from scratch.
``This speeds Akamai's time to market, reduces risk, and saves
money,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Intervu chief executive Harry Gruber said the two companies are
a perfect fit. Each has a key capability the other lacks, while
both are committed to the same business of speeding the performance
of the Internet. ``We have the same religion,'' said Gruber, ``and
that's what makes the synergy so great between the two companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a very strong deal from a strategic standpoint,''
said Mark Langner, senior broadband analyst at J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc. in San Francisco. ``It makes a lot of sense on a
lot of levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Langner noted that Intervu and Akamai serve many of the same Web
sites. By acquiring Intervu, Akamai eliminates a competitor and
insures that some other firm can't purchase Intervu and gain a
foothold in the market. ``This is really textbook Internet business
building 101,'' Langner said.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai agreed to swap 0.5957 shares of its stock for every
Intervu share. At Akamai's closing price Monday of 228 5/8, that
makes the deal worth almost $2.8 billion. Still, it's relatively
cheap, considering that Akamai went public just three months ago at
36 a share. The company has been one of the biggest beneficiaries
in the huge Internet stock run-up, and is using its high stock
valuation to make some strategic purchases. Just last month, Akamai
paid $200 million in stock to acquire Network24 Communications, a
company that makes software for managing interactive Internet
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Intervu went public in 1997 at a price of 9 1/2 a
share. As with most Internet start-ups, the company has never
posted a profit, losing $14.5 million in the first three quarters
of 1999 on revenue of $6.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also will give General Electric Co. a small stake in
Akamai, because GE's National Broadcasting Co. business unit
presently owns 5 percent of Intervu.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Akamai closed down 6 3/8 to 228 5/8 Monday, while
Intervu gained 12 3/8 to close at a record high of 129 3/8, both on
the Nasdaq Stock Market.

BEGINNING LAWYERS OFFERED $140,000 IN TALENT HUNT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ Faced with increased competition for law school
graduates from the Internet firms it represents, Boston law firm
Testa, Hurwitz &AMP; Thibeault will offer its associates $140,000 per
year, making its first-year lawyers among the highest paid in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are right in the midst of the high-tech revolution and, the
truth is, we have collected within our walls an awful lot of
talent,'' said Timothy C. Maguire, a partner at the law firm.
``These are people who know the industry and they are attractive to
a lot of companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost, so far, four to five people in the past year to
some very high-quality dot-coms,'' Maguire said. ``So, we decided
to take salary off the table. We'd like people to focus on the
quality of our training and the collegiality of the firm and not
get lost in dollars and cents.''
</P>
<P>
   The law firm, which represents emerging companies and the
venture capitalists that fund them, hired 45 law school graduates
in September. All will receive a 40 percent pay hike, from $100,000
to $140,000, effective this month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, pay raises were extended to associates with more
than a year's tenure. One associate who joined the firm several
years ago said his annual pay increased from $175,000 to $217,000.
</P>
<P>
   The push to hike first-year associates' pay actually began in
California about a month ago. There, companies had established a
base compensation of $125,000, along with calculations that
included bonuses based on the number of hours worked by each
associate. Under this plan, an associate could make up to $155,000
per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are now seeing is a reaction to what has happened in
California,'' said Earle Yaffa, managing director of Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom.
</P>
<P>
   Based in New York with an office in Boston, Skadden Arps also
notified its first-year associates last Thursday their pay would
increase from $107,000 to $140,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to come up with compensation that would pay the same
total compensation that the best associates at California firms
would likely be paid,'' said Yaffa. ``With a bonus, the total
compensation could be higher. The bonus is based on a number of
factors, including how well the firm has done . . . We have paid
bonuses, in addition to base salaries, for at least three to four
years.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the pay raise at Testa, Hurwitz, which was announced
late last week, spread quickly throughout the legal community and
caused some firms to begin re-evaluating pay and compensation
packages again, just weeks after leading firms started offering
first-year lawyers $100,000 per year, excluding bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now reviewing what everyone else is paying and
hopefully, within the week, we will know how to respond,'' said
Robin Carbone, director of recruiting for Choate, Hall &AMP; Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The firm currently pays associates $90,000 per year, and was
planning to raise first-year associates' salary to $100,000,
Carbone said. She did not know how the increase at Testa, Hurwitz
would affect associates at her firm.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia C. Brier of MCB Communications, which represents law
firms in Boston, said the higher salaries would have a ``tremendous
impact on work-family balance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there will be much more pressure on associates to
perform and bill,'' she said. ``They will have to do serious
billing to justify these stratospheric salaries and that will
affect work-family balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the legal community is not alone. The world's top
consulting companies have hiked pay and are offering an array of
benefits to prevent its brightest employees from joining Internet
firms. McKinsey &AMP; Co., for example, now offers investment
opportunities in Internet start-ups. And Mercer Management helps
talented associates design business plans and will even put them in
touch with venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Testa, Hurwitz employs 330 to 340 people. Its associates receive
comprehensive health care, dental, and a company match of up to 4
percent of total pay in their 401(k) accounts. The company has
instituted a number of perks, including an equity incentive program
that offers associates access to Internet investments and a
concierge service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concierge service will even walk your dog, if necessary,''
Maguire said. ``It allows our associates to stay calm and not get
stressed out because a client is going into merger negotiations and
(the associate) cannot be home to meet the cable guy.''
</P>
<P>
   David Hagen, marketing manager at Infirmation.com, a career
resource for lawyers founded by two lawyers, said: ``Associates are
finding that the hours at law firms are very long, and they are
struggling. But when they join a dot-com, they are automatically
considered top management. A lot of them are doing content
management, or business development. In many cases, they are not
even practicing law.''

RAYTHEON TO FACE ANALYSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Daniel Burnham took over as chief executive of Raytheon
Co. in 1998, some outside investment specialists warned him they
were wary of the company's financial footing.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexington, Mass. defense contractor had a reputation for
consistently hitting its earnings projections, but also for
reporting relatively low cash-flow figures.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics wondered whether the company could sustain its
profitability, though they relaxed when a new chief financial
officer was installed last March and seemed ready to gain a firmer
handle on Raytheon's outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the alerts now look more apt than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Profits for the quarter ended Dec. 31 fell 79 percent. Following
a series of warnings about its earnings, Raytheon's stock now
trades at less than a third of the high it reached in July.
Raytheon's Class B shares closed Monday at 21 5/8, down 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, a credit-rating downgrade has forced Raytheon to
increase its borrowings from banks.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has investors anxious to hear more details of
Raytheon's recovery plans at a conference the nation's
third-largest defense contractor has scheduled in New York Tuesday
with Wall Street analysts. Sources say the company is expected to
continue trying to free up cash, such as demanding up-front
payments and improving collections from customers, and reducing the
inventory it keeps on hand.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether such steps and other moves it might
announce will help enough as Raytheon tries to pay down the bills
it took on through acquisitions. Total debt stood at $9.7 billion
at the end of December, up from $8.9 billion a year earlier, and
just servicing it cost Raytheon $713 million in net interest
expenses in 1999, a big drain on earnings.
</P>
<P>
   To some, doubts also remain whether Raytheon has done enough to
improve its financial controls. ``They need to develop consistency
and predictability'' in that area, said S.G. Cowen analyst Cai von
Rumohr.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Raytheon has blamed its problems on
tougher-than-expected competition and difficulties integrating
other missile and defense-electronics companies it bought amid
industry consolidation. (The company purchased Hughes Electronics
and Texas Instrument's defense and electronics businesses in 1997).
Raytheon has laid off thousands more employees since 1997 and late
last year launched another restructuring meant to aid the reviews
of new chief financial officer Frank Caine.
</P>
<P>
   It is also trying to combine payroll, ordering and billing
systems that at one point were kept on 50 different computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   But the more Caine and his troops sift, the more accounting
problems they seem to find. Others debate to what extent Raytheon's
problems are the fault of current leaders or their retired
predecessors, former chief executive Dennis Picard and former chief
financial officer Peter D'Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   Some blame both sets. ``It's easier to hold the previous
management team responsible,'' said Lehman Bros. analyst Joe
Campbell. ``However, the current team has had enough time that they
should have their arms around this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman declined to respond. Meanwhile, the stock's
grim performance has some investors pressing for steps more
dramatic than improved bookkeeping, such as the sale of trouble
assets such as its Cambridge-based construction unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably need to get themselves some financial
flexibility,'' said John Hayes of shareholder Independence
Investment Associates in Boston. On the other hand, the unit might
not fetch much, given weaknesses in overseas construction markets.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon has begun to borrow against a bank line worth more than
$4 billion because a reduced credit rating has diminished its
ability to tap other sources of funds.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon spokesman David Polk declined to discuss the exact
amount it has drawn down, but called the borrowings ``not unusual''
given the rating change.

ATA TO OFFER LOW-COST CHICAGO-BOSTON FLIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The battle between low-cost carriers and established
airlines will have a new front _ the competitive Boston-Chicago
market, which has been dominated by United Airlines and American
Airlines, the nation's number one and number two airlines
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Low-cost American Trans Air, the nation's 11th-largest carrier,
announced Monday that it will begin service from Boston's Logan
International Airport to Chicago's Midway Airport on May 7.
</P>
<P>
   And US Airways's low-cost service, known as Metrojet, will begin
Boston-Midway service on March 5, with four flights a day.
</P>
<P>
   Metrojet will have a 21-day advance purchase fare of $198 round
trip and a walk-up round-trip fare of $548. US Airways officials
are confident that the US Airways brand name will help win
customers, especially in Boston where the airline has a big
presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the targeting of a market that has a heavy demand, if
fairly high prices, and is a great opportunity for an upstart to
come in and offer low prices that presently do not exist in that
market,'' said Thomas Kinton, director of aviation for the
Massachusetts Port Authority, which owns and operates Logan.
</P>
<P>
   In making the announcement Monday, ATA said it will offer
introductory fares to Chicago's Midway, where it has a hub, from
$79 to $89 for a one-way trip. Fares to West Coast cities such as
Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle will be $119 to $149 each
way. Tickets must be purchased by March 31 for travel from May 7
through June 30, and the fare does not include passenger fees
levied by airport authorities, which can add as much a $6 per trip
segment.
</P>
<P>
   The new service makes a competitive market even more crowded.
American and United both have hubs at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport, and have seen other low-cost entrants enter
recently, including Pan Am, which flies from Portsmouth, N.H., to
Gary, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   The low-cost carriers do not offer more than one class of
service, nor do they come close to matching the varied schedule
from Boston to Chicago that the big two do, but ATA officials are
confident they will do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are excited about expanding our scheduled service to
include Boston,'' said ATA's president and chief executive officer,
John Tague. ATA flies to 26 business and vacation destinations,
including Dallas, Denver, Honolulu, Las Vegas and several Florida
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The airline will begin service to Chicago with three nonstop
flights every day but Saturday. The flights will continue on to
Dallas-Fort Worth, Denver and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston fits our profile as a city that can perform like others
where we have had success, including Philadelphia and New York out
of LaGuardia and Kennedy,'' said Rick Larsen, vice president of
marketing. ``It is a large market with limited access into Midway
Airport, and it is a market that some lower-fare competition can
stimulate.''
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old airline is known primarily for its commercial
and military charters, but has grown rapidly in the past seven
years as a scheduled airline. Scheduled service now accounts for
nearly 65 percent of the company's revenues. Last year ATA broke
the $1 billion mark, with total revenues of $1.122 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The airline operates a fleet of 53 airplanes, including 24
Boeing 727s, 11 Boeing 757s and 18 Lockheed L-1011s. The company
has its own heavy maintenance and engineering facilities at Chicago
and Indianapolis. The airline will fly 727s from Boston. All of
ATA's planes have one class of service.
</P>
<P>
   ATA closed Monday at 11 11/16, up 7/16.

<P>
   Dazzle someone special this Valentine's Day with a homemade
show-stopping creation from the heart _ and the kitchen. Although
these edible valentine ideas look glamorous, they don't require all
day to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   These sweets for your sweetie rely on a shortcut _ rolls of
refrigerated cookie dough. Turn them into a giant heart-shaped
cookie, a bouquet of cookies (on sticks), a cookie pizza,
individual heart-shaped chocolate chip cookies and more. The
novelty and attractiveness of it all is bound to impress _ and show
you really care.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes are designed to fit into your schedule. Keep in mind
that some of the cookies can be made a day in advance and decorated
on the day of giving as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   Pick up a roll of refrigerated dough in your favorite flavor.
Choose from sugar, chocolate chip, peanut butter with chocolate
chips or whatever other varieties you find on your market shelf.
Some even have a valentine and heart motif.
</P>
<P>
   If you opt for baking our giant heart-shaped cookie, you can
achieve a professional look by frosting the top with Vanilla Butter
Cream Icing (tinted with pink paste food color available at cake
decorating supply or craft stores) and then piping on ``I Love
You'' (leave the frosting white), ``Be Mine'' or other desired
messages using a pastry bag and assorted tips. You can vary the
color combinations and decorations according to personal artistic
tastes (keep this idea in mind for birthday greetings, too).
</P>
<P>
   Present the cookie (overwrap carefully with plastic wrap) on a
doily-lined glass or plastic plate or cardboard base wrapped
festively in clear cellophane tied with ribbons, balloons, hearts
or flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Our cookie bouquet is a little more time consuming to prepare as
you'll need to spend some time rounding up the various elements _
such as cookie or lollipop sticks, a special cookie pan, food-safe
clear cellophane, ribbons and a box _ to present an attractive
bouquet. Also, because the cookies are fragile (you'll need to make
a few extras in case some break), a bit more patience is required
on the cook's part.
</P>
<P>
   Once baked, decorate the cookies using either the Vanilla Butter
Cream Icing or the Frosting Paint and Icing tinted colors as
desired. The butter cream is a much creamier, softer frosting than
the Frosting Paint and Icing, which dries hard.
</P>
<P>
   Gussy up the cookies immediately after frosting with assorted
candies (such as M&AMP;Ms, Red Hots, jellied hearts). When decorations
are thoroughly set, overwrap each cookie with food-safe plastic
wrap and tie with ribbons to preserve freshness. Then package
cookies as desired in a bouquet of cellophane or place atop ruffled
white or colored paper or clear shredded cellophane in a floral box
designed for long-stemmed flowers (pick one up at a flower shop).
Tie the box with a wide ribbon or a colorful bow.
</P>
<P>
   We also tested arranging some of the sturdy cookie sticks in a
piece of white plastic florist's foam cut to fit in a small, low
vase (or try a basket), which looked terrific. Plan to secure the
stems in the foam with tacky crafts glue.
</P>
<P>
   Our valentine cookie pizza, topped with coconut and assorted
red, pink and white candies, is sure to be a hit with the kids on
your list.
</P>
<P>
   For simple cut-out cookies, roll the dough out on a floured
pastry cloth or wax paper, and with cookie cutters (in the size
desired) cut out heart-shaped cookies. After baking, drizzle with
melted chocolate chips.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other ways to use refrigerator cookie dough _
from Chocolate Cookie Turtles to Sugar Cookie Fruit Tart, Linzer
Bars, Chocolate Chip Caramel Nut Bars and more. Any one of them
would make a delicious dessert offering for Valentine's Day or
other festivities throughout the year. &QL;

SWEETHEART COOKIE 
 
 
1 (18-ounce) roll refrigerated sugar cookie dough, slightly
softened 
2 to 3 recipes Vanilla Butter Cream Icing (recipe follows)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grease bottom of a 9-inch heart-shaped cake pan. Line with wax
paper, cut to fit; grease paper. Press 1/2 to 3/4 of the roll of
dough evenly in pan. (Bake remaining dough separately in rounds or
as heart-shaped cookies.)
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 20 to 25 minutes, or until
golden brown and cooked through. Cool 5 minutes in pan (no longer,
or you risk not getting it out of the pan in one piece); then
loosen edges with a knife and carefully turn out onto cookie sheet
to cool completely. While warm, remove wax paper from bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Frost cooled cookie with part of Vanilla Butter Cream Icing
tinted pink with paste food color. Using a pastry bag and tube,
decorate and write message or name on cooled cookie with white
Vanilla Butter Cream Icing. Makes 1 (9-inch) cookie heart.

<P>
   GIANT COOKIE ROUND: Grease and line 1 (9-inch) round cake pan
with wax paper; grease again. Proceed as directed above.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: After cooling completely, wrap up the cookie and store it
up to a day prior to decorating, which should be competed on the
day of giving as a gift. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VANILLA BUTTER CREAM ICING
</P>
<P>
   A versatile icing. Vary the flavor and tint colors, as desired,
to complement cookies. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1/4 cup butter, room temperature &QL; 
1 cup powdered sugar &QL; 
Pinch salt &QL; 
1 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
1/2 to 1 teaspoon orange extract &QL; 
1 tablespoon whipping cream OR milk &QL; 
Paste food colors (optional)
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, beat together butter, powdered sugar, salt,
vanilla, orange extract and cream until light and fluffy. Tint with
food colors. Use to decorate cookies, either spreading on or piping
on. Makes about 1 cup icing.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Cookies'' by Natalie Hartanov Haughton (HP Books). &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
COOKIE BOUQUET
</P>
<P>
   For ease in making the cookies for the bouquet, we baked the
dough, with sticks carefully inserted at least 2 inches (or a
little more than halfway) into the center of the cookies, in a
Wilton brand Heart Cookie Treat Pan found at Michaels arts and
crafts store in Tarzana (and other locations in the Los Angeles
area).
</P>
<P>
   We thought the pan was a good investment ($7.99) as it speeded
up the cookie-on-a-stick process. You can bake six cookies at a
time in it. Bake the cookies a day in advance of decorating and
giving as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   You can attempt to make cookies on sticks without the pan, but
you'll have to experiment a little and use about a one-third cup of
dough per cookie, shaped into either rounds or hearts. For best
results, insert the sticks 2 inches into the sides of these cookies
while they are hot _ to avoid breakage _ immediately after removing
from the oven.
</P>
<P>
   The special heart pan can also be used to make crisp-rice cereal
treats and other heart-shaped goodies. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 (18-ounce) roll refrigerated chocolate-chip cookie dough &QL; 
8 (6- or 8-inch) cookie OR lollipop sticks (available at cake
decorating shops or crafts shops) &QL; 
Vanilla Butter Cream Icing (recipe above) OR Frosting Paint and
Icing (recipe follows) &QL; 
Assorted valentine candies
</P>
<P>
   Cut dough into 8 equal pieces. Press dough into heart spaces (to
top) in well-greased (you can also spray with vegetable cooking
spray) Heart Cookie Treat Pan. Carefully insert sticks at least 2
inches (or a little more than halfway) into center of cookies. (You
can bake 6 cookies at a time, depending on the size of your oven
and the length of the sticks.)
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 12 to 15 minutes (or longer)
until golden and cooked through. For best results and least
breakage, let cookies cool thoroughly in pan before carefully
removing.
</P>
<P>
   Decorate as desired using Vanilla Butter Cream Icing OR Frosting
Paint and Icing and assorted candies. Allow decorations to set
before overwrapping cookies with plastic wrap and presenting in a
cookie bouquet. Makes 8 heart cookies on sticks. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FROSTING PAINT AND ICING &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
3 tablespoons meringue powder (available at stores that sell cake
decorating supplies; we used Wilton brand) &QL; 
1 package (1 pound) powdered sugar &QL; 
7 tablespoons warm water OR more as needed to thin icing to proper
consistency &QL; 
Paste food colors
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl with a heavy-duty electric mixer, beat together
meringue powder, powdered sugar and water on medium speed about 7
to 10 minutes or until icing forms peaks.
</P>
<P>
   To use as paint, divide frosting among small bowls. (Keep any
unused frosting covered or it will dry out.) Tint each portion the
color desired with paste food colors and thin with a few drops of
warm water until mixture reaches consistency of thick paint.
</P>
<P>
   Using 1-inch-wide inexpensive artist brushes or a small knife,
paint top surface of cookies until smooth, using color desired. Let
stand until dry. If using candies for decorations, press onto
cookies now so they will adhere.
</P>
<P>
   To use as icing, divide frosting among small bowls, tinting each
portion with paste food colors desired and thinning with a tiny bit
of warm water only if necessary to pipe on icing.
</P>
<P>
   When paint on surface of cookies is dry, pipe decorations on
cookies using a pastry bag fitted with desired decorating tips and
filled with desired colors. Let cookies stand until decorations are
set and dry. Cookies are then ready to package. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VALENTINE COOKIE PIZZA &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 (18-ounce) roll refrigerated chocolate-chip cookie dough &QL; 
3/4 to 1 cup flaked OR shredded coconut &QL; 
Vanilla Butter Cream Icing (recipe above) &QL; 
Assorted valentine candies (Red Hots and M&AMP;M's, etc.)
</P>
<P>
   Slightly soften cookie dough (do in 30-second intervals in
microwave oven if using straight from fridge). Cut dough roll in 3
pieces and place on a greased 12-inch pizza pan. Press dough (with
fingers) evenly in pizza pan. Sprinkle with coconut, pressing
lightly into dough.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 13 to 15 minutes or until
golden. Cool in pan.
</P>
<P>
   Make a 4-to 5-inch diameter heart in center of cookie using

AUSTRIA BRACES FOR BACKLASH FROM INVESTORS AND TOURISTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Austrian economists and policy-makers fear
that the protests and sanctions against the new government could
dampen investment in this country and raise capital costs for
companies already doing business here.
</P>
<P>
   But the greater concern seems to be Austria's exclusion from
European Union deliberations at a time when the 15-nation group is
discussing policies crucial to the nation's economic future,
including the admission of several formerly Communist East European
countries that are Austria's immediate neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus here seems to be that the downgrading of relations
by the European Union, and the recall of ambassadors by Israel and
the United States, because of the inclusion of ministers from the
anti-immigrant Freedom Party of Joerg Haider, will not have
immediate and serious economic consequences. But that could change
if Austria's isolation deepens.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Haider sought to play down the impact of his
party's inclusion in the government. ``We will have a stable
situation in a few weeks,'' he said in an interview for NBC's
``Today'' program.
</P>
<P>
   The most visible financial effects of Austria's political
isolation were felt last week, when the Vienna stock market index
dropped 10 percent. It dropped 1.3 percent further Monday to the
lowest level in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one loves a stock exchange in a country with political
problems like this,'' Ronald Kern, a fund manager in Vienna with
Constantia Privatbank AG, told Bloomberg News. ``The fears are that
the last international investors will leave the market and not
return for three to six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the Brussels, Belgium, stock exchange index has performed
more poorly this year, dropping 13 percent so far.
</P>
<P>
   Austria's financial climate was not helped any last Wednesday,
after the Dutch bank ABN-Amro announced it was suspending a deal to
underwrite asset-backed securities for the Austrian province of
Carinthia, where Haider is governor, because of reports that the
securities would be used to finance a child aid program that would
exclude immigrant families.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in companies dependent on tourism, like Austrian Airlines
AG and Flughafen Wien AG, the Vienna airport operator, have been
dragged down.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, school authorities in Belgium scrapped ski trips to
Austrian resorts and a Belgian tourism trade fair canceled an
invitation to the northern Austrian resort of Scharding. The
Belgian foreign minister, Louis Michel, said skiing in Austria this
winter would be ``immoral.'' How many people will heed such
admonitions is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Sabine Koppl, spokeswoman for the Austrian National Tourism
Board, acknowledged ``scattered cancellations'' by tour groups, but
said it was too early to judge the reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian tourism has been booming. In 1999, tourism revenue
reached a record $14.2 billion, after $13.8 billion the year
before. ``We live from tourism as never before,'' Koppl said.
</P>
<P>
   It is premature to gauge foreign investor reaction to Austria's
political shift. But there have been some disquieting signs.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Siegl, managing director of the Austrian Business Agency, a
government office that seeks to lure foreign investment, said the
new government was ``no catastrophe,'' yet he admitted to ``quite
some demand for explanations'' from prospective investors in Japan,
Taiwan and the United States. In 1999, the agency helped land 118
foreign investment deals totaling $271 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernhard Felderer, the director of IHS, an economic research
institute, said further stock market weakness would penalize
Austrian companies by increasing the cost of capital, forcing them
to pay in effect a premium for investment. And the success of the
new government depends in part on attracting new capital in order
to privatize much of Austria's nationalized industry, including the
remaining 75 percent it holds in Austria Telekom AG.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for the moment, Austria is hardly in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Helmut Kramer, the director of WIFO, another economic research
group, said growth this year could reach 3 percent, after 2.2
percent in 1999. But he cautioned that lingering exclusion of
Austria from European Union deliberations could damage Austrian
interests by preventing Vienna from influencing future policy,
notably toward European enlargement into Eastern Europe, in its own
favor. Austria borders on Hungary and the Czech Republic, which
with Poland are the first three candidates for enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet labor costs in those countries are roughly one-tenth the
Austrian level, Kramer said, and Austria has been urging European
partners away from an immediate opening of Eastern European labor
markets to prevent a flood of cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
   This means the sanctions resulting from Haider's victory could
hamper Austria in obtaining measures to prevent the increased
immigration he opposes. ``In representing our interests to the
European Union,'' said Kramer, ``we are severely handicapped.''

EBAY FACES ANTITRUST CHALLENGE IN COUNTERSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet auction search service Bidder's Edge, facing a
lawsuit from the online auction house eBay Inc., has filed a
countersuit claiming that eBay is violating federal antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   The countersuit, filed Monday in US District Court in San Jose,
Calif., says that eBay holds a virtual monopoly of the Internet
auction market, and that the company is using its market power to
interfere with Bidder's Edge's relationships with other firms. For
example, the countersuit charges that Krause Publications Inc.,
publisher of a magazine devoted to eBay auctions, canceled an
advertising contract with Bidder's Edge after being pressured by
eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Pursglove, an eBay spokesman, called the filing ``not
unexpected,'' but declined further comment on the allegations until
his firm's attorneys had a chance to study the filing.
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust charges come less than a week after press reports
indicating that the Justice Department is investigating whether to
launch its own antitrust investigation of eBay. Bidder's Edge
president Jim Carney said the countersuit was not connected with
the Justice Department probe, but confirmed that he had been
interviewed by a team of Justice Department attorneys for two hours
on Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   The Bidder's Edge charges are a response to a lawsuit filed in
December, in which eBay accused Bidder's Edge of illegally
publishing information that belongs to eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Bidder's Edge runs an Internet search service from Burlington,
Mass. that allows people to check auctions at different Web sites.
A visitor looking for an item can see prices at several auction
sites at the same time, without having to visit each site
separately.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet auction sites welcome the Bidder's Edge service,
seeing it as a way to attract more customers.
</P>
<P>
   But Pursglove calls it ``trespassing.'' EBay says that the
auction listings on its site are company property, even if they are
displayed on a publicly accessible Web page. In addition, Pursglove
said that the listings offered by Bidder's Edge are partial and
inaccurate, thereby harming eBay's business.
</P>
<P>
   EBay wants the auction search companies to pay a licensing fee
and follow rules that Pursglove said would ensure ``complete,
accurate and timely listings.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of other auction search services have made such an
arrangement, but Carney has refused. Carney says that Bidder's Edge
is no different from other Web page indexes, such as AltaVista or
Lycos. These services do not need the permission of each of the
millions of Web sites they index. Carney says that if eBay's suit
is successful, it would set a precedent that would undermine the
free exchange of data across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue here is really the openness of the Internet
itself,'' he said.

budget proposal built on the idea that the budget surplus will
allow the nation to have it all, from increased government spending

spending across the range of issues that have long been central to

   FRANCE-ABORTION-PILL (Trappes, France) _ The students stopping
in at the high school infirmary on a recent morning were making
their usual requests for aspirin or cold medicine. But soon they
will also be able to pick up morning after pills. Last month,
France became the first country to give its school nurses the right
to dispense emergency contraception pills. The pills are to be
available in both high schools and junior high schools. Although
the nurses are advised to make efforts to inform the child's
parents, they do not have to. French health and education officials
hope the policy will help lower unwanted pregnancies among

COMMENTARY: FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE JUST JOINING US 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The public seems to have gotten interested, temporarily, in the
presidential races. I can't tell you how exciting this is for those
of us who write about politics for a living and normally have all
the social cachet of an exterminator who specializes in mole
eradication. In case you tuned in late, here's what has happened so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 10 _ New York Republicans begin their attempt to knock Sen.
John McCain off the state's primary ballot. This is the sort of
thing New York politicians do instinctively for their candidates,
like cats laying a dead chipmunk at their owner's feet.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 22 _ Bill Bradley attributes his irregular heartbeats to
excessive consumption of cream soda.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 25 _ George W. Bush and Al Gore win the Iowa caucuses. Gary
Bauer comes in fourth. A hard-charging conservative, Bauer was
perhaps best known for calling a press conference to announce he
was not having an affair with a member of his staff, stunning
Washington insiders who were not aware he had any staff.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 27 _ Bush begins to campaign in New Hampshire, against what
he has begun to refer to as ``my worthwhile opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 30 _ Vice President Gore takes traditional hand-shaking
walks through New Hampshire towns. When a press aide calls out,
``Anybody want the name of the little girl who asked him what he
did for the poor people?'' no one responds.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 31 _ The New York Republican Party's attempts to keep John
McCain off the ballot has become a large moldering albatross around
Bush's neck. Observers mourn this blow to New York Gov. George
Pataki's vice-presidential hopes, and the chance to field a team
composed entirely of guys named George who went to Yale in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 1 _ Gore beats Bradley in New Hampshire. The McCain-loving
media report that the Arizona senator walloped Bush by 19 points.
But Karl Rove, the Bush campaign's chief strategist, explains that
his candidate had actually scored an impressive triumph, only to
see it wrested away by Too Much Turnout. ``We got nearly 72,000
votes,'' he told CNN later. ``... In a normal year it would have
given us a good victory, but when you got 235,000 people who show

   Feb. 2 _ Rove sends his candidate into South Carolina, where
Bush nails down his image as a winner by receiving the coveted
endorsement of Dan Quayle. He also appears with a bunch of retired
military men who charge that McCain was not strong on veterans'
issues. This was undoubtedly a canny attempt to remind voters that
Bush served heroically in the Texas Air National guard while McCain
lolled away the Vietnam years in a prisoner-of-war camp.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 3 _ Polls show that Bush's 20-point lead over McCain in

<TEXT>
<P>
   And you thought the days of characters uttering the phrase ``let
your light shine'' outside Hallmark city limits were behind us. No
such luck.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the significant advice a mother gives her
9-year-old daughter, Belle, in ``Knockout,'' director Lorenzo
Doumani's clunky film about pursuing one's dreams. Belle the
impressionable daughter grows up to be Belle the beautiful boxer, a
``knockout'' who _ get it? _ knocks people out.
</P>
<P>
   A smarter, more insightful film explores what a woman goes
through when she penetrates a male-dominated sport. But
``Knockout,'' written by Mark Stevens and Doumani, is neither smart
nor deep. It's a watered-down ``Rocky'' with a predictable plot and
bone-crunchingly stupid dialogue that probably should have been a
cable TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing we really learn about Belle (played as an adult
by newcomer Sophia Adella Hernandez) is she (BEGIN ITAL)needs(END
ITAL) to fight. Why? Presumably because her father (Tony Plana)
used to box before giving up a career as a golden gloves champ to
become a cop. He made this sacrifice at the request of Belle's
mother (Maria Conchita Alonso, in a cameo) who, in addition to her
``let your light shine'' advice, also concludes ``we shouldn't have
to give up the thing we love to be with the one we love.'' Which
isn't Belle's problem: Her boyfriend Mario (Eduardo Yanez) is her
trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Belle's ring quest is also spurred by seeing her pugilistic best
friend Sandra (Gina La Plana) get seriously roughed up by Tanya
``The Terminator'' Tessaro (Fredia Gibbs). You don't need the
Psychic Friends Hotline to guess Belle and the Terminator are
destined for a showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Plana has a couple of real moments, and the usually excellent
Paul Winfield sleepwalks through a role as a wheelchair-dependent
promoter. It's too early for a verdict on Hernandez's acting chops,
since, despite all her screen time, she's given surprisingly little
to work with. However, she certainly looks like she belongs in the
ring, and the fight scenes are convincing.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie feels false in so many other ways. Despite all the
talk about ``getting off the streets'' and away from gangs, East
L.A. isn't portrayed as dangerous. Our only indication that Belle,
her father and Mario have ``escaped'' a worse fate is a showdown
between the cops and a couple of kids carrying automatic weapons
that look like they're off the shelf of Toys R Us. And Belle?
Before plunging into the fight game, she's teaching aerobics at a
seniors center. How dangerous is that?
</P>
<P>
   The fault is primarily the script's, which can't deliver its
up-from-the-streets premise. Doumani may have envisioned his
heroine as ``Rocky.'' In ``Knockout,'' she comes across as little
more than a gimmick with a decent right hook. &QL;

IN FRANCE, MORNING-AFTER PILL COMES TO SCHOOL CLINICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRAPPES, France _ The students stopping in at the high school
infirmary on a recent morning here were making their usual
requests: Some wanted aspirin. Others, cold medicine. One just
wanted a place to cry because she had flunked a math test.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however _ as soon as the nurse here gets her supply _
students will also be able to pick up morning-after pills.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, France became the first country in the world to give
its school nurses the right to dispense emergency contraception
pills. The pills are to be available in high schools and junior
highs, where students are as young as 12. Although the nurses are
advised to make efforts to inform the child's parents, they do not
have to.
</P>
<P>
   French health and education officials hope the policy will help
lower unwanted pregnancies among teen-agers and reduce the
country's abortion rate, among the highest in the European Union,
and stubbornly so, as it has not dropped despite the wider
availability of contraception in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The measure has found wide support here. Women's groups and
abortion rights activists and even some parents groups see it as a
major step toward making contraception more accessible to young
people, even those who live a long way from family-planning
clinics, those who cannot afford to buy the pills and those who are
too shy to go to the local pharmacist, who may know everyone in the
village.
</P>
<P>
   The school nurse's union has also hailed the measure as a
positive step.
</P>
<P>
   Many nurses, like Chantal Broal, who runs the infirmary at the
high school here, believe they will be able to ease the burden on
terrified young girls who make mistakes. In this working-class city
on the outskirts of Paris where many of the students come from
North African immigrant families who rarely discuss sex with their
children, Broal says there are unwanted pregnancies every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a pill that can help is a lot better than standing
around with my arms at my side,'' Broal said recently between
tending to students.
</P>
<P>
   Despite days of banner headlines on the subject, few youngsters
who stopped by the infirmary even knew about the new policy.
</P>
<P>
   But even in a country that has often been a leader in
contraception issues, some parents and family rights groups are
saying the government has gone too far this time. Some say it is
usurping the role of the parent and is encouraging casual sex.
Worse still, some say, it may be inadvertently promoting the use of
the morning-after pill when the need for condoms to prevent
sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS, should be
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a complex issue,'' said Christian Ganet, the president
of Parents of Public School Students, the more conservative of the
two federations of parent associations in France, which has
denounced the school distribution program. ``There are a lot of
facets to this thing. On the one side there are advantages. If you
did a survey there is an advantage to a number of children, but
from the other side how many will begin to rely on this and become
H.I.V.-positive?''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to make the morning-after pill available to
schoolgirls follows a decision last June by the French government
to allow pharmacists to sell the medicine over the counter without
a prescription. France is also the only country to do that. To be
effective, the pill, marketed here under the brand name Norvelo,
must be taken within 72 hours of having sex. It works by preventing
a fertilized egg from implanting itself in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   Similar pills are available in the United States and about 15
countries in Europe but only with a prescription. England alone is
testing a program that would allow specially trained pharmacists to
sell such a pill without a doctor's approval.
</P>
<P>
   The Norvelo pill is not the same as RU-486, or methapristone,
which can terminate pregnancies up to 12 weeks after conception. In
its literature, the French government describes Norvelo as a ``late
contraception'' pill, though Catholic groups take offense at this.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are kidding themselves,'' said Francoise Meauze, vice
president of the National Confederation of Catholic Family
Associations. ``This is an abortion pill, too, and distributing it
like this is not right. There is a banalization of sex going on.
And of course the big danger is that the kids will just keep going
back and back again for another pill.''
</P>
<P>
   Meauze, like others who have come out against the program, said
she was shocked at the way that French government decided on
distributing the pill, after consulting hardly anyone involved.
Ganet, the leader of one parent group, said he was not informed of
the decision before it was announced.
</P>
<P>
   But French officials say the decision has been carefully thought
out, if not widely discussed. ``No decision like this is wholly
without flaws,'' said Segolene Royal, the deputy minister of
education who announced the decision at a conference for school
nurses on Nov. 26. ``But at the same time there exists a universal
morality that demands that we relieve human suffering when we
can.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   School nurses could begin dispensing the pills on Jan. 8, but
nurses were on their own to order the pills, and nothing was in
place by then in most schools.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was brought on in part by a government-commissioned
report looking into abortion practices, 25 years after abortion was
legalized here. The author of the report, Dr. Israel Nisand, a
professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Strasbourg University,
recommended the measure and the institution of sex education after
discovering that French adolescents, who receive virtually no sex
education, were horribly misinformed.
</P>
<P>
   Nisand found that many youngsters believed they could not get
pregnant until they had had sex several times. They also believe
that having sex when they are menstruating is risk-free. And, he
said, they often do not use condoms correctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who mix up a discussion about the morning-after
pill with AIDS are really masking other motives,'' Dr. Nisand said.
``Right now, the youngsters have a far greater risk of getting
pregnant and an abortion at the age of 14 is very traumatic. If you
can prevent only a few hundred of those it is a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a largely Catholic country, France has for a long time
given students confidentiality when they sought advice on
contraception, and condoms have been available in French schools
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, abortions have failed to decline in the last decade. Each
year, about 220,000 abortions are performed in France, about 6,700
on adolescents under the age of 18. In 1995, the most recent
figures available for France, 10.5 out of every 1,000 girls under
the age of 20 had an abortion, according to the World Health
Organization. By comparison, the rate of abortion in 1995 in
Germany was 6.8, in Italy, 6.3 and in Spain, 4.5. The United
Kingdom has a higher rate at 18.5.
</P>
<P>
   Former eastern bloc countries, where other forms of birth
control used to be very difficult to obtain, continue to have far
higher abortion rates, in many cases more than 30 per 1,000. In
1996, the rate of abortion among girls between the ages of 15 and
19, was 29.9 per 1,000 girls, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the students at the Lycee La Plaine de Neauphle, the
high school in Trappes, squirmed with embarrassment at the idea of
going to the infirmary to get either condoms or the morning-after
pill. ``Maybe,'' said Isabelle Sohet, 17, looking doubtful. ``If
you were in real trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   But like several other students, she wondered whether the easy
availability of the pill would make it that much harder to persuade
the boys to use a condom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know what is good policy,'' she said. ``I can
see, too, that having that pill could really save your life some
time, so this is a hard question.''
</P>
<P>
   Broal, who runs the infirmary, says she can not begin to guess
whether there will be a lot of demand for the pill. Until now, she
pointed out, girls who needed it had no reason to come see her.
``But if they know it's here,'' she said, ``they may come.''

<P>
   How does actor put on his boxing shorts? One leg at a time _
just like a real fighter.
</P>
<P>
   How do you train an actor for a role as a boxer? Work on the
fundamentals, then train him hard and pray for a knockout _ just
like you would a real fighter.
</P>
<P>
   The only difference is that you're hoping the magic will be on
the screen instead of in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   But any actor who expects to play Ali of Liston in the movies is
likely to find himself working like a dog in some secluded, sweaty
gym in the San Fernando Valley or downtown L.A. where Oscar
nominations and Juilliard training don't add up to a pile of
sawdust.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Terry Claybon, who spent 18 months training Denzel
Washington to play Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter in ``The Hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Denzel had had all types of personal trainers over the
years, so I didn't know what it was going to be like to work with
him,'' said Carter. ``When he came in, he said, `I don't know
anything. Start me from ground one. I want to learn how to fight
like a professional.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That was exactly what I wanted to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Claybon, along with a handful of fight-movie trainers have been
busy lately. In addition to ``Hurricane'' and Ron Shelton's ``Play
It To The Bone,'' which are in theaters now, there has been a
recent spate of television and film boxing projects, including two
TV biographies of Muhammad Ali. ``Knockout,'' featuring Maria
Conchita Alonso, opens today in theaters, and Karyn Kusama's
``Girlfight,'' about a high school senior who embarks on an amateur
boxing career, shared the grand jury prize at the just-completed
Sundance Film Festival. Separate feature film versions of a Sonny
Liston and Muhammad Ali biographies are also in the works. In ``The
Price of Glory,'' opening March 31, Jimmy Smits stars as a former
boxer who trains his three sons to be champion fighters.
</P>
<P>
   All of these need realistic-looking fight scenes with actors who
can pull it off. Enter a Claybon, Jimmy Nickerson, Benny Urquidez
or Darrell Foster. What these fight choreographers and trainers
have in common is that they're confident, sometimes arrogant,
telling you who they've trained and what they've accomplished in
and out of the ring. They'll never admit to being starstruck. A
client, they'll tell you, is a client.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quick look at each:
</P>
<P>
   TERRY CLAYBON: After retiring from boxing after a career that
included 39 amateur fights, three golden glove championships and an
undefeated professional record, Claybon wasn't itching to return to
a 9-to-5 job. At the Hollywood Boxing Gym, where he is an
instructor and co-owner, Claybon teaches classes and claims he can
pass on his skills to anyone. Of course it helps if you come in
with the skills of Denzel Washington who, his trainer said, might
have had a career in the ring had that been his ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had started training as a fighter at the time he was
starting off in acting, you could have flipped a coin,'' said
Claybon, who also trained the fighters for ``Knockout.'' ``He has
very fast hands and an unbelievable right.''
</P>
<P>
   Claybon and Washington worked more than a year together studying
tapes of Rubin Carter's fights. Working out two hours a day, five
days a week during that period, Washington lost more than 40 pounds
_ all for a movie that has relatively few boxing scenes.
</P>
<P>
   As he frequently does with his trainees, Claybon stresses
defense. ``To make it real, you have to have defense,'' he said.
And by teaching defense, Claybon also helps provide his trainee
with the confidence that he can avoid being hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can choreograph a scene to be just like a fight,'' said
Claybon, ``the punches will be so close, but he won't be glove shy
because he has the security of having defense.''
</P>
<P>
   While Claybon handled the moves and conditioning, Washington
took care of everything else: the attitude and confidence that he
could step into the ring and knock out any opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Denzel, I was always telling him, `when you get on the
set, your first take, this is your world championship fight,'
Claybon said. ``Believe me, the very first time he was on the set
to shoot the scene, the tension ... I've been in world championship
fights ... and the tension between him and me was like `hey, we're
going to go for a rumble. There's going to be a battle.'''
</P>
<P>
   JIMMY NICKERSON: He'll modestly tell you, ``It could have been
anybody.'' Maybe producer Irwin Winkler and director Martin
Scorsese could have picked any skilled fighter to add some realism
to their now landmark 1980 boxing film ``Raging Bull.'' But they
selected Nickerson, a professional stuntman and former amateur
fighter from Pittsburgh whom Winkler had tabbed to work with
Sylvester Stallone on the first two ``Rocky'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raging Bull'' _ which featured an Oscar-winning Robert DeNiro
as Jake LaMotta _ became a critical smash, renowned for its
realism, and it put Nickerson on the fight film map. Since then _
with the exception of ``The Hurricane,'' _ Nickerson has worked on
a film biography of every famed boxer you can think of. Most
recently he trained Terrence Howard and Steve Harris for ``King of
the World,'' the ABC version of the Muhammad Ali story.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his trainees end up sweating it out at the Ten Goose Gym
in Van Nuys, where Nickerson likes to work. His routines are
carefully choreographed and, as ``Raging Bull'' demonstrates,
unfailingly realistic. But he won't sacrifice an actor's safety for
the sake of reality. If a filmmaker actually wants his performers
to feel an authentic blow, then count this trainer out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've proven to everybody in the past and I've shown on tape
that real punches don't work as well as my movie punches,'' said
Nickerson. ``I've walked away from shows where an actor has said,
`I just want to get hit.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Then you don't need me. I don't know what else to
tell you.' If the guy breaks his nose, we have to sit in a hotel
room for two weeks waiting for it to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   BENNY ``THE JET'' URQUIDEZ: His trainees will stretch and ache
and work like crazy. But before they do, they have to answer a
deceptively simple question from Urquidez: ``Do you believe I can
help you get to where you need to be?
</P>
<P>
   ``If if comes out of their mouth, `yes,' I'll say `you've got a
working relationship,''' said Urquidez, a world champion kickboxer
in five weight divisions. ``If they say it verbally, we bond to a
hypnotic state of mind where I can get them to every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds new agey, but Urquidez _ nicknamed ``the jet'' for his
flying, spinning kicks _ likes to get into his fighters' minds, to
have his actors ``paint me a picture'' of what they're feeling or
envisioning. It helps the process of transformation, Urquidez said,
of an actor into a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   In David Ramsey, Urquidez had an eager pupil. The actor, who
plays Ali in an upcoming Fox TV movie, had a background in martial
arts and was able to develop both a physical and psychological
connection with his trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `I can't teach you the rhythms. It's already in
you,''' Urquidez said. ``All I have to do is just bring it out in a
way that you can present it.'''
</P>
<P>
   As Ramsey said, ``It sounds kind of cosmic, kind of spiritual,
and it is. Expressing yourself through fighting is very cosmic and
spiritual. Ali is a dancer who made this incredible art form
beautiful. So there was a lot of trust I placed in Benny, to learn
what does it mean to dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Ramsey's preparation wasn't all spiritual. The actor
talks about stretching and aching the likes of which he had never
before experienced. Between the five day a week workouts, the
stretching, running, sit-ups and carbohydrate restrictions, Ramsey
was ripping too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, ``Damn, Ali never looked this good,''' Ramsey said
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   DARRELL FOSTER: ``Fighting is not a game,'' Foster were tell you
pointedly.
</P>
<P>
   Ving Rhames learned that lesson while training to play Sonny
Liston. Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas learned by being on
the receiving end of a few errant punches in the early stages of
``Play it to the Bone'' training.
</P>
<P>
   And 7-year-old Spencer Breslin, co-star of an upcoming untitled
Bruce Willis film being directed by Jon Turteltaub (``Phenomenon'')
learned by hearing the words from the source.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to explain to him to stop playfighting in the street,
and if anybody on the set wanted to box around, to tell them his
coach told him he can't do that,'' said Darrell Foster, 40, trainer
to Rhames, Banderas, Harrelson and now Breslin.
</P>
<P>
   Foster spars with his clients, runs with them, and puts himself
through every move, crunch or stretch that he makes them do. In
return, he asks that his trainees _ actors and athletes alike _
respect the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Which they do. Chi McBride, who has lost 50 pounds in the past
year, expects to drop several more training with Foster to play a
training-reluctant heavyweight champ who teaches Breslin's
character to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actors are obsessive-compulsive by nature, and I think Darrell
appeals to that aspect of an actor's personality,'' a
sweat-drenched McBride said following a workout with Foster in
Santa Monica.,
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm actually doing all this,'' and here McBride raises his
voice in comic outrage so that Foster, across the room, will hear
him, ``slave driving, unmerciful training _ I must be a masochist _
to play a boxer who doesn't want to train!''
</P>
<P>
   A semi-pro boxer with 150 victories in 152 decisions, Foster was
former champion Sugar Ray Leonard's conditioning coach during much
of the 1970s. He had trained with Rhames for more than a year on
the as yet unmade Liston project when he was recommended to ``Play
It'' writer/director Ron Shelton. For that film, Foster was the
trainer and fight choreographer, and even took a role as the
referee in the climactic bout between Harrelson and Banderas.
</P>
<P>
   On location in Las Vegas, the three men stayed up late into the
night talking about boxing and acting. They would sleep in the
trailer and be up at 5 a.m. running in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are two actors who, many weeks before, had never put on
a pair of boxing gloves,'' said Foster. ``They didn't have a
fighter to carry them. They only had each other,'' he said,
downplaying his role.
</P>
<P>
   Well, and their trainer ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they had me,'' he admitted. ``They had me as the
referee.'' &QL;

``Fighting is the one sport people identify with life,'' says Ray
``Boom Boom'' Mancini. 
 
 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking for authenticity in a fight scene? Watch the feet, says
Ray ``Boom Boom'' Mancini.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one who did a great job, who moved like a fighter, was Jon
Voight in `The Champ,''' said Mancini, a former lightweight
champion, now an actor and a producer. ``His movement. That's what
I was impressed with. The feet are what I watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Through his Santa Monica-based Boom Boom Productions, Mancini
looks to produce films and develop roles for himself. He recently
played the lead in a remake of ``Body and Soul'' for The Movie
Channel. A 1985 TV movie about his life, ``Heart of a Champion''
starred Doug McKeon and Robert Blake.
</P>
<P>
   The original ``Body and Soul,'' starring John Garfield, remains
one of Mancini's favorite fight pictures, primarily for its
depiction of the business side of the fight game. ``It's about how
you get seduced by success,'' he said. ``Good guys get caught up in
it. They're calling you champ on the way in and chump on the way
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch at an Italian restaurant near his offices, the
colorful and opinionated Mancini shared his thoughts on fights,
movies and fight movies:
</P>
<P>
   On ``The Hurricane'': ``Denzel Washington gives an Academy
Award-winning performance. Knowing the real story so well, I know
the movie is slanted. So how much do you buy the rest of it?''
</P>
<P>
   On the much-rumored prospect of Will Smith playing Muhammad Ali
in a feature film: ``He's a wonderful performer, but it's hard to
think of the guy who sings `Gettin' Jiggy With It' playing Muhammad
Ali. I don't buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the most realistic fight scenes on screen: ```Raging Bull.'
Ask anyone. If you're asking what's the fight movie they
!ital!enjoyed most, most people would say `Rocky,' but if you want
realism, `Raging Bull.' Nobody had ever seen that before, the
close-ups of the action, the sweat flying off.''
</P>
<P>
   On the glut of fight films and TV projects: ``People live
vicariously through fighters. Fighting is the one sport people
identify as a parallel with life. People take their knocks and
bruises figuratively and literally. In the sport, it's literally,
but in life, too.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Knockout,'' a film about female boxers opening today: ``I
don't want to see it. It's a novelty. I don't want to see it not
because I'm chauvinistic. I was raised to think of women in a
certain way, and I do. I don't want to see a woman get smacked
around. I don't want to see a woman bleed.'' &QL;

WHEN A MONEY MACHINE NEEDS A HELPING HAND
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until reports of hundreds of millions of dollars in losses made
the headlines, few Americans had ever heard of hedge funds, the
invention of Nobel Prize mathematicians that promised to take the
risk out of investing in the stock market. To get in on a company
formed in 1992 called Long-Term Capital Management, created to
bring about that miracle, you had to invest at least $10 million
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, Long-Term Capital, in Greenwich, Conn., was a Wall
Street Wunderkind, paying as much as 43 percent in its best year.
The rich got richer. But in 1997 the company ran into deep trouble;
its investments lost prodigiously until the company was $100
billion in debt and the government and Wall Street, fearing the
effects that its collapse would have on economies around the world,
joined to save it from its own misjudgments.
</P>
<P>
   How this happened is tidily unraveled by ``Trillion Dollar
Bet,'' Tuesday night's cautionary tale about the fallibility of
experts and the unpredictability of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Turning finance into a science is the holy grail long sought by
investors big and small. In the 1970s mathematicians thought they
were moving toward that goal with a way to keep one's investment
portfolio in perfect balance with a technique they called ``dynamic
hedging.''
</P>
<P>
   For an explanation of how their system worked or was supposed to
work, see Tuesday night's ``Nova,'' which spells out somewhat
abstruse matters in an admirably lucid way. The upshot of the
theoreticians' labors, which brought a Nobel Prize to Myron S.
Scholes and Robert C. Merton in 1997, was a way to cancel out all
risks by evaluating the price of options, a kind of insurance that
permits investors to buy or sell stock at a specific price by a
specific date.
</P>
<P>
   Scholes and Merton had already joined a bond trader named John
W. Meriwether in a new firm, Long-Term Capital Management, that
would operate by the rules of their theory. Their reputations
quickly brought in $3 billion of investment money to be bet on
continuing assessments of the relationship of markets all around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   But then, in 1998, came the Asian economic panic, an event that
had never been dreamed of in the economists' mathematical models.
As one trader says Tuesday night, ``The market will test you and do
what you don't expect it to do.'' Stock prices slid and kept
sliding; on one day after Russia's economic default in August 1998,
Long-Term Capital dropped $500 million and the Federal Reserve
organized a $3.6 billion bailout by Wall Street's biggest power
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The simple lesson that the narrator is left with after all the
brilliant theorizing of the economists is, ``While models can help
us manage risk, they can never tell us when to buy or sell.''
Another lesson is that unless you are a billionaire, nobody is
going to bail you out.

DEMAND FOR TECHNOLOGY STOCKS PUSHES NASDAQ ABOVE 4,300  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Nasdaq composite index cruised to a record
Monday, as demand for technology and biotechnology stocks remained
strong.
</P>
<P>
   But the strength in technology masked another lackluster session
for most stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology and biotechnology are good and everything else is
blah,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor
Fitzgerald. ``The broader market is responding to interest rate
hikes by the Federal Reserve. There will be more of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Cisco Systems and Intel, the Nasdaq closed at 4,321.77,
up 77.63, or 1.8 percent. It was the sixth straight advance for the
index and marked the first time it has closed above 4,300.
</P>
<P>
   However, weakness in blue-chip companies like General Electric
and Alcoa pulled down the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow dropped 58.01, or 0.5 percent, to 10,905.79. Nine of its
30 components gained in price, while the remaining 21 fell. Strong
gains in Hewlett-Packard and Intel prevented the Dow from
sustaining what would have been a loss of well over 100 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was little changed,
falling 0.13 point, to 1,424.24. But strength in technology and
biotechnology shares helped to bolster the Russell 2000 index of
small company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell, which so far this year has done much better than
either the Dow or the S.&AMP; P. 500, gained 6.87, or 1.3 percent, to
532.39.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was brisk.
</P>
<P>
   More than 918 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock
Exchange. Volume on the Nasdaq stock market was 1.6 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   The continued strength in demand for technology stocks is
surprising some analysts, who point to sky-high valuations
throughout the sector as well as a long _ and growing _ list of
stocks that are trading at bargain-basement levels.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, at least, it is not an argument that many
investors seem to want to hear, or heed.
</P>
<P>
   John Manley, an equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, just
returned from a trip to visit clients in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Italians want to be in this market, and they want to own
technology,'' he said. ``That is true throughout Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Much the same seems to be true in the American heartland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am having a hard time getting anyone to listen to anything
but technology,'' said Philip S. Dow, a managing director in equity
research at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis. ``Our clients
want to be in the right stocks, and they want to be in the ones
that are moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, which is expected to issue its quarterly earnings
report after the market closes Tuesday, certainly qualifies as a
mover.
</P>
<P>
   The stock gained 4 1-16 Monday, closing at 125 3-16. From the
close of business on Jan. 28, the stock risen by more than 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among Dow stocks, General Electric shed 5 11-16, to 135~. Alcoa
fell 2 3-16, to 68 3-16. Boeing dropped 2 3-16, to 41 13-16.
</P>
<P>
   Those losses were mitigated by big gains in Hewlett-Packard,
which jumped 10], to 128], and in Intel, which gained 3 3-16, to
107 15-16.
</P>
<P>
   It was a very good day for biotechnology shares, which continued
their torrid rise.
</P>
<P>
   Among biotech companies, Amgen gained 4 9-16, to 69 3-16.
Genentech jumped 6{, to 150{. Human Genome rose 25 15-16, to 142
1-16.

<P>
   STANSTED, England _ Day and night negotiations with gunmen who
seized an Afghan jet on a domestic flight and eventually ended up
in this suburban London airport succeeded Monday in gaining the
release of eight passengers and providing supplies for those still
trapped on board.
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the hijackers and the nature of their demands
remained unclear, though reports from the Middle East said their
purpose might be to liberate an Afghan fighter jailed by the
Islamic fundamentalist Taliban movement that now rules most of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen hours into the negotiations here, the men had made no
political demands, said John Broughton, assistant chief constable
of the police in Essex County, where the airport is located.
</P>
<P>
   Three women, three men and two children left the plane by its
back steps, bringing the total of freed passengers to 27. The plane
had 186 people on board when it left the Afghan capital, Kabul,
early Sunday for an internal one-hour trip to the northern city of
Mazar-I-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   Civil aviation authorities in Kabul told Reuters that all the
passengers were Afghans, including 35 members of one family.
</P>
<P>
   The British Foreign Office, however, said it was in touch with
the embassies of other unidentified nationalities, suggesting that
some non-Afghans might have been on the plane. Britain does not
have diplomatic relations with Afghanistan, and conducts relations
with the country through Britain's High Commission in Islamabad,
Pakistan, or through the United Nations in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban's supreme leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, issued a
statement read by the movement's ambassador to Pakistan describing
the hijackers as terrorists and saying, ``We will not negotiate
with them. We will not accept their demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after takeoff at 12:30 a.m. Sunday, an estimated half
dozen armed men took control of the Afghan-state-owned Ariana
Airlines Boeing 727 and forced it to land in Tashkent, Uzbekistan,
where 10 passengers were let off. It flew on four hours later to
Aktyubinsk in Northern Kazakstan, where a fuel tank was repaired.
In Moscow, the commandeered airliner's next stop, for refueling,
nine riders were allowed off.
</P>
<P>
   On being advised shortly after midnight Monday morning that the
gunmen wanted to come to London, British authorities mobilized
specialized hijack crisis teams and directed the airliner to
Stansted Airport in Essex County, north of London, where it landed
and taxied to a secluded runway at 2 a.m. Prime Minister Tony Blair
had been awakened at 1 a.m. and told the aircraft was headed here,
and the Foreign Office had given its approval.
</P>
<P>
   Talks, aimed at calming nerves and described by airport
officials as ``fairly calm and businesslike,'' began immediately
upon the plane's arrival. John Broughton, the assistant chief
constable of the Essex police, coupled his midday announcement of
the passengers' release with a statement saying, ``We are at a very
critical stage in our negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Stansted, with a futuristic glass terminal designed by Britain's
leading architect, Sir Norman Foster, is the place designated by
security officials as the preferred location for dealing with
hijackings.
</P>
<P>
   It is less cluttered with traffic than London's two other
international airports, Gatwick and Heathrow; it offers a location
that is away from population centers, and police, military and
security personnel trained in terrorism diplomacy are close by.
</P>
<P>
   In the last such episode, in 1996, Stansted negotiators secured
the release of the crew and 197 passengers of a Sudanese Airbus
forcibly diverted here by six Iraqis on a flight from Khartoum,
Sudan's capital, to Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan plane's stop at Stansted was probably its last on
this journey, since British policy prohibits hijacked airliners
from taking to the air again. The Taliban government in Kabul urged
the British to storm the plane, but officials said that military
assault was not an option as long as lives were not in danger. They
said they would rely instead on the tactics of talking patiently,
establishing trust and exerting persuasion, approaches that have
earned Britain a reputation for ending hijacking episodes with no
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban found themselves in the middle of a hijacking
episode when an Indian Airlines flight from Nepal to New Delhi was
commandeered by gunmen on Dec. 24 and eventually landed in
Afghanistan. After days of negotiations, in which the Taliban
declined to participate, India agreed to release three imprisoned
Kashmiri militants.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers and freed militants were given 10 hours by the
Taliban to leave the country, but they have not been found and it
is not clear where they ultimately went.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers in Britain on Monday allowed baby food, fresh
water, hot meals, medicines and unidentified medical equipment to
be sent to the blue-and-white plane, parked in an isolated area
next to a perimeter fence and a hangar at the edge of the airport,
nearly a mile from the terminal building. The area has been used
before for hostage episodes.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen asked for, and received, a generator for power and
air-conditioning and the delivery of food supplies to the jet.
``There have also been requests for tea bags, cans of soft drink
and other such things to make the passengers as comfortable as they
can be,'' said Charles Clark, deputy chief constable of the Essex
force.
</P>
<P>
   As night fell, Clark said, ``This clearly remains a very
sensitive and difficult situation. We are still working toward a
peaceful resolution, and that remains our primary aim. I understand
that the occupants of the plane are as comfortable as they possibly
can be.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Broughton, asked about the progress of the negotiations, said,
``It's positive, the fact that we are talking, that we are
continuing to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rogers, a terrorism expert at the University of Bradford,
said the main goal of negotiators was to reduce tensions. The
hijackers, he said, are being told they have as much time as it
takes.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report from the Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic
Press that was not confirmed by British authorities, the hijackers
are demanding the release of Ismail Khan, 58, an Afghan opposition
figure who, though a war hero against the invading Russians a
decade ago, fell afoul of the Taliban, who now control 90 percent
of Afghanistan. He was jailed in 1997.

`TIR NA N'OG': A SPAGHETTI WESTERN SET IN AN IRISH LEGEND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, Ireland) (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``That was so good,'' a little boy said the other day
after the end of ``Tir Na n'Og'' at the New Victory Theater here.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as if someone had told him, ``You could say that again,''
he repeated his assessment: ``That was so good.''
</P>
<P>
   He was so right.
</P>
<P>
   Playing only five more performances from Friday through Sunday,
this deeply sensitive and highly imaginative production combines
Irish legend with family drama in a feat of theater that puts to
shame many a more lavish show.
</P>
<P>
   The work of the Traveling Light Theater Co. from Britain, the
70-minute intermissionless ``Tir Na n'Og'' rides on the lofty
talents of three actors and two musicians as it translates to the
stage ``Into the West,'' the fine 1993 film directed by Mike Newell
(``Enchanted April'') and written by Jim Sheridan, the director of
``My Left Foot.''
</P>
<P>
   From a bit of pipe, this production conjures a great white
horse, the windows of a Dublin housing project, the screen of a
television. From thrusting arms and voices, it summons up the sea,
hurling itself against the cliffs of a rocky shore; a tree
reluctantly surrendering its berries; and the rush of traffic in
the streets of Dublin. From a pair of sunglasses and a hand
slapping against a thigh while an actor runs, it creates a
helicopter, searching the west of Ireland for two runaway children
and a horse born of legend and love.
</P>
<P>
   Here once again, with the three actors playing all the roles and
a fiddler and an accordionist accenting and underscoring the
exciting and emotional story, is the tale of the great white horse
of Irish lore that emerges from the sea and follows a grandfather
to Dublin. There it is taken in by Finn and Ally, his two poor,
motherless grandchildren living on the 14th floor in Dublin housing
project with their father, once the king of the Gypsy-like
Travelers, now an alcoholic, mourning the death in childbirth seven
years earlier of his beloved wife, Mary.
</P>
<P>
   When the police make off with the horse and rebuff the father's
efforts to buy it back, the children learn that it is about to be
entered in an international jumping championship. They steal it
back and set off for the west, pursued by the police and their
flawed but loving father. They are made notorious by television
news and newspaper headlines that say their capture is worthy of
reward, just as in one of the spaghetti westerns that ``Tir Na
n'Og'' recreates with its keen understanding and humorous eye for
engaging detail.
</P>
<P>
   Tir Na n'Og is not only the name of the horse but also, as
Grandpa explains as he relates the legend of the warrior king Oisin
and his love, the fairy princess Niamh, a land beneath the sea off
the western coast of Ireland, where summer is eternal, and no one
grows old.
</P>
<P>
   The gifted actors Craig Edwards as Finn, Cerianne Roberts as
Ally and David Annen as Pa and Grandpa also people the stage of the
New Victory with a gallery of vivid characters, like busybody
neighbors, tough police officers with their crackling radios and
dogs, and Dubliners assessing the children as they sing (``Danny
Boy'') and beg for money to feed their horse.
</P>
<P>
   The fine instrumentalists are the fiddler Fiona Barrow and the
accordionist Thomas Johnson, who composed with music. Greg Banks is
the director and adapter who seems not to have missed an
opportunity to invest every minute of ``Tir Na n'Og'' with
memorable life in bringing it to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Even adults are likely to leave the New Victory Theater saying,
``That was so good.''

Choose from sugar, chocolate chip, peanut butter with chocolate
chips or whatever other varieties you find on your market shelf.
Some even have a valentine and heart motif.
</P>
<P>
   If you opt for baking our giant heart-shaped cookie, you can
achieve a professional look by frosting the top with Vanilla Butter
Cream Icing (tinted with pink paste food color available at cake
decorating supply or craft stores) and then piping on ``I Love
You'' (leave the frosting white), ``Be Mine'' or other desired
messages using a pastry bag and assorted tips. You can vary the
color combinations and decorations according to personal artistic
tastes (keep this idea in mind for birthday greetings, too).
</P>
<P>
   Present the cookie (overwrap carefully with plastic wrap) on a
doily-lined glass or plastic plate or cardboard base wrapped
festively in clear cellophane tied with ribbons, balloons, hearts
or flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Our cookie bouquet is a little more time consuming to prepare as
you'll need to spend some time rounding up the various elements _
such as cookie or lollipop sticks, a special cookie pan, food-safe
clear cellophane, ribbons and a box _ to present an attractive
bouquet. Also, because the cookies are fragile (you'll need to make
a few extras in case some break), a bit more patience is required
on the cook's part.
</P>
<P>
   Once baked, decorate the cookies using either the Vanilla Butter
Cream Icing or the Frosting Paint and Icing tinted colors as
desired. The butter cream is a much creamier, softer frosting than
the Frosting Paint and Icing, which dries hard.
</P>
<P>
   Gussy up the cookies immediately after frosting with assorted
candies (such as M&AMP;Ms, Red Hots, jellied hearts). When decorations
are thoroughly set, overwrap each cookie with food-safe plastic
wrap and tie with ribbons to preserve freshness. Then package
cookies as desired in a bouquet of cellophane or place atop ruffled
white or colored paper or clear shredded cellophane in a floral box
designed for long-stemmed flowers (pick one up at a flower shop).
Tie the box with a wide ribbon or a colorful bow.
</P>
<P>
   We also tested arranging some of the sturdy cookie sticks in a
piece of white plastic florist's foam cut to fit in a small, low
vase (or try a basket), which looked terrific. Plan to secure the
stems in the foam with tacky crafts glue.
</P>
<P>
   Our valentine cookie pizza, topped with coconut and assorted
red, pink and white candies, is sure to be a hit with the kids on
your list.
</P>
<P>
   For simple cut-out cookies, roll the dough out on a floured
pastry cloth or wax paper, and with cookie cutters (in the size
desired) cut out heart-shaped cookies. After baking, drizzle with
melted chocolate chips.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other ways to use refrigerator cookie dough _
from Chocolate Cookie Turtles to Sugar Cookie Fruit Tart, Linzer
Bars, Chocolate Chip Caramel Nut Bars and more. Any one of them
would make a delicious dessert offering for Valentine's Day or
other festivities throughout the year. &QL;

   PFIZER (Undated) _ On Monday, as expected, Pfizer announced that
it would buy Warner-Lambert Co. for $90 billion in stock. The
combined company, which will be called Pfizer, becomes the
second-largest drug company in the world behind Glaxo Wellcome and
SmithKline Beecham. But because it also becomes the fastest-growing
pharmaceutical company, it is expected to overtake
Glaxo-SmithKline, the British drug giant created by Glaxo Wellcome
and SmithKline Beecham, which announced their merger plans last
month.

SWEETHEART COOKIE 
 
 
1 (18-ounce) roll refrigerated sugar cookie dough, slightly
softened 
2 to 3 recipes Vanilla Butter Cream Icing (recipe follows)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grease bottom of a 9-inch heart-shaped cake pan. Line with wax
paper, cut to fit; grease paper. Press 1/2 to 3/4 of the roll of
dough evenly in pan. (Bake remaining dough separately in rounds or
as heart-shaped cookies.)
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 20 to 25 minutes, or until
golden brown and cooked through. Cool 5 minutes in pan (no longer,
or you risk not getting it out of the pan in one piece); then
loosen edges with a knife and carefully turn out onto cookie sheet
to cool completely. While warm, remove wax paper from bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Frost cooled cookie with part of Vanilla Butter Cream Icing
tinted pink with paste food color. Using a pastry bag and tube,
decorate and write message or name on cooled cookie with white
Vanilla Butter Cream Icing. Makes 1 (9-inch) cookie heart.
</P>
<P>
   GIANT COOKIE ROUND: Grease and line 1 (9-inch) round cake pan
with wax paper; grease again. Proceed as directed above.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: After cooling completely, wrap up the cookie and store it
up to a day prior to decorating, which should be competed on the
day of giving as a gift. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VANILLA BUTTER CREAM ICING
</P>
<P>
   A versatile icing. Vary the flavor and tint colors, as desired,
to complement cookies. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1/4 cup butter, room temperature &QL; 
1 cup powdered sugar &QL; 
Pinch salt &QL; 
1 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
1/2 to 1 teaspoon orange extract &QL; 
1 tablespoon whipping cream OR milk &QL; 
Paste food colors (optional)
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, beat together butter, powdered sugar, salt,
vanilla, orange extract and cream until light and fluffy. Tint with
food colors. Use to decorate cookies, either spreading on or piping
on. Makes about 1 cup icing.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Cookies'' by Natalie Hartanov Haughton (HP Books). &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
COOKIE BOUQUET
</P>
<P>
   For ease in making the cookies for the bouquet, we baked the
dough, with sticks carefully inserted at least 2 inches (or a
little more than halfway) into the center of the cookies, in a
Wilton brand Heart Cookie Treat Pan found at Michaels arts and
crafts store in Tarzana (and other locations in the Los Angeles
area).
</P>
<P>
   We thought the pan was a good investment ($7.99) as it speeded
up the cookie-on-a-stick process. You can bake six cookies at a
time in it. Bake the cookies a day in advance of decorating and
giving as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   You can attempt to make cookies on sticks without the pan, but
you'll have to experiment a little and use about a one-third cup of
dough per cookie, shaped into either rounds or hearts. For best
results, insert the sticks 2 inches into the sides of these cookies
while they are hot _ to avoid breakage _ immediately after removing
from the oven.
</P>
<P>
   The special heart pan can also be used to make crisp-rice cereal
treats and other heart-shaped goodies. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 (18-ounce) roll refrigerated chocolate-chip cookie dough &QL; 
8 (6- or 8-inch) cookie OR lollipop sticks (available at cake
decorating shops or crafts shops) &QL; 
Vanilla Butter Cream Icing (recipe above) OR Frosting Paint and
Icing (recipe follows) &QL; 
Assorted valentine candies
</P>
<P>
   Cut dough into 8 equal pieces. Press dough into heart spaces (to
top) in well-greased (you can also spray with vegetable cooking
spray) Heart Cookie Treat Pan. Carefully insert sticks at least 2
inches (or a little more than halfway) into center of cookies. (You
can bake 6 cookies at a time, depending on the size of your oven
and the length of the sticks.)
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 12 to 15 minutes (or longer)
until golden and cooked through. For best results and least
breakage, let cookies cool thoroughly in pan before carefully
removing.
</P>
<P>
   Decorate as desired using Vanilla Butter Cream Icing OR Frosting
Paint and Icing and assorted candies. Allow decorations to set
before overwrapping cookies with plastic wrap and presenting in a
cookie bouquet. Makes 8 heart cookies on sticks. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FROSTING PAINT AND ICING &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
3 tablespoons meringue powder (available at stores that sell cake
decorating supplies; we used Wilton brand) &QL; 
1 package (1 pound) powdered sugar &QL; 
7 tablespoons warm water OR more as needed to thin icing to proper
consistency &QL; 
Paste food colors
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl with a heavy-duty electric mixer, beat together
meringue powder, powdered sugar and water on medium speed about 7
to 10 minutes or until icing forms peaks.
</P>
<P>
   To use as paint, divide frosting among small bowls. (Keep any
unused frosting covered or it will dry out.) Tint each portion the
color desired with paste food colors and thin with a few drops of
warm water until mixture reaches consistency of thick paint.
</P>
<P>
   Using 1-inch-wide inexpensive artist brushes or a small knife,
paint top surface of cookies until smooth, using color desired. Let
stand until dry. If using candies for decorations, press onto
cookies now so they will adhere.
</P>
<P>
   To use as icing, divide frosting among small bowls, tinting each
portion with paste food colors desired and thinning with a tiny bit
of warm water only if necessary to pipe on icing.
</P>
<P>
   When paint on surface of cookies is dry, pipe decorations on
cookies using a pastry bag fitted with desired decorating tips and
filled with desired colors. Let cookies stand until decorations are
set and dry. Cookies are then ready to package. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VALENTINE COOKIE PIZZA &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 (18-ounce) roll refrigerated chocolate-chip cookie dough &QL; 
3/4 to 1 cup flaked OR shredded coconut &QL; 
Vanilla Butter Cream Icing (recipe above) &QL; 
Assorted valentine candies (Red Hots and M&AMP;M's, etc.)
</P>
<P>
   Slightly soften cookie dough (do in 30-second intervals in
microwave oven if using straight from fridge). Cut dough roll in 3
pieces and place on a greased 12-inch pizza pan. Press dough (with
fingers) evenly in pizza pan. Sprinkle with coconut, pressing
lightly into dough.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 13 to 15 minutes or until
golden. Cool in pan.
</P>
<P>
   Make a 4-to 5-inch diameter heart in center of cookie using
Vanilla Butter Cream Icing. Top heart with Red Hots. Sprinkle rest
of cookie with red, pink and white M&AMP;Ms. Cut cookie pizza into
wedges to serve. Makes about 10 to 12 wedges. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;

Vanilla Butter Cream Icing (recipe above), optional &QL;

each slice in half; form into a heart shape. Place 2 inches apart
onto an ungreased baking sheet.

BROWN UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT GOING TO VANDERBILT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   E. Gordon Gee, who has rattled Brown University in his two short
years as its president, shocked faculty and students on the Ivy
League campus Monday by announcing he was leaving to become
Chancellor of Vanderbilt University in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   A Mormon lawyer given to sporting bow-ties who had served as
head of three big public universities, Gee was considered the
breath of fresh air candidate when chosen in 1997. He scored points
in his interview by asking those who hired him the impertinent but
obvious question: why would an East Coast liberal bastion hire a
conservative Utah native as its president?
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, some suggested that Gee was too much fresh air,
especially in contrast to Vartan Gregorian, the academic's academic
who led Brown for a decade before.
</P>
<P>
   Gee took a more businesslike approach, announcing plans to
review all programs and eliminate ones that couldn't compete with
their peers on other top campuses. He angered faculty by announcing
programs like a $47 million initiative in brain science without
having it reviewed by key faculty committees. He sent alarms across
campus when three top administrators left within weeks of each
other last year.
</P>
<P>
   On campus in Providence, R.I. Monday, the reaction ranged from
anger and disappointment to relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was working on the fit issue, and everybody was working
with him,'' said Laura Freid, Executive Vice President for
University Relations. ``In the end, he felt he was going to be more
comfortable somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real strength of Brown is its empowered and opinionated
students, and empowered and opinionated faculty,'' Freid said. ``In
his other roles, he did much more external functions. He wasn't
used to the kind of intensity that can happen at a small
institution.''
</P>
<P>
   The average college presidency is a little more than seven
years, and usually longer at the nation's most elite schools. And
the 55-year old Gee gave no sign of leaving; less than a month ago,
his ``new'' role at Brown was featured as the cover story in the
Chronicle of Higher Education.
</P>
<P>
   A two-year presidency, said Judith McLaughlin, who runs the
seminar for new college presidents at the Harvard Graduate School
of Education, is ``unheard of,'' and often suggests the institution
and the individual were simply mismatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guess that was the case here,'' she said. ``I like
Gordron enormously, he's a very capable guy, but for him, Brown
represented a foreign culture, and for Brown he represented a
stranger. That kind of learning about each other that happens in
the first two years was taking place, it was a bit messier than one
would have hoped it might be. Given the chance to go somewhere that
was a better fit, I'm not surprised he would.''
</P>
<P>
   A college president at age 37, Gee was at Ohio State when he was
named to the Brown presidency in 1997, and had served as president
of the University of Colorado system and West Virginia University
before that. A lawyer, he did not have a PhD, and was part of
something of a trend in higher education to seek presidents with
non-academic backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Brown might have guessed his tenure would be short; Gee's
previous presidencies had been about 5 years each. As Freid said,
``He's not a marathon runner.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he arrived, Gee told reporters this was the last
university presidency he would take. And he appeared to have
success, raising $109 million during his first full year in office,
double what was raised in the previous two years. He adopted a
folksy style with students, often inviting them to dinner. And
arguing that a college president should be a public figure _ a role
neglected by many in recent years _ he chaired the committee to
choose the new superintendent for the Providence Public Schools.
</P>
<P>
   But he also made faculty suspicious with plans to revamp
graduate education and trim academic programs that weren't
successful. He argued that if the programs weren't the best in the
country, there was no use having them at Brown. But while this was
a move that might be expected under constraints of a state budget,
it was considered almost crass at a private school, and certainly
in the Ivy League.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Gee told reporters in Nashville that leaving Providence
was one of the most difficult decisions he has had to make, but
praised Vanderbilt as ``a special place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He simply met an opportunity and an excitement at Vanderbilt
that he couldn't resist,'' said Stanley Ikenberry, president of the
American Council on Education and a Gee friend.
</P>
<P>
   Gee plans to leave in April to take his new job in August,
replacing Joe Wyatt, who has been chancellor for 18 years. Brown
officials said an interim president will be named by April, and a
search committee by the end of February.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dazzle someone special this Valentine's Day with a homemade
show-stopping creation from the heart _ and the kitchen. Although
these edible valentine ideas look glamorous, they don't require all
day to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   These sweets for your sweetie rely on a shortcut _ rolls of
refrigerated cookie dough. Turn them into a giant heart-shaped
cookie, a bouquet of cookies (on sticks), a cookie pizza,
individual heart-shaped chocolate chip cookies and more. The
novelty and attractiveness of it all is bound to impress _ and show
you really care.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes are designed to fit into your schedule. Keep in mind
that some of the cookies can be made a day in advance and decorated
on the day of giving as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   Pick up a roll of refrigerated dough in your favorite flavor.
Choose from sugar, chocolate chip, peanut butter with chocolate
chips or whatever other varieties you find on your market shelf.
Some even have a valentine and heart motif.
</P>
<P>
   If you opt for baking our giant heart-shaped cookie, you can
achieve a professional look by frosting the top with Vanilla Butter
Cream Icing (tinted with pink paste food color available at cake
decorating supply or craft stores) and then piping on ``I Love
You'' (leave the frosting white), ``Be Mine'' or other desired
messages using a pastry bag and assorted tips. You can vary the
color combinations and decorations according to personal artistic
tastes (keep this idea in mind for birthday greetings, too).
</P>
<P>
   Present the cookie (overwrap carefully with plastic wrap) on a
doily-lined glass or plastic plate or cardboard base wrapped
festively in clear cellophane tied with ribbons, balloons, hearts
or flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Our cookie bouquet is a little more time consuming to prepare as
you'll need to spend some time rounding up the various elements _
such as cookie or lollipop sticks, a special cookie pan, food-safe
clear cellophane, ribbons and a box _ to present an attractive
bouquet. Also, because the cookies are fragile (you'll need to make
a few extras in case some break), a bit more patience is required
on the cook's part.
</P>
<P>
   Once baked, decorate the cookies using either the Vanilla Butter
Cream Icing or the Frosting Paint and Icing tinted colors as
desired. The butter cream is a much creamier, softer frosting than
the Frosting Paint and Icing, which dries hard.
</P>
<P>
   Gussy up the cookies immediately after frosting with assorted
candies (such as M&AMP;Ms, Red Hots, jellied hearts). When decorations
are thoroughly set, overwrap each cookie with food-safe plastic
wrap and tie with ribbons to preserve freshness. Then package
cookies as desired in a bouquet of cellophane or place atop ruffled
white or colored paper or clear shredded cellophane in a floral box
designed for long-stemmed flowers (pick one up at a flower shop).
Tie the box with a wide ribbon or a colorful bow.
</P>
<P>
   We also tested arranging some of the sturdy cookie sticks in a
piece of white plastic florist's foam cut to fit in a small, low
vase (or try a basket), which looked terrific. Plan to secure the
stems in the foam with tacky crafts glue.
</P>
<P>
   Our valentine cookie pizza, topped with coconut and assorted
red, pink and white candies, is sure to be a hit with the kids on
your list.
</P>
<P>
   For simple cut-out cookies, roll the dough out on a floured
pastry cloth or wax paper, and with cookie cutters (in the size
desired) cut out heart-shaped cookies. After baking, drizzle with
melted chocolate chips.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other ways to use refrigerator cookie dough _
from Chocolate Cookie Turtles to Sugar Cookie Fruit Tart, Linzer
Bars, Chocolate Chip Caramel Nut Bars and more. Any one of them
would make a delicious dessert offering for Valentine's Day or
other festivities throughout the year. &QL;

A FLEDGLING PUBLISHER WILL RUSH YELTSIN BOOK INTO PRINT
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: also moved in `e' category) 
(nk) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than a month after ceding power, Boris Yeltsin is preparing
to publish his memoirs of two tumultuous terms as president of the
Russian republic with a new American publisher that has offered the
enticement of speed rather than an outsize advance.
</P>
<P>
   With a handshake at his villa outside Moscow, Yeltsin, 69,
agreed last month to publish his memoirs, tentatively titled
``Midnight Diaries,'' with the co-writer from his previous two
books, Valentin Yumashev, a former Russian magazine journalist who
was a chief of staff in Yeltsin's administration. The book is
scheduled to appear in stores in October.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was a coup for the 2-year-old publisher PublicAffairs,
which was the only American company considered by Yeltsin's
London-based literary agent, Andrew Nurnberg, who shunned the
traditional ritual of courting the richest publishers for the most
generous advance. In October, Nurnberg approached Peter Osnos, the
publisher of PublicAffairs, with a proposal, and a few months later
Osnos, who is fluent in Russian, was flying to Moscow to meet with
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is of the essence for a memoir of this kind,'' Nurnberg
said. ``This is not going to be a long, portentous philosophical
tract. This is going to be a personal, vivid account told from the
heart about his recent years in office, trials and tribulations,
the disappointments. And that should be published as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? It was Harold Wilson, the British prime minister, who
once said that `a week in politics is a long time.' The publishingindustry has seen to it, regrettably over the years, that if they
leave political memoirs too long in the making the sales are very
much lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Nurnberg and Osnos would not reveal the amount of Yeltsin's
advance, although Nurnberg said it was significant. Nurnberg
retained the power to sell the foreign rights to the book, which
are considered likely to generate more income than Yeltsin would
earn from his American sales.
</P>
<P>
   Osnos, who was a foreign correspondent in the Soviet Union for
The Washington Post before becoming an editor at Random House,
edited Yeltsin's last book, ``The Struggle for Russia,'' which was
published in 1993 by Times Books, then an imprint of Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Osnos left Random House to found PublicAffairs, which
specializes in nonfiction titles that the company can publish
quickly. For example, PublicAffairs produced copies of the Starr
report, about President Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, hours after it became available. It also published a
title by the international financier George Soros after he
abandoned a slower-moving publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin is expected to provide a much more personal account in
this memoir than he did in his previous books, written when he was
constrained by his political positions. The book grows out of
late-night conversations between Yeltsin and Yumashev while he was
in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``He intends to talk about everything, including the allegations
of corruption,'' Osnos said, adding that Yeltsin envisioned a book
that he described as being ``fresh like a great meal so it should
make people want more.''
</P>
<P>
   Osnos said: ``It's very clear that it's not meant to be some
theoretical tract, but a personal account of these first two terms
in Russian democracy. And he clearly wants to tell that story in a
very personal way.''
</P>
<P>
   That means that Yeltsin will also explore the dramas in his
recent political career, from the conflict in Chechnya to his
health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Are these health problems behind the rush to publish Yeltsin's
memoirs? Nurnberg and Osnos said that Yeltsin appears to be
thriving since leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Yeltsin regularly, two or three times a year,'' Nurnberg
said. ``He was doing quite poorly in the autumn, but when I saw him
the other day he literally looked like a man with a weight that had
been lifted from his shoulders. He was energetic, joking all the
while and very, very spirited. His health has been a problem, a
considerable problem.''

CNN'S MITCHELL TABBED TO TAKE HELM AT PBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pat Mitchell, a top executive at CNN who launched her television
career as an entertainment reporter in Boston, was named Monday the
first female president and chief executive officer of the Public
Broadcasting Service.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Mitchell, a highly respected producer whose
documentaries have won 41 Emmys and who most recently oversaw CNN's
24-hour ``Cold War'' series, was hailed as a step toward
revitalizing PBS's staid image in the face of increasing
competition from cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could not have done better,'' said a CNN political
analyst, Jeff Greenfield. ``PBS needs an infusion of energy and
drive and ability to get things from the conceptual stage to the
screen much faster. She's the type who can cut a lot of Gordian
knots.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Charren, a longtime TV activist and board member at
WGBH-TV (Channel 2), Boston's public television station, added:
``She has managed big systems, she has produced documentaries _
which is the product of PBS _ and she's produced news. And she's
always been a savvy dame.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Mitchell called the post the
``realization of a dream'' and vowed that PBS, under her
leadership, will ``find a stronger niche'' in the multichannel TV
universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``PBS has an opportunity to stand out even more,'' she said.
``We have a high mission here, and we're going to deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mitchell, 57, assumes the reins at a challenging time for
public broadcasting. The system has been whipsawed between charges
of commercialism on the one hand, and what PBS supporters see as
chronic underfunding by Congress on the other.
</P>
<P>
   A funding increase was thrown into temporary jeopardy last year
_ and longstanding charges of liberal bias at PBS were resurrected
on Capitol Hill _ when it was revealed that local stations,
including WGBH-TV (Channel 2), had shared donor lists with
political organizations, most of them Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell replaces Ervin S. Duggan, who resigned in September, on
the day that an inspector general released a 31-page report about
the list-swapping practice. PBS officials have maintained that
Duggan's resignation was not related to the flap.
</P>
<P>
   However, that controversy tarnished the PBS image, and it
occurred in the context of tensions between PBS and member stations
over programming control and the direction of public broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very serious problems between the stations and
PBS,'' said a former PBS president, Lawrence Grossman. ``It's a
daunting undertaking she's got to deal with, both internally and
externally.''
</P>
<P>
   When she takes over on March 1 as the fifth PBS president in the
system's 31-year history, Mitchell will be in overall charge of 346
public TV stations. The initial response from some of those PBS
stations was positive Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Abbott, general manager at Channel 2, said Mitchell is
well-equipped to lead PBS because of her documentary background and
because she comes to public broadcasting from ``the cable
universe'' _ the source of much PBS competition.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's resume is notable for the array of on- and off-screen
positions she has held. From 1972 to 1977, she was an arts and
entertainment reporter at WBZ-TV (Channel 4), where she also
coanchored the 5:30 p.m. news, produced a political program, and
hosted a daily talk show called ``Woman '75.''
</P>
<P>
   Channel 4 anchor Jack Williams, who was briefly teamed with
Mitchell on an early-evening newscast, recalled her as smart,
fun-loving, and ``one of these people you have to be careful not to
underestimate.''
</P>
<P>
   NECN anchor Tom Ellis, who anchored the news at Channel 4 when
Mitchell worked there, described her as ``a perpetual-motion
machine'' and said it was always ``pretty clear she had abilities
above and beyond doing features on the 6 and 11 o'clock
newscasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell left Boston in 1977 for an interview show at WTTG-TV in
Washington. Over the next several years, she hosted several local
and syndicated talk shows, including ``Hour Magazine,'' and also
was a correspondent and substitute anchor on NBC's ``Today'' show
as well as an arts reporter on CBS's ``Sunday Morning.'' In 1983,
she formed her own production company and began hosting ``Woman to
Woman,'' a syndicated talk show.
</P>
<P>
   But her attention was increasingly devoted to producing. After
several years of developing documentaries and specials, Mitchell
joined Turner Broadcasting Inc. in 1992, and soon was in charge of
producing nonfiction programs for TBS and TNT, including
prizewinning documentaries such as ``A Century of Women.'' In 1997,
Mitchell was named president of CNN Productions and Time Inc.
Television.
</P>
<P>
   It was CNN founder Ted Turner who asked Mitchell to serve as
co-executive producer of ``Cold War,'' a job that consumed her
energies for four years.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday, Mitchell said she told Turner last
Monday that she might soon be put in charge of PBS. Turner's
response, according to Mitchell, was: ``You mean the whole thing?''
</P>
<P>
   Though she left Boston professionally more than two decades ago,
Mitchell retains some local roots: She sits on the advisory board
of Radcliffe's Schlesinger Library on the History of Women, and is
a member of the Women's Leadership Advisory Council of the John F.
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.

SOFTWARE FIRMS IN $3.9 BILLION MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Silknet Software Inc. of Manchester, N.H., has
agreed to be acquired by Kana Communications Inc., a California
software company, for $3.9 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, the latest in a wave of mergers and acquisitions to
sweep through the world of Internet commerce, is notable because it
involves two tiny companies that have less than $90 million in
combined annual revenue but have nevertheless ignited the stock
market's fancy for companies that sell so-called e-commerce
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Silknet, founded in 1995, sells software that lets companies
manage communications with their customers regardless of whether an
exchange took place via e-mail, on a Web site, by telephone, or in
person. Silknet clients, for example, use the company's software to
let customers track orders over the Internet, receive support over
the phone, or get marketing materials in an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Kana, based in Redwood City, Calif., is in the business of
helping companies such as eBay Inc. and Ford Motor Co. manage large
volumes of e-mail to and from customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds preposterous, but the vast majority of companies on
the Internet have no idea who their customers are, what they're
buying, and whether they would be likely to return and buy
something else,'' said George Godfrey, director of research at ING
Barings in New York City.``Silknet and Kana look to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two companies are gearing up for a battle with
market leader, Siebel Systems Inc. in San Mateo, Calif., whose
annual revenue of $791 million is nearly 10 times that of Silknet
and Kana combined, but whose market capitalization of $19.4 billion
is just twice that of the two upstarts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the case of the Internet mouse that roared,'' said Bob
Chatham, senior analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the mouse needs to get larger in order to survive
in the field of customer relations management, Chatham said.
Companies interact with customers via phone, Internet, mail, and in
person to market, sell, and provide support.Few firms have been
able to master all those fronts, he said. Monday's deal combines
Kana's expertise with Internet-based exchanges and Silknet's
strength in phone-based communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about getting big,'' said Dave Fowler, vice president of
marketing for Silknet. ``In this game, you have to get big or go
home. In order to double through normal growth, we would have had
to find 250 new people to hire into our organization. Instead,
we've instantly doubled our size without the pain of having to go
out and recruit those people.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger, which is expected to be completed by the end of
June, will produce a company with 600 employees and 450 customers,
including ETrade, William-Sonoma, and Microsoft. More than 175
employees, primarily Silknet workers, will be based in New England.
The companies have no plans for layoffs or for moving any of their

</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the opposite is true. We plan to aggressively grow
our presence,'' Gainey said. ``We're very excited to be in New
England.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Silknet, which is 18 percent owned by venture capital
company CMGI Inc. of Andover, Mass., have surged more than 12-fold
since its debut on the Nasdaq May 4 at 15. Kana, which also went
public at 15 a share on Sept. 21, has swelled 16-fold.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Silknet shares rose 44 13/16 on the Nasdaq market to
close at 183 5/16; Kana's stock fell 18 3/8 on the Nasdaq to 240
1/2.
</P>
<P>
   These sky-high valuations help boost the dollar value of Kana's
$3.9 billion acquisition of Silknet. The transaction is based on a
stock swap, in which Kana is expected to issue 16.4 million shares
of its stock, valued at $4.2 billion, to acquire Silknet.

   ``Investors have been paying a premium price for Internet
companies, and this is just a reflection of that,'' Godfrey said.
``That's why only Internet companies are the only ones that can
afford to buy other Internet companies.''

FBI LOOKING AT SLAYING OF PROVIDENCE POLICE SERGEANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ In moves that significantly widen the probe
into the slaying of police Sergeant Cornel Young Jr., the Federal
Bureau of Investigation entered the case Monday, and the Rhode
Island attorney general has asked for an independent panel to study
ways to prevent similar deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Barry W. Mawn, special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston
office, said his office has opened a ``preliminary inquiry'' into
possible civil rights violations in Young's death. The FBI, he
said, will ``follow and review'' the separate investigation by the
Rhode Island attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI will not interview witnesses at this time, Mawn said;
however, if the probe leads to prosecution, the FBI would turn the
case over to the US attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse announced that
he will appoint nine law officers as special agents to assist a
grand jury conducting an inquiry of the case here.
</P>
<P>
   Those agents, including six officers from the Providence Police
Department, will investigate Jan. 28 fracas which led two
Providence officers to open fire on Young after mistaking him for
an armed suspect.
</P>
<P>
   In the the first-ever use of such resources in Rhode Island, the
agents will compile, review, and present evidence for the grand
jury. Bound by secrecy, they will answer directly to Whitehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Young, the son of the highest-ranking black officer on the
Providence police force, was off-duty but drew his weapon and
rushed to aid two officers confronting an allegedly armed man
outside an all-night restaurant. Minority activists have questioned
whether the officers, Carlos A. Saraiva and Michael Solitro III,
instantly assumed Young was a suspect because he was black.
</P>
<P>
   Police have not identified the races of Saraiva or Solitro.
</P>
<P>
   In a shift, Whitehouse now says that he supports pending
legislation that would require State Police to compile statistics
on traffic stops that could show whether troopers
disproportionately target minority motorists.
</P>
<P>
   His concerns that such a study might create divisions,
Whitehouse said, have become secondary to a greater need to build
trust between minorities and police.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the attorney general had backed a voluntary plan
that would identify and decrease racial profiling as well as
encourage recruitment of more minority police officers throughout
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehouse, however, rejected calls to recuse himself from the
investigation; some black clergy and activists demanded that he
step down to guarantee investigative independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, it is particularly important that the course and
administration of justice not be influenced by public ultimatums,
however well-intentioned,'' Whitehouse said.
</P>
<P>
   Aldrin Diaz of Providence, who police allege had brandished a
pistol at the scene, has been charged with felony murder in Young's
death for provoking the incident, even though he obeyed commands
and dropped his gun before Young was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford R. Montiero, president of the Providence chapter of the
NAACP, said he will convene an emergency meeting of the group's
executive board to study the new investigative plan.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, the Rhode Island Minority Police
Association unveiled several demands it has presented to Police
Chief Urbano Prignano Jr. and the police union.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that the ``majority of police officers
respect and serve our communities with great pride,'' Providence
police Sergeant Tonya King, association president, said the
department must admit it has ``racist individual officers'' and
that racial profiling _ assigning greater criminal suspicion based
on race _ exists among its ranks.
</P>
<P>
   That demand, she said, is intended to create a mechanism to
purge Rhode Island police departments of racist officers, closely
screen recruits and educate officers on cultural diversity.
</P>
<P>
   King said that Prignano and the executive board of the Fraternal
Order of Police have agreed to address these demands, which were
endorsed by Young's parents, Providence Major Cornel Young Sr. and
Leisa Young. Providence Police spokesman Major Martin Hames, could
not be reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The officers who shot Young, Carlos A. Saraiva and Michael
Solitro III, have been placed on paid leave. Whitehouse urged that
the public not prejudge the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The processes of law enforcement have been honed by history to
protect the rights of defendants, and should not be set aside
lightly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both King and Leisa Young urged activists to have patience with
the investigation. Last week, 300 demonstrators rocked City Hall,
heckled Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr. and demanded Saraiva and
Solitro turn in their badges.
</P>
<P>
   The protests, however, have prompted several threatening calls
against activists and minority organizations.
</P>
<P>
   King said a black officer at the police academy got an anonymous
call: ``You're next.'' When minority officers tried to file a
complaint, King said, they were greeted with ``hostility'' at the
Providence Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   King added that the complaint was withdrawn initially because
the association did not believe it would be handled properly.
Prignano has been made aware of the threat, she said, and a probe
is under way.

N.E. FISHERMEN SLATED FOR $38M IN AID IN CLINTON BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New England fishermen would get a $38 million aid
package to ease the burden of federal restrictions on local
fisheries under President Clinton's 2001 budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes $12 million for a ``cooperative
management'' program to hire fishermen for industry-related
research. The idea is to help struggling fishermen with jobs while
also giving them more of a say in fisheries management by involving
them in the research, according to aides to Senator Edward M.
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Another $7 million would go for job training and counseling for
those fishermen needing to find new work; $10 million would be
available for a vessel buy-back program and other emergency aid for
fishermen. There would be $2.5 million on hand to help fishing
communities make infrastructure repairs, and $6.6 million in
low-interest loans so fishermen could refit their boats.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the country has been buoyed by the nation's record
economic growth, New England fishermen have been hard hit by
federal rules restricting fishing in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 Sustainable Fisheries Act, New England fishermen
were drastically restricted in the number of hours they could fish.
The law was a response to record low levels of fish in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Some fishermen are finding it virtually impossible to make a
living under those restrictions, and entire communities have been
affected by the conservation law.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry said he was very pleased by the inclusion
of the aid in Clinton's budget _ an item members of the New England
congressional delegation had fought hard to get. But getting the
aid passed by the Republican-controlled Congress will be a fight,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts and the region generally did well under the
Clinton budget, members of the congressional delegation said. While
there may have been a few cases in which senators and
representatives had gotten less money than they asked for
particular programs, the White House generally accommodated New
England concerns, aides to members of Congress said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had lobbied hard for catastrophic coverage of
prescription drugs and got the item included in the budget, aides
in his office said.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts defense companies may also get a chunk of defense
contracts; the budget calls for 42 Hornet fighter planes, at a cost
of $3 billion. The engines for those planes are made by General
Electric Co.'s Aircraft Engine Division, based in Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   Other regional projects included in the fiscal 2001 budget are:
</P>
<P>
   --$33 million to continue construction of the South Boston Piers
Transitway, an underground bus tunnel linking South Station and the
South Boston Piers area.
</P>
<P>
   --$75 million for the YouthBuild program to help disadvantaged
youth find jobs and affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   --Nearly $10 million for rehabilitation and preservation of
various historic sites and national recreation areas, including $1
million to complete the rehabilitation of the St. Joseph's Polish
Club in Salem, Mass., and $3,253,000 for the Cape Cod National
Seashore.
</P>
<P>
   --$350,000 for the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth to
improve weed and pest control of cranberry crops. Cranberries are
the state's number one agricultural crop.

BUSH INSISTS HE IS THE REAL REFORMER, QUESTIONS MCCAIN'S
`RESULTS' 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also DEL-PRIMARY, MCCAIN-MICH) 
(nk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY with FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. _ Signaling a new, aggressive tone to his campaign
Monday, Gov. George W. Bush proclaimed that he was the true
reformer in the Republican field and portrayed his chief opponent,
Sen. John McCain, as someone who ``says one thing and does
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain has been wearing the reform mantle throughout
his campaign, Bush on Monday called himself ``a reformer with
results'' and pointed to his record as the governor of Texas on
issues like education, taxes and civil justice to justify the
claim.
</P>
<P>
   And in the wake of his 18-point loss to McCain in the New
Hampshire primary, he conceded that he had failed to define himself
in the eyes of voters there and asserted that McCain distorted his
proposed tax cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got defined,'' Bush said at a news conference. ``Those days
are over with. You can cut it any way you want, but I'm going to
take it to him, I'm going to take it to him. I'm not going to let
this happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   In a swing through Delaware the day before the state's
Republican primary, Bush used the news conference to raise
questions about McCain's credentials as an agent of reform, and
criticized him for accepting campaign contributions from lobbyists
for companies that have business before the Senate Commerce
Committee, which McCain heads.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, citing a news report but not giving its source, claimed
that the Arizona senator had received ``more money than anybody''
from Washington lobbyists. ``On the one hand he preaches campaign
finance reform. On the other hand he passes the plate,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington said
campaign finance records through the first three quarters of 1995
indicate that Bush received almost five times as much money from
lobbyists and their immediate families as McCain. His aides later
explained that Bush was referring to a report in The Wall Street
Journal that said that among the candidates, McCain had the highest
percentage of total campaign contributions from lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's escalating fight with McCain has also been reflected over
the airwaves in South Carolina, the site of the next major
Republican primary, on Feb. 19. On Friday, Bush began running a
commercial that accused McCain of distorting elements of the
governor's tax cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   And Monday, McCain, using the harshest language of any political
ad so far this political season, began running an ad accusing Bush
of negative campaigning. The spot ends with the line: ``Do we
really want another politician in the White House America can't
trust?''
</P>
<P>
   That prompted a response from Bush's spokesman Ari Fleischer,
who said: ``Suggesting that Gov. Bush is as dishonest as Bill
Clinton is a disservice to our party and our principles. Our nation
has been through enough and John McCain's ad has gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Bush's stinging loss in New Hampshire and his sagging
poll numbers in South Carolina, Bush spent the weekend in Texas,
where he and his aides plotted a response to McCain's rising
popularity. The new theme became quickly evident as Bush arrived at
a luncheon sponsored by local Republican officials in Dover _ and
it was strikingly similar to McCain's campaign hallmarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Reformer with Results,'' announced a large blue and white
sign. Bush also shortened and revised his stump speech, leaving
more time for questions and answers, which the campaign dubbed
``One on One'' sessions. Again and again, Bush described himself as
a reformer, always careful to add the phrase ``with results.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as Bush and his campaign struck out in a slightly new
direction, they kept one wheel on the old track.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign announced Monday that the Texas governor's parents
would be back out on the campaign trail this week. Former President
Bush has one event scheduled in Michigan on Tuesday and and three
on Wednesday; Barbara Bush has three appearances scheduled in
Virginia on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Their appearance with the governor at a rally three days before
the New Hampshire primary was widely criticized by political
strategists and even a few people affiliated with the Bush campaign
as an ill-conceived publicity stunt that fed notions that Bush was
trying to inherit, not earn, the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It did not help that Bush spoke for just a few minutes, making
no case for himself other than his bloodline. Additionally, his
father's reference to him as his ``boy'' arguably diminished the
governor's stature.
</P>
<P>
   Bush advisers said there had been top-level discussions about
the wisdom of using the former president and first lady as
surrogate campaigners, and that the consensus was that the couple
should no longer appear with the governor, but remained useful
campaigners on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a net plus,'' said one adviser, alluding to the
couple's popularity in many key states. ``It also helps up
establish ourselves as the alternative to Clinton by reminding
people: This is what you had.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few Republican strategists said that the Bush campaign was
playing a dangerous game with its use of surrogates and its parade
of endorsements, essentially urging voters to support Bush simply
because so many other people do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten to the point where the issue of Bush's gravitas
and abilities as a candidate are the driving issues of the
campaign,'' said one strategist. ``Having his parents work for him
doesn't address those.''
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance here Monday, Bush, while not using the word
hypocrite to describe his opponent, criticized the senator for
making campaign finance the centerpiece of his campaign while
taking contributions from lobbyists with business before his
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're tired of no results and simple, empty rhetoric,''
Bush told the lunch crowd, ``If you're tired of people who say one
thing and do another, come join our team.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain chose not to campaign in Delaware, focusing his resources
on South Carolina. Bush is the favorite in Delaware, where his main
challenger is Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's luncheon, the governor sought to highlight McCain's
absence, saying: ``I look forward to going to every primary.''

 &HT;    Fall-Winter 2000 shows
 &HT;    Girl power runs amok on catwalk

   NEW YORK _ More and more it seems as if Fashion Week is governed
by females who are barely old enough to vote.
</P>
<P>
   They are the headset-wearing guardians at the gates to the
runway shows; the groupies whose gate-crashing techniques cause
every show to start 30 minutes later than scheduled; ``interns''
for the deputy assistant market editor at (take your pick) magazine
and the roommates of the headset-wearing gate guardians.
</P>
<P>
   Girls rule. Who cares if they can't vote as long as they can
spend. That's why _ for the sixth straight year _ Monday's ``Girls
Rule!'' presentation of five up-and-coming brands was one of the
hottest invitations in town. Among girls, at least.
</P>
<P>
   The event is sponsored by Teen magazine, if that tells you
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Roaste Chuck's was my favorite of the five short shows. At one
point, a model stripped (clumsily) down to her sheer, floral-print
pantyhose to prove the inside-out wearability of Roaste Chuck
jeans. The brand's design chief, Toshi Hosogai, has nearly
perfected the most consumer-conscious of concepts: two stylish
garments for the price of one. His designs made some of the other
brands look amateurish (T-shirt sleeves as bras) at worst, and
contrived (Velcro skateboarding skirts) at best.

 &HT;    A report on fall-winter clothes
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The decidely dressy fall/winter 2000 designs that
Carolina Herrera previewed Monday under the big tent at Bryant Park
drew mixed reviews. That's noteworthy because Herrera's shows
usually draw unanimous approval from Central Park socialites,
cynical fashion critics and sassy ``downtown'' girls alike.
</P>
<P>
   The glitz and glamour typical of Herrera's collections were all
there: Mink was shown prominently, as was drop-dead beading and
embroidery. Still, some in the standing-room-only crowd left
feeling something was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Hart, the critic who appears rather regularly with Herrera
on E! Network programs such as ``Fashion Emergency'' raved.
Predictably. But Kaye Davis, fashion director for Atlanta's apparel
mart (AmericasMart) did not.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said she thought there wasn't enough color: 32 of the 49
outfits were either black, tan or gray. But Hart contended, ``I
promise you, they'll be available in more colors. (Herrera's)
Latin, like me. She loves color.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said Herrera's fur coats and jackets _ in vertical or
chevron stripes in contrasting shades of mink and sable _ looked
somewhat dated. Hart: ``Once again she's made beautiful clothes for
women who want to look and feel beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the looks shown reach the stores next fall, the jury will
remain out. Determining factors will be whether or not women like
tight, shiny blouses; slinky leather pantsuits in colors like
shocking pink and flaming orange; low-slung pants that hug the legs
all the way down to the front-slit ankles; tailored jackets cropped
just above the derriere; and backless halters and dresses with long
scarves trailing from the hips, neck or shoulders.

CLINTON OFFERS FAR-REACHING $1.8 TRILLION FEDERAL BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Looking decades beyond his administration and to
the presidential campaign at hand, President Clinton Monday sent
Congress the final budget of his final term: a $1.84 trillion
spending plan that aims to give tax breaks to some families, help
seniors pay for prescription drugs and yet wipe out all publicly
held federal debt by 2013.
</P>
<P>
   The budget, for the year that starts Oct. 1, includes a variety
of proposals already rejected by Congress. Republicans denounced it
as a political document designed to boost Vice President Al Gore's
bid for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Clinton's plan is sure to help shape the budget
debate in a year when spending proposals and politics are tightly
entwined. Democrats are already promoting Clinton's tax breaks for
child care, ill seniors and the college-bound _ ideas they believe
will win favor with voters _ while Republicans say Clinton's
rejection of a larger tax cut is a key reason to elect GOP
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin optional trim) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The president's plan offers mixed news for New England. With
many local hospitals and nursing homes already losing money, he
would reduce payments to health providers to shore up the finances
of Medicare. The president would cut Medicare payments to the
providers by nearly the same amount Congress recently added to the
program to help them, industry groups said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would essentially undo a good portion of the hard work
that our congressional delegation fought for last fall,'' said Judy
Glasser of the Massachusetts Hospital Association.
</P>
<P>
   The budget proposal does include a one-year boost for children's
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton plan would significantly increase engineering and
medical research, a likely gain for New England university and
hospital labs. It would send money to troubled New England fishing
communities. It does not change the financial picture for the Big
Dig, which was funded in a six-year plan that Congress approved
1998.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end optional trim) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The budget and explanatory notes _ all 2,700 pages _ can be
viewed on the Internet at www.gpo.gov/usbudget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a balanced budget with a balanced approach to our
national priorities,'' Clinton said Monday. ``It maintains our
fiscal discipline, pays down the debt, extends the life of Social
Security and Medicare and invests in our families and our future.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said there was no way Clinton could do all that
while putting more money into his favorite spending programs.
Discretionary spending, or money spent outside of Social Security
and Medicare, would rise 3.9 percent over 2000 levels, or about 1
percentage point more than inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's budget is a paradox. How can we pay down the
debt with a budget that substantially expands the size and scope of
the federal government?'' asked House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert,
Republican of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also said many of Clinton's spending proposals were
aimed at traditional Democratic constituencies, and therefore at
Democratic hopes in the fall elections. The White House summary of
the budget, in fact, calls it a ``Clinton-Gore'' document.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to working with the president in putting
together a serious spending proposal,'' said Senate Budget
Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, Republican of New Mexico. ``But
this is a document designed to help Al Gore win election.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has all things for everyone they feel they'll need to get
Al Gore elected president,'' said Representative John Kasich, the
Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the budget proposal is remarkable as the opening salvo in
a fight that was wholly unanticipated only a few years ago _ a
battle over how to spend billions of dollars in federal budget
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton anticipates that the government will raise $746 billion
in surplus revenues over 10 years from sources other than the
Social Security payroll tax, far less than projected by
congressional budget-writers. He would devote more than half of
that to shoring up Medicaid over the next decade and adding a new
prescription drug benefit to the program, which would be even more
generous than in previous White House proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the remainder of the surplus would go to a range of
social spending plans, such as improved access to health insurance
for low-income people. Clinton also proposes $350 billion over 10
years in tax breaks for certain people saving for retirement or
paying college tuition, long-term health care costs or child care
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cuts would be paid for in part by ending tax
``loopholes'' that Clinton says are worth $96 billion over 10
years. They include new rules for people who renounce US
citizenship in order to avoid federal taxes. The administration is
also counting on $66 billion from a 25-cents-per-pack increase in
cigarette taxes and new penalties on tobacco companies that do not
reduce youth smoking. That proposal faces uncertain prospects in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated $2 trillion in surpluses from the Social Security
program over the next decade would be used to pay down the national
debt, and all $3.7 trillion in debt held by the public would be
gone by 2013, Clinton said. The remaining $2 trillion in national
debt is money the government owes to its own programs, such as
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the gains from paying off the debt, such as lower
debt service costs, would be transfered to the Social Security
program to improve its financial position.
</P>
<P>
   While growing in total dollars, the federal budget has been
shrinking during Clinton's term as a percentage of the US economy _
from 22 percent when he took office to 18.3 percent today. It would
fall to 16.7 percent by 2010 under his new plan, said Robert
Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute, a Washington think
tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a level we haven't seen since the Eisenhower
administration, to periods before we had Medicare, Medicaid, food
stamps and the student loan program,'' Reischauer said. ``It shows
a strong economy can trump a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Concord Coalition, a budget watchdog group, criticized
Clinton for using federal surpluses that might not materialize to
fund his proposed tax cuts and prescription drug benefit. The group
says no permanent spending plan, including Republican tax cut
proposals, should be built on tentative projections of a surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's nice to be talking about surpluses, rather than
deficits,'' said Robert Bixby, executive director of the group.
``These are nice problems to have.''
</P>
<P>
   With less than a year left in office, Clinton budget officials
argued that they nonetheless can lay the groundwork for spending
priorities well into the future. Using surpluses to pay down the
federal debt is so popular, for example, ``that if you lock it in
now with legislation, it will be politically difficult in five
years or 10 years to change that,'' said Gene Sperling, a senior
economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The budget proposes the largest-ever dollar increase for the
National Science Foundation, which would boost engineering and
physical science research at a time when Congress has already given
record increases to medical research budgets. The NSF would get a
boost of $675 million, or 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would also add $1 billion, or about 5.7 percent, to the
annual medical research budget at the National Institutes of
Health. That amount is well below what is needed to meet Congress's
general goal of doubling the NIH budget over five years, but
Clinton has traditionally offered a small increase to the NIH with
the expectation that lawmakers will approve more.

 &HT;    Many challenges await Mitchell as PBS president
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Pat Mitchell told her boss, Ted Turner, that
she was on the verge of being named president of the Public
Broadcasting Service, his response was, ``You mean the whole
thing?''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mitchell, a native of Statesboro and former president
of CNN Productions, was officially named the new president and
chief executive officer of PBS. The whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is going to be terrific. She `gets it,''' said Sharon
Percy Rockefeller, a member of the search committee that
recommended Mitchell to the PBS board of directors. The board
unanimously approved her on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As PBS enters its third decade and I enter my third act, this
is simply going to be the biggest, best time ever for PBS,''
Mitchell said Monday at the National Press Club. She will be the
fifth president of PBS in 30 years and its first female CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, 57, comes to PBS after a varied career that has
included hosting her own syndicated talk show, substituting for
Jane Pauley on the ``Today'' show and making independent
documentaries. Since 1992 she has run CNN Productions (formerly
Turner Productions), and she served as co-producer of the
award-winning 24-hour series ``The Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mitchell's steady stream of accomplishments was somewhat
undercut last year when Turner announced that she would be
president of a new cable channel called the Women's Network, then
canceled the network after Mitchell had started hiring a staff. The
reason: Turner didn't think it could be profitable. Many at
Turner's networks feel that Mitchell was treated poorly in the very
public announcement and cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed, (but) I didn't for one second take
any of this personally,'' Mitchell said Monday. ``I don't think it
was the right decision to make, but I understood why they made the
decision.'' She said the scuttling of the project had nothing to do
with her decision to go to PBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am genuinely disappointed to lose her from CNN, but I'm also
equally enthusiastic and proud. I think she will be an even
stronger leader of PBS because of her Turner years,'' said Tom
Johnson, chairman and CEO of the CNN NewsGroup, who first met
Mitchell at the University of Georgia when they were students there
in the early '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many producers are brilliant but terrible to work with,''
Johnson said. ``In the case of Pat, she's caring, she's funny,
she's got a great spirit. No sharp elbows, no BS.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell will take over March 1 at PBS' headquarters in
Alexandria, Va. But she said she will commute to and from Atlanta,
where she has a home in Morningside and a steady companion,
businessman Scott Seydel, and where she will continue to serve on
the boards of the High Museum of Art and the Atlanta Metro YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell acknowledged she's taking a big pay cut moving from CNN
to PBS. ``I didn't even hesitate,'' she said. ``I just accepted
that as part of the package.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's a lot more to the package. The president of PBS
faces several challenges, some of them unique to the job. Among the
major situations Mitchell faces:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Declining viewership. PBS' national audience has been dropping
about 2 percent a year for the past few years. That's not as much
as networks like CBS and Fox have seen, but it's not a good sign.
And while the total amount of money pledged by viewers has held
constant, the number of people making pledges has dropped. Public
radio, meanwhile, which operates similarly to public television,
hasn't seen these dropoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to reverse these trend lines before they become
serious erosion,'' said Robert Coonrod, president and CEO of the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the funding arm of public
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we need to do is remind the audience of the genres
at which we excel,'' Mitchell said Monday. ``Perhaps we could do a
better job of getting that message out, making that known to our
viewers, bringing them back.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A difficult structure. The president of PBS is not nearly as
powerful as the president of, say, NBC. Mitchell has to share a lot
of her power with the 346 PBS stations around the country, and with
the CPB, which controls the purse strings. Public television at the
national level is known for its cumbersome bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's slow in its decision-making,'' said documentarian Ken
Burns (``The Civil War''), arguably the poster boy of PBS. ``You
have many constituencies, and some stations are more powerful than
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said she wants to streamline the process of approving
which shows will air at PBS, called green-lighting. ``It's to
everyone's advantage to make the green-lighting process more
efficient,'' she said. In his recent book ``The Vanishing Vision:
The Inside Story of Public Television,'' James Day, former
president of WNET in New York, called PBS ``an institution of
enormous promise mired in a self-created bureaucracy. Its human and
economic resources are thinly spread over a highly fragmented
system, its national leadership is divided and largely impotent.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's challenge will be to provide strong leadership and
unite the sometimes quarrelsome factions within public television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat is known for her skills of working with people,'' said
CNN's Johnson. ``She can work with just about anybody.'' Colin
Campbell, chairman of the PBS board of directors, said she was
hired in part for her ``major diplomatic and consensus-building
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Conversion to digital. All PBS stations have to convert to a
digital signal within six years, as do all other TV stations.
``It's an awesome challenge,'' said the CPB's Coonrod. PBS
estimates it will cost $1.8 billion for all of its stations to
convert, which is more than the $1.5 billion in total revenue all
346 stations take in annually. Obviously, there will have to be
government funding of the conversion, at a combination of federal,
state and local levels. Just as obviously, getting that money will
be an enormous task. (President Clinton's 2001 budget is asking
Congress for $393 million for digital conversion.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Encroaching commercialism. Not only do the pledge drives
irritate viewers, but the underwriting announcements that begin
most programs are looking more and more like regular TV ads. ``I'm
concerned about the extent to which corporate underwriting becomes
so central to programming,'' said William Hoynes, who teaches mass
media and society at Vassar College. ``Increasingly, PBS has moved
down the path of a more commercially driven market model.
Ultimately, this will be a failed strategy that will backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know these messages are essential,'' Mitchell said.
``As a producer, it feels a lot better to have a message at the
beginning and end of a program than to have it interrupted six or
seven times for commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Competition from cable. Critics of PBS frequently say that
various cable channels fill needs that were once met only by PBS:
Programming about nature on Discovery and Animal Planet,
documentaries on the History Channel, quality British imports on
A&AMP;E, fine arts on Bravo, information in general on CNN and C-SPAN.
</P>
<P>
   PBS counters that cable is available only in about 75 percent of
American homes, and its mission is to serve everyone. ``There's a
difference between history programming on the History Channel and
history programming on PBS,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The X factor. Also called ``It's always something.'' In the
mid-'90s, Congressional Republicans tried to end all federal
funding of PBS. Shortly after that, there was a wave of questioning
the need for PBS. Every couple of years, PBS airs a program that
generates heated controversy; last year, the Rev. Jerry Falwell
charged that one of the Teletubbies was gay.
</P>
<P>
   Also last year, several PBS stations were heavily criticized for
sharing their donor lists with political parties.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows where Mitchell will need to practice damage control
next. But something will happen.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of difficulties facing Mitchell as she takes over
the reins of PBS. The institution is no longer as simple as the
definition that was offered in jest by Robert MacNeil, former
anchor of ``The MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour,'' who once called PBS:
``English people talking and animals mating, occasionally
interrupted by English people mating and animals talking.''

&HT;     S.F. AND CALIF. WOULD GAIN UNDER CLINTON BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ San Francisco would get significant boosts in
housing and community development funds from President Clinton's
$1.84 trillion budget for fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, anxious to please California, a must-win state for
Democrats in this election year, also laced his plan with large
spending jumps in education, housing and the environment for the
state. And he proposed a hefty 8.4 percent raise nationally in
funds to combat HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is seeking $9.2 billion in HIV-AIDS funding, a $716
million increase from this year's' spending level.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $9.2 billion, the National Institutes of Health would get
$2.1 billion for AIDS research, an increase of 5.2 percent. In
addition, Clinton proposed $100 million for AIDS prevention, care
and education in Africa and Asia, parts of which have been
devastated by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called the budget's HIV-AIDS
spending hike a ``reasonable start.'' But she added, ``We must
fight for funding above the administration's request, especially in
the AIDS Drugs Assistance Program, which provides lifesaving drugs
to people with HIV who cannot afford to pay for the drugs on their
own.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's budget for the Department of Housing and Urban
Development budget nationally includes 120,000 new housing
vouchers, a $690 million rent subsidy aimed at helping the poor,
the homeless and those going from welfare to work find housing in
increasingly tight rental markets. California is earmarked for
17,730 of those vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   The budget directs 458 of the vouchers _ valued at $5.3 million
_ to San Francisco, according to HUD calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Also proposed for San Francisco is:
</P>
<P>
   _ $9.7 million for housing for people with AIDS, up from $8.7
million this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ $7.6 million for homeless assistance, up from $6.9 million
this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ $10.3 million for the local public housing authority, up
slightly from $10.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ $26.3 million in Community Development Block Grants, aimed at
spurring economic development through improvements in commercial
downtown areas, old industrial areas and residential neighborhoods.
Last year, San Francisco received $24.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed for the greater Bay Area is:
</P>
<P>
   _ $80 million to expand the Bay Area Rapid Transit System to the
San Francisco International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   _ $60 million for the California Bay-Delta Watershed.
</P>
<P>
   _ $23.4 million for the Presidio as the former Army post
continues its conversion into a national park.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget, unveiled Monday, would boost California's Head
Start funding for disadvantaged pre-schoolers to $772.8 million, an
increase of $136.1 million over last year.
</P>
<P>
   The president's effort to hire 100,000 teachers around the
nation to reduce class size in the early grades _ a centerpiece of
his education legacy _ earmarks $206.5 million for California, a
$140 million increase.
</P>
<P>
   A new program to recruit, train and reward good teachers would
channel $81.2 million into the state.
</P>
<P>
   California child-care programs for low-income parents, including
those leaving welfare rolls for work, would receive $243.8 million
from Washington, a $100.1 million increase.
</P>
<P>
   The president also proposed spending $54.1 million _ an $8
million rise _ on care of the severely mentally ill in California.
</P>
<P>
   On environmental issues, the budget would give the state $38.7
million to buy natural and historic sites within its borders.
</P>
<P>
   The budget would also pump $84.6 million into a revolving fund
for California drinking water, an increase of $632,300 increase
from last year. The money enables the state to float low-interest
loans to local water systems for so-called ``infrastructural
improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Clinton's proposed $825 million nationally for the
clean water fund, Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif., said she was
``thoroughly disappointed'' that he had slashed that fund by $550
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that waste water treatment facilities in our
area may not have the money to properly clean water that they put
back into the delta,'' Tauscher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we fought to restore funding of the clean water
fund to $1.35 billion. This year, I will try to increase that
appropriation as well as push my own bill to finally reauthorize
the clean water fund for the next five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein hailed the president's overall plan as ``a
fiscally prudent, balanced budget.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It sets out a solid blueprint for tackling the major issues
facing our nation, including reforming public education, expanding
the access to affordable health care, improving public safety,
enhancing the national defense and other critical priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans lawmakers said the Clinton budget faces an
extremely cool reception on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., applauded the president's proposal
to increase federal spending nationally on after-school programs
from $495 million last year to $1 billion in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said after-school programs prevent juvenile crime and
boost school performance, by giving children ``safe productive
places to go in the critical hours after the school bell rings.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton sent Congress a budget proposal
Monday built on the idea that the budget surplus will allow the
nation to have it all, from increased government spending to tax
cuts and big reductions in the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The president's budget, his eighth and last, calls for
additional spending across the range of issues that have long been
central to his agenda, including health care, education and the
environment, as well as increases for the military.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it stresses fiscal responsibility and maps out
a path to eliminate the portion of the national debt held by the
public over the next 13 years. And it tries to define the size of
the surplus in a way that builds Clinton's priorities into the
budget mix for the next decade and leaves Republicans relatively
little room to pursue the sweeping tax cuts they want.
</P>
<P>
   There is no argument between the parties that projected budget
surpluses, assuming they materialize, present the nation with
tremendous opportunities, including a chance to pay down the debt
and insure Social Security's long-term solvency.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's exchanges vividly illustrated the continuing
deadlock over how to apportion the surplus. Republicans have
generally emphasized tax cuts, Democrats for the most part have
called for maintaining or increasing spending on critical needs,
and each has labeled the other's approach a threat to debt
repayment and the future of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget blueprint is unlikely to break that impasse,
and the debate this year is raging not just on Capitol Hill but on
the campaign trail, where there are stark divisions within and
between the parties over how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget calls for total spending in 2001 of nearly
$1.84 trillion, including an increase of 3.9 percent in spending on
the third of the budget accounted for by basic government
operations like the military, national parks, education and law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   That increase, and proposed growth in this discretionary
spending of about 2.5 percent a year for the rest of the decade,
would, at least by the White House's accounting, cover the costs of
a wide range of initiatives laid out by Clinton over the past few
months. They range from an expansion of basic scientific research
to new training for pre-school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a balanced budget with a balanced approach to our
national priorities,'' Clinton told reporters. ``It maintains our
fiscal discipline, pays down the debt, extends the life of Social
Security and Medicare, and invests in our families and our
future.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also an election year platform, chock full of programs
that Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton and other
Democratic candidates can use to defend themselves, attack their
opponents and illustrate their stands on issues.
</P>
<P>
   They include aid for hard-pressed farmers and manufacturers,
initiatives to enforce gun laws and fight wage discrimination
against women, calls for additional spending on AIDS and biomedical
research and sweeping expansions in efforts to reduce child poverty
and make health care more accessible and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have in this budget is an opportunity for politicians
to just go out and tell every single group who has any kind of an
interest at all, `Oh, we're taking care of you,''' said Rep. John
R. Kasich, R-Ohio, who is chairman of the House Budget Committee.
``That's not leadership. It's all things for all people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the centerpieces of Clinton's proposal, including the
addition of prescription drug coverage to Medicare, are politically
popular and stand a good chance of being enacted in some form by
the Republican-led Congress this year. There is also general
bipartisan agreement on using the portion of the surplus generated
by Social Security, estimated by the administration at $2.2
trillion over the next decade, to reduce the debt.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans derided the administration's overall proposal as
a liberal tax-and-spend manifesto that they would discard as they
set about drafting their own tax and spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's budget is a paradox,'' said House Speaker
Dennis Hastert of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we pay down the debt with a budget that substantially
expands the size and scope of the federal government?'' Hastert
said. ``How can we address the issue of tax fairness, when his
budget does not substantially ease the marriage tax penalty? How
can the era of big government be over when his budget would create
close to $350 billion in new government programs?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first budget battle between Congress and the administration
this year will be over the size of the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Surplus projections vary tremendously based on assumptions about
spending, economic growth and other factors. The Congressional
Budget Office laid out three estimates last month of the non-Social
Security surplus, ranging from $838 billion to $1.9 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget said the surplus outside of Social Security
would be $746 billion over the next decade, with the vast majority
of it being generated after 2005.
</P>
<P>
   In calculating that number, the White House assumed that overall
discretionary spending would grow from its current level at
slightly less than the rate of inflation over the 10-year period.
To assume any less growth in spending over that period would be
unrealistic, given past spending patterns, and would risk a nasty
fiscal surprise down the road, White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we start this year has everything to do with where we
end up,'' said Jacob J. Lew, the director of the White House's
Office of Management and Budget. ``If you start with realistic,
honest numbers and make the tough decisions within that framework,
we can get to paying off the debt by 2013.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress have not yet settled on a surplus
estimate, but they made clear on Monday that whatever number they
do use will assume substantially less spending than Clinton's
budget and will therefore be considerably larger than the
administration's surplus projection.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They said the surplus should not be committed in advance to
spending increases, that many programs can be trimmed back, and
that the surplus should be calculated in a way that maximizes the
amount of money available for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Should Clinton's surplus figure be adopted, it would severely
limit the ability of Republicans in Congress to pursue their
tax-cutting agenda, and it would make the tax cut being offered by
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in his run for the Republican
presidential nomination look excessive. Bush's plan is estimated to
cost at least $1.3 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans were largely silent Monday on one of the major
changes contained in the Clinton budget: its formal abandonment of
the strict spending limits set by the 1997 bipartisan balanced
budget act. The caps would have required deep spending cuts in each
of the next two years, and although the two parties have found ways
around them in the past several years, killing them completely
would once have been politically treacherous for Republicans and
Democrats alike.
</P>
<P>
   With deficits now but a memory and surpluses piling up, though,
neither party seems inclined to make an issue of the spending caps.
Administration officials said the new path they set out, keeping
spending growth just below the inflation rate and using all of the
Social Security surplus for debt reduction, should serve as the new
standard for fiscal discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget puts a heavy emphasis on shoring up and
expanding Medicare, the system of health insurance for the elderly.
It would designate $299 billion out of the 10-year surplus
projection of $746 billion to go to extending the system's solvency
from 2015 under current projections to 2025.
</P>
<P>
   It would also create a $168 billion program over a decade to
help retirees pay for prescription drugs, which have become
cripplingly expensive for many older people. Clinton also
designated another $35 billion over a decade to help beneficiaries
who face huge drug bills stemming from a catastrophic illness.
</P>
<P>
   Under intense pressure from Republicans on taxes, Clinton called
for $350 billion in tax cuts, mostly for low- and middle-income
people. But he would offset a portion of the reductions by closing
what administration officials said were $96 billion of egregious
corporate tax loopholes _ a step that Republicans and many industry
groups said was an unfair tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's tax proposals include $45 billion over 10 years to
reduce the marriage penalty paid by some two-income couples.
Republicans in Congress are pressing hard for marriage penalty
relief this year, but are pushing for a much bigger package than
what the president proposed. The House will take up a marriage
penalty bill later this week worth $182 billion in tax reductions
over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the initiatives in the budget have Gore's stamp on them.
They include a plan to provide more money to towns and cities that
lose manufacturing jobs to foreign competition, the proposal to
create catastrophic drug coverage within Medicare and a plan to
create a national licensing system for handgun owners.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Clinton's proposal ``makes my point that surpluses
will be spent if we don't have a leader who's willing to cut
taxes.'' Bush's main rival for the Republican presidential
nomination, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who has criticized Bush's
tax plan as too big, said he welcomed Clinton's emphasis on debt
reduction and Social Security, but added that he was ``concerned
about all the new spending programs that he is proposing here.''

BUSH BRINGS `REFORMER' IMAGE TO DELAWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Delaware _ Under pressure to revamp and energize his
campaign, Governor George W. Bush arrived here Monday championing
his credentials as a reformer and the real political outsider in
the race.
</P>
<P>
   There was no missing the new message.
</P>
<P>
   A giant blue banner hung over Bush's head during two events,
reading, ``A Reformer With Results.'' At a Republican luncheon in
Dover, he used the word ``reform'' eleven times in a 15-minute
speech. And, unlike his pattern in recent weeks, he didn't use his
campaign stops to underscore his endorsement by one high-profile
party leader or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to remind people that in this race there's only one
person who can stand up and say, `I'm a reformer with results,' ''
he told the 265-person crowd ``Somebody who comes from outside the
system. Somebody who's got a record of reforming and a record of
results.''
</P>
<P>
   The intended comparison was clear: His leading opponent, Arizona
Senator John McCain, has championed campaign finance reform but
never convinced the Senate to vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   The new tactic, unveiled on the eve of the Delaware primary but
clearly aimed at the South Carolina contest Feb. 19, was part of a
carefully orchestrated shift by the Bush campaign, whose soft-edged
campaign style has been widely blamed for the wide margin of defeat
in the New Hampshire primary last week. It was matched by new
efforts to underscore Bush's willingness to hear out and respond to
individual voters' concerns. This move _ heralded as ``One on One
with Governor bush'' in another giant banner _ is designed to
address concerns that Bush's campaign has kept him at too great a
remove from actual voters.
</P>
<P>
   And, while the new strategy did not take Bush in new policy
directions or even seem to have a noticeably different tone, it
changed the dynamic of his dialogue with Senator John S. McCain. As
of Monday, the debate no longer centered around the issues favored
by Bush _ subjects like tax cuts. Instead, both McCain and Bush
wrestled for the titles of ``outsider'' and ``reformer.'' Both men
aired their views on campaign finance reform. Each attacked the
other in public remarks and new television ads.
</P>
<P>
   McCain laughed off the developments in his opponents' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand Governor Bush is now a reformer,'' McCain said
during a stop in economically depressed Flint. ``If so, it's his
first day on the job. I've been at it for 17 years. It seems to me
the Bush campaign can't figure out whether to imitate me or attack
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The accelerated attacks in the Republican primary came as
several candidates, including Bush and Steve Forbes, campaigned for
the Delaware GOP primary taking place Tuesday. And few campaign
aides seemed sure of what to expect. No reliable polling has been
done here recently, and campaign aides said a small state like
Delaware can yield unpredictable results. Just 28 polling places
will be open, with some turnout estimates as low as 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Only 12 delegates are up for grabs here, but the vote does have
symbolic stakes for all the campaigns. Bush in particular is badly
in need of positive headlines, McCain would like further proof of
his momentum, and the struggling Forbes campaign is hoping to do
respectably in a state he won four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, with his campaign coming off a weak showing in New
Hampshire, is badly in need of new momentum. Delaware, a state
whose primary he won in 1996 would seem like a natural choice. But
Forbes aides were not optimistic about the contest, saying it was
likely Forbes would finish third behind Bush and McCain _
potentially embarassing result given that McCain did not actively
compete here while Forbes spent several days travelling the state.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bush carried on a long-distance debate throughout the
day, and each prepared to release new ads in South Carolina. In
particular, Bush went after McCain's position on campaign finance,
accusing the Arizona Senator of keeping a double standard as
chairman of the US Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in his harshest language yet, told reporters at a news
conference that McCain had ``raised more money than anybody in the
campaign from lobbyists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running for a reason. I want to be judged for results, not
rhetoric,'' Bush said. ``The campaigns are all the time full of
people saying one thing and doing another, people saying lobbyists
are bad and special interests dominate Washington, D.C. and on the
other hand pass the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush stopped just short of calling McCain a hypocrite. ``That's
your word,'' he told reporters. Asked his word for it, Bush said:
``Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared, however, that Bush's accusations were inaccurate.
According to the most recent figures compiled by the Center for
Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, Bush
far surpasses McCain in his talent for raising money from
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   As of last September 30, Bush had raised nearly five times more
from lobbyists than McCain. His total was $480,464. McCain's was
$96,675. McCain, however, relied on lobbyists slightly more heavily
than Bush; they accounted for 10 percent of his total funds, versus
8.4 percent for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, McCain pounced on the accusation and responded with one
of his own: that Bush has received contributions from 20,000 people
with Washington zip codes, compared 1,000 similiar contributions to
the McCain campaign. Bush routinely boasts he is the only candidate
without a Washington D.C. zip code.
</P>
<P>
   McCain called Bush's charges against him ``an act that may be
viewed by some as desperation.'' He ridiculed Bush for spending
more than $1 million on the Arizona primary, which McCain said he
would win. And he feigned nervousness over Michigan Governor John
Engler's political organization, which is backing Bush here the way
Senator Judd Gregg backed Bush in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all hoping that the Engler machine is as efficient and
overwhelming as the Gregg machine was in New Hampshire,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain joked, his campaign launched a serious ad in South
Carolina accusing Bush of releasing a ``new negative ad attacking
John McCain and distorting his position.'' This week, Bush is
planning to release an ad accusing McCain of doing the same thing.
Both ads feature the no-negative-campaigning handshake they made
during a Jan. 10 Republican debate.
</P>
<P>
   And both candidates threatened to go after each other much more
aggressively in coming weeks. McCain, referring to his days as a
Navy pilot, said he would not hesitate return take Bush's fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't just respond, we will respond doubly, and have a lot
of fun doing it. We can play as rough as anybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Countered Bush: ``I'm ready. You haven't seen the Barbara Bush
in me yet.''
</P>
<P>

BRITISH AIRWAYS SHARES FALL AS A LOSS IS REPORTED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Airways PLC reported better-than-expected
third-quarter financial results Monday but still showed a loss from
fare discounting and a surge in fuel prices, and its shares fell
more than 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The airline is one of the hardest hit by aircraft overcapacity _
too many seats for too few passengers. Hoping to fill the empty
seats, carriers have cut some ticket prices so steeply that the
cost of an economy-class seat in some cases hardly covers the
airline's expenses.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways said it took in 3.2 percent more revenue per
passenger in the third quarter, reversing a trend of the previous
seven fiscal quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The improvement appeared to reflect results from a radical plan
undertaken this past fall to increase profits by essentially
reducing the airline's market share. The airline said then that it
would focus its attention on first-class and business class
service, which have higher profit margins than in economy class.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, premium-class traffic grew 6.8 percent and
non-premium traffic fell by 2.8 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reading the market correctly and the trends are going
in the right direction,'' said Robert Ayling, chief executive of
British Airways. ``We have seen premium traffic grow for the past
seven months in succession.''
</P>
<P>
   While conditions in the international marketplace continue to be
highly competitive, Ayling said, he expected British Airways
results would continue to show improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said its third-quarter pretax loss narrowed to 60
million pounds, or $95.5 million, from 75 million pounds a year
ago. On the basis of operations, the company lost 2 million pounds
or $3.2 million, in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with
an operating profit of 92 million pounds during the same period a
year earlier. The company reported a loss per share of 6.6 pence,
the same as a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the latest results were better than they had
anticipated, and said the British Airways outlook looked
encouraging. But some questioned whether its recovery would be
sustainable. The company has taken a number of strategic actions
and short-term corrective measures to raise profitability, Andrew
Light, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London said in a note
to clients. The main outstanding issue is the timing of an industry
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel prices also are an unpredictable element in the airline
industry. Many carriers have reported weaker results in the latest
quarter partly because the price of jet fuel has surged over the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   Share of British Airways dropped 13 pence to settle at 295 pence
or $4.72. The shares slumped 5.2 percent on Friday.

   Oregon's Winterfest Has a Russian Theme
</P>
<P>
   A glimpse of life in Imperial Russia, with all its trappings, is
coming to Portland, Ore., and the city is celebrating with a
festival of events.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Winterfest is a sweeping exhibition at the
Portland Art Museum, ``Stroganoff: The Palace and Collections of a
Russian Noble Family,'' which opens on February 19. It showcases
more than 230 paintings, icons and furnishings that belonged to the
Stroganoffs before they were confiscated during the Russian
revolutions.
</P>
<P>
   The treasures, on loan from the State Russian Museum, the
Hermitage and other Russian museums, will be arrayed as they were
in the grand 18th-century Stroganoff Palace on Nevsky Prospekt. The
exhibition will remain on view through May 31. (It then travels to
the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, the Musee des Arts Decoratifs
in the Louvre and the Hermitage.)
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen other cultural institutions in Portland have
their own Russian-themed offerings.
</P>
<P>
   On March 17 and 18, in ``Stars of St. Petersburg,'' dancers from
the Mariinsky Theater (formerly the Kirov Ballet) will perform
solos and duets from ``Giselle'' and from less-known Russian
ballets at Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall. Tickets are $36 to $80
for each night, or $125 for a benefit on March 17 that includes a
reception and meeting with the dancers. Tickets can be bought from
Ticketmaster at (503) 790-2787.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon Symphony has scheduled three performances that
include Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5 (May 6, 7 and 8) and three
performances of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 9 and Prokofiev's
``Alexander Nevsky'' (May 20, 21 and 22), all at Arlene Schnitzer
Concert Hall. Tickets, $14 to $67: (800) 228-7343 or on the Web at
www.orsymphony.org.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest Film Center will screen Russian classics, and many
galleries are featuring Russian icons and artworks. On March 11,
St. Nicholas Orthodox Church will hold a celebration of icons and
liturgical arts that concludes with a service of the Great Vespers;
admission is free.
</P>
<P>
   Eight Portland hotels, including the Mark Spencer, the Heathman,
the Four Points Sheraton and the Westin Portland, are offering
packages that include tickets to the Stroganoff exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Timed tickets to the exhibition at the Portland Art Museum, 1219
S.W. Park Ave., cost $13 and are available at (503) 790-2787.
Information on all events: (503) 226-2811 or

   Airlines Old and New Cut New York Fares
</P>
<P>
   Less expensive air fares are coming to New York, with JetBlue, a
new airline based at Kennedy International Airport, starting
operations this month, and Southwest Airlines, the biggest discount
airline, starting service from Albany in May.
</P>
<P>
   JetBlue, with one class of service on new Airbus A-320 jets, was
scheduled to begin service to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on February
18; it will be followed by flights from New York City to Buffalo,
N.Y., on Thursday and to Tampa, Fla., on March 16. Within 18 months
Jet-Blue plans to add flights from JFK to Rochester, N.Y., and
Syracuse, N.Y., as well as Burlington, Vt., among the 30 cities,
mostly east of the Mississippi, it plans to serve by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Seats to Fort Lauderdale, purchased 14 days in advance, are $99
each way on Friday and Sunday, peak fare days, and $79 on other
days. Seven-day advance purchase is $139 peak and $119 off peak.
The last-minute walk-up fare is $159, about 70 percent less than
the one-way walk-up fare of $524.50 that Delta quoted recently.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo tickets are $69 peak and $49 off peak when bought two
weeks in advance; $79 and $59, a week in advance. The walk-up fare
is $99, compared with a recent quote of $246 on USAirways, which
flies from La Guardia to Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   JetBlue planes come with a television monitor showing
satellite-TV broadcasts at each seat. And its seats are one inch
wider than those on most commercial jets.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest will offer nonstop flights from Albany, N.Y., to
Baltimore-Washington International Airport, Orlando, Fla., and Las
Vegas starting in May. The airline, which flies Boeing 737's, has
been rapidly expanding in the Northeast with service from Islip,
N.Y., Hartford and Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Advance purchase fares to Baltimore-Washington will be as low as
$88 round trip, and the walk-up fare will be $65 one way; USAirways
recently quoted a walk-up fare of $322.50 on that route.
</P>
<P>
   More of London Linked to Underground
</P>
<P>
   The recent completion of the Jubilee Line on London's
Underground makes many tourist sites in South and East London more
accessible. The 9.93-mile extension runs from Green Park in Mayfair
to Stratford in East London. It crosses the Thames four times: from
Westminster to Waterloo; Canada Water to Canary Wharf; Canary Wharf
to North Greenwich, and North Greenwich to Canning Town.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the 11 stations on the new section of the line connect
with either other Underground services, above-ground trains, bus
stations or the Docklands Light Railway, which serves other areas
of East London. All the stations have elevators as well as
escalators when necessary, and eight have glass safety screens
between the platform and track with doors that open when the train
arrives. Trains run every two and a half minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of London's most historic areas are along the line:
Southwark, with Shakespeare's Globe (the open-air replica of the
original Wooden O theater); and the Oxo Tower Wharf with its
restaurants, museum and designer galleries and studios. Near London
Bridge are the London Dungeon; the Clink Prison Museum, with
exhibits on the original 16th-century prison for heretics; the
weekend food and flower market at Borough; the Gothic style
Southwark Cathedral; and the Golden Hinde, a full-scale
reproduction of the ship in which Sir Francis Drake circumnavigated
the globe from 1577 to 1580. North Greenwich is the stop for the
Millennium Dome.
</P>
<P>
   A free leaflet, ``The Millennium Mile,'' with information on
South Bank attractions, is available from (44-171) 928 6193.
</P>
<P>

SUSPENSION OF TALKS AND SURGE IN FIGHTING COMPLICATE MIDEAST PEACE
HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Palestinian Authority froze peace talks with the
Israelis on Monday and released from prison a charismatic Islamic
fundamentalist leader from Gaza who is an outspoken opponent of the
peace effort and of the authority.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and U.S. officials interpreted the release of Dr.
Abdel-Aziz Rantisi, a senior Hamas official, as a provocative and
intentional coincidence with the suspension of the peace
negotiations. But Palestinian officials disagreed with their
interpretation, saying that Rantisi, a 52-year-old pediatrician,
had been held for nearly two years without charges and was due to
be released.
</P>
<P>
   For Prime Minister Ehud Barak, whose agenda since he took office
last July has been almost entirely focused on peacemaking, it was
not a good day. Indeed, with Syria having broken off negotiations
last month, Barak now faces a freeze on two peace fronts at once.
And with the intensification of fighting in Lebanon, where Syria is
a powerbroker, February appears bound to be a difficult month.
</P>
<P>
   By early Tuesday, the outlook for peace was further complicated
when Israel launched air strikes in southern Lebanon, according to
wire reports.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who is also the defense minister, ordered the strikes
against the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, guerrillas.
According to the wire reports, warplanes made three strikes on a
power station in Baalbek city in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa valley.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen Lebanese civilians were injured, one of them seriously,
and 11 of them were taken to a hospital, according to Agence
France-Presse. All the injuries were caused by flying glass or
debris from about a dozen missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The escalation in the conflict in southern Lebanon may well
affect _ some say jeopardize, others say kick-start _ the
resumption of talks with Syria, which Israel holds responsible for
the recent escalation of fighting in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli-Palestinian relations began to cool last week when a
summit meeting between Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and
Barak ended in deadlock, despite the fact that they have held
regular and generally productive meetings. And although the
Israelis predicted late last week that the negotiations would
resume as scheduled on Sunday, the Palestinians did not show up.
Finally on Monday, they indefinitely suspended their participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no desire to return to the table in order to go around
in empty circles,'' said Yasser Abed Rabbo, the chief negotiator.
``That gives a tricky impression that the peace process is still
going on and is only facing small problems. In truth, the crisis is
a deep one.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Palestinian negotiators said they were awaiting
answers from the Israelis on three key questions before they would
resume talks. The questions were tough ones, and it seemed unlikely
that answers from the Israelis would be imminent or to the
Palestinians' liking.
</P>
<P>
   The issue that drove a wedge between them concerned the next
transfer of West Bank land, which was supposed to take place this
week. The Palestinians wanted the Israelis to include villages near
Jerusalem, and the Israelis refused, maintaining that the fate of
Jerusalem needs to be negotiated separately.
</P>
<P>
   That land dispute made it clear that the larger issues of the
final status talks _ borders, settlements, Jerusalem and refugees,
among others _ would not be resolved, even in broad brush, by the
original target date of Feb. 13.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That was a written goal for a framework agreement; the full,
detailed treaty is supposed to be accomplished by mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   So the Palestinians, in a meeting with the Israelis on Saturday
night at the home of Martin Indyk, the new U.S. Ambassador to
Israel, posed the three questions.
</P>
<P>
   First, they asked, ``since the February 13 target date is as
good as over,'' if Barak wanted to eliminate the framework
agreement _ which had been his idea _ and go straight to the final
treaty. Or, they asked, did he want to extend the deadline?
</P>
<P>
   Second, they asked if Israel accepted _ which Israel never has
-_ that the maps for the next land transfer of 6.1 percent of the
West Bank should be decided jointly.
</P>
<P>
   Third, they asked when Israel intended to carry out the final
interim phase of withdrawal from the West Bank, after the 6.1
percent and before the final treaty. Israel has indicated that it
prefers to skip that stage of withdrawal because the territory will
be divided once and for all in a final agreement. But the
Palestinians, fearing that a final agreement may never be reached,
insist that it must happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fate of the negotiations depends on the answers to these
questions,'' said Nabil Aburdeineh, a senior adviser to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   When Rantisi was released on Monday in Gaza City, he boasted
that Arafat had personally ordered that he be set free. But,
outspoken as ever, he disparaged the notion that his release would
be seen as a provocation by the Israelis, saying that ``the
Zionists are not paying that kind of attention, and if it was meant
that way, then our leaders are playing and not practicing
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor was greeted at the headquarters of Hamas, which
carried out a series of suicide bombings that killed dozens of
Israelis four years ago, by the spiritual leader of the movement,
Sheik Yassin.
</P>
<P>
   Many consider Rantisi to be the second most powerful person in
the movement after the sheik. He spent eight years in Israeli
prisons, one year in deportation to Lebanon, and 21 months in the
custody of the Palestinian Authority, which accused him of
incitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that the Palestinian Authority is sending a green
light to Hamas, just like Assad is sending a green light to the
Hezbollah to hit Israeli soldiers,'' a Palestinian political
analyst in Gaza said, referring to Hafez el-Assad, the Syrian
president.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had warned Israel not to undertake a military retaliation
against Lebanon. But, as Barak flew to northern Israel to meet with
residents of the border towns, it was clear that Israel was headed
in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will fight,'' Barak said earlier on Monday, ``and we will
make sure that anyone who struck at us will be hit, and that it is
impossible to continue in this this way, to act against the Israeli
army without the aggressors and their operators being punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak faced rising pressure to order a large reprisal attack
after Israelis grappled for what analysts said was the first time
with live images of their wounded soldiers on television. Hemi
Shalev, a columnist for the Maariv newspaper, said the ``Lebanese
killing valley invaded the living room of Joe Israeli after 18
years of repression.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Israeli politicians had urged Barak to continue his
policy of restraint. ``We are not in Lebanon in order to take
revenge but to defend ourselves,'' said Yossi Beilin, the Justice
Minister. But most said Israel could no longer put itself in the
role of a sitting target for the guerrilla forces as it waited for
Syria to return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   And the repercussions were bound to be felt. ``As Lebanon heats
up,'' a senior U.S. official said, ``the chances of a break-through
on Syria goes down.''

STING SNARES ALLEGED NIGHT-GOGGLE SMUGGLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ An alleged plot to smuggle night-vision goggles and
blueprints of a US military aircraft to the Pakistani Army was
thwarted by US Customs agents who set up an undercover export
company in Boston and snared a Bangkok businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Reynolds, 33, a British citizen now living in Thailand,
was lured to a meeting in Boston and arrested Saturday. He is
charged in a federal complaint with conspiring since September 1998
to export defense articles to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has banned military exports to Pakistan since
1990 because of the country's failure to restrict nuclear testing
and development.
</P>
<P>
   Just Monday, in a move likely to escalate tensions between
Pakistan and neighboring India, Pakistan test-fired a new missile
that officials said improves accuracy and can hit targets 60 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries tested nuclear devices in 1998 and declared
themselves nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in US District Court Monday, Reynolds described
himself as the owner of a company that sells aircraft parts, but
said he can't afford to hire a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   US Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler ordered Reynolds held
without bail pending a hearing Wednesday after Asst. US Attorney
Despena Billings said prosecutors want him jailed until his trial
because they fear he may flee if released.
</P>
<P>
   US Customs agents in Boston set up the undercover company in
June 1998 after a cooperating witness told them he had been
contacted over the Internet by Hassan Ahmed, of the Sun &AMP; Star
Company in Pakistan, who wanted to buy night-vision goggles for the
Pakistani Army, according to a court affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Agents purporting to work for the Boston-based undercover
company corresponded by e-mail, fax and telephone with Ahmed, who
said his company specialized in supplying spare parts for military
aircraft, weapons systems and ground support equipment, according
to the affidavit by US Customs Special Agent Richard C. Krueger.
</P>
<P>
   After acknowledging that he knew it was illegal to export the
goggles to Pakistan, Ahmed told the undercover agents that he
wanted to ``proceed cautiously'' and asked them to negotiate with
Reynolds, who was working on his behalf, according to the
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   During secretly recorded conversations, Reynolds described
himself as a purchasing agent for Pakistan concerns and boasted
that he knew top officials in the United Kingdom's Department of
Trade and Industries who could help him.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Reynolds sent $10,980 to the undercover company
for one pair of night-vision goggles and asked them to send them to
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds also used the undercover company to purchase drawings
of Lockheed's C-130 aircraft from an unnamed US company for $18,000
last October, according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit says an undercover agent asked an employee of the
company whether the boss knew where the blueprints were going and
was told, ``Absolutely. ... He knows about Jonathan (Reynolds),
trust me. I'd be...dead...if he didn't.''

COMMENTARY: LIARS' POKER, INTERCONTINENTAL STYLE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Big Lie had a Big Week last week.
</P>
<P>
   In Austria, Joerg Haider _ who has expressed sympathy for
Hitler's full-employment policies, defended the Waffen SS and
referred to Nazi concentration camps as ``punishment camps'' _ saw
his extremist Freedom Party sworn into power after a strong finish
in recent elections. And in Syria the leading state newspaper,
Tishreen, published an editorial that asked: ``Why does Israel
insist on bringing up this alleged Holocaust policy?'' It's just to
get money and to reinforce ``the myth of the Holocaust in the face
of credible voices questioning it, including that of the
controversial British historian David Irving.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice stuff. Austria brings a neo-Nazi to power at the height of
European integration, and Syria calls the Holocaust a myth at the
height of peace talks with Israel. These cases are so perverse,
they're interesting. They also have a lot in common: Modern Syria
and modern Austria are each built on two lies _ one about their
past and one about their present, and both want to enter the 21st
century without re-examining either.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian lie about the past is that the Golan Heights was lost
not as part of a failed attempt to destroy Israel, but in a war of
self-defense. Therefore Syria is entitled, before declaring
publicly what it will give to Israel, to an Israeli assurance that
it will get back all the Golan, plus areas Syria encroached upon
before the 1967 war. The Syrian lie about the present is that it's
a democracy. You didn't know? When the State Department spokesman
Jamie Rubin rightly stated that Syria had an authoritarian regime
that didn't exactly have to take public opinion into account, the
Syrians lodged a diplomatic protest.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian regime self-righteously insists that Israel give back
the Golan, without even deigning to shake hands with Israeli
negotiators, precisely because this Syrian regime has lied to
itself about what it did in 1967 and about what it is today _ a
brutal dictatorship that doesn't even shake hands with its own
people.
</P>
<P>
   Austria, of course, the country that produced both Mozart and
Hitler, has made a career of lying to itself. Austria let the
Germans take history's rap for Hitler's rampage, neglecting the
fact that Austria was the only country that welcomed annexation by
Nazi Germany _ with crowds throwing flowers at Hitler's tanks.
Precisely because the Austrians never came to terms with their
past, they never really absorbed the meaning of what it is to be a
member of the European Union _ that it is not just about accepting
trade rules, but erasing forever Europe's Fascist past and
embracing forever democratic norms. For some Austrians, the
Anschluss with Nazi Germany in 1938 clearly still feels more
organic than their Anschluss with the E.U. in 1995. &UR;  &LR;  But Haider is
not just a blast from the past. He is also a product of the
present. Austrian politics for the past 50 years has been dominated
by a cartel of two parties _ the Social Democrats and Christian
Democrats _ who together divvied up the spoils of a state-dominated
economy, dabbled in corruption and created political immobility for
many Austrians. Haider has promised to break this cartel for all
those kept out of power _ particularly the shopkeepers, peasants
and workers left behind by modernization and immigration. ``Haider
is not the cause of Austria's political stagnation _ he's the
effect,'' says the German foreign-policy expert Josef Joffe. Which
is why Haider has two sides to him _ he's a neo-Nazi and a
high-tech free-marketer, an advocate of the Waffen SS and the flat
tax. He's Pat Buchanan AND Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the Austrians and Syrians wanted to forget the past and
the present, and just jump into the future _ with the Syrians
maintaining the illusion that they were always right and always a
democracy, and the Austrians that they were always pure and always
a democracy,'' says Stephen Cohen of the Center for Middle East
Peace. ``A new awareness is being imposed on them from the outside,
but it will only have meaning if it emerges from the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's hard to believe Austria will ever be a true member
of the European Union, or Syria in the club of Middle East peace,
without a more honest reckoning with their past and their present.
History has a weight, and lifting it always has a price. Nobody
gets to enter the 21st century for free.

 &HT;    Bush trying to out-McCain McCain
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. _ Gov. George W. Bush re-entered the presidential
fray Monday with a new speech, new signs and a new, more combative
attitude, all designed to win the spotlight back from U.S. Sen.
John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign, which has offered ``compassionate
conservatism'' and ``prosperity with a purpose,'' is now based on
stealing McCain's thunder and positioning the former front-runner
as a reformer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush debuted his new strategy in Delaware, which holds its
primary today. But it was South Carolina, scene of his next matchup
with McCain on Feb. 19, that was clearly on Bush's mind. Bush heads
to the Palmetto State this morning, hours before the Delaware
results will be tallied. Monday, standing before new, blue and
white signs touting him as ``A Reformer with Results,'' and ``One
on One with Governor Bush,'' Bush was clearly trying to out-McCain
McCain, barely naming his chief rival, but telling the audience at
a packed GOP luncheon in Dover that he, Bush, is the candidate best
able to clean up Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It's the message McCain rode to a landslide win over Bush in New
Hampshire last Tuesday. Bush, flush with cash and big-name
endorsements, is scrambling to avoid a repeat in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I'm not going to let happen this time is to
get defined by my opponent,'' he said. ``He is the person who is
Mr. Chairman. He's been in Washington for a long time. He's been
there so long that he's now a chairman of a very important
committee and chairmen of very important committees have got the
capacity to call people up and say, 'I'd like your help.' On the
one hand, he preaches campaign funding reform. On the other hand he
says, 'Pass the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, campaigning in Michigan, was unimpressed with the new
Bush approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand Governor Bush is now a reformer. If so, it's his
first day on the job. He should join me in going to the heart of
what's wrong with the system today and that's campaign finance
reform,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's new look also emphasizes more ``one-on-one'' contact with
voters. The goal is to create something like the town-hall meetings
that McCain held in New Hampshire (113 of them) in which the
Arizona senator combined stand-up comedy, direct answers to
questions and a personal aura that rocketed him to political
success.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Bush has been doing question-and-answer at the end of
many events. But, like his early debate performances, it often
wound up as Bush offering his stump speech in sound-bite-sized
chunks. On Monday, Bush delivered a rewritten, truncated version of
his stump speech, peppered with the word ``reform,'' and expanded
the Q&AMP;A with voters. At one stop, an American Legion hall in Dover,
he skipped the speech and spent about 45 minutes fielding
questions.
</P>
<P>
   The new Bush strategy began emerging shortly after the New
Hampshire defeat when top strategist Karl Rove and other Bush
handlers began casting McCain as a Clinton-Gore liberal because his
$283 billion tax cut proposal is about half the size of the one
Bush has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear Monday that Bush's new strategy is to cast
McCain _ a 17-year Beltway veteran (the last 13 as a senator) _ as
a cynical insider happy to accept the contributions he derides on
the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Buchanan, a political scientist at the University of
Texas, said Bush's new tack would be a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing people care about is evidence of authenticity and
stand-alone leadership ... `` Buchanan said. ``Bush is the very
embodiment of the hypercautious candidate. That's his problem, not
liberalism or conservatism. I'm amazed that a guy as smart as Rove
hasn't figured that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not use the word hypocrite Monday to characterize
McCain but said he'd call attention to the differences between
``what people say and what they do.'' In his two gubernatorial
races, Bush proudly noted that he never attacked an opponent. In
the presidential race, he has said he would adhere to an ``honest,
optimistic and very positive campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his new strategy is all about defending his record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna take it to him,'' Bush said of McCain. ``I'm gonna
take it to him. I'm not gonna let this happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   During a televised debate last month, Bush and McCain shook
hands to seal their agreement not to go negative on each other.
Now, both will air a TV ad showing the handshake and accusing the
opposition of breaking the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we really want another politician in the White House
America can't trust?'' the McCain ad asks. The Bush campaign has
not released the text of its handshake ad that will begin airing
this week in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent the day shadow-boxing with McCain, who skipped
today's Delaware race and headed straight to South Carolina, eager
to capitalize on his New Hampshire win. Polls indicate a tight race
in South Carolina and show McCain gaining on Bush in polls of
national GOP voters.
</P>
<P>
   Basil R. Battaglia, Delaware's Republican party chairman,
criticized McCain's ``cafeteria-style campaign.'' He said Bush's
New Hampshire loss won't mean a thing to Delaware's 164,000
registered voters. Even if it does, Delaware, with 12 GOP
delegates, is hardly a high-stakes stop on the long road to the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to Steve Forbes. The millionaire magazine
publisher won here in 1996 and has been traversing the state
spreading his anti-tax, anti-abortion message. That may help him in
a state that is half the size of Los Angeles County, has no sales
tax and laws that have enticed more than 170,000 Fortune 500
companies to incorporated here.
</P>
<P>
   But most eyes were on the McCain-Bush showdown in South
Carolina. Bush heads there today on a campaign jet he jokingly said
he's renamed from ``Great Expectations'' to ``Retooled One.''
</P>
<P>
   Not in the retooled strategy, however, is any attempt to
distance the candidate from his famous parents. Ex-President George
Bush and wife Barbara made their first public campaign appearance
for their son on the Saturday before the New Hampshire primary. At
the time, polls showed Bush within striking distance of McCain, and
gave no hint of the landslide to come.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-President Bush will step up his involvement today with
appearances in Michigan, site of a Feb. 22 primary. He also will
hold his first campaign-related news conference. Barbara Bush will
attend several Virginia campaign events on Wednesday.

 &HT;    CDC boost envisions new labs, research, services
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Count the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
among the winners in President Clinton's federal budget for 2001:
The Atlanta-based agency's annual budget gets a proposed raise of
5.5 percent or $195 million dollars more than this year,
potentially bringing its total appropriation to $3.53 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In any year, three-fourths of CDC's budget flows in the door and
out again, to state and local health departments, and university
and field research. But the remainder of the 2001 funds, if
approved, will go to improve buildings, laboratories and electronic
resources at the agency's Chamblee and Clifton Road campuses, and
to expand HIV prevention and programs aimed at improving the health
of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The funding boost comes at a time when the CDC is mounting a
multiyear, multimillion-dollar expansion of its Clifton Road
facilities and satellite operations in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This budget, as a whole, addresses our need to reposition and
renovate public health in the next century,'' Dr. Jeffrey Koplan,
CDC's director, said in an interview. ``It strengthens us at the
federal level, and at state and local levels as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Highlights of the proposed CDC budget, released by Health and
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala at an afternoon press
conference, include:
</P>
<P>
   -- $127 million (an increase of almost $70 million over the
previous year) to improve security and build three new
laboratories: the second half of a new infectious diseases research
lab, and a new high-biosafety lab for very dangerous pathogens,
both on Clifton Road, plus a new environmental-health laboratory in
Chamblee.
</P>
<P>
   -- $795 million (an increase of $66 million) for HIV/AIDS
prevention efforts, including a $40 million increase for prevention
programs within the United States, $10 million to support
community-based programs, and $61 million to combat AIDS abroad,
especially in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   -- $123 million (an increase of $25 million) for combatting
emerging infectious diseases, including $20 million to create a
national electronic disease-surveillance network that will provide
early warnings of new infections and bioterrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   -- $151 million (an increase of $15 million) to prevent cases of
other sexually-transmitted diseases _ especially syphilis, which
CDC hopes shortly to eliminate in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   -- $39 million (an increase of almost $10 million from the
previous year) for food safety research, including an expansion of
the PulseNet system that allows labs across the country to compare
strains of bacteria electronically.
</P>
<P>
   -- Increases in funds for programs that target adolescent
smoking prevention, monitoring for environmental hazards and
screening for breast and cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
   -- $999 million in funds that will be shared among CDC and other
federal agencies to guarantee that at least 90 percent of U.S.
children receive the full series of recommended childhood vaccines.
That appropriation includes money to buy vaccines for underinsured
children, to research vaccine safety, and to target polio
eradication around the world.

France became the first country to give its school nurses the right

CHIEF THEMES OF MILITARY BUDGET: MODERNIZING AND TROOP WELFARE
</HEADLINE>
   (With BUDGET-CLINTON) 
(jw) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The $291.1 billion Pentagon budget proposed by the
Clinton administration on Monday not only reflects peacetime
concerns about improving the lives of those who serve but also
looks ahead to the challenges of a national anti-missile defense
and quick-and-dirty regional combat.
</P>
<P>
   The budget, for the fiscal year that will begin on Oct. 1, calls
for a 3.7 percent increase in military pay on top of last year's
increase, which brought the troops their first raise after
inflation since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   New in the budget proposal is an increase in the housing
allowances paid to all service members who live off base. The
Defense Department would increase those allowances by $3 billion
over the next five years; the effect would be that at the end of
that period, personnel living off base would no longer have any
out-of-pocket housing expenses. The Pentagon would also push ahead
programs to improve on-base housing.
</P>
<P>
   While the budget would add $369 million next year to the
Pentagon's medical care program, top officials of the department
have yet to agree on a plan providing health care coverage to
retirees. Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, has failed to persuade Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen
to approve a new $3 billion-a-year program to cover retirees'
health care costs, even though both men consider such coverage an
obligation of the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the options we've looked at are quite expensive,''
Cohen said in presenting the budget Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The military's Kosovo campaign, which brought $2 billion in
emergency costs, revealed shortcomings in the services'
war-fighting abilities and helped shape the new budget, with its
accent on modern weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   In particular this budget finds the Army, which had serious
difficulties deploying its Apache helicopters to Albania, unveiling
important changes for the sake of modernization. To make its forces
more mobile, the Army has cut by half the financing for its
fledgling Crusader artillery system until officials are convinced
that it can be built light enough for quick deployment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Army has scrapped plans to build two new
vehicles, the Wolverine and the Grizzley, which among other uses
would have cleared minefields and knocked down bridges. Instead,
the service will spend $14.5 billion to create new weaponry, in
particular a mobile, lightweight armored vehicle that can be used
for combat in small-scale conflicts as well as major wars.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has also reordered its budget, to spend more than $3
billion on development of a new destroyer powered by electric
motor, a ship that Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig has said
will become a model for the future fleet.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the amount sought to develop various new weapons systems
for the military as a whole is $60 billion. The budget also calls
for $1.9 billion to be spent on a national anti-missile defense
system should President Clinton decide to build one, to protect the
nation from limited nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Air Force, it had expected approval of all its plans
to build new fighter jets, given the successful air campaign in
Kosovo. Instead, Congress last year scaled back production of the
F-22 fighter for the current fiscal year, in protest of the plane's
escalating costs. Now the Air Force proposes to put the F-22 back
on schedule by spending $4 billion on the program next year, with
plans to buy as many as 36 planes a year by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The two leading Republican presidential candidates, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, have both argued
that military spending is too low.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen said Monday that since taking office in 1997, he had
``laid the foundation'' for a strengthened military through
increased spending. For the current fiscal year, spending rose by
$17 billion, a figure that amounted to the end of the so-called
peace dividend, which had brought nearly 10 years of shrinking
armed forces and military budgets. This proposed budget is $13.5
billion more than the current year's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes without saying that we have the finest military in the
world,'' Cohen said. ``We intend to keep it precisely that way.''

CENTRAL ISSUE IN THE ECONOMIC DEBATE: REAGANOMICS VS. CLINTONOMICS
</HEADLINE>
   (See also BUDGET-CLINTON) 
(jw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By the reckoning of the National Bureau of Economic
Research, the independent group that has the final say on these
matters, the current economic expansion _ as of this month the
longest on record _ dates from March 1991.
</P>
<P>
   That was nearly two years before Bill Clinton took office as
president. But since his two terms in the White House have largely
overlapped the extended run of prosperity, Clinton and his team
have not been shy about claiming their share of credit. They point
in particular to the administration's record in balancing the
budget, thereby keeping long-term interest rates down, stimulating
business investment in efficiency-enhancing technology and creating
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   While deficit spending gave the economy a temporary and
ultimately costly lift in the 1980s, Clinton said in an interview
last week, the economy only went on a sustainable long-term growth
path after he pushed a deficit-reduction package through Congress
over Republican opposition in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we actually passed it, people could see we were serious,
and I think it was just like breaking through a dam,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   But by the reckoning of most Republicans, the current expansion
is nothing more than an extension of a growth surge that began
early in the Reagan administration. With the exception of a short,
shallow recession in late 1990 and early 1991 that coincided with
the Persian Gulf war, the economy has grown steadily since November
1982, driven by Reagan-era tax cuts and deregulation, they say.
</P>
<P>
   To the degree that the country's improved fiscal position has
helped, they said, it was only pressure from Republicans that
forced Clinton to abandon big spending programs and support
aggressive efforts to eliminate the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Bill Clinton to be taking credit for this economic boom
we're experiencing is like the rooster taking credit for the
sunrise,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Kudlow, who was an economist in the Reagan
administration, said the reductions in marginal income tax rates in
the early 1980s and steps to free a variety of industries from
price controls and other regulation ``opened the door to a
tremendous entrepreneurial burst, which has gained momentum and
continues.''
</P>
<P>
   This current stretch of good times, however framed, clearly has
many factors behind it. There have been dizzying advances in
computing power and breakthroughs in new technologies. Investors
have proved eager to finance even risky new ideas. The nation's
work force, strengthened by a huge wave of capital spending, has
become much more productive. The Federal Reserve has conducted
monetary policy with skill and flexibility. The United States has
benefited to some extent from the problems that have plagued much
of the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But this is an election year, making it hard to avoid putting
the economy and the longevity of this expansion in a political
context.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the Clinton boom is Vice President Al Gore, whose
economic platform calls for a combination of fiscal conservatism
and incremental government activism that is all but identical to
the program pursued by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the forces of Reaganism is Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, who is running on a big tax cut intended not just to bolster
economic growth but to keep politicians in Washington from
frittering away the federal budget surplus on what Republicans see
as costly and wasteful government programs.
</P>
<P>
   Given the challenge that both face from within their own
parties, especially on fiscal policy, neither camp can be assured
of carrying its message into November. On the Democratic side,
former Sen. Bill Bradley is unapologetically calling for big
spending programs to deal with big problems like child poverty and
access to health care. Among the Republicans, Sen. John McCain of
Arizona is making a case that dealing with long-run problems like
the solvency of Social Security is more important than tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, to a remarkable degree, the economic policy debate
this year comes down to the question of the 1980s versus the 1990s
_ tax cuts and an emphasis on reducing the size and influence of
federal government vs. a belief that spending more on priorities
like health, education and the environment can coexist with
strengthening the national balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Economists, never mind politicians, will no doubt argue the
merits of both sides for decades. The importance of Washington in
shaping the economy has faded in recent years. Still, some credit
no doubt goes to both sides, as well as to other players, even some
with otherwise poor economic records, like President Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Two things happened in the Carter administration that helped
shape what came later, said William Niskanen, who was an economist
in the Reagan administration and is now chairman of the Cato
Institute, a conservative research group.
</P>
<P>
   One was the beginning of a wave of deregulation, starting with
the airline industry, that broke a long spell in which the
government had steadily taken a more active role in the economy.
Over the next decade it spread rapidly through industries including
trucking, bus lines, energy and financial services.
</P>
<P>
   The other, Niskanen said, was Carter's decision, in 1979, to
appoint Paul Volcker to lead the Federal Reserve. Although Carter
turned on Volcker in the early 1980s, Volcker went on to defeat the
high inflation that was crippling the economy, setting the stage
for the era of price stability now being managed by Volcker's
successor, Alan Greenspan.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the same time there was a growing clamor for tax cuts among
Republicans in Congress, led by Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and Sen.
William Roth Jr. of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basics were in place for what later became called
Reaganomics,'' Niskanen said. ``Tax rate reductions, deregulation,
tight money.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change after Ronald Reagan's election was the
passage in 1981 of the Kemp-Roth tax bill, which sharply lowered
marginal income tax rates, cutting the top rate from 70 percent to
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kemp-Roth tax cut became the rallying cry of the Reagan
forces, and it's what turned the country around,'' Roth said. ``It
turned the country from a period of pessimism to confidence in the
future, and it freed up money that allowed entrepreneurs to take
greater risks. That was the opening shot of the period of
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   But the big tax cuts, combined with a big increase in military
spending and an unwillingness on the part of Congress to cut
domestic spending, sent the budget deficit and the national debt
climbing to previously unheard-of levels.
</P>
<P>
   There were many other developments in the 1980s that had a
positive influence on the economy, including a drift in both
parties toward supporting free trade and a revolution on Wall
Street, which came up with new and sophisticated ways to raise
money for entrepreneurs and big corporations.
</P>
<P>
   But in the view of many Democrats, the economy that Clinton
inherited in 1993 was little more than a shell, its strength
hollowed out by the strain that rapidly growing deficits were
creating. While the economy was growing, it was weak, and another
recession did not seem out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush and Democrats in Congress had agreed on a
deficit-reduction package in 1990, but the deficits had continued
to increase. Clinton originally backed a traditional Keynesian
stimulus package of new spending to give the economy a boost, but
then went all out to bring down interest rates by persuading Wall
Street that he was serious about debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have gotten out of the recession of the late '70s and
early '80s with this massive deficit spending, but to build it
structurally into the economy was a big burden,'' Clinton said in
the interview last week. ``We decided we would break it
structurally.''
</P>
<P>
   Helped by a steadily improving economy, the deficits have melted
away since 1993, replaced lately by huge surpluses that could well
continue for many years. The national debt is falling, freeing
capital for investment in private industry. Democrats credit the
1993 deficit reduction plan, augmented by the 1997 bipartisan
balanced budget act, further moves to tear down trade barriers and
the updating of legislation governing key industries like
telecommunications and financial services.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things, even before they were actually felt, helped
to create a mindset of confidence, which it seems to me is critical
for keeping the recovery going this long,'' Clinton said. Democrats
also point out that nearly all Republicans in Congress opposed the
1993 deficit-reduction plan because it raised rates for
upper-income taxpayers. Many Republican leaders openly predicted it
would ruin the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Should Bush win the White House in the fall and push through a
Reagan-sized tax cut, the president added, the country could
ultimately be faced again with painful choices: cutting spending,
dipping into the Social Security surplus or returning to budget
deficits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The likeliest thing would be a slow return to the deficit,''
Clinton said, ``which I think in the world we're living in would be
a bad error.'' &QL;

YUGOSLAV DEFENSE MINISTER, A CLOSE ALLY OF MILOSEVIC, IS SLAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia _ Yugoslavia's defense minister was shot and
killed Monday night when unidentified gunmen fired automatic
weapons through the windows of a Belgrade soccer club where he was
eating, the Belgrade police said.
</P>
<P>
   The minister, Pavle Bulatovic, 51, was from Montenegro and was a
close ally of Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic. Bulatovic
had been defense minister since 1993 and had earlier served as the
Yugoslav minister of the interior in a government led by Milan
Panic, whom Milosevic fired.
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic was an important member of Milosevic's allied party in
Montenegro, the Socialist People's Party.
</P>
<P>
   The party is now in opposition in Montenegro, Serbia's sister
republic, which is led by Western-leaning president Milo
Djukanovic. Djukanovic has become an outspoken opponent of
Milosevic and has supported an eventual referendum on Montenegro's
independence from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear why Bulatovic, a relatively colorless figure
with a low profile in Belgrade, might have been assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   His killing bore the hallmarks of a gangland-style murder, like
many of the political killings in Belgrade that have never been
solved. It came just one month after the Serbian paramilitary and
criminal leader, Zeljko Raznatovic, also known as Arkan, was shot
dead after eating dinner in a Belgrade hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The police say that they have captured most of those responsible
for that killing but that the organizers of the deed remain at
large. More than a dozen prominent people, some close to Milosevic,
have been killed in Belgrade in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Montenegro noted that Bulatovic was considered an
important player in the tense relationship between Serbia and
Montenegro. During the NATO bombing war against Yugoslavia last
year, he pushed for a more robust Yugoslav military intervention in
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   They also suggested Monday evening that Bulatovic had been
active in organizing military police that could be used in any
clash between Milosevic's Yugoslavia, which has up to 12,000 troops
in Montenegro, and Serbia's sister republic, where Djukanovic has
built up an equal number of well-armed police, a quasi-military of
his own.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government, which met in a special session Monday
night after the killing, sent condolences to Bulatovic's family and
said in a statement that he ``was the victim of a classic terrorist
act'' and urged the launching of a fight against such terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government gives full support to the relevant
state organs in their uncompromising struggle against terrorism,''
the statement said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bulatovic often ate at the restaurant of the soccer club Rad,
near the military clinic where he was pronounced dead. His two
companions _ banker Vuk Obradovic and restaurant owner Mirko
Knezevic _ were wounded. They were sitting at a corner table when
the gunmen, apparently standing on the soccer field outside, fired
through the windows just before 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Ljubisa Mitrovic, the editor-in-chief of the independent
Montenegrin newspaper Vjesti, said Monday night that Bulatovic
``was another victim from Milosevic's inner circle, another in a
series of murders whose motives are not clear but were obviously
well-planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic is no direct relation to Momir Bulatovic, the Yugoslav
prime minister and leader of the Socialist People's Party. But the
two men became friendly while working together at a newspaper in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   There were also persistent rumors that Bulatovic had contacts
with an important member of the Belgrade criminal world, Darko
Asanin, who was killed two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic was born in the Montenegrin village of Gornji Rovci in
the northern part of the coastal republic. He was trained as an
economist, was married and had three children.

TRIAL FOR CLINTON-GORE FUND-RAISER BEGINS IN CALIFORNIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A longtime fund-raiser for Vice President Al Gore
went on trial here Monday on charges that she helped disguise
illegal campaign donations to the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign,
including at least $55,000 connected to a controversial appearance
by the vice president at a Buddhist temple in California.
</P>
<P>
   In opening statements before a federal jury, a Justice
Department prosecutor asserted that the fund-raiser, Maria Hsia,
employed a scheme to violate the law and deceive the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Yaffe, the prosecutor, said Hsia arranged for people to
write checks to make it appear they were making political
donations. In reality, Yaffe said, these straw donors were
illegally reimbursed by other wealthy donors, including the Hsi Lai
Temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The real donors were ineligible to give the money either because
the amount of their donations exceeded legal limits or they were
foreign nationals who were prohibited from giving campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people used as straw donors, the government has
charged, were dozens of nuns and monks at the Buddhist temple where
Gore attended an April 1996 event.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will doubtlessly serve as a reminder of what became a
deeply embarrassing incident for Gore, and has provided material
for his political opponents. At first, Gore asserted that his
attendance was merely something that he called ``community
outreach,'' but he later acknowledged that he knew it had something
to do with fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond serving as an untimely reminder of the 1996 Democratic
fund-raising practices, the trial may not produce any fresh
damaging information against Gore. In his opening statement, Yaffe
asserted that Hsia engaged in the deception by herself along with a
few close associates. Among those who were deceived, he said, were
people at the Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia, a California immigration consultant, has denied any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In describing how Hsia allegedly arranged for the nuns and monks
to pretend they were actual Democratic donors, Yaffe said, ``She
didn't tell the Clinton-Gore committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaffe is part of a special task force named by Attorney General
Janet Reno to investigate possible fund-raising abuses in the 1996
campaign. Reno formed the task force in place of seeking the
appointment of an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In Yaffe's telling, among those who were duped by Hsia were the
finance chairmen and treasurers of the Clinton-Gore campaign, the
Democratic National Committee and the finance committee for the
re-election bid of Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, a Rhode Island
Democrat, who also received contributions in the name of nuns and
monks from the California temple.
</P>
<P>
   Yaffe said Hsia even concealed her actions from John Huang, a
former fund-raiser for the Democratic National Committee who has
been depicted by Republicans in Congress as a major figure in
fund-raising irregularities involving Asians.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia, a naturalized American citizen born in Taiwan, has had a
long association with Gore, and is equally unlikely to suggest in
her defense that either Gore or President Clinton were part of some
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Nancy Luque, said in her opening statement that no
scheme existed because Hsia was unaware that those people who wrote
checks were not using their own money.
</P>
<P>
   Luque sought in her remarks to narrow the scope of the case for
the jury. She argued that Hsia is not charged with undermining the
political system or engaging in illegal schemes to conceal
donations as the prosecution had just told the jury. The actual
charges, five felony counts, are that Hsia ``caused someone else to
make false statements'' to the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case about five lies, and they claim she caused
these five lies,'' Luque said. If any lies were made, she said,
they were by the officials of the Clinton-Gore campaign, the
Democratic National Committee and Kennedy's finance aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Maria never spoke to any of those people,'' Luque said,
adding that even if Hsia knew there were falsely listed donors _
something she denies _ that would not be a crime because she was
not obligated to inform the campaign officials.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges in two counts that for a 1995
fund-raising dinner at the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles, Hsia
found straw donors to help buy two tables.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Hsia is said to have arranged for a wealthy
businessman to donate $10,000, but since federal law limits a
single donor to $1,000 per election, she had him distribute $5,000
among five family members. She had five others write checks for
$1,000 each and they were reimbursed in cash, the prosecution says.
</P>
<P>
   For the second table, she found straw donors because the real
donor was a foreign national, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Three other counts concern the Hsi Lai Temple. One of those
involves donations to the Patrick Kennedy campaign and two involve
the Clinton-Gore campaign, which the government said received as
much as $100,000 from the temple, funneled through nuns, monks and
others.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the April 29 luncheon with Gore, the government
charges that Hsia ``arranged for Gore to be invited'' and that
``she and John Huang were the driving force behind this event.''

 &HT;    Not many answers in Lewis murder case
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than a week after the celebrated post-Super Bowl slayings
in Buckhead, the public knows next to nothing about the case beyond
the fact that NFL star Ray Lewis is accused of stabbing two men to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Most can probably remember the brand of limousine involved more
easily than the names of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police, rarely particularly forthcoming about an
investigation, have shown remarkable reticence in this, one of the
most sensational cases to confront them in years. Chief Beverly
Harvard has not uttered a word, which is her wont in a high-profile
case. Mayor Bill Campbell has confined his comments to generalities
about seeking justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewis case is a hot topic across the nation. Some people,
especially in Baltimore where Lewis is considered a team leader and
is active in social programs, are concerned he is being held on
thin evidence. Atlanta police are still getting dozens of calls
daily from reporters in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Police have confirmed only that:
</P>
<P>
   _They believe the altercation that led to the deaths of Jacinth
Baker and Richard Lollar started in a nightclub called Cobalt.
</P>
<P>
   _They found a knife at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   _Lewis' Lincoln Navigator stretch limousine was struck by
bullets ``one or more times.''
</P>
<P>
   _They arrested Lewis and charged him with two murders.
</P>
<P>
   _They recovered a firearm from in front of a Buckhead florist's
shop.
</P>
<P>
   _They believe that two of Lewis' acquaintances, A.J. Johnson and
Kwame King, were also in the 40-foot limousine.
</P>
<P>
   _On Monday, they confirmed that detectives searched Lewis' home
in suburban Baltimore. (His attorney had already confirmed that.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of those points are hotly contested. No one has said
publicly they saw the victims inside the Cobalt club
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, it seems unlikely the victims could have
gotten into the club. They were dressed neatly but casually, and
there was no indication they could afford the $100-a-head cover
charge or $10 per drink.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson spoke up from Baltimore and claimed that not only was he
not in the limo, he wasn't even in Atlanta. He said he stayed in
Baltimore on
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl weekend and didn't know Lewis well enough to be
invited to go club-hopping with him.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta officers talked with Johnson in Baltimore on Friday.
They won't say if they've talked to King.
</P>
<P>
   They also won't say who else was in the limo; that matter, they
say, is ``still being investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the limo, Duane Fassett, was put under police
guard. While detectives apparently based their arrest warrant for
Lewis on what Fassett told them, the driver has told others that
Lewis had nothing to do with the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Who shot the limo? Police probably know, but they are not
telling. There are unconfirmed reports that the shooter was an
armed citizen trying to stop the fleeing behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   Police also have searched the Gwinnett County home of attorney
Max Richardson, where Lewis was arrested. They will not say what
they found.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' Maryland attorney said police who entered the football
player's home there Monday morning carried away plastic containers
full of things he would not mention, plus Lewis's computer. What
any of this might have to do with an apparent heat-of-the-moment
crime in Atlanta is not explained.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' attorneys have not been particularly talkative, either,
other than to repeatedly insist he had nothing to do with the
crime. They have not offered to explain why Lewis, though it was
his $150-an-hour limousine, would let anyone in his party get out,
stab a couple of Decatur men three times apiece, then get back in
and speed away.
</P>
<P>
   Officer John Quigley, spokesman for the Atlanta police
department, would not agree that police are saying less about the
Lewis case than they might about one of lower profile. ``It's
inappropriate to discuss witnesses and evidence at this stage in
the investigation,'' he said.

 &HT;    In Atlanta, Buckhead is partytown
 &HT;    By Paul Donsky
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many people around the country, night life in Atlanta means
one thing: Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities around the country have similar, high-profile night
spots _ the French Quarter in New Orleans, Georgetown in
Washington, D.C., Rush Street in Chicago, South Beach in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   All are relatively historic areas that, over the years, have
evolved from neighborhoods and even suburbs into Party Central. All
are places where, on any given evening, tourists, businessmen and
locals converge to eat fancy meals, grab a drink, shop and dance.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Buckhead has become an important tourist
attraction and revenue producer for the city. But some local
residents wonder if the party scene has gotten out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Three homicides in the last two weeks in Buckhead _ including a
double murder last week near the Cobalt club _ have put the upscale
community on edge. Some leaders are calling for earlier closing
times, parking restrictions and more police in efforts to make the
area safer.
</P>
<P>
   Homicides are rare in most entertainment districts around the
country. Georgetown has seen two murders over the last three years,
Washington police said. The Buckhead bar district has had three
murders during that same time period, though those in Buckhead were
committed over a much shorter time span.
</P>
<P>
   Murders also are extremely unusual in Chicago's Rush Street
neighborhood and Nashville's downtown District, though police in
those cities said they had no figures available on the exact number
of homicides
</P>
<P>
   The French Quarter has been a bit more violent, reporting 16
murders from January 1997 to June 1999, New Orleans police said.
</P>
<P>
   How other entertainment districts deal with the crowds and crime
may offer Atlanta leaders some guidance as they deal with growing
pains in Buckhead:
</P>
<P>
   _ A moratorium on liquor licenses in Georgetown has helped that
district remain vibrant by maintaining a healthy mix of
restaurants, shops and bars, local business leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   _ In New Orleans, sophisticated crime-fighting strategies and a
beefed-up police force are credited with cleaning up the French
Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Nashville's bustling downtown area, known as The District,
police say a crack-down on ``quality of life'' crimes like
vandalism and traffic offenses has helped transform what was once a
dangerous, crime-ridden spot.
</P>
<P>
   Business and community leaders say some problems are unavoidable
when you mix large numbers of people with alcohol. But, they add,
serious, violent crimes are rare occurrences that do not accurately
reflect the safety of entertainment districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buckhead and Georgetown are probably the safest places in
Atlanta and in Washington,'' said Paul Cohn, president of the
Georgetown Business and Professional Association.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn, vice president of a company that once owned J. Paul's
restaurant in Buckhead, said the recent killings there should not
be seen as a sign the area has turned a corner and is headed for
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take an isolated incident and stake a case for it,''
Cohn said. ``I stayed at the Ritz three weeks ago and walked by
Cobalt. There were a lot of police presence in cars. I felt very
safe. Things like that can happen anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say preventative steps can't help cut crime,
police and community leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   The violent crime rate in New Orleans has been cut nearly in
half since 1996, when the city began increasing the size of the
police force and police began using computers to track crimes and
act more proactively.
</P>
<P>
   Few places in the world rival the French Quarter's party
atmosphere. With its narrow, French-named boulevards, street
artists, peep shows, open-all-night bars and restaurants, the
Quarter has become a top tourist attraction and one of the city's
leading industries.
</P>
<P>
   Local leaders say despite the rowdy atmosphere, violent crime is
not a given in the area.
</P>
<P>
   A once-neglected home to dive bars and run-down honky-tonks,
Nashville's downtown District has made a dramatic turnaround in
recent years to become the heart and soul of Nashville's night
life.
</P>
<P>
   Trendy bars and packed nightclubs now line Second Avenue and
Broadway, the area's main streets, which are packed with locals and
tourists most weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Tayler, general manager of Buffalo Billiards and Havana
Lounge, an upscale District bar and restaurant frequented by many
Tennessee Titans players, said she's had few problems other than
the occasional fight involving college kids.
</P>
<P>
   It's important for a city to have the type of vibrant night
scene the District provides Nashville, Tayler said. ``What the
District down here offers to people is an enormous variety of
things to do.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, city officials have learned the hard way that
special steps must be taken during some events. Celebrations after
the city won professional football and basketball championships got
out of hand, recalled Burton F. Natarus, a longtime Chicago
alderman whose district includes the Rush Street area and the
Michigan Avenue shopping district north of the downtown Loop.
</P>
<P>
   When large crowds are expected in Rush Street, police now block
off streets to keep people confined to certain areas that are
heavily patrolled, Natarus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is the fact that on these streets
where there are large numbers of people gathered for entertainment
is (to have) a large police presence,'' Natarus said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Buckhead leaders are worried that the area has become
overrun with bars and have suggested zoning changes to attract more
shops to the area.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn, of the Georgetown business association, agreed with that
concern, saying that a moratorium on liquor licenses has capped the
number of bars and clubs in Georgetown and allowed other businesses
to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were finding there were too many bars opening up one right
after another,'' Cohn said. ``We wanted to keep a good mix of
retail. You can't have a bar on every corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want this to become another Bourbon Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Buckhead residents also have wondered if earlier closing
times would reduce the risk of violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   Bars in Buckhead now stop serving alcohol at 4 a.m. Clubs in
Washington have to stop selling alcohol at 2 a.m. Monday through
Thursday and at 3 a.m. on weekends. In Nashville, taps go dry at 3
a.m. In Chicago, most bars stop selling drinks at 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Monaghan, owner of Molly's on the Market, a fixture in the
French Quarter for three decades, said curfews or earlier closing
times will not do any good.
</P>
<P>
   Molly's is only closed for four hours a day _ between 6 a.m. and
10 a.m., Monaghan said.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing up the closing time ``won't help a thing. That will just
worsen the situation,'' Monaghan said. `` It's like taking away
liquor in Prohibition. Anything they take away, (people) will do
just the opposite. That's human nature.''

2 WOULD-BE WASHINGTONS CROSS INTO DELAWARE; 1 DOESN'T 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BUSH-DEL, MCCAIN-MICH) 
(nk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ For Steve Forbes, the Republican primary in
Delaware on Tuesday is a chance to prove there is life left in his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   For George Bush, on the other hand, the race here is mostly a
distraction from his main goal nowadays of stopping Sen. John
McCain in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is on the ballot here, but he has not campaigned at all.
</P>
<P>
   In most respects, the contest in Delaware, which has only
700,000 residents and 12 delegates to the Republican National
Convention, is but a minor twist on the road from New Hampshire
last week to South Carolina, where the primary is Feb. 19. The race
has hardly been mentioned on network television or in the national
press, and even this state's newspapers are treating it casually.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats choose their delegates in caucuses beginning month, so
neither Vice President Al Gore nor former Sen. Bill Bradley
campaigned for the Democratic primary last Saturday. Gore won with
57 percent of the vote and a turnout of about 5 percent of the
state's 200,000 registered Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican race is being taken somewhat more seriously.
Forbes has spent considerable resources here, hoping to replicate
his experience in 1996, when he was the only candidate who
campaigned in the state. He won the primary with 33 percent of the
vote to Bob Dole's 27 percent. About 33,000 Republicans voted in
that primary, a turnout of about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush had no choice but to compete here, given his
emphasis on conducting a 50-state campaign. In Wilmington on
Monday, taking a swipe at McCain, Bush said, ``Anybody campaigning
for president ought to run in every state.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been no reliable recent public polls. As is the case
in most other states, Bush has the support of the business and
political establishment here, including Rep. Michael N. Castle, the
popular former governor who is Delaware's only House member.
</P>
<P>
   And within these circles, the prevailing view is that Bush will
win handily. Over the weekend, The Baltimore Sun quoted Patrick
Murray, a retired banker who is chairman of the Bush campaign in
Kent County, as promising a ``68 to 70 percent'' victory for the
Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' strength is difficult to calculate. He has spent much
more time here than Bush. Monday, on the third leg of a four-day
bus tour, Forbes once again emphasized his opposition to abortion
and the tax system. He also expressed optimism about his prospects
and took swipes at Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elites are not picking the nominee,'' Forbes, a wealthy
publisher, said in Dover, referring to Bush's loss in New Hampshire
to McCain and his less-than-overwhelming victory in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Because Delaware does not have its own network-affiliated
television stations _ coverage comes from Philadelphia in the north
and Baltimore in the south _ Forbes cannot blanket the state with
commercials. He and Bush are both running advertisements on cable
television stations and on radio, but it is nothing like the
commercial saturation that characterized the race in New Hampshire,
where Forbes finished a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' advisers are playing down his chances, clearly hoping
that if he does make a strong showing it will exceed expectations.
</P>
<P>
   When asked at a news conference whether he would stay in the
race until the Republican convention in order to throw his support
to either McCain or Bush, Forbes responded, ``I see it the other
way,'' adding, ``I may need the help of one of them to get over the
top.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bush's allies question whether, with all eyes on South
Carolina and so few delegates at stake here, he should be competing
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a no-win proposition for him in Delaware,'' said an
ardent Bush supporter in Congress. ``If he wins big, it will be
discounted because McCain is not in the race. And if he loses or if
he only barely beats Forbes, it will be seen as a further sign of
weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, on his third visit to the state, Bush criticized McCain
for taking contributions from lobbyists while calling for campaign
finance reform. Bush said his record as governor showed that he was
the true reformer in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Another unknown factor is whether McCain is at all competitive,
not having campaigned or spent any money in the state. There is a
large Air Force base in Dover and thousands of military retirees
who might back the Arizona senator live nearby. A small bank of
McCain volunteers was making calls Monday to drum up votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McCain had tried here,'' said Basil Battaglia, the state
Republican chairman, ``he probably would have done pretty well.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There is a jingle to Rep. Charles B. Rangel's step
now, a little like the ka-ching of a cash register swallowing up
dollar bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``They throw it at me,'' Rangel said, only half-kidding, about
the money he is collecting to win back control of the House for the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which is in
charge of raising money and spending it strategically to win this
year's crucial House races, is awash in money right now. In a
remarkable turnaround, the group has more than doubled the amount
of cash in the bank _ $19.8 million as of Dec. 31 _than its
Republican counterpart in the House has. And, in a year of
staggering war chests, it has socked away more money than any other
party committee, Republican or Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Few Democratic members have helped raise more cash this year
than Rangel, the 15-term congressman from Harlem with the gravelly
voice, wry sense of humor and a bygone aversion to campaign
fund-raising. And few members stand to benefit as directly from a
Democratic victory as Rangel, who is now the senior member of the
New York congressional delegation and would become chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee, which shapes tax, Social Security
and Medicare policy.
</P>
<P>
   In a field cluttered with money-raising schemes, Rangel, 69, has
tapped into a novel fund-raising combination. He has by turn
reached out to old money _from traditional Democratic sources in
the business world _ and new money, much of it from a burgeoning
group of wealthy African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's new money,'' Erik Smith, a spokesman for the Democratic
House Campaign Committee, said about the $2.5 million that Rangel
raised last year. ``There is a term called `hitting a new vein.'
And that's what he's been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel's pitch is straightforward, more suave than blunt. And it
inevitably focuses on his possible ascendancy to the tax-writing
committee's chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Charlie is selling is one of the most powerful positions
in the Congress, if not the government,'' said Robert Johnson, the
chairman of Black Entertainment Television Holdings, who is a
contributor.
</P>
<P>
   In his pitches to African-American business leaders, who
historically have not focused their giving on House races, Rangel
asks them to picture a House where black lawmakers would hold
unprecedented sway: himself at the helm of the Ways and Means
Committee, Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan as chairman of the
Judiciary Committee and 19 other black members in control of
various subcommittees.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executives, who relish a tax cut of any size and usually
donate more money to Republicans, are often reeled in when Rangel
asks a hypothetical question: What if? And it has been effective.
More Republicans are sending money the Democrats' way, and in the
last few months.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel said he had sat down with a few unnamed, rich corporate
heads in luxurious private clubs, simply because they wanted to get
to know him better.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the black community, he relies on a combination of pride
and power,'' Johnson said. ``And in the white community, he says,
`Don't you want to hedge your bet on who will be chairman?' People
are putting safe money in his hands and pride money in his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel is so popular in his district _ New York's 15th, which
includes all of Harlem and some of Manhattan's Upper West Side _
that he has seldom had to raise money for his own elections and
none of the current $19.5 million he has raised is for himself. He
is also involved in a get-out-the-vote plan hatched by Bill Lynch,
vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee, that proved
successful in the 1998 elections. He travels to swing districts
where black voters can make a difference, and asks them to turn out
on Election Day, in much the same way the Christian right does with
its supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But his cross-country fund-raising trips have served another
purpose, too: to build a national reputation for a man who is
headed into his 30th year in Congress. While Rangel has been a
household name in New York, his name does not always ring a bell
elsewhere. He is a liberal and a partisan Democrat, and is rightly
perceived that way, but he also is letting people see a third side:
that of the pragmatist, with a rapier wit, who can juggle the
concerns of the poor with the interests of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people didn't know him in the business community,''
said Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, and a former campaign committee
chairman. ``They have certain preconceptions about a congressman
from Harlem, but when they meet him and talk to him, they are blown
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the business world, however, are not as keen about
Rangel's becoming the Ways and Means chairman, and they are
actively working for Republicans to prevent it. They offer the same
pitch to their constituents as Rangel does to his: Imagine this
congressman as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an unmitigated disaster,'' said Brian Reardon, who
handles federal public policy for the National Federation of
Independent Business. ``He doesn't support small business and he
never met a tax he didn't like.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel says nobody ever complains to him. But why would they, he
adds. He shrugs it off by pointing to the political friends he has
among New York's banking, Wall Street and real estate moguls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my chairmanship would shatter the vestiges of racism
overnight,'' Rangel said. ``There are people that absolutely become
colorblind when they got a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no idea how much I want to preserve the economy and
make it grow,'' Rangel added. ``What good is civil rights during a
depression? What good is a decent education if you have no jobs?
Why would you fight against drug addiction if you were not
providing hope on the other hand?''
</P>
<P>
   Sanford I. Weill, the chairman and co-chief executive of
Citigroup, says Rangel does not give business concerns short
shrift.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have an issue, he's somebody you can talk to,'' Weill
said. ``And if what you're saying makes sense, he's supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bernard Rangel was born on June 11, 1930, to a Harlem
factory seamstress and a father he barely knew. A high school
dropout, he eventually joined the Army and fought in the Korean
War, where he rescued 40 men from behind enemy lines. He was
decorated with the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when the Democrats lost control of the House, Rangel,
who was once considered the least ideological black member,
proclaimed a new era for himself as an ``oratorical bomb-thrower.''
He was angry at the Democratic leadership and angry at President
Clinton. And he bemoaned the turn the nation was taking on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel still says he is fiery, but much of that is simply his
role as an agent provocateur in the minority. He enjoys needling
the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Bill Archer of
Texas, whom he sometimes compares to Dreyfus, Inspector Clouseau's
sputtering, foiled-again superior. He also once likened Archer to
Hitler, something the chairman did not forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you would call it strong humor,'' said Rep. E. Clay
Shaw Jr., a conservative Florida Republican on the committee who is
friendly with Rangel. ``Some may call it ruthless humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel staunchly defended Clinton in the impeachment proceedings
last year, saying Republicans were more guilty of high crimes and
misdemeanors than the president when they failed to support
Clinton's decision to bomb Iraqi military sites in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel's colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee say Archer
has made his mark in the last few years, helping to keep his party
unified in committee and reaching out to more conservative
Democrats. Despite his run-ins with Archer, Rangel sometimes works
closely with other Republicans, including Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech before the National Federation of Retailers
in New York City, Rangel struck a chord that is seldom heard on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is, if you're talking about Medicare
and you're talking about Social Security and a real large tax bill,
the Democrats cannot have this and neither can the Republicans
unless we work together,'' he said. ``This is not a spirit of
bipartisanship. This is a spirit of common sense.''

FOR SOME SEQUELS, THIRD TIME'S THE CHARM. OTHER NO. 3'S ARE SERIAL

<P>
   For some reason, our society is fascinated by threes. They're
good: The third time's a charm. They're bad: Three on a match means
bad luck. They're ambiguous: Good things and bad things come in
threes; a three-ring circus can be fun, but it can also signify,
say, an incoherent staff meeting. In baseball, it's good to get a
three-base hit, bad to get three strikes. Beginning writers learn
about a ``rule of threes'': when illustrating a point, use three
examples. Whoops, messed that one up.
</P>
<P>
   We are also a society that doesn't know when to quit, which
could explain why a movie that merits a sequel merits two sequels _
and sometimes, more. This is the case with Scream 3, which opened
to generally positive reviews that still classed it as the weakest
entry in the Scream horror-comedy series. Scream 3 will make a
boatload of money, thanks to magazine-cover hype and little
box-office competition last weekend, but as far as quality goes, it
looks like a victim of the law of diminishing returns.
</P>
<P>
   You can only return to the same well so often before it runs
dry, and the strategy of the Batman and Lethal Weapon series _ add
new characters while keeping old ones _ only serves to make for
noisier, more incoherent movies. Scream 3 manages to avoid this.
Although stars Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox
Arquette and Liev Schrieber (a good actor who probably wants to
break this cycle) return, screenwriter Ehren Kruger doesn't
overcrowd his script with new characters and director Wes Craven
brings the movie in at a mere 90 minutes _ a half-hour less than
Scream 2.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't make Scream 3 necessary, but it was probably
inevitable. Francis Ford Coppola, who created 1970s masterpieces
with The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, couldn't leave well
enough alone and tried to bring the saga to completion with 1990's
The Godfather Part III. Edie Falco, as The Sopranos' Carmela
Soprano, summed up Godfather III best: ``What happened there?''
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1990, The Exorcist novelist/screenwriter William Peter
Blatty tried to undo the damage done by 1977's Exorcist II: The
Heretic by taking the reins on another installment, Exorcist III.
Although it wasn't considered an embarrassment, it didn't have the
hair-frying cultural impact of the 1973 original, which was so
frightening that it scared people who didn't even see it.
</P>
<P>
   Not all movie series have succumbed to this. After the
travesties of Grease 2 and Caddyshack II, the minds behind those
films had the good sense to call it quits. And Gremlins 2, the rare
sequel to surpass its original (and make fun of it), was content
with being the last word in that series. Some of the movies below
(we didn't include all series) should have learned from other
sequel bombs; others were better than we had any right to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Die Hard With a Vengeance: After the adrenaline punch of Die
Hard and the meanness of Die Hard 2, this series (with Bruce Willis
as the world's unluckiest cop) began to show signs of self-parody
with this third installment, despite strong support from Samuel L.
Jackson and Jeremy Irons.
</P>
<P>
   Godfather III: Not really as bad as its reputation indicates,
this is still an example of an ordinary movie standing in the
shadow of two classics.
</P>
<P>
   Return of the Jedi: Again, a movie that's only weak in
comparison with its predecessors (Star Wars and The Empire Strikes
Back), marred with a cuteness that would also infect Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.
</P>
<P>
   Friday the 13th Part III: An exception to the rule, this is
arguably the best movie in this disreputable series, although it's
still pretty blah if you can't see it in 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween III: Season of the Witch: This renegade Halloween
movie has nothing to do with the series' villain, Michael Myers.
And nobody should have anything to do with the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: Yet another movie that's not
that bad, this still suffered from a five-year gap between it and
its predecessor, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Beautifully
cast, though, with Sean Connery as Indiana Jones' dad and River
Phoenix as a younger version of Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Lethal Weapon III: The beginning of the decline of this series,
this installment turned a once dark, angry police drama laced with
humor into a glorified Three Stooges comedy with more graphic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Naked Gun 331/3: The formula for this police farce seemed ripe
for burnout, what with its goofy, joke-a-minute humor. That didn't
stop its makers, the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team, from milking the
formula in a bunch of other movies.
</P>
<P>
   National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation: Another exception, this
Chevy Chase vehicle is funnier than anyone had a right to expect,
largely thanks to a persistent, conniving squirrel.
</P>
<P>
   Police Academy III: Look, we're not even going to pretend to
have watched this. We'll cop to watching the original, which was a
funny guilty pleasure, and to No. 2, which wasn't. That should be
enough. And they made seven of these!
</P>
<P>
   Rocky III: The first Rocky was an underdog that proved cliches
aren't always bad, just as long as you put 'em together correctly.
Rocky 2 was a sentimental favorite. Rocky 3 was at least less
gloppy than the next two entries, but aside from introducing the
world to Mr. T, it's pretty ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Star Trek III: The Search for Spock: The common belief about
Star Trek movies is that the even-numbered ones are pretty good,
while the odd-numbered ones are weak. III is actually OK, it just
doesn't hold up to II and IV. Think of it as a good,
extended-length version of the TV show, and it holds up better.

`AUSTIN CITY LIMITS' MAKES GARTH'S LIMITS CLEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has always been a time-capsule element to ``Austin City
Limits,'' the venerable music show that is kicking off its 25th
anniversary celebration this year on PBS (see local listings for
times and stations).
</P>
<P>
   ``ACL'' has become something of a public television legend _ for
its down-home feel and its survey of American music, from the
mountainside porches and big-city nightclubs and honky-tonks of
America.
</P>
<P>
   To see a Willie Nelson or a Joe Ely or a Los Lobos or a Stevie
Ray Vaughan or a Ruth Brown on ``ACL'' is as close as we will come
to viewing from our living rooms the master American musicians in a
fairly normal performing situation.
</P>
<P>
   The staging is simple, the crowd is small, and the performances
frequently excellent. It's no wonder that ``ACL'' execs are
planning to release various episodes on home video: I can think of
a fistful of shows I'd buy tomorrow if I had the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday evening's program, billed as ``An Hour With Garth
Brooks,'' though, is a whole 'nother deal _ a different kind of
history, a visual document of a man who has just made a massive
career blunder and is trying to put a good spin on it.
</P>
<P>
   We are catching Brooks just about two months after the release
of the CD ``Garth Brooks in... The Life of Chris Gaines,'' in which
he assumed the role of a fictional rock star who has returned to
the public eye after recovering from a horrible car wreck. Garth
gave us Chris with Trent Reznor-like hair and a pop/rock/R&AMP;B soul
sound that veered unsteadily from Babyface to John Mellencamp.
</P>
<P>
   By early November, ``Gaines'' was already slumping on the
charts. It was because the rock didn't rock hard enough, and the
transformation from Garth to Chris had come to appear both weird
AND lame. This Chris guy may have looked like an '80s lite-rocker,
but his music was an unfocused stew of mediocre songs that had no
personality, and certainly never really rocked.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour-plus taping Garth did for the ``Austin City
Limits'' show was quite a bit better than that, but it's mainly
because most of it was tried-and-true Garth country. Dressed in his
standard country garb, and fronting his touring band, he first tore
through more than an hour of hits such as ``Rodeo'' and ``The
Thunder Rolls,'' all sincerity and enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Gaines material; mercifully, Brooks didn't change
outfits or shift into the Gaines character, but he did have a
separate, young, multiracial band come on to navigate through the
new material.
</P>
<P>
   But he only played four songs from the new CD. That's right _
all the buildup, all the promotion done on this new character and
sound, and he wimps out. The new band was onstage less than 25
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This was clearly an attempt to show the faithful (a few of whom
actually walked out during the Gaines set!) that he was coming back
to the fold.
</P>
<P>
   And the show you'll see underscores this: In the end, only ONE
song from the Gaines CD _ ``Right Now,'' Garth's cringe-inducing
stab at rap _ makes the final cut for television.
</P>
<P>
   ``ACL'' publicist Pat Consgrove said that the Brooks camp had
final selection of the songs, which also include ``We Shall Be
Free, Friends in Low Places, Callin' Baton Rouge'' and the
concluding ``The Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   What can we conclude here? That Brooks is trying to distance
himself from the whole Chris Gaines diversion, playing damage
control and reminding us of his status as country's biggest name,
all in one fell swoop.
</P>
<P>
   So would you if you'd seen a project die as quickly as this
Chris Gaines diversion did. There's been no mention of late about
``The Lamb,'' the movie starring Garth as Gaines that was supposed
to start filming this year. Brooks has been a bit testy with
reporters about the CD, and has strongly hinted that he'll be
retiring at the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you believe it. Brooks is too competitive _ and maybe, at
this point, just too angry that this shift in sound didn't go over
well _ to bow out now. My money's on him releasing another country
CD by the end of the year, and following it with a long worldwide
tour.
</P>
<P>
   After all, once you've been on the mountaintop (and Brooks has
been there for 10 years now) it's hard to admit you've got to go
back down the other side. &QL;

CROATIA ELECTS RELAXED MODERATE TO SUCCEED TUDJMAN
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia _ A jocular former leader of the old Yugoslavia
was elected Monday as president, succeeding Franjo Tudjman, who
died in December.
</P>
<P>
   The winner, Stipe Mesic, 65, last leader of the collective
presidency before Yugoslavia disintegrated in 1991, earned the
trust of Croatians for his easy manner, his apparent disregard for
pretension and his relaxed attitude about Croatian nationalism, in
sharp contrast to Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
   A happy Mesic told a cheering crowd at his campaign headquarters
that he would concentrate on bringing Croatia into the European
Union and NATO ``as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   His opponent, Drazen Budisa, a 51-year-old former dissident,
conceded defeat shortly after the polls closed and early results
showed Mesic with a large lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the moment has come for me to congratulate Mesic on
his victory and to wish him a lot of success in carrying out the
presidential duties,'' Budisa said.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 99 percent of the vote counted, Mesic had 56.2
percent to Budisa's 43.8 percent, the State Electoral Commission
announced early Tuesday. Turnout was 61.5 percent of Croatia's 4.2
million voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the first round of the election, on Jan. 24, Mesic received
41.6 percent of the vote in a nine-party field, while Budisa
received 28 percent, but final polls had shown the race narrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are pro-Western and relatively liberal, favoring
membership in the European Union and NATO, and both are part of the
six-party opposition coalition that won parliamentary elections a
month ago, defeating Tudjman's once-dominant Croatian Democratic
Union.
</P>
<P>
   American and European officials had said they would be pleased
if either man won, especially after the strained and contentious
relationship they had with Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
   The election both concludes and opens an extraordinary period of
political change here, which Washington hopes will be a model for
neighboring Serbia, run by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the lingering illness and death of Tudjman last
year, the Croatian Democratic Union that he founded and that led
the state since independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 has been swept
out of all the major institutions of government by democratic
means.
</P>
<P>
   With a serious democratic alternative presented by a largely
united, six-party opposition coalition, Croatians voted in big
numbers to turn their back on their fiercely nationalist past, its
tenor and repressions founded in the Yugoslav civil wars.
</P>
<P>
   With Tudjman revered but politically unpopular, his party
tainted with charges of corruption and the economy deeply troubled
by unemployment and unpaid wages and pensions, the opposition won a
large victory in parliamentary elections on Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ivica Racan took office on Jan. 27 and has
already moved to soften nationalist policies, free up the media,
support democratic and human rights, and promote economic
discipline and sacrifice.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the first round of presidential voting, even the relatively
moderate candidate of the Croatian Democratic Union, Mate Granic,
finished in a poor third place, failing to qualify for Monday's
runoff election.
</P>
<P>
   The party, known here by its initials, HDZ, is wounded and is
likely to split, and in an interview last week, Racan himself said
that he feared that the rapid collapse of Tudjman's party was
risky, because it weakened the opposition all governments need.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, the H.D.Z. is falling apart too soon for the
democratic life of the country,'' Racan said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted his main coalition partner, Budisa, to win,
and described Mesic's appeal as ``populism with a smiling face.''
But he said that both men were democrats and that he could work
well with either.
</P>
<P>
   The real turning point for Croatia came with the opposition
victory in the parliamentary vote. Both Mesic and Budisa promised
to work to cut back the powers of the imperial presidency Tudjman
built for himself and to make Croatia a parliamentary democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both men want the president to retain the position of
commander in chief and to have an important, if still vague role in
foreign and security policy. Part of the campaign debate here
focused on whether Budisa or Mesic were harboring secret ambitions
or agendas, and which of the two might work more easily with Racan.
</P>
<P>
   Mesic is less nationalist than Budisa, and has explicitly warned
Bosnian Croats that they must learn to live inside Bosnia and not
look to Zagreb for financial and military support. By doing so,
Mesic ensured the opposition of HDZ voters, who are especially
strong in Bosnia, where ethnic Croatians are allowed to vote in
elections here. Mesic and Racan want to stop that practice, too.
</P>
<P>
   So Mesic aides were particularly concerned about the possibility
of widespread vote fraud in Bosnia organized by the HDZ and its
Bosnian political allies. But voting went smoothly there, officials
said, especially after the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe criticized fraud in the first round and asked
the Croatian state electoral commission to replace its observers.
</P>
<P>
   If he lost, Budisa said he would serve as an ordinary member of
parliament and lead his Social Liberal party. Racan said he would
like Budisa, in that case, to join the government, at least
eventually, but that he doubted that Budisa would change his mind.

ENTER THE DRAGON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Millennium-schlmennium. Saturday marked the beginning of Year
4698 _ the Year of the Dragon. Maybe it's because we've all been
reading a lot of Harry Potter lately, but the thought of a year
celebrating the mythological, magical beasts hit with a blast of
fresh, hot air. Who wouldn't want to tap into the dragon's
benevolent and powerful energy, or ``chi''?
</P>
<P>
   The roar of the dragon days begins with 15 days of traditional
Chinese New Year celebration. Rather than stocking up on the Veuve
Cliquot and finding the best all-night party, Chinese families
prepare for the new year by paying debts, cutting their hair,
sweeping out the dirt (and ill fortune) from their homes and
decorating with paper cut-outs with the themes of happiness, wealth
and longevity. Not coincidentally, when the new year dawned this
weekend, rather than spending the day with hot-water bottles,
hangovers and Bowl games, families visited relatives and neighbors,
wishing them good luck. Old grudges are dismissed. Gifts are
exchanged. Feasts are shared.
</P>
<P>
   A dragon year is a cause for special celebration, as the dragon
is the most powerful of the 12 Chinese zodiac signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dragon symbolizes power, fertility, harvest, nature,
everything that is powerful. Usually that means activity,
prosperity and good luck,'' says Mike Xu, an assistant professor of
Chinese studies at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   As Martha would say, the dragon is simply a good thing. In
celebration of the new year, we salute the winged beast with this
primer on things dragonian.
</P>
<P>
   Zodiacal beginnings &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The legend behind the 12 signs of Chinese astrology goes
something like this: Buddha invited all the animals to come before
him on Chinese New Year. Only 12 showed up, in this order: rat, ox,
tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog and
boar. To thank them, Buddha named a year after each of the
creatures and proclaimed that people born during those specific
years would share some of the characteristics of the year's animal.
Eastern vs. Western dragons &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Know your dragon's family tree. The Eastern dragon is a much
different creature from the dragons of Medieval lore. Western
dragons are the fire-breathing, evil creatures we all know and love
_ and hate. In Eastern cultures, the dragon is revered.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to pinpoint the origins of the dragon, but in
ancient mythology, the scaled, winged beast is said to be akin to
the Great Mother, the water god and the warrior sun god, making it
one of the most powerful creatures. Dragons eventually took on the
roles of Osiris, god of the underworld, and his evil brother Set in
Egyptian mythology.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the nature of the dragon evolved within
different cultures. In Eastern Asia, the dragon was a benevolent
force; but in Europe, Africa and most everywhere else, it assumed a
belligerent identity. Often it took the form of various creatures _
a dragon might have eagle's feet and wings, a lion's forelimbs and
head, fish scales, antelope horns and a serpentine trunk, tail and
neck. Slaying a dragon was the highest achievement in medieval
lore.
Dragon People &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The dragon, the only mythological animal among a collection of
comparatively ignominious creatures such as the rat and the ox, is
considered the most powerful of the Chinese astrological signs.
</P>
<P>
   People born under the dragon sign are natural leaders. They are
also considered to be lucky, successful and likely to bring wealth
and luck to their families (but beware their flames of aggression
and determination).
</P>
<P>
   Famous dragons? Bruce Lee, Martin Luther King Jr., Grace Kelly,
Christopher Reeve, Frank Sinatra, Mae West, John Lennon, Joan of
Arc, Salvador Dali, Betty Grable, Oliver Hardy, Ernesto ``Che''
Guevara, Florence Nightingale and Shirley Temple Black.
Dragons in Pop Culture &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to think of ``Beowulf'' as pop culture, but once this
staple of college curricula was indeed contemporary. In case you
don't remember the details from English Lit 101, the hero is slain
by a dragon after he kills the monster Grendel and Grendel's
mother. Since then, even the bad-karma Western dragon has enjoyed
some moments in the spotlight. For instance:
</P>
<P>
   Drago, the digitally animated dragon voiced by Sean Connery in
1996's ``Dragonheart.'' Drago saved a king's life and gave him half
a heart, but when the king turned evil, the knight (Dennis Quaid)
and Drago teamed up to vanquish the corrupt monarch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puff, the Magic Dragon,'' who lived by the sea, frolicking in
the autumn mists. Children's song by those '60s rascals Peter, Paul
and Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Maleficent, the evil witch of the classic fairy tale ``The
Sleeping Beauty,'' who turns into a dragon (Disney's 1959 film
version makes Maleficent one of the most beautiful Americanized
dragons).
</P>
<P>
   Dungeons &AMP; Dragons, the quintessential role-playing game in
which players take on the identities of wizards and other creatures
in an effort to stay alive and collect treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Mushu, the pint-sized dragon voiced by Eddie Murphy in the 1997
movie ``Mulan,'' which makes its television premiere on the Disney
Channel on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Spyro, an energetic young dragon hero of the popular PlayStation
game ``Spyro the Dragon,'' created by Insomniac Games. His goal is
to rid the Dragon World of Gnorcs, restoring the dragon populace
and reclaiming the dragon treasure.
Eating Dragon? &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The pairing of the dragon and the phoenix goes back to Imperial
China. The dragon, showing the yin or feminine side of nature, was
often used to symbolize the Empress, while the phoenix, symbolizing
the yang or masculine side, was a symbol of the Emperor.
</P>
<P>
   This traditional dish featuring poultry (the phoenix) and ham
(the dragon) celebrates the yin-yang balance.
THE PHOENIX AND THE DRAGON &QC; 
Serves 4 4 thin slices ham 1 whole chicken breast, boned and cut
into two pieces 4 pieces fresh caul fat, see Note 1/4 cup water
chestnut powder OR flour OR cornstarch 4 cups peanut oil, for
deep-frying Vegetable sauce: 2 tablespoons peanut oil 2 whole
cloves garlic, crushed 2 slices fresh gingerroot 4 fresh water
chestnuts, peeled and sliced lengthwise 1/2 cup bamboo shoots,
sliced lengthwise 4 whole scallions, cut in 3-inch pieces 1
tablespoon soy sauce 1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine OR dry sherry
1/2 cup chicken broth 1 teaspoon cornstarch dissolved in 1
tablespoon cold chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   Note: Caul fat is the thin, fatty membrane that lines the
abdominal cavity of pigs or sheep. The pork is considered better.
It looks like a lacy net and is used to wrap dishes like pates. The
membrane melts during baking. Order caul fat through your butcher.
To keep it from tearing, it may be necessary to soak the membrane
in warm salted water to loosen the layers before using.
</P>
<P>
   Lay 2 slices of ham on 1 side of piece of the chicken breast.
Refold the breast, enclosing the ham. Lay breast on a sheet made of
2 pieces of caul fat. Roll up tight. The caul is sticky, so it
needs nothing to seal it. Dust surface with water chestnut powder,
flour or cornstarch. Shake off excess. Repeat with second breast
piece.
</P>
<P>
   Heat oil in a wok to 350 degrees. Slide the chicken breast
pieces into the oil, one by one. When they've browned (about 5
minutes), remove one from the oil and press it. If it feels mushy,
it needs more cooking. Remove and drain chicken. Slice chicken,
crosswise diagonally, into 1/2-inch pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable sauce: Heat oil in wok and flavor with garlic and
ginger. Remove garlic and ginger and add water chestnuts, bamboo
shoots and scallions to the wok. Stir-fry for 30 seconds, then add
soy sauce, wine or sherry and chicken broth. When liquid boils,
stir in dissolved cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Spread sauce on
platter as a bed for the sliced chicken breast.

   FLINT, Mich. _ Touching on themes more common in Democratic than
Republican primaries, Sen. John McCain campaigned Monday in auto
factory towns in Michigan, praised unions, called his rival's tax
plan too generous to the rich and said he welcomed the support of
independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain presented a friendly face to the non-Republicans
who could play a crucial role in the Feb. 22 Michigan primary, in
South Carolina he released a tough advertisement criticizing his
main rival for the Republican nomination, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, and raising questions of trust.
</P>
<P>
   At a town meeting in the Detroit suburb of Warren, McCain said
the United Automobile Workers union and its members had helped
improve the quality of American cars and the competitiveness of the
industry, although he also said he opposed so-called closed shops,
in which all workers are required to join a union.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who also campaigned Monday in Saginaw, 100 miles
northwest of Detroit, praised unions here and in Warren. Asked in
this blue-collar city 70 miles northwest of Detroit about his
support for legislation that would require unions to obtain their
members' permission before making political contributions, the
Arizona Republican said he also wanted companies to obtain their
shareholders' approval before making such donations.
</P>
<P>
   McCain cited the success of former President Ronald Reagan in
attracting support from union workers who usually vote Democratic,
and said at the news conference that he would welcome the support
of such voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're seeking the Republican vote first, we want the
independents and we would appreciate the Democrats,'' he said,
while stopping short of specifically asking independents and
Democrats to cross party lines. ``Part of the success of President
Reagan was the so-called Reagan Democrats. The essence of the
Republican Party should be to reach out and appeal to a broad cross
section of voters.That's the way you lead the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan primaries are open to voters of any political
affiliation, and a state law even bars residents from registering
by party. Because of a Democratic Party policy that limits the
allocation of delegates based on open primaries, Vice President Al
Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley have pulled out of the primary
here on Feb. 22, and will participate instead in a separate
Democratic caucus on March 11.
</P>
<P>
   Voters going to the polls here on Feb. 22 will receive a single
ballot including not only the Republican primary candidates but
also some local referendums and at least one race for county
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Stewart, a General Motors transmission worker and UAW
member who voted for Reagan in 1980 but usually supports Democrats,
said after attending the town hall meeting that he planned to vote
for McCain. Stewart said that he admired the senator's stance on
campaign finance and added that in November, ``I'll vote for McCain
if he wins the nomination; otherwise I'll vote Democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   He also accused Bush of steering too much of his proposed tax
cuts to the wealthiest families and not enough to working
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Bush's criticism Monday that it was inconsistent
to pursue campaign finance reform while seeking campaign
contributions, McCain told reporters at a campaign stop in Flint
that broad hostility to him from the Republican establishment
demonstrated his independence from special interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This attack that special interests have any influence on me is
just foolishness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain took a more aggressive tack in the television
advertisement, suggesting that Bush had broken an agreement not to
run a negative campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we really want another politician in the White House
America can't trust?'' the advertisement concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Asked here whether he was calling his opponent untrustworthy,
McCain said the advertisement was meant to indicate that ``the
American people deserve a president they can trust.''

   If it weren't for ``Scream`` movies, we were joking the other
day, David Arquette wouldn't have a career (unless you consider a
series of irritating long-distance-company commercials a career).
In fact, if it weren't for the Scream series, he probably wouldn't
have a wife _ at least his current wife, Courteney Cox Arquette,
whom he met while doing ``Scream'' and ``Scream 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Which just goes to show _ there's a lot of trivia in them there
sequels! And talking about Arquette was what inspired us to round
up these tidbits of sequel trivia.
</P>
<P>
   By now, most Kevin Bacon followers know that he appeared in the
first ``Friday the 13th.'' Here are some other actors who appeared
in the series: Crispin Glover (Part IV, officially known as The
Final Chapter); Ghost villain Tony Goldwyn (Part VI); and Welcome
Back, Kotter's Ron Palillo (Part VI).
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance are the names most closely
connected to the Halloween series. Among others who have cropped
up: Dana Carvey (''Halloween 2''); and ``The Cider House Rules' ''
Paul Rudd and Dharma &AMP; Greg's Mitchell Ryan (both in ``Halloween:
The Curse of Michael Myers,'' the series' sixth entry). The most
recent installment, 1998's ``Halloween H20,'' was Curtis' first
Halloween movie in 17 years and the first in which most cast
members had made a name for themselves before the movie was
released.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wes Craven gets most of the credit, other directors got
early breaks with the ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' series (the most
imaginative and underappreciated movies in the slasher genre).
Chuck Russell, who directed Nightmare 3, went on to direct Jim
Carrey in ``The Mask'' and Arnold Schwarzenegger in ``Eraser.''
Stephen Hopkins, who directed Nightmare 5, also directed 1998's
``Lost in Space.'' Most notable of all was Nightmare 4 director
Renny Harlin, who directed last year's ``Deep Blue Sea'' as well as
another significant sequel, ``Die Hard With a Vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors who got an early break from ``Nightmare on Elm Street''
movies include Johnny Depp and ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'' voice
Charles Fleischer (the original Nightmare), and Patricia Arquette
and Laurence Fishburne (Nightmare 3).
</P>
<P>
   Nightmare director Wes Craven pops up in his own ``Scream'' as a
janitor dressed like Nightmare's Freddy Krueger. ``Scream 2's''
alumni include Portia de Rossi, now a familiar face on Ally McBeal,
and Heather Graham, who was a Powers girl in ``Austin Powers: The
Spy Who Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Godfather Part III'' contains a couple of the most glaring
continuity errors in movie history. A subplot concerns the Vatican
of Pope John Paul I _ even though he died in 1978, and the film
takes place in 1979. Not that you would know by a copy of The New
York Times seen in the film _ the paper's 1990 copyright date is
easily visible.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people who have survived notoriously bad sequels are
Michael Caine (''Beyond the Poseidon Adventure,'' ``Jaws the
Revenge''); Sally Field (''Beyond the Poseidon Adventure''); James
Earl Jones (''Exorcist II: The Heretic''); Harrison Ford (''Force
10 From Navarone''); Michelle Pfeiffer (''Grease 2''); and John
Travolta (''Staying Alive'').

BRADLEY DECRIES REPEAL OF FLORIDA AFFIRMATIVE ACTION LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ Bill Bradley, convinced that blacks would back his
struggling campaign if they only knew him, accused Florida Governor
Jeb Bush Monday of committing ``a clear wrong'' and a lapse in
leadership by repealing the state's affirmative action program.
</P>
<P>
   Scrambling to chip into Vice President Al Gore's overwhelming
support among blacks, Bradley launched the attack on the Florida
governor immediately before heading for South Carolina to charge
Texas Governor George W. Bush with a similar act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he has demonstrated a lack of vision and
leadership by repealing affirmative action laws,'' Bradley said of
the Florida governor during a town meeting in the Ybor City section
of Tampa. ``He did this despite the fact that affirmative action is
about fairness. It's about social justice. It's about making sure
all Americans have a fair chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's primary is not until March 14, a week after the big
15-state primary Tuesday that is expected to make or break
Bradley's candidacy. And South Carolina, where the Democratic
primary is scheduled later, is largely inconsequential in the
Democratic race.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley is banking on his appearances in the two states to
boost his appeal to black voters and liberals. By nearly all
accounts, Bradley will be unable to break Gore's momentum toward
the Democratic nomination unless he can woo such core Democratic
constituencies as blacks, Latinos and liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bradley has made racial unity a central theme of his
20-year political career, he has watched with frustration as the
nation's black establishment has buoyed Gore's candidacy. Gore, in
addition to basking in the reflected glow of President Clinton's
strong bond with black voters, spent much of Clinton's
administration cultivating black leaders in anticipation of a
challenge for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in chastising the Florida governor over affirmative
action, said, ``Giving people opportunity, investing them with
responsbility, holding them accountable is not a preference or a
quota. It is the standard by which the mark of progress is made in
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   To the crowd's applause, he said, ``I strongly oppose the action
taken by Governor Bush because I believe that justice is one of the
most enduring and abiding principles that make up the promise of
America. When opportunity is taken away or snuffed out, justice is
denied and progress is brought to a standstill.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Bradley plans to renew his criticism of the
Texas governor for recently taking his campaign for the Republican
presidential nomination to Bob Jones University, a fundamentalist
Christian college in the state, which lost its tax exempt status in
the 1970s because the school engaged in racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The two-pronged offensive against the Bushes comes eight years
after Bradley attacked their father, then-President George Bush,
for allowing race to become an issue in the 1988 election by
failing to repudiate an ad criticizing former Massachusetts
Governor Michael S. Dukakis over the furlough of Willie Horton.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in a speech on the Senate floor, also blasted Bush for
opposing the 1964 Civil Rights Act when Bush ran for senator in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley launched his stepped-up appeal to black voters at a
predominantly black church in Queens, N.Y., on Sunday, when he cast
himself as a leader whom blacks could trust and respect as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Bradley is scheduled to broaden his appeal to black
voters when he delivers a major education address in Ohio calling
for policies that would better serve disadvantaged students and
their families.

MIRO AND MURRAY: WASHINGTON, D.C.'S LATEST ATTRACTIONS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BARBARA GAMAREKIAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Visitors to Washington frequently arrive with a mental itinerary
taking them from the lofty precincts of Capitol Hill and the White
House to the greensward of the Mall with its museums, monuments and
memorials. And visit them all one must, for they provide an
encyclopedic view of America's culture and historic legacy.
</P>
<P>
   But despite this city's reputation as a static place where
little changes from year to year beyond the election cycle, there
are always new delights to discover.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most beguiling additions is the National Gallery of
Art's Sculpture Garden, which opened in May. It has already
attracted more than a million visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Sculpture Garden has been a long time coming. A garden was
first envisioned in 1791 by Pierre Charles L'Enfant who, upon
laying out the master plan for the capital city, stipulated that
this very site, what is now 6.1 acres on the north side of the
Mall, be a ``landscaped park'' with ``copious water.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 years later, a $10 million grant from the Morris
and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation helped realize L'Enfant's dream.
The fanciful garden, designed by Laurie D. Olin of Olin
Partnership, beckons the passer-by to ``come in, look, explore.''
Curvilinear marble benches and a double row of linden trees
surround a pool and central fountain that in summer plays an
ever-changing water dance and in winter is alive with ice skaters
gliding to music under strands of twinkling white lights. As
twilight deepens on winter evenings, the spotlit sculptures provide
a luminous backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen works by artists including Mark di Suvero, Isamu
Noguchi and Joan Miro are situated among the magnolias and redbud
and towering elm and cypress trees.
</P>
<P>
   Calder's ``Cheval Rouge'' (``Red Horse'') catches the eye from a
distance against the monumental Washington skyline. Other works
appear as you make your way along winding paths: among them
Ellsworth Kelly's abstract ``Stele II'' and Barry Flanagan's
``Thinker on a Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The geometry of the Washington skyline was taken into
consideration when we were siting the sculpture,'' said Earl A.
Powell III, director of the gallery. Many of the artists
collaborated on the installation of their works. A sculpture by
Frank Stella is expected to join the collection, Powell said, and
there will be other additions over time.
</P>
<P>
   The guards have been hard pressed to keep children from climbing
Sol LeWitt's terraced ``Four-Sided Pyramid'' and hoisting
themselves up on Louise Bourgeois' bronze ``Spider.'' New plantings
have been artfully added to isolate and protect some of the most
``enticing'' sculptures from ``the curious and overzealous,''
Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit in the fall several dozen people relaxed on the
terrace of the Pavilion cafe, an eye-catching Art Nouveau-style
structure, which will open as a glass-enclosed bistro in the summer
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away Dr. Luke Faber, a surgeon visiting from Dubuque,
Iowa, gazed at George Rickey's ``Cluster of Four Cubes,'' a kinetic
sculpture revolving in the breeze. ``It doesn't tell me which
direction the wind is coming from _ they seem to flow against each
other,'' he mused to his wife, Mary Elaine. ``I guess that's the
art part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the garden under a canopy of trees, the Dimitropoulous
family, from Atlanta, had plopped down on Scott Burton's polished
granite chairs, aptly named ``Six-Part Seating.'' Twelve-year-old
Alex said his favorite sculpture was Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van
Bruggen's giant orange ``Typewriter Eraser, Scale X,'' a Pop art
rendering of an eraser leaning precariously on edge, fiberglass
brush bristles waving skyward.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Alex didn't know what it was,'' his father noted, smiling.
``We had to explain it to him because he had never seen a
typewriter eraser _ or a typewriter, for that matter.'' For his
part, Dimitropoulous said he was intrigued by Roy Lichtenstein's
``House 1.'' ``It looks simple but it's very complicated,'' he said
of the sculpture whose dimensions appear to change as you approach.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, William O'Neil, 5, and his brother, Daniel, 3,
unmindful of the protective plantings, circumvented the cartoonish
red and yellow house, poking their heads through windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, kids, out of there,'' called their father, and the
children scampered off to their next target: the LeWitt pyramid.
``It's an igloo!'' Daniel declared of the 15-foot white sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   A different but equally engaging experience can be had with a
quick trip, by Metro, across the Potomac River to Arlington, Va.,
for a visit to the Newseum. Since opening in April 1997, it too has
proved a hit with children and adults _ recently reaching the 1.2
million mark in visitors.
</P>
<P>
   As its name suggests, the $50 million, 72,000-square-foot museum
is devoted to the history of communication and news gathering. It
is financed by the Freedom Forum, a nonpartisan foundation
dedicated to free press and free speech.
</P>
<P>
   With its vaulted spaces and slick design, the high-tech museum
is visually exciting, and cleverly combines education and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The best spot to get a fix on the place is the 220-seat,
dome-covered theater. A continuously running 10-minute film,
``What's News?,'' narrated by Charles Osgood, helps orient
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the museum you'll find an interactive newsroom, a
News History Gallery, two minitheaters with continuous films, a
radio-TV state-of-the-art broadcast studio and control room, and a
series of exhibits and seminars featuring media personalities.
</P>
<P>
   The News History Gallery traces the evolution of communication
from talking drums to the printing press, radio, television and,
finally, the global village and satellite television. Among the
artifacts are a pen owned by Charles Dickens and pages from Bob
Woodward's handwritten Watergate notes.
</P>
<P>
   For the nostalgia buffs, front pages proclaim: ``Scopes Found
Guilty,'' ``Babe Ruth Smashes Own Record''; and with a wand you can
hear, once again, the voices of Edward R. Murrow, Walter Winchell
and H.V. Kaltenborn.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Gillette of Camano Island, Wash., stood transfixed before
television replays of the night Robert F. Kennedy was shot and the
October day in 1987 when Baby Jessica was rescued from the well in
Midland, Texas ``I thought this place would probably just be a pat
on the back for journalism,'' she said, ``but it gives you a better
insight into how it all works.''
</P>
<P>
   It is in the interactive newsroom that the senses are bombarded
from all sides. A 126-foot-long Video News Wall simultaneously
broadcasts breaking news from a half-dozen cities around the world
as a news zipper flashes the latest headlines. Below the video
display is a wall of the day's front pages from 70 newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   At touch-screen video monitors, people try their hand at being a
reporter covering a story, or an editor figuring out the day's news
budget. And teen-agers cluster around booths where they can
broadcast a radio sports event or photograph themselves for a
magazine cover.
</P>
<P>
   The adjacent Freedom Park is a more contemplative spot, an
outdoor exhibit area that pays tribute to the 1,029 journalists who
died while reporting the news. Installations including cobblestones
from the Warsaw Ghetto and a bronze casting of the Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr.'s jail-cell door in Birmingham can be found there.
A 32-foot-long section of the Berlin Wall and one of the 30-foot
guard towers have been added most recently.
</P>
<P>
   The capital cityscape has had some other changes. The new Ronald
Reagan Building and International Trade Center, the second largest
federal building (after the Pentagon), now looms on 1300
Pennsylvania Avenue. Its Atrium Gallery offers rotating exhibits
(on display through March 15 is the work of six artists from
Senegal) and there are guided tours, a food court and a Washington
Visitor Information Center. Across the Mall at Third and
Independence, a giant excavation foretells the coming of the
National Museum of the American Indian scheduled to open in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Washington Monument has been metamorphosing. Undergoing
a two-year restoration, it was ``wrapped'' in blue mesh by the
architect Michael Graves to hide the scaffolding.
</P>
<P>
   Now with the restoration winding down, the blue mesh is gone and
the scaffolding is being dismantled. But during the years it was
clad in its festive garb, it was symbolic, one would like to think,
of the nation's ability to surprise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Sculpture Garden at the National Gallery of Art is at
Seventh Street, between Constitution Avenue and Madison Drive, on
the Mall. It is open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday and
11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday. From mid-November to mid-March, the
skating rink is open until 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and 11
p.m. Friday and Saturday (opening times same as the sculpture
garden). The charge for skating is from $4 to $5.50 (there are
discounts for students and seniors); skates can be rented for
$2.50. Information: (202) 737-4215. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Newseum is at 1101 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, Va.; (703)
284-3544. It is a short walk from the Rosslyn Metro stop on the
Blue or Orange lines. Closed Monday and Tuesday until March, when
the museum is open Tuesday as well. Open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center at
1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, (202) 312-1300, is open 7 a.m. to 7
p.m. weekdays, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday. Free guided tours are
available on Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 11 a.m. beginning at
the concierge desk at the 14th Street entrance.

AUTO INSURERS SEEK OEM OPTION IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Auto insurers Monday pushed for the right to sell
drivers a $37 optional rider that would require certain vehicle
repairs to be made with original manufacturer's parts, instead of
cheaper generics.
</P>
<P>
   Generic parts have come under fire over the last year in the
wake of a billion-dollar court decision in Illinois and a Consumer
Reports study that indicated some parts may be unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Auto insurers kept a low profile at Monday's hearing before
Insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthard. But auto body shops slammed
the proposal as an attempt to escape liability associated with what
they called ``counterfeit parts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it mind-boggling as to what this two-tiered policy
represents,'' said Christopher Colo, president of the Massachusetts
Auto Body Association, which says generic parts should not be used
until their safety can be demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the real world of insurance, a diamond would not be
replaced with a cubic zirconia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt gave no hint Monday of how she will rule.
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel Johnson, head head of the Automobile Insurers Bureau,
an industry group, said Ruthardt's staff has urged the bureau to
back the rider.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt has defended the use of generic parts in the past.
</P>
<P>
   To keep insurance rates down, state regulations require the use
of cheaper generics (or rebuilt or used brand-name parts), unless a
new brand-name part is available at a lower price or the car has
less than 15,000 miles on it. Generic parts are supposed to be used
only if they are ``of like kind and quality'' to a manufacturer's
brand-name parts.
</P>
<P>
   That standard, which is used in many states, has come under fire
since a $1.1 billion court judgment in October against State Farm
Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. for using inferior generic parts in
repairs to customers' cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Consumer Reports had published an article on the
issue, entitled ``Shoddy Auto Parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Many insurers, including several operating in the Bay State,
stopped using generic parts outside of Massachusetts after the
court decision. They continue to use them here, however, because of
the state mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies say the rider would merely give consumers an
option, without driving up rates for everyone. The rider would be
triggered if the damaged part could not be repaired, and it would
apply only to exterior or cosmetic parts, such as fenders and
hoods. On average, the rider would cost an extra $37.
</P>
<P>
   The rider would in effect put the burden on drivers to decide
whether it's worth the extra money to buy parts from manufacturers
such as Ford and Toyota. It's not an easy call, given the
conflicting data. Many consumers are not aware that insurers call
for generic parts when authorizing repairs.

IRAQ SUSPECTED OF SECRET GERM WAR EFFORT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Britain)   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ With a new arms inspection system now being
devised for Iraq, some arms control experts are looking anew at
Iraqi biological weapons programs and finding evidence of at least
one more secret project still to be uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Milton Leitenberg, an expert on biological
weapons, has been looking at this murkiest and most dangerous
corner of Saddam Hussein's armory. He says a series of reports add
up to indications that Iraq may be trying to develop a new viral
agent, possibly in underground laboratories at a military complex
near Baghdad where Iraqis first chased away inspectors six years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Leitenberg, a senior fellow at the University of Maryland's
Center for International and Security Studies, has collected
reports on Iraqi sites and activities from a variety of people,
including two Iraqi defectors.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, research and intelligence experts, also convinced
that there are more germ warfare agents left in Iraq than
previously known, have suggested that Iraq may have produced the
organism that causes bubonic plague. No evidence has been published
in support of this theory, American experts say, and U.N.
inspectors found no trace of the plague in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Leitenberg, who does not know what the new virus is _ if indeed
it is a virus and not a bacterial agent _ said in an interview that
accumulating evidence of this previously unknown component of the
Iraqi germ warfare program suggests that Hans Blix, the new chief
inspector for Iraq, may want to give priority to biological
weapons. Leitenberg and other experts also say inspectors will have
to be aggressive in demanding access in Iraq. Dozens of major
questions remain unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   The elimination of biological weapons in Iraq may be as
important _ or more important _ to the Iraqi people as to the
outside world, scientists say. Experts working with the U.N.
Special Commission, the first disarmament body created for Iraq
after the Persian Gulf war, said some of the bacterial and viral
agents Iraq was producing then were of little use for war. Among
them were aflatoxin, a fungal agent that can lead to liver cancer,
and rotavirus, which causes diarrhea in children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say agents like these were more probably intended for
use against Iraqis. Hussein did not shrink from using chemical
weapons on Kurds in 1988, and some scientists and physicians say he
may also have tried aflatoxin.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq told U.N. inspectors that it tested mixes of aflatoxin with
various nerve gases and other agents in 1989. Research being done
among Kurds in Europe has turned up some liver cancer figures
higher than expected, a former inspector said.
</P>
<P>
   Blix is the chairman of the new U.N. Monitoring, Verification
and Inspection Commission and thus chief inspector for Iraq. From
1981 to 1997, he was director general of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, which was responsible for dismantling Iraq's nuclear
programs.
</P>
<P>
   In March, he will take over inspections of biological, chemical
and missile programs, and he has been asked by the Security Council
to give Iraq a list of tasks it must accomplish to have
international sanctions suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has not said it will admit inspection teams, though; it
says it has already fully disarmed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Friday, Blix said there were very few
unanswered questions on Iraq's nuclear arms. In the missile area,
Iraq may also be able legitimately to meet demands for closure.
Chemical programs have some outstanding questions on quantities of
poison produced, especially the nerve agent VX, and whether those
substances were loaded into warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Biological programs, however, have been the most difficult to
uncover. Richard Butler, the former executive chairman of the U.N.
Special Commission, said that is because they are the most
important to Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over nine years now,'' he said in an interview last week,
``Iraq has consistently made extraordinarily strenuous efforts to
hide the biological program _ well beyond those they made on
missiles or chemicals. Why? Why? No effort was too much to prevent
us from getting to the truth. That says to me it was big and
nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is required to be certified free of weapons of mass
destruction before the United Nations lifts sanctions that were
imposed because of the invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Arms control
experts contend that the list of conditions for suspending
sanctions must be left open-ended so inspectors can add to it if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, they say, Iraq will probably conceal all the
activities it can while providing minimum information to meet
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. inspectors from the former commission list a host of
biological agents found in Iraq, including botulinum toxin,
anthrax, camel pox and infectious hemorrhagic conjunctivitis virus.
The commission was never able to account for all the stocks of
biological agents _ which Iraq denied having until 1995 _ or for
large amounts of growth material used to produce germ warfare
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is also able to make its own growth media, scientists say.
Leitenberg, who has produced a preliminary paper on his suspicions
about a new virus program for the Institute for Science and
International Security, an independent research organization in
Washington, said missing bacterial growth media could be irrelevant
because viruses can be grown on tissue culture or fertilized eggs,
and Iraq has many incubators.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews this week, Leitenberg said new evidence from Iraqi
exiles, one an engineer, and from other pieces of information
assembled and analyzed by experts leads to a renewed focus on an
Iraqi site known as Salman Pak, an area of about 10 square miles in
a bend in the Tigris River southeast of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The area once housed a large military research institute and
animal testing centers and was always of great interest to
inspectors. Although Iraq said it had relocated its research
laboratories to Al Hakam, a complex later destroyed by the U.N.
commission, Salman Pak was bombed in 1991 during the gulf war, an
indication that Western intelligence still considered it an active
installation.
</P>
<P>
   Leitenberg said an underground laboratory might still be
functioning there, detectable by ground-level air ducts camouflaged
by a small shed. He said a U.N. inspector had missed an
above-ground laboratory there in 1992. A team that toured the same
building in 1994 found a decontamination shower and airlock doors,
hallmarks of a high-risk environment.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, the U.N. inspectors tried to excavate a
recently dug and refilled trench at Salman Pak, looking for
something that may have been hastily buried. The digging met what
inspectors call a nearly hysterical Iraqi reaction. Iraqi officials
called in mullahs to declare the land sacred and off limits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The inspectors never pushed hard to do more excavations there or
in nearby locations. Before the end of 1994, Iraq had forced a
crisis with the United States by moving troops to the border with
Kuwait again.
</P>
<P>
   In the following months, the inspectors finally cornered Iraq
into confessing to the biological weapons program it had said it
never had, and Salman Pak became less a site for detective work
than for verification of documentation turned over by the Iraqis.
Arms experts want the detectives to go back.

MARKETPLACE: GOLD PRICE IS BOUNCING BACK, BUT WEAKNESS REMAINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The price of gold has taken off again.
</P>
<P>
   At $304.50 an ounce, it is not yet above the $326 high of
October. But the question now is much the same as it was then: How
far can this rally go? Once again, it seems that something more has
to change _ both in market psychology and in the global economy _
before gold can move much higher and, more importantly, stay there.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the catalyst that pulled the price of gold up from a
20-year low of $253.70 was the surprise announcement by 15 European
central banks that they would limit their selling of gold to 400
tons a year over five years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the banks said they would curb their lending of
gold, which had enabled speculators and producers to bet against
gold cheaply for years.
</P>
<P>
   But that rally did not last. One reason was that the demand for
gold for jewelry fizzled as the price rose. According to Andrew
Smith, the precious metals analyst at Mitsui &AMP; Co. in London, the
flow of gold into the three leading importers, Singapore, Hong Kong
and Dubai, plunged more than 80 percent between July and October.
So the price fell, hitting a recent low of $278.20 an ounce in
early December, and many investors continued to bet against gold.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday Placer Dome, the world's fifth-largest producer,
announced that it would stop hedging altogether, meaning that it
would no longer bet on a decline in the price of gold. On that
news, the price shot up by $23.10, or 8 percent, to $313 an ounce.
Jerry Taylor, Placer Dome's president, called on other producers to
follow suit and ``show leadership and confidence in gold.''
</P>
<P>
   The excitement on Friday was heightened by the report that
Barrick Gold, the strongest and most successful proponent of
hedging in the industry, planned an announcement for Monday.
Investors speculated that the world's fourth-largest producer would
fall in line and reject hedging. There was, as Smith of Mitsui put
it, ``a jihad against hedging.''
</P>
<P>
   Central bank selling, gold leasing and gold producer hedging
have all put downward pressures on the price of gold for several
years. The uncertainty about when and how much central banks would
sell weighed heavily on the market. Active gold leasing made it
cheap to bet against the price of gold, and producer hedging seemed
to nip every rally in the bud. Neutralizing these forces would, at
the least, help prevent the bottom from falling out of the gold
market again.
</P>
<P>
   But Barrick disappointed investors Monday. Instead of a complete
halt to hedging, it announced a 48 percent reduction: It will sell
less gold as a hedge against declining prices.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its shifting strategy, Barrick also bought options on
gold that will allow it to benefit more from a smaller rally in
gold. Based on the new strategy, Barrick will profit when the price
of gold exceeds $319 an ounce, instead of $360. The move was
designed to assuage the company's stockholders and shift the
company's image away from one that is always betting against gold.
</P>
<P>
   But the company did not reject hedging outright. In fact,
Randall Oliphant, the president, defended the practice, saying that
hedging made the company enough money during gold's slide to pick
up a new gold property, Bulyanhulu mine in Tanzania, cheaply. ``As
a company, waiting passively for increases in gold prices is not a
strategy,'' he told an audience of analysts and journalists
gathered in Toronto and brought in by Internet and the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The price of gold, which had jumped as high as $323 an ounce
earlier in the day, fell quickly, finishing down $8.50 at $304.50
an ounce and giving up more than a third of Friday's surge.
Barrick's stock, which jumped 10.9 percent to $18.375 Friday, also
slipped after the announcement, finishing the day at $17.75, down
62.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the market got very extended the last few days and
built in more than could happen,'' said James R. Steel, metals and
energy analyst at Refco Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there will be less downward pressure from producer
hedging, and that is a positive for gold. Even though he wanted
more from Barrick, John Hathaway, the senior portfolio manager at
Tocqueville Asset Management, said, ``The practical effect of this
is that there will be fewer producers betting against the price of
gold.''
</P>
<P>
   But two more changes are needed before gold prices can really
take off. Speculators that have been betting for years that the
price of gold will fall have to change their minds and bet on a
rising price. Second, the financial and economic climate has to
change. Inflation needs to begin to be worrisome or the stock
market needs to fall, disappointing investors enough to send them
in search of alternative investments.
</P>
<P>
   Until these changes occur, even gold bulls like Hathaway, who
runs Tocqueville's $20 million fund that invests in gold company
stocks, say any rally will be contained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that stocks have been a wonderful place to be and
there has been low inflation has not helped gold,'' he said. ``We
need gold speculators to change their mind, and I don't think they
have.''

`THE OTHERS' SEEMS TO HAVE BARELY A GHOST OF A CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   College student Marian Kitt doesn't know what she wants to do
with her life, which is fine, since she has little say in the
matter anyhow. We see why in the opening moments of ``The Others,''
an ambitious but rather calculating and distant suspense drama that
premiered on NBC last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Jolted from bed, Marian staggers into the bathroom of her
dormitory room, sees a toy ducky floating in a tub full of water,
and pulls it out. Suddenly, a mummy-type figure rises from the
tub's depths, arms out, as if wanting to pull Marian in.
</P>
<P>
   Later, we learn that the thing is a woman, a dead one at that,
who chased down pills with alcohol a year earlier, in that
dormitory, in that room, in that bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does stuff like this happen to you a lot?'' a stranger wants
to know in the next scene, cornering Marian in a library that looks
as spooky as everything else in this series.
</P>
<P>
   Marian: ``What do you mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Stranger: ``Psychic phenomenon. 'Cause I know some people you
really should meet.''
</P>
<P>
   The people she eventually meets, for better or worse, are a
small, mysterious and awfully creepy group of men and women who
share the extrasensory ability to reach ``the other side,'' as they
refer to their communication with deceased souls.
</P>
<P>
   Like superheroes with different modes of besting their enemy,
each is represented by an extrasensory gift. There's John Aylward
(ER) as Albert, a vision-impaired grouch with a heightened sixth
sense, and Gabriel Macht as Mark Gabriel, the passionate and
way-too-cute medical intern blessed (or is that cursed?) with the
gift of feeling the pain of others. (What, and he's sensitive,
too?)
</P>
<P>
   The cast also includes Bill Cobbs as a famed medium, able to
enter the other side and return to tell about it; Melissa Crider as
a store-front ghost caller; Kevin J. O'Conner as a homeless
``seer,'' someone who sees things before they occur; and John
Billingsley as a folklore professor who brings the group together
and records these paranormal events as giddily as a kid with a
bunch of new trading cards.
</P>
<P>
   Though reluctant at first (she calls the Others ``freaks''),
Marian, played by Julianne Nicholson, finally concedes to her
special ability, which is to see into the past and the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' she's told by Billingsley's Miles Ballard.
``They're all gifted people ... you know. Freaks. Like you.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how ``The Others'' will serve as weekly entertainment will
be developed over the next two episodes. Since their ``gifts'' are
used to help those in need, they interact with those alive and
dead. Such as a deceased man destined to walk the earth as long as
his wife blames herself for letting him drive that morning with
their infant son.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for ``The Others'' comes from Steven Spielberg's shop.
Glen Morgan and James Wong, who have experience with the dark and
paranormal, having written scripts for ``The X-Files'' and
``Millennium,'' are executive producers. They appear to be rather
deft at making everyday, nonthreatening sights _ doorknobs and
staircases, that sort of thing _ exude unexplained menace.
</P>
<P>
   As with most supernatural dramas, though, ``The Others'' will
take a while to find a tone balanced enough to lure more than a
handful of viewers. It doesn't help that no character jumps out
right away; even Nicholson, a former model who had a breakout
performance as the headstrong feminist in ``The Love Letter,'' is
rather forgettable. Which is a shame, since she's well-cast as the
overwhelmed newcomer and does a nice job of conveying Marian's
emotional vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Not helping matters is that the so-so special effects do nothing
to camouflage what is, for the time being anyway, nothing more than
trite drama with high intentions.
</P>
<P>
   They better get with it fast. NBC has ordered only 13 episodes.
Worst case scenario is that ``The Others'' will go the way of a
similar NBC series, ``Sleepwalkers.'' The producer of that show,
about a group of people using dreams to solve problems, had asked
for patience, promising clear, engaging story lines down the line.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``Sleepwalkers'' never made it that far.
</P>

CLINTON PLANS A GOOD YEAR FOR NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BUDGET-CLINTON) 
(sw) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Whether it was Hillary Rodham Clinton's run for the
Senate or just Democratic politics at work in a prosperous election
year, President Clinton's proposed budget lavishes New York City
with money for important programs.
</P>
<P>
   Schools, housing, health care and job training _ all issues
Democrats love to claim as their own on the campaign trail _ are
among the programs that stand to receive a windfall this year if
Congress gives Clinton what he wants. In fact, most cities, which
withstood a long fiscal dry spell for years, will do better in next
year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Although the picture of how New York City stands to benefit from
next year's budget requests is sketchy, a few details did emerge
today.
</P>
<P>
   New York City would receive $14.3 billion for low-income housing
vouchers, a $3.7 billion increase from last year. Public hospitals
would get a temporary reprieve on reimbursing the federal
government for Medicare costs. And Clinton wants to add $1 billion
to the pot for Head Start in New York City, bringing the total to
$6.2 billion. Another $450 million would go toward reducing class
sizes, for a total of $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., calls it ``probably the best
budget for New York City in years.''
</P>
<P>
   But for New Yorkers, Clinton's largesse, at least on paper,
raises the question: Coincidence?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those instances where good substance and good
politics coincide,'' said Schumer. ``I think he would have
emphasized education and stopped the hospital cuts, whether Hillary
was running or not, but it will clearly benefit her, and nothing is
wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget requests would also secure $3.3 billion for
transportation programs for New York City, about $250 million more
than last year, and steer $1.2 billion toward training the city's
young people for jobs, an increase of $240 million.

LIGHTS, ACTION IN FRANCE FOR SECOND DISNEY PARK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The early struggles of Disneyland Paris, which the Walt
Disney Co. opened at Marne-la-Vallee east of Paris in 1992, may
have led some to believe that Europeans don't like amusement parks.
But in fact, the eventual huge success of the park prompted Disney
to announce in September that it would build a second theme park
next door to the first.
</P>
<P>
   The leftist Paris daily Liberation recalled that some had
described the arrival of the first park as a ``cultural
Chernobyl.'' Yet that did not deter Disney, which owns 39 percent
of the company that runs Disneyland Paris, from announcing plans
for a new $615 million, 62-acre park that will focus on film
studios, animation and television.
</P>
<P>
   The official opening is planned for April 2002, 10 years from
the inauguration of the first park. Nor did it discourage the
French authorities, who are delighted with the prospect of 5,000
jobs that the new park is expected to generate.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever some Europeans may think about theme parks, the
majority seem to be voting with their feet. In the year that ended
Sept. 30, Disneyland Paris drew over 12.5 million visitors, more
than any other attraction in France. Only about 41 percent were
from France, with 17 percent from Belgium, Luxembourg and the
Netherlands, 15 percent from Britain and 10 percent from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, we needed 35 years to reach those results, even
though the park there is larger,'' said Gilles Pelisson, chief
executive of Euro Disney SA, the company that operates the French
Disney park.
</P>
<P>
   The planned studio park is not a first for Europe. A park called
Movie World near Bottrop, Germany was recently sold by Warner
Brothers, the film and entertainment unit of Time Warner, to an
American company called Premier Parks; Warner Brothers and Premier
are building another movie park outside Madrid, to open in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney project in France will have the familiar features:
Guided tours of television and movie studios, demonstrations of
special effects, a half-hour stunt show in which actors portraying
secret agents attempt to arrest a band of terrorists on a set that
recreates a Mediterranean village.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's entry into the world of European theme parks was not an
easy one. Disney spent roughly $5 billion, much of it borrowed, to
develop the original park, only to swing open its pink Victorian
gingerbread gatehouse in 1992 in the midst of a European recession.
</P>
<P>
   The park's hotels drew so few guests that some had to be
shuttered temporarily. To hold costs down, Disney kept salaries
low, which over the years has led to strikes by disgruntled
employees, mainly low-paid performers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Disney's original marketing strategy for the park
proved a flop. Originally named Euro Disneyland, signaling the
parent company's intention to reach out beyond France to all of
Europe, the park was soon quietly rebaptized Disneyland Paris, in
recognition of the need to focus on national markets.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising for the park was also redesigned along national
lines, taking into account the fact that features of the park that
appealed, say, to Germans would not be the same ones that drew
Dutch or British visitors. Wine was added to Disney menus, an
omission that had irritated the French, and perhaps most important,
ticket prices were temporarily reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to these initiatives, annual attendance quickly took off.
By the mid-1990s, Disneyland Paris was attracting more than 9
million visitors a year. Still, as the interest burden on Euro
Disney's debt caused financial losses to mount, the company was
forced in 1995 to obtain a five-year debt rescheduling agreement
from banks and forfeiture of management fees from the parent Walt
Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   For the fiscal year 1998-99, which ended Sept. 30, Euro Disney
recently reported a $24 million net profit. Though that was 46
percent less than the year before, the drop was attributed mainly
to a resumption of Euro Disney's payment of management fees to the
Walt Disney Co. and to stagnant attendance, which was hurt by the
World Cup soccer tournament in France in the summer of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Disney was buoyed by the rise in occupancy rates at the
six big hotels at Disneyland Paris to 82.6 percent for the year
that ended in September, from 80.9 percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
   So successful has Disneyland Paris been at drawing crowds that
some local politicians in the Marne-la-Vallee area are growing
nervous. Euro Disney is pushing to increase the returns on land it
bought in the early phase of the project, and this spring a
megamall built by an outside developer and designed to be Europe's
largest is set to open at Serris, next door to the original park.
</P>
<P>
   On one weekend in late October, when crowds flooded into
Disneyland Paris, highways leading to the park were completely
blocked by traffic. The addition of the Serris mall, plus the new
park, some local leaders say, will lead to continuous gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the local Communist Party demanded an immediate
study of the possible impact the mall and park will have on local
roads; not to be outdone, the conservative Assembly for the
Republic appealed to the ministers in Paris responsible for
transportation and the environment for early action to double the
size of the A4 highway that links the French capital and the park.

BACK IN TIME IN OLD BEIJING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is still possible, just barely, to get a glimpse of what
daily life for Beijingers was like at the last turn of the century.
You can't do it by touring the Forbidden City or by competing for
dubious antiques in the ersatz Qing dynasty market of Liulichang.
But you can by taking a relaxed stroll through one of the city's
oldest residential quarters, near the string of willow-lined lakes
to the northwest of the Forbidden City above Beihai Park.
</P>
<P>
   In my first week in Beijing, I was introduced to a particular
walk that transformed my impression of what is generally a
frenzied, frazzling city, stripped of its history. I have retraced
the same path several times since, always finding something
different and always feeling rejuvenated by the slowed pace, the
human scale and just enough remnants of the old days to fire the
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   This is no museum; the courtyard houses that line the
neighborhood's lanes were desecrated during the Mao years and are
often falling apart, and you can't let yourself be chagrined when
two familiar yellow arches poke out above a vista of sloping tiled
roofs. But in the alleys, or hutongs, that surround the lakes, and
on one ancient lane in particular _ one not described in most
guidebooks _ you can discern both past and present.
</P>
<P>
   Like most good travel experiences, this one started with a lucky
break. Two years ago, on the plane to Beijing where my family was
about to take up residence, our 5-year-old daughter, Cara, started
playing with a girl named Lida in a nearby seat. The ice broken, my
wife, Libby, and I struck up a conversation with the parents, Wu
Hung, a Beijing-born professor of art history at the University of
Chicago, and his wife, Judith Zeitlin, also a professor at Chicago.
We made vague promises to get together during their brief visit to
his family home.
</P>
<P>
   I scarcely imagined what a spirit-saver this tenuous appointment
would turn out to be. Our first days in Beijing were forbidding:
the air was acrid; the chaotic roadways seemed too dangerous to
cross, and the city composed of dusty construction sites and
undistinguished high-rises. We wondered what we were getting into.
</P>
<P>
   Then our new friends called and asked if we'd like to visit the
neighborhood where Hung grew up and his parents still lived. It is
one of the few remaining hutong neighborhoods in the city _ most of
them, regarded by authorities as slums to be given over to
developers, have been bulldozed; it lies just south of the lake
called Houhai, the second and largest of the three so-called rear
lakes.
</P>
<P>
   On a languid fall afternoon, we walked along the south edge of
Houhai, where we saw men tending what must be the world's longest
fishing poles. We dipped into the adjacent maze of alleys and saw
Hung's childhood home, a rectangular structure of brick with a
courtyard in the middle that, like most such houses, has seen
better days.
</P>
<P>
   We continued walking along the lake toward the east, crossing
the famed Silver Ingot Bridge that divides Houhai from Qianhai, the
smaller lake to the south. Then Hung led us along Old Pipe Lane, an
ancient shopping street, to the Drum Tower, one of the city's major
landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Hung was back in Beijing and I asked him to
accompany me on the same route again while I took notes. While I
had the benefit of a native guide, any tourist with a map and ready
smiles could enjoy the same walk in two or three hours: if you get
lost in meandering alleys, just say ``Houhai?'' (pronounced HO-hi)
with a quizzical look and you'll be directed back to the lake's
edge, where orientation is easy.
</P>
<P>
   For those who prefer organized tours, some of this same
territory _ though not Old Pipe Lane, thankfully _ is visited by
the Hutong Tours on pedicabs that can be arranged through hotels.
These tours have become so popular that in the fall and spring you
have to dodge pedicab caravans as you walk the alleys _ with the
unfortunate effect that more residents are keeping their compound
gates shut.
</P>
<P>
   One can make this trek starting from the Drum Tower, just east
of Houhai, but I like to start on the west side of Houhai, where
you walk in from busy Deshengmennei Street and then almost
immediately, as you get to the lake's edge and stroll under the
willows next to grizzled fishermen, experience a palpable slowdown
in rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   The three man-made lakes have their own rich history: during the
Mongolian Yuan dynasty in the 13th and 14th centuries, including
the time when Marco Polo visited, they were connected up with the
Grand Canal and served as ports receiving boatloads of rice from
southern China.
</P>
<P>
   The surrounding neighborhoods are dotted with homes of the
formerly rich and powerful, including Manchu gentlemen of the Qing
dynasty, which ended early this century. Today, the lakes are plied
by the occasional pedal boat and gondolas that were recently
introduced and can be rented at Qianhai.
</P>
<P>
   Walking along the southern shore of Houhai you'll soon encounter
a little amusement park, where children jump on trampolines and
drive small electric cars in a rink. Walk on and a bigger park area
opens up along the side. On any day you are apt to see many older
men ``walking'' their pet birds, as the Chinese phrase puts it.
Mostly, they hang the cages from trees, where the birds sing in the
fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   Mornings and late afternoon, you'll see elderly men and women
from the adjacent alleys practicing tai qi, or perhaps a group of
20 doing mild exercises together. Other clusters of men are huddled
around games of mah-jongg or cards.
</P>
<P>
   About three-fourths of the way to the east end of Houhai, just
after a statue of a bearded man doing exercises, is where I turn
off to the south into the alleyways. There is no one thing to see,
just the remains of a classic Beijing neighborhood, some of it in
disrepair, other parts being renovated or rebuilt altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on weather and time, you may see children playing or
elders gossiping in the lanes, but most life goes on inside the
courtyard homes. These all have gray walls facing the alleys, with
big double doors for an entrance, sometimes surrounded by intricate
detail work in stone or wood. Hung pointed out some extra-wide
gates that signified homes of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   But the stone beasts that once guarded many entrances are mostly
gone _ destroyed by Red Guards rampaging against ``feudalism''
during Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Without being too intrusive you can peek through open doors. You
may see someone washing clothes or doing other household chores.
What you will seldom see is the original large gardens that gave
these courtyard houses their name: during the Mao era, several
families were often squeezed into one family's home, and the
central gardens were filled with crude brick structures that remain
today. Most of the compounds are still shared by two or three
families. Plumbing is primitive; heating is usually with coal
bricks. Low incomes as well as uncertainty about land rights and
city policy have meant residents have felt little incentive to fix
up their buildings. Yet there is a shared sense that this
neighborhood is one of the last, best examples of a special Beijing
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   You may come across what, for better or for worse, is a possible
harbinger of the area's future. Hong Kong developers have rebuilt a
few of the courtyard homes from scratch, complete with garages. One
can imagine this becoming a choice neighborhood for a new breed of
the rich and powerful.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Once you work your way back to lakeside you are nearly at the
Silver Ingot Bridge. The current marble structure was built only in
the 1980s. But the bridge has a special place in Beijing lore, long
described as one of the city's 16 most famous scenes _ in this
case, as the perfect spot from which to view the Western Hills.
These days smog usually obscures the hills, but this remains a
colorful spot, a low-rise mini-world with a distinctly Chinese
feel.
</P>
<P>
   Across from the bridge, built in a traditional style, is a
venerable restaurant specializing in roast lamb called Kaorouji.
Around to the left side of the restaurant, to the north, perhaps 60
feet from the bridge, is the entrance to Old Pipe Lane, a curving
little street that ends near the Drum Tower, built in 1420, with
drums that marked the time.
</P>
<P>
   The street's name refers to a long-renowned shop that sold
tobacco and those long pipes once favored by Chinese. (The lane is
not labeled in English signs and if you aren't sure you're on the
right one, ask and point: the name in Chinese is Yan Dai Xie Jie,
pronounced yen dye sheeay jeeay.)
</P>
<P>
   By this point I am always ready for a snack and, luckily, a few
yards along the lane are open stalls and a bakery with a street
window selling a delicious array of traditional Beijing breads and
dumplings. I prefer the bakery's da bing, large, chewy flat breads
that look like baked pizza dough and are served fresh and hot.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy a half of a wheel for a couple of yuan, or splurge
on the whole thing. You might also sample some little saucer-shaped
corn breads and tasty xiao bing, pancakes stuffed with scallions or
meats.
</P>
<P>
   I like this narrow lane precisely because it hasn't been
restored. Mixed among the older shops and telltale signs of a
bygone era are an abundance of hair cutters and tailors and wooden
pushcarts offering everything from potatoes to persimmons. A few
shops sell pirated video compact discs. A number of the storefronts
still sport century-old slabs of wood, including the characteristic
heavy eaves across the top.
</P>
<P>
   Steps beyond the bakery, at No. 57 on the lane, is a cluttered
little shop, only a few yards wide and deep, run by an ancient
couple selling pet accessories, a strange variety of old- and
new-style pipes, kites, fishing poles, beer and other odds and
ends.
</P>
<P>
   Here, pet accessories doesn't mean flea collars and catnip: they
sell cricket cages carved from gourds and wooden grass-hopper cages
and tiny porcelain bowls to put in your bird cage, all of which
make nifty souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   If you're feeling tired by now, a bit farther at No. 40 you can
get a head and neck massage, about $2 for 30 minutes. Just past
that on the opposite side at No. 37 are the decaying remains of a
Buddhist temple, its roof grown over with grass. A sign on the wall
declares this building a protected cultural relic, but as Hung
noted, ``After all this destruction, it's meaningless.'' The people
living inside now, though, do a fine job of mounting and framing
traditional paintings and calligraphy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Next, at No. 21, is a white building that once housed a large
bath house: a community social center where people bathed and
talked for hours on end. Operating here for more than a century, a
commercial bath house remains on a smaller scale, serving local
residents who have no showers in their crumbling former courtyards.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at No. 5, near the mouth of the lane, is the structure
that once housed the famous pipe and tobacco store. The store
continued operating to the mid-1950s, when the Communists took over
private shops. Part of the building is boarded up, part is occupied
by a tailor, but much of the 19th-century wooden storefront
remains.
</P>
<P>
   You can make out traces of paint on some heavily grained former
signboards, and along the top are curved cast-iron racks from which
signs once dangled. It takes a bit of effort, but if you pause for
a minute you can call to mind the scene here a hundred years ago,
when bearded Manchus came in to sample the latest shipment of
Yunnan tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   That reverie complete, you spill out into a jangling modern
street, Di'anmenwai, and modern Beijing. Worth a look across the
street is a shop selling old-style copper and brass pots.
</P>
<P>
   At this point you can bail out and flag a cab, to attack the
steep steps of the 15th-century Drum Tower another day. Or you can
walk over to the tower that looms less than half a black away, buy
your $1.25 ticket and climb up for a great view of Beijing and the
cluttered hutongs you just traversed. In which case, after you
descend, you may want to finish your afternoon in the teahouse
inside the Bell Tower just to the north. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those who prefer to take the guided Hutong Tour, in a pedicab,
can book a morning or afternoon tour through most hotels. The price
is about $22 a person, at 8 yuan to the dollar. The tours visit the
Drum Tower, courtyard neighborhoods and Prince Gong's mansion, on
the southwest edge of the neighborhood, a royal residence with
gardens that was converted into a museum and teahouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Drum Tower, on Gulou Dajie, is normally open from 9 a.m. to
4:30 p.m. Admission to this historic site _ the climb to the top is
well worth it _ along with the Bell Tower just to the north is
$1.25.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the base of the Bell Tower is the Bell Tower Teahouse,
which offers 18 kinds of Chinese tea, for prices ranging from $2.50
to $25 a pot as well as snacks. If you ask, the staff will serve
the tea with ceremonial flourishes. Open from 8:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.
(5 p.m. in winter). If you don't have a ticket for the two towers,
admission to the Bell Tower grounds alone is 75 cents. &QL;

PFIZER WILL BUY WARNER-LAMBERT FOR $90.27 BILLION IN STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: A graphic is being sent. Non-subscribers can purchase by
calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.) 
(DW) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When many drug companies decided to cut their sales forces in
the early 1990s because of the push into managed health care,
William C. Steere Jr., the then new chairman of Pfizer Inc., hired
more sales people.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy has paid off. By pouring money into sales and
advertising, Steere has transformed Pfizer from a company that
could not make the industry's top 10 list when he took over in 1992
to a company that is on course to become the world's largest drug
company.
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday, as expected, Pfizer announced that it would buy
the Warner-Lambert Co. for $90.27 billion in stock. The combined
company, which will be called Pfizer, becomes the second largest
drug company in the world behind Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline
Beecham. Because Pfizer also becomes the fastest-growing
pharmaceutical company, it is expected to swiftly overtake
Glaxo-SmithKline, the British giant created by Glaxo Wellcome and
SmithKline Beecham, which announced their merger plans last month.
</P>
<P>
   After trying for three months to ward off Pfizer's hostile
takeover bid, the board of Warner-Lambert approved the deal just
before 1 a.m. Monday morning. Immediately the two companies began
acting like longtime friends, with Warner-Lambert's chairman,
Lodewijk J.R. de Vink _ who has decided to step down from his job
as a result of the takeover _ joining Steere and other Pfizer
executives to tout the combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pfizer and Warner-Lambert represent a new competitive standard
for our industry,'' Steere said. ``By combining two world-class
organizations to create the fastest-growing, major pharmaceutical
company in the world, we are positioned for global leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of Warner-Lambert, Pfizer will add 2,500 sales
people to its 5,000 workers now selling drugs in the United States.
The combined Pfizer and Warner-Lambert will also have a research
staff of 12,000 _ the largest in the world. The need to spend more
on research is one reason that many drug companies are now
searching for merger partners.
</P>
<P>
   The decoding of the human genome, which is expected to be
complete by the end of the year, promises to give drug companies
millions of new targets to look at when trying to find new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, you only had a few targets to aim at,'' said
C. Louis Clemente, executive vice president at Pfizer. ``Now we
have many, many targets. It's getting a bit overwhelming to sort
out.''
</P>
<P>
   But the growing numbers of drug mergers is raising concerns in
Washington. , Two ranking senators on the subcommittee that reviews
antitrust matters sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission,
urging regulators to scrutinize all three drug mergers that have
recently been announced. In December, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn announced
in it planned to merge with Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maintaining strong competition in the pharmaceutical industry
is of crucial importance to controlling health care costs and to
ensuring that innovation continues to take place,'' Sens. Mike
DeWine, R-Ohio, and Herbert Kohl, D-Ohio, wrote to the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   An aide on the subcommittee said that hearings may be held on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Pfizer executives said that they were not concerned
about any antitrust issues.
</P>
<P>
   Steere will remain Pfizer's chairman and chief executive. The
63-year-old executive worked in marketing and sales at Pfizer
before becoming a top executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Steere sees drugs as a consumer product,'' said Sergio
Traversa, an analyst at Mehta Partners, a firm that invests in drug
stocks. ``He understands marketing and that you can sell drugs like
any other product.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides increasing Pfizer's sales force, Steere has also
invested heavily in advertising drugs directly to consumers. For
example, the company's commercials for Viagra, one of Pfizer's top
selling drugs and one of the most heavily advertised products in
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Steere has also increased the revenue from each sales person by
having them sell drugs made by other companies under joint
agreements. Last year, the fastest-growing portion of Pfizer's
revenue came from sales of Lipitor, a cholesterol-lowering drug
made by Warner-Lambert and from Celebrex, an arthritis drug made by
Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer's agreement with Warner on Lipitor is the reason Pfizer
made the hostile bid for Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Lipitor agreement, Pfizer gets about half of the
profits of the drug, which is expected to have revenues of $5
billion this year. But when Warner-Lambert announced on Nov. 4 that
it would buy American Home Products Corp., analysts say that Pfizer
began to fear that it might lose its agreement on Lipitor.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after de Vink shook hands with John R. Stafford, the
chairman of American Home, Pfizer began an $82.4 billion hostile
offer for Warner. After months of bickering and fighting each other
in court, the two companies agreed last week to a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Many Warner-Lambert executives, including de Vink, are expected
to leave their jobs _ a main reason why Warner-Lambert tried so
hard to fend off Pfizer's attack.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert also has a large consumer products division,
selling products ranging from Listerine to Bubblicious chewing gum,
that Pfizer is not keen on.
</P>
<P>
   But Pfizer executives said Monday they had no plans to try to
sell the consumer products division. While Pfizer's headquarters
will remain in New York City, the consumer products business will
be managed from Warner-Lambert's headquarters in Morris Plains,
N.J. But Pfizer has said that some jobs will likely be cut, mostly
in management and administrative positions. Pfizer says that it
plans to save $1.6 billion by 2001. Analysts said Monday that
Pfizer must cut thousands of jobs to reach that goal. The two
companies have a total of 87,000 workers with 12,000 employees in
the New York City metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   De Vink said Monday that he was not sure what he will do. Pfizer
has offered to pay him as a consultant for his advice after the
companies combine their operations, which is expected sometime this
summer. Shareholders of both companies must approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   De Vink, 54, said that he did not want to be an executive at
Pfizer because he feared his ideas would clash with those of
Steere. ``There must be clarity of command,'' he said, ``clarity of
vision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he said, ``I have a golden opportunity to redefine my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger leaves American Home Products, the spurned suitor of
Warner-Lambert, alone again for the third time in two years. Two
other proposed marriages _ one with SmithKline Beecham, another
with Monsanto _ fell apart in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But this time American Home walks away with $1.8 billion _ the
largest fee that any company has received when a proposed merger
ended.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer has agreed to exchange 2.75 of its shares for each share
of Warner-Lambert. Based on Pfizer's closing share price of $35.75
on Friday, that puts the value of the deal for Warner-lambert's
918.2 million fully diluted shares at $90.27 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Warner-Lambert rose $2.75 Monday, to $97.3125, a new
52-week high, while shares of Pfizer climbed $1.25, to $37.

A RESTED GORE GOES AFTER HARD-HAT AND HIGH-HAT VOTES
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a two-day respite from the campaign trail, Vice
President Al Gore stepped up his New York campaign in earnest
Monday, paying homage to the labor unions he is counting on to
mobilize for him in the March 7 primary and spending the evening
courting arts patrons at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   And in recognition of Bill Bradley's popularity here from his
days as a star basketball player and a senator from New Jersey,
Gore opened a new attack against his rival for the Democratic
nomination, saying that Bradley's proposals, particularly on health
care, education and the budget surplus, would be bad for New York.
</P>
<P>
   New York is seen as Bradley's best hope for a breakthrough after
his losses to the vice president in Iowa and New Hampshire, and
Gore made it clear Monday that he was not going to give Bradley an
inch of breathing room here. His line of attack was tailor-made for
hard-core Democrats in New York, playing on party loyalty and the
economic success of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to describe to you one of the big differences between
myself and my opponent in the Democratic primary,'' Gore told about
1,000 people in Lower Manhattan at the headquarters of District
Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that you can run for the Democratic nomination
by running down the progress and achievements of the Democratic
Party over the past seven years,'' he said, ``because in fact our
policies have been good for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Asked later if he would campaign in New York with President
Clinton, Gore said, ``I've got to win this race on my own, and I'm
campaigning on my own vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would campaign with Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is
running for Senate in New York, Gore said: ``It's a matter of
scheduling, not just me, but also her. I hope so. But that's yet to
be worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While Gore was courting New York Democrats, Bradley appeared in
Tampa, Fla., and took aim at the Republican governor, Jeb Bush, who
signed an executive order last year, ending affirmation action in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has long been a staunch defender of affirmative action,
as has been his opponent, Vice President Al Gore. But by choosing
to attack Bush, the brother of the Republican presidential
candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Bradley delivered notice
that he was prepared to take on any elected official or
presidential candidate or relative of a presidential candidate, in
his uphill fight for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he has demonstrated a lack of vision and
leadership by repealing affirmative action in the state of
Florida,'' said Bradley about JEb Bush at a raucously supportive
town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's brief appearance in Florida, whose primary is March
14, was his second in two days focusing on race relations. On
Sunday, he visited a church with a large black congregation in the
New York City borough of Queens, and on Tuesday, he will appear in
South Carolina, which has no Democratic primary, to criticize the
Confederate flag's presence over the State Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance Monday before the labor group, Gore assailed
Bradley for having retired from the Senate in 1996 instead of
fighting against what Gore called the Gingrich Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he retired from the Senate during President Clinton's
first term, Sen. Bradley spoke about what he called a budget
stalemate and a process that was, in his words, paralyzed, a
continual deadlock,'' Gore said. ``And so he decided to leave. But
he was wrong. We broke that deadlock.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If Sen. Bradley could not foresee the progress that
we made when we decided to stay and fight against the Gingrich
Republicans, what else does he not see now? How can he be counted
on to see what is right for working families today?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's remarks seemed to turn the tables on Bradley, who
recently has been accusing Gore of waging a campaign of distortions
and falsehoods.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore cannot tell the truth as a candidate, Bradley has been
asking audiences, how can the nation expect him to tell the truth
as president? And now Gore is asking about Bradley: If he did not
fight the good fight a few years ago, how can the nation expect him
to fight as president?
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said that Bradley's health-care proposal would
``eliminate Medicaid for more than 3 million New Yorkers who depend
on it, people with disabilities, people with AIDS, the elderly, in
nursing homes,'' substituting vouchers or subsidies of $150 a
month. ``See if you can find a health-care plan in New York for
$150 a month that pays your prescription drug benefits as Medicaid
does, that pays the kind of benefits that Medicaid pays,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Union members account for 30 percent to 40 percent of the
Democratic primary vote in New York, much higher than they figured
in Iowa and New Hampshire, and they drew most of Gore's attention
Monday. He began with an appearance via satellite at the United
Food and Commercial Workers meeting in Naples, Fla., then met at
his hotel with about 65 labor leaders from across New York state.
</P>
<P>
   He later went to a construction site on Manhattan's West Side,
at 63rd Street and West End Avenue. As he walked through the muddy
site in his heavy topcoat, business suit and cowboy boots, he shook
hands with carpenters and masons.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To help Gore, the state AFL-CIO distributed 1 million pieces of
Gore literature Monday at 10,000 work sites across the state. The
fliers exclaim, ``No presidential candidate has ever been more
supportive of working families than Al Gore!''
</P>
<P>
   Denis M. Hughes, president of the New York State AFL-CIO, said,
``I don't know of any organized support for Bradley in the
trade-union movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore took about an hour and a half out of his labor
supplications to rehearse at Avery Fisher Hall for his nighttime
performance, in which he was to narrate Aaron Copland's 1942
classic, ``Lincoln Portrait,'' accompanied by the American Symphony
Orchestra, under the direction of Leon Botstein.
</P>
<P>
   The concert is a benefit for seven charities in New York. Tapes
of it are to benefit the Phillips Brooks House, a student-run
public-service organization at Harvard, Gore's alma mater.

 AMD's Speedy New Chip Upstages Intel's  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
PC microprocessors, which crossed the 500-megahertz mark less than
a year ago, are set to double that speed before this year is out.
<P>
   At yesterday's opening of the International Solid-State Circuits
Conference _ a major industry event held annually in San Francisco
_ industry leader Intel said it will ship a version of its Pentium
III processor with a clock speed of 1 gigahertz _ one billion
cycles per second _ this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, however, was upstaged by rival Advanced Micro Devices,
which demonstrated a 1.1-gigahertz version of its Athlon chip and
promised to begin shipping it to customers in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   AMD's share of the PC chip market is only about 15 percent,
compared with about 80 percent for Intel. But the successful Athlon
design has recently given AMD a beachhead at the lucrative high
end, which Intel previously had to itself.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid acceleration in processor clock speeds over the past
few years has exceeded most predictions. In a famous 1989 article,
Intel executives forecast that speeds would reach the
then-unheard-of level of 250 megahertz this year.
</P>
<P>
   There's no indication, either, that the rate of improvement will
slow any time soon, even though the industry will have to overcome
some formidable engineering challenges to maintain its recent pace.
Intel now predicts that clock speeds will reach at least 10
gigahertz by the end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   IBM used this week's conference as the occasion to announce what
could turn out to be an important milestone along that path: an
experimental design that allows conventional silicon transistors _
the tiny switches packed by the millions into today's chips _ to
reach speeds of 3.5 to 4.5 gigahertz.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's innovation involves operating different parts of a chip at
different speeds. The parts most critical to performance would run
at the highest speeds, while other parts would operate on their
own, slower clocks.
</P>
<P>
   That approach, according to company officials, reduces by half
the power consumption and heat that would be required to achieve a
comparable performance with today's designs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to disclosing its plans for a 1-gigahertz Pentium
III, Intel disclosed new details about Itanium, a radically new
chip it also expects to ship in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Intended initially for high-powered server computers rather than
desktop systems, the Itanium will start out at a speed of 800
megahertz. To give performance an extra boost, it will be packaged
in a module that also includes 4 megabytes of ``Level 3'' cache
memory also operating at 800 megahertz. That unusual design will
give the chip extra-fast access to data and instructions it needs
to use repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another new Intel design, code-named Willamette, is expected
to displace the Pentium III as Intel's top-of-the-line processor
for desktop PCs before the end of the year. The company, however,
has yet to disclose details about that chip.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Compaq and IBM also presented papers describing
upcoming 1-gigahertz versions of their respective server chips, the
Alpha and the PowerPC.
</P>
<P>
   Users of Apple Macintosh computers, however, will apparently
have to wait longer to cross the gigahertz barrier. The PowerPC
running at the speed IBM described is a high-end version Apple
doesn't use. In a separate paper, engineers from Motorola, which
also makes PowerPC chips, discussed a new version of the G4, the
PowerPC variant Apple uses in its high-end systems, but that chip
will run at only 780 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest current G4 runs at only 450 megahertz, since
Motorola has not yet been able to produce in volume a 500-megahertz
version it announced last August. The G4, however, includes special
multimedia features that enable it to match or beat the performance
of seemingly faster chips on many tasks.

 IBM Goes Simple, Sleek With New Net Devices  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
IBM, a company whose name is virtually synonymous with the
mainframe and the PC, is hoping that a new focus on sleeker and
simpler Internet-access devices will put it back on top in the
computer industry.
<P>
   Big Blue execs have been talking up this new direction _ which
they call ``EON,'' or ``edge of the network'' _ for several months.
But yesterday, they previewed some of the new products it will be
built around, including stripped-down ``Internet appliances'' for
consumers, improved ``thin clients'' for corporate desktops and
even a ``wearable'' computer for airline mechanics and others who
need access to data while they work.
</P>
<P>
   The new products, which won't be shipped or even formally
introduced until later in the year, represent ``just the first wave
of a very broad set of initiatives across the whole company,'' said
Dave McCaughtry CQ &LR; , vice president of marketing, EON and network
devices at the IBM Personal Systems Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC has been essentially the same for 20 years _ it hasn't
changed nearly as much as the Net,'' he said. ``EON is really about
what's going to happen post-2000, when the Internet is ubiquitous
and broadband (high-speed access) is commonplace.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM CEO Louis Gerstner roiled the computer industry a year ago
when he declared that ``the PC era is over.'' Some observers
suggested that the real problem was simply that IBM's
personal-computer division, which has suffered massive losses in
recent years, couldn't keep up with its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, virtually every major PC-maker, including
such heavyweights as Compaq and Hewlett-Packard, has stepped up
efforts to develop new classes of devices that are supposed to
offer Internet access without the complexity of a Windows PC. Even
softwaremaker Microsoft and chip giant Intel have announced plans
to move into this new arena.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the Internet appliances these competitors have
shown, IBM's consists mostly of a notebook-size flat-panel screen
and keyboard. Rather than Windows, it will run simpler, cheaper
software _ most likely a version of the free Linux operating
system, combined with Netscape's open-source browser.
</P>
<P>
   Some models will be designed to plug directly into a high-speed
DSL Internet connection; others will have dial-in modems built in.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other ``appliance'' developers, IBM isn't planning to
sell its devices on a retail basis. Instead, it seeks to market
them through Internet service providers, telephone companies,
Internet portal companies and financial institutions, who in turn
would distribute them to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of paying up front for the device, users would pay for
it as part of a monthly service plan. Some providers might
subsidize the service for regular customers; if not, prices would
likely range from $30 to $60 per month, McCaughtry said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM also intends to extend its simplification pitch to users who
want the flexibility of a Windows PC. A new all-in-one PC design
code-named Luxor _ essentially a computer integrated into the base
of a flat-panel display _ is scheduled to ship in about two months
for less than $2,000. Another simplified box code-named StarDust
will cost less than $600 without monitor.
</P>
<P>
   For the corporate market IBM is beefing up its existing line of
NetStation ``thin clients'' with new models designed to use Linux
or to run applications from servers based on Windows 2000, the new
business operating system Microsoft plans to release on February
17.
</P>
<P>
   One NetStation model is so small that it can be clipped to the
back of an IBM display, creating what the company called a
``zero-footprint workstation.''
</P>
<P>
   The wearable computer consists of a belt-mounted base unit, a
keyboard strapped to the user's wrist, a cursor-control device in
the other hand and a small head-mounted display that uses optics to
project what looks like a full-size screen.
</P>
<P>
   For more conventional notebooks, IBM will put new emphasis on
wireless communications, offering both ``Bluetooth'' short-range
radios and faster wireless-networking cards based on an emerging
standard called 802.11.

ADVERTISING: NBC HELPS RALPH LAUREN FULFILL A MULTIMEDIA DREAM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky.)   (jw) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren, the pre-eminent peddler of aspirational clothes
and other merchandise, has dreams too. He wants to have a
multimedia presence like Martha Stewart, the omnipresent home guru.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, NBC and its Internet affiliates signed on with his
dream. They joined with Polo Ralph Lauren in a new media company
that will promote the designer's products online and on the air.
The deal, while a coup for Lauren, will further blur the line
between content and commerce at traditional media companies.
</P>
<P>
   The first and foremost task of the joint venture will be to
develop Polo.com, which is being billed as an upscale lifestyle
destination site _ like Stewart's Web site, but for the ponied set.
The idea is that consumers will go to the site to experience
Lauren's luxurious romantic version of safari or the American West
through video clips, and that they will then buy the related Polo
products, as well as non-Polo-related services like airline or
hotel reservations. Eventually, the company, RL Media, might
develop magazines or even TV programming for NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous media companies have tried to leverage their
advertising power for stakes in the Internet field. CBS, a unit of
Viacom, has traded airtime for part-ownership in some 19 Internet
businesses, including a health site and a portal that gives away
cash. And USA Networks signed a deal last week that would enable it
to sell National Basketball Association products and services on
its electronic commerce units, which include the Home Shopping
Network and Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ralph Lauren announcement, analysts saw further signs
that the networks were preparing to profit from a time when viewers
want not just to watch television programs, but to shop from them
as well. (Hey, who made that leather thong Jennifer Aniston is
wearing and how much does it cost, anyway?) ``This is an enormous
step toward turning what's currently known as a television set into
an interactive appliance,'' said David Verklin, chief executive of
Carat North America in New York, part of Aegis Group, a media
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the 30-year joint venture, NBC and associated
companies will foot much of the bill (most of it in advertising)
for start-up expenses, in return for 50 percent of the company. The
network is committed to providing $100 million in advertising time
over the next five years; NBCi, an online holding company 47
percent-owned by NBC, will offer $40 million in online promotions,
and CNBC has committed $10 million in advertising time.
</P>
<P>
   ValueVision, which is 40 percent owned by NBC, and operates Home
Shopping Network, No. 3 in TV shopping, will put up about $50
million in cash. It will handle customer service, merchandise
stocking and distribution for Polo.com, and is building a warehouse
in Kentucky for Polo.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren will build the multimedia empire he has long coveted for
a relatively small sum. He will attach the Polo.com tag to the
annual $100 million in magazine advertising he already does to
promote the Polo brand, he will provide merchandise at cost, and he
will handle excess inventory through his outlet stores.
</P>
<P>
   But in return, he will retain 50 percent ownership and total
creative control of the site _ in fact his son, David Lauren, will
be creative director. When and if sales from the site exceed $75
million, Polo Ralph Lauren will begin to receive a portion of
sales. From $75 million to $200 million, it will get 10 percent of
revenues, and it will get an undisclosed portion of sales above
that level. In addition, Lauren will maintain relationships with
department stores, which will sell Polo merchandise through
bloomingdales.com, macys.com and saks.com, among others.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Lauren was vague about the content but ecstatic
about the potential. ``We don't know all the things that are going
to happen,'' said the designer, who even ventured that he had a few
thoughts about situation comedies, ``but this is about integrating
into the world of technology and new media.''
</P>
<P>
   The partnership also gives a nice kick to Polo Ralph Lauren's
stock, mired like those of many apparel companies and trading at an
all-time low before the announcement. Shares of Polo rose $2.125
Monday to close at $16.25.
</P>
<P>
   It is less apparent what NBC and its associated companies hope
to get from the deal, beyond a stake in a company that could have a
hot public stock offering. NBC executives seem eager to develop a
future for the network where content and commerce commingle more
easily. ``Instead of merely aggregating a great audience and
letting other people sell to them,'' said James Schwab, a senior
vice president for interactive services at NBC, ``now we are going
to sell things ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren was advised by Robert S. Wiesenthal, head of
digital media at Credit Suisse First Boston, who helped broker the
deal between the two companies.

 Kana Acquires Silknet in Deal for $4.2 Billion  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Kana Communications, a Redwood City company that helps firms manage
their e-mail, unveiled plans yesterday to spend $4.2 billion for
Silknet Software, a New Hampshire firm that uses Web software to
help businesses field questions from customers.
<P>
   Although both companies are relatively small, the mammoth price
underscores the growing importance of doing business over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The deal makes sense for Kana because it hopes to sell Silknet's
software to its existing customers. Though many of Silknet's rivals
sell software to help customer service departments handle queries,
Silknet's business is booming because it uses the same program to
handle everything from questions on Web sites to phone calls. The
software also makes it easy for both customers and employees to
access accounts with a standard Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Silknet, which has 75 customers, works with such dot-com
companies as E-Trade and Priceline, and also helps more traditional
businesses, like Sprint and Office Depot, that are increasingly
using the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are taking the plumbing and building these
e-businesses,'' said Mark Gainey, Kana's founder and president.
</P>
<P>
   To land Silknet, Kana paid 55 percent more than market value of
the New Hampshire firm, based on closing prices of the two
companies on Friday. In other words, the purchase price works out
to about $16.8 million per worker, or 150 times annual revenue. By
comparison, traditional software firms usually fetch closer to two
or three times sales.
</P>
<P>
   Gainey said Silknet's ``explosive growth'' justified the price,
noting that his own company's sales leaped 140 percent to nearly $8
million in the latest quarter. Silknet has 250 employees, including
a dozen in San Francisco. ``We are just at the tip of the iceberg
iceburg  &LR; of this particular market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kana investors reacted cooly to the deal. Kana shares closed
yesterday at $240.50, down $18.38. It has a market value now of
just under $7 billion. Meanwhile, Silknet shares soared 33 percent,
to $183.31, up $44.81.
</P>
<P>
   Silknet lost $7.3 million on $14 million in revenue for the
first six months of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Kana actually recorded smaller revenues than Silknet and
squirted more red ink. It lost $119 million on $14 million in sales
largely because of several acquisitions. But Kana also reported
torrid growth as sales zoomed to $6.5 million in the latest
quarter, up 650 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In defending the deal, Gainey said the premium amounts to only
21 percent based on the stock price during  &LR; over  &LR; the last 30 days.
He said the price was inflated because Kana's stock has soared
recently.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst said the deal made sense strategically. ``This could
be one of the biggest e-business moves of at least the first half,
if not the year,'' Reginal King, an analyst with Chase H&AMP;Q, told
Bloomberg News. ``Everybody needs this stuff.''

WHY I LOVE MEXICO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time I went to Mexico, I really didn't go there at
all.
</P>
<P>
   We got a package deal to Cancun; the beach was pretty, the
weather perfect, and I almost slammed into the side of a high-rise
hotel during an ill-advised parasailing expedition. After four
days, we went home with sunburns and T-shirts and hangovers from
the tequila shots practically forced on us by an
English-slang-slinging waiter apparently hoping we'd get so drunk
we'd overtip. It was an OK trip, but I didn't think I wanted to go
again. And I wasn't sure I liked Mexico all that much.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, I still feel the same way about Cancun. But
I've fallen in love with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure exactly which part of which visit turned me around:
The forced march to the bottom of the northern Copper Canyon, where
we swam in an ice-cold, waterfall-fed pool and picnicked near the
crumbling remains of a mansion built by a copper-mining magnate.
The torch-lit dinner at the old Spanish fort in Acapulco, where we
ate corn-fungus enchiladas (better than they sound) as a lavishly
costumed ballet folklorico troupe performed. The three-hour tour
from Topolobampo, when our little skiff was surrounded by a school
of dolphins, acting as playful tour guides the whole way back,
jumping around as if they were auditioning for a show on the Animal
Planet channel. The day spent lounging on a perfect deserted beach
two hours south of Cancun, one that nobody else managed to stumble
onto that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong _ I loved Paris, I loved Rome, I can't wait
to get back to London. But when it comes down to it, the only place
I really HAVE to visit every year, the only place that I find
myself actually MISSING, is Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you're a Texan, it's easy to love Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   For a few hundred bucks and in a few hours, you can be there, or
at least in one of its airports. And if you live in Texas and you
pay any attention at all, the sights and smells and sounds of
Mexico will stir at least a bit of recognition in you. (For me,
another attraction is that no matter how many
``now-YOU-say-it-in-French'' tapes I listen to, Spanish remains the
only language other than English in which I can do more than buy a
bus ticket and order wine.)
</P>
<P>
   More than that, however, it's that whatever I want, I can find
it in Mexico. Lots of countries have beautiful art or fascinating
ruins or great food or idyllic beaches or scenic mountains or
bustling big cities or fantastic shopping. Not many have them all.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond sightseeing and spending, of course, travel is really
about getting outside your comfort zone, of seeing how other people
do things and learning to adapt to that. In some places, that means
going faster, being more harried; sometimes it's hard work.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico is one of the few places where my life seems to slow
down, a feeling that bothers me at first but then seems completely
natural. A couple of years ago, I was sitting in the Huatulco
airport, trying to get a seat on a flight into Oaxaca after
realizing we didn't have time for the bus. I fumed at first when we
spotted computers sitting unused while clerks carefully wrote out
the tickets. In longhand. In triplicate.
</P>
<P>
   It took a few minutes _ and a few moments of inhaling the scent
of the tropical hibiscus that bloomed everywhere _ to remember the
point. They were still getting the job done, if not as fast as I
might have wanted. We'd still get there. Maybe we should go get
some snacks.
</P>
<P>
   And I was frustrated at first at the old-fashioned spa in
Ixtapan de la Sal, a smallish town outside Mexico City. What was up
with the '60s-era diet (Melba toast, cottage cheese, chicken
broth)? And the casual approach to exercise? (The morning walk was
often led by a genial but very round fellow whose main job was
waiting tables in the resort's restaurant; we didn't, obviously, do
much power-walking.) When I asked for a harder workout, they
cheerily suggested I go get another facial instead. Also maybe a
nap.
</P>
<P>
   I finally listened to them. They were right.
</P>
<P>
   Travel is also about small, isolated moments, the ones that help
you form a relationship with a country and a culture. And many of
my most memorable ones _ singing in my bad Spanish at a karaoke bar
in La Paz, watching a funeral procession in a flower market in
Acapulco, being the only tourists climbing the pyramids at Coba,
eating German-style sausage and cheese at a Mennonite colony that
is for some reason situated south of Chihuahua _ are from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that I couldn't have had similar experiences elsewhere.
The point is, I didn't. And the result is, I feel oddly attached to
Mexico, almost protective of it. When I hear people say they've
been there, but they didn't really like it, I often wonder aloud if
they've given it a chance _ or if they've only been to the Club
Med.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, I went back to Cancun last summer, not
exactly on purpose _ we wanted to go to some less-developed beaches
in the Yucatan _ but Cancun is where the flight landed. For
logistical reasons, we spent the first night in one of those Cancun
high-rises, with the multilevel landscaped swimming pool and the
$10 breakfast buffet.
</P>
<P>
   After a day on the beach _ still beautiful, despite the crowds _
we went looking for dinner, walking on a busy four-lane divided
road past countless Tony Romas and Hard Rock Cafes and trying to
stay out of the path of the packs of daiquiri-toting high school
seniors. We finally found a place that wasn't too crowded, ate
quickly, and rushed back to the hotel. The next morning, we were up
at the crack of dawn, headed for a quieter beach; we couldn't get
out of town fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to dismiss Cancun (or, OK, maybe it is) or the other
plush resorts; I guess they have their place, and their fans. But
right down the road, there's a Mexico that suits me much better.

IT ONLY GETS MORE INTERESTING FOR U.S. DAVID CUP TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Now that John McEnroe is 1-0 as Davis Cup
captain, he gets to experience what Jeff Van Gundy does as a
basketball coach. He has to dole out the minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Next up for the U.S. team following its narrow 3-2 escape here
against Zimbabwe on Sunday is the Czech Republic, come April in Los
Angeles. McEnroe has a while before naming his starters, but he may
have longer-term issues to deal with. First and foremost, what to
do, if anything, about Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi has said he is on board for McEnroe's first-year
run, which takes care of one singles spot. Sampras, who pulled out
of the first round, citing a hip-muscle injury sustained during his
losing semifinal match with Agassi at the Australian Open, never
committed himself to playing this year with the certainty that
Agassi did.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras may be even less enthusiastic after hearing that
McEnroe, in a regular column written for a London newspaper,
offered that Sampras may have never really wanted to come here in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you get a phone call from Sampras over the weekend?''
McEnroe was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upset?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say upset, no,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans happily reported that Jim Courier e-mailed his
friend, Chris Woodruff, wishing him luck Saturday night before his
straight-set breakout victory over Wayne Black on Sunday. Todd
Martin, who also had to withdraw from the first round because of a
viral infection, faxed the team and telephoned Woodruff for a
15-minute pep talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two class people,'' Woodruff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean you're not a classy guy if you don't do it,''
McEnroe said, navigating the minefield. ``It means that you are if
you do.''
</P>
<P>
   At this stage of Sampras' career, his body rebelling as he
single-mindedly pursues a record-setting 13th Grand Slam title,
Davis Cup does not appear to be his thing. Agassi, overcome here
Sunday by humidity and high elevation, would be the first to admit
he has not been as consistently devoted to his career as Sampras.
At 29, in the best shape he has ever been in, Agassi seems to want
to do it all right now, make up for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   The other issue becomes one of creating the strong team core,
which McEnroe and Agassi always say is the only reason to play
Davis Cup in the first place. Woodruff, at 27, is no budding
Sampras, but he was ranked as high as No. 29 in the world before
tearing up his knee three years ago while kicking a football. Once
he got over his nerves here Sunday, he showed an effective
hardcourt game, with deep, heavy ground strokes and a serve he
cranked up to a high of 120 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a nice question,'' McEnroe said when asked if
Woodruff has complicated his life by rising to a fifth-match
occasion under extreme conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff was sitting right next to him, so McEnroe did not want
to get into it. He did, of course, because what subject has he ever
been unwilling to discuss?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, you know, you just played the biggest match of your
life, thank you very much, now get the hell out of here,'' he said.
``This is when the job, in a way, gets tougher because we had such
a great team spirit. I believe, with this team, we'd beat
Czechoslovakia. I'll just tell you that right now. This team would
beat Czechoslovakia.''
</P>
<P>
   Would he keep it together then? ``I'm tempted to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   First things first, like getting hold of an updated European
map. Beyond the Czech Republic could come another trip, to the clay
courts of Spain. Sampras would not necessarily be of great value
there, either. But should the United States go that far without
him, it may be unreasonable to expect him to ever play again.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Martin, who after Agassi and Sampras is the most
dependable American player on hard courts.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe is only getting started. He has time to figure this all
out, and if he does not, well, he will live. Someone will play for
him. As the preacher, Matthew Ashimolowo, told his South London,
South Africa, congregation Sunday morning on the Zimbabwe Broadcast
Co., ``No matter what happens to you, it's not over till it's
over.'' &QL;

By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   {Oaxaca:} The art produced in the surrounding countryside is, on
its own, worth the trip _ intricately painted wooden animals and
plaster angels, carved masks and wooden skeletons, hand-thrown
pottery in black or green glazes and silver crosses, and subtle
woven shawls and tablecloths. (Not to mention the first mescal,
flavored with orange or lime, that I actually kind of like.) But
the city's main plaza, filled with entrepreneurs selling everything
from cheap plastic toys to folk art to warm ears of roasted corn
(served, to my dismay, with mayonnaise), and ringed with open-air
restaurants, is one of the best places to while away an evening in
Mexico _ or anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   {Ixtapan de la Sal:} Mexico is relatively new to the spa
business, but this small town near Mexico City has hosted guests in
spa resorts and a neighboring ``balneario,'' or spring-fed
bathhouse, for 50 years. The ``balneario's'' spa was a trip _ one
of the weight-loss treatments consisted of being painted in blue
wax, wrapped in plastic and left to roast under wool blankets. And
apparently no visitor comes home without buying jars and jars of
rose-scented lotions and vitamin-laced beauty creams, handmade by a
local woman and sold in her tiny boutique downtown.
</P>
<P>
   {Playa del Carmen:} The first time I visited this simple seaside
town a 45- minute drive south of Cancun, it was so laid-back that a
tame pig was wandering about the beach undisturbed. A half-dozen
years later, some shiny new hotels and its popularity with cruise
ships have drawn a bunch more tourists _ and driven up prices. But
the water and sand are still gorgeous, and the beachside palapa
huts are a fine place to drink $1 Bohemias _ even if the pig is
long gone.
</P>
<P>
   {Copper Canyon:} The train, running from Chihuahua to Los
Mochis, gets all the attention because of its stunning views of the
ridges of the Copper Canyon ranges and its astonishingly engineered
switchbacks. (Oh, and perhaps because it took nearly a century to
build, finally being completed in 1961.) But stop a few days, in
Creel or Batopilas or one of the other tiny towns, and hire a guide
to lead you into the depths of the canyon, hiking the trails that
the local Tarahumara Indians have used for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   {Acapulco:} It's touristy. It sits on a bay that fights repeated
attempts at cleanup. It's filled with breathtakingly beautiful _
and heart-stoppingly expensive _ resorts. But the oldest of Mexican
beach resorts still has a great mountainous location, a lovely,
authentic soul _ and those famous cliff-divers. Whatever they're
paid, it can't be enough; watching them soar perilously off the
sharp cliffs, arcing effortlessly into the ebbing water below, was
one of the few times I thought a classic tourist attraction
deserved its reputation.

 Treasuries Turmoil Creates Opportunities  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
With the U.S. government accelerating its plans to retire its
long-term debt, investors in Treasury issues have to start thinking
differently.
<P>
   The market for Treasuries has turned into an Alice-in-Wonderland
scene, with the yields on shorter-term Treasuries moving higher
than the yields on longer-term Treasuries _ a phenomenon known in
the bond trade as an inverted yield curve.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, long-term issues are priced to yield more than
short-term ones because investors demand a higher interest rate to
compensate for the longer wait until their bonds can be redeemed at
face value.
</P>
<P>
   If you invest in Treasuries, or are thinking about it, the
obvious _ and correct _ move right now would be to phase into
shorter-term issues, experts say. There is no rational reason to
tie up your money for the long term at a lower yield than you can
get in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why ask for additional risk?'' is the way Joe DuCote, senior
managing director of Sutter Securities in San Francisco, puts it.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts suggest that conservative investors ought to
let their thoughts wander beyond the Treasury market. That's
because the buying spree in Treasuries has caused their yields to
look unattractive relative to other fixed-income securities.
</P>
<P>
   The spread between long-term Treasury yields and other long-term
fixed-income issues has opened up considerably, notes Kirk Hartman,
chief investment officer for fixed income with Banc of America
Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   There are tempting alternatives among quasi-governmental
agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage lenders,
as well as among investment-grade corporate bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a situation of turmoil in the market,'' Hartman
observes, ``and when there is turmoil, it can create buying
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil in the Treasury market reached a climax late last
week, when Gary Gensler, a Treasury Department undersecretary,
offered details of the government's massive plan to drastically
scale back the issuance of securities with maturities ranging from
five 5  &LR; to 30 years, and to buy back much of the long-term debt
outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   All this has been made possible by the booming economy, which
has filled federal tax coffers to overflowing and ushered in a new
era of budget surpluses. Because the government pays higher
interest on longer-term issues than on shorter-term, the
longer-term issues have been targeted first for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a looming shortage of long-term Treasuries set
off a buying panic in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative institutional investors such as insurance
companies, which consider long-term Treasuries essential holdings,
gobbled them up last week faster than baseball fans buy Mickey
Mantle cards.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Schlossberg, an economist with San Francisco's Wells
Capital Management, points out that there also was a lot of buying
by other institutions, which had borrowed long-term Treasuries and
sold them short as part of a routine strategy to hedge against
increases in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   As the prices of these issues shot up last week, the
institutions were forced to buy them back to avoid losing a lot of
money.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy buying pushed Treasury prices up and pushed down
interest rates, which move in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   As of yesterday, you could buy a two-year 2-year  &LR; Treasury
yielding 6.67 percent to maturity, or a five-year 5-year &LR;   &LR; Treasury
with a 6.74 percent yield.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the 10-year bond was yielding just 6.64 percent,
and the 30-year Treasury, which normally has the highest yield of
all, was down to 6.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   You can get significantly better yields these days in the
corporate bond market, observes Richard Lehmann, a newsletter
publisher with the Bond Investors Association in Miami Lakes, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent survey, Lehmann found that triple-A corporate
bonds _ those with the least risk of default _ were yielding 0.84
percentage points more than Treasuries with the same maturities. If
you are willing to accept slightly less quality, you could get a
0.94 percent spread on double-A bonds or 1.12 percent on
single-A's.
</P>
<P>
   All those spreads are larger than they have been in recent
months, Lehmann observes. And yet, ``with the economy booming, the
risk of default is at a low level.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Lehmann advises individual investors not to try
singling out particular corporate bonds, because the risk of
picking a loser is too great. Instead, investors should buy mutual
funds specializing in bonds, ``where they can get diversity.''

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Buy the things you've always wanted, but don't overdo it. A lot of
money can make for a lot of debt.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Don't be surprised if you don't want to retire. Instead, give
yourself the opportunity to decide what kind of work you really
want to do.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Find avenues to express your altruism that are personally
meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Communicate with family members about your new wealth. Keep in
mind that the arrival of money will have an impact on everyone in
the household.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Expect to lose some friends and make some new ones. Be prepared
for the envy of others.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Don't be surprised if you wonder who you can really trust. Expect
invitations, solicitations and loan requests to exponentially
increase.

 Overcoming the New-Money Blues  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Silicon Valley has created tens of thousands of millionaires _ 64
new ones each and every day, according to some estimates.
Frequently, however, these newly rich find that big bucks don't add
up to big fun.
<P>
   Just the opposite, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Bay Area psychologists, Stephen Goldbart and Joan
DiFuria, have come up with a name for the affliction: ``Sudden
Wealth Syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about having your life change earlier in adulthood than
you imagined, in ways that are dramatically different from how you
grew up,'' Goldbart said during a lengthy chat at the office he and
DiFuria share in Kentfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an early identity crisis,'' DiFuria, sitting nearby on
the couch, clarified. ``There's a sense of denial. There's a sense
of shock. There's a sense of I-don't-deserve-it.''
</P>
<P>
   To assist in overcoming such conflicted feelings, the pair have
founded the Money, Meaning &AMP; Choices Institute as a beacon of light
for those wandering in the darkness of Sudden Wealth Syndrome. They
are also at work on a book.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, it will be pretty darn hard for most people to
sympathize with some Porsche-driving, sneakers-wearing
propeller-head who's having a hard time adjusting to life as a
megamillionaire.
</P>
<P>
   And that's actually part of the problem. The suddenly affluent
find that, along with potential feelings of anxiety and guilt over
their windfall, one of the hazards of new wealth is coming to terms
with how others perceive you.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, experts say, is that very few people are
psychologically and emotionally prepared for the life-altering
effects of large amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the challenge, a growing cadre of wealth
specialists has emerged to help the rich be rich, tackling
everything from inheritances and stock options to raising kids in
newly affluent households.
</P>
<P>
   So great is the demand for such services, financial powerhouses
like Charles Schwab and Merrill Lynch have even held seminars for
clients on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The swift-rich do not have the wisdom of time to have their
psychology catch up with their affluence,'' said Paul Schervish, a
sociology professor at Boston College specializing in
wealth-related issues. ``They have to acquaint themselves with a
new identity. It's the same dynamic as being newly retired.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of. While the newly retired and the newly rich may
both find themselves with excess time on their hands, the former
have planned for years on a lifestyle change, while the latter are
almost overnight thrown into the deep end of the financial pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of challenges that people face when they come
into wealth they didn't expect,'' said Christopher Mogil, director
of More Than Money, a Massachusetts nonprofit group dedicated to
assisting people in handling new wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your relationships with friends change,'' he said. ``You ask
yourself whether people are interested in you or your money. You
need to decide whether to keep working, which for men especially is
a real source of self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   Exacerbating the situation is the fact that many people with
money and misgivings often have a difficult time sharing their
feelings with others. The fear, of course, is that they will be
ridiculed for being unable to cope with what should be a sweet
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the last taboos in society _ talking about money
and class issues,'' Mogil said.
</P>
<P>
   As a cautionary tale, Money, Meaning &AMP; Choice's Goldbart related
the story of a 44-year-old San Francisco software developer named
John, who woke up one morning about a month after his company went
public and realized he no longer had to go to work. He no longer
had to spend more than 60 hours a week toiling away in a cubicle.
</P>
<P>
   John was now a multimillionaire. But instead of reveling in his
good fortune, he found himself increasingly distracted by feelings
of isolation and worry.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he found his way to Goldbart's office, John was
genuinely troubled. He said that he was uncomfortable with the way
other people were now treating him and that he was having a hard
time keeping his priorities straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying assumption is that if you have all the money in
the world, you'll be happy and fulfilled,'' Goldbart said. ``That's
simply not true.''
</P>
<P>
   He and DiFuria, both well regarded in their field, first spotted
the trend of woeful wealth several years ago _ not coincidentally,
right around the same time that info-tech companies were turning
into slot machines for options-laden employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept seeing clients come in with issues of wealth, and they
were getting younger and younger,'' DiFuria noted. ``I had very
successful men who'd say they'd stop when they reached $3 million,
and then it was $15 million, and then $50 million.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've bought the BMW and they have the $3 million Mill
Valley house,'' Goldbart chimed in. ``And they still wake up in the
morning and say, `I don't feel good about myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   The pair have broken down their recovery process into three
stages. In the first, clients come to terms with the shock,
excitement and confusion surrounding the arrival of money into
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, they attempt to regain a sense of control over
the changes they have experienced. In the third, clients seek to
come up with a revised set of priorities and goals accommodating
their improved circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money means power,'' Goldbart said. ``The question is how
you're going to wield that power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you use or abuse it,'' DiFuria added.
</P>
<P>
   Like many wealth specialists, they advocate philanthropy as the
key to peace of mind _ using one's riches as a tool for positive
social change.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, the suddenly wealthy often find themselves at sea.
How much should they give? Who should they give it to? How should
they do it?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a wariness about giving away a lot of money,'' noted
Claude Rosenberg, founder of a San Francisco entity called the
Newtithing Group, which promotes philanthropic activities. ``You
can never really overcome that wariness.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he believes that the well-to-do can, and should,
commit a healthy percentage of their net worth to charitable
organizations. This, Rosenberg said, will both increase a personal
sense of fulfillment while addressing some of the nation's most
pressing needs.
</P>
<P>
   John Levy, a Mill Valley wealth counselor, said those who
inherit their riches, as opposed to hitting a home run in the stock
market, tend to have an easier time adjusting to la dolce vita.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inheritors are prepared in advance,'' he said. ``On the other
hand, they have to deal with not having earned it. That can cause
insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   As for IPO millionaires, Levy said they frequently go on
spending sprees and flaunt their newly affluent status. ``They
don't know how to be rich,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   Most wealth specialists advise clients to take it slow, to not
rush into any major decisions. They urge the newly prosperous to
adjust first to the idea of being rich before turning their lives
upside-down with wholesale changes.
</P>
<P>
   Schervish, the Boston sociologist, said the suddenly rich could
do worse than to follow the examples of prominent wealthy guys like
Bill Gates, Ted Turner and Donald Trump, each of whom appears to
have reached a level of comfort with their status.
</P>
<P>
   ``The swift-rich must remember that money is empowering in a
material sense,'' he said, adding that until one learns to make
good use of money, ``it can be disempowering.''
</P>
<P>
   Schervish also advised new arrivals to the highest tax bracket
to be cautious when seeking guidance from self-appointed wealth
experts. ``As with every fast-growing industry,'' he said,
``there's some snake oil and there's some high-quality
counseling.''
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, some less-than-prosperous people might
conclude that being rich is more hassle than it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   Schervish laughed. ``Well,'' he said, ``it's a problem most of
us wouldn't mind facing.''

   Premier Lucien Bouchard of Quebec gave a cold shoulder to
separatist hard-liners at a Parti Quebecois convention, declaring
that his party's main goal should be to win re-election before its
mandate expires in 2003 instead of holding a third referendum on
independence. Previously, he promised to hold a vote on separation.
But opinion polls indicate support for independence and his

CHRISTIE'S IS CHANGING ITS FEES IN FACE OF SUITS AND U.S.
INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (js) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Faced with class-action lawsuits and a 3-year-old
antitrust investigation into possible collusion between Sotheby's
and Christie's, the world's two largest auction houses, Christie's
announced Monday that it was changing the fees it charges buyers
and sellers.
</P>
<P>
   In much the same way airlines give frequent fliers incentives to
maintain a loyal customer base, Christie's will now give customers
who buy a lot of art cheaper rates when they sell art. Previously,
sellers paid a fixed scale of charges ranging from 2 percent to 20
percent based upon the value of the property sold at Christie's
during a calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   But while it may be cheaper to sell at Christie's, it will be
more expensive to buy there. As of March 31, Christie's will
increase its buyer's commissions, charging buyers 17.5 percent on
the first $80,000 and 10 percent on any amount over that. Since
1993 both Sotheby's and Christie's charged buyers 15 percent for
the first $50,000 they spent and 10 percent for everything after
that.
</P>
<P>
   Sources in both auction houses said Christie's new fee structure
was a reaction to the Justice Department's investigation and to the
numerous civil lawsuits that were filed last week by angry buyers
and sellers who claimed the auction houses inflated their fees as a
result of illegal price-fixing.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has declined to comment on its case since
beginning the investigation in 1997. Gina Talamona, a government
spokeswoman, said only that ``the antitrust division is looking at
the possibility of anti-competitive practices in the fine art
auction industry.'' But sources at the auction houses, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the investigation centers on the fees.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Sotheby's announced the increase in buyer's commission,
up from a flat fee of 1 percent. Seven weeks later Christie's
followed suit. Then in 1995, Christie's announced it was changing
the fee it charged sellers from a flat commission of 10 percent to
a more complex, non-negotiable sliding scale ranging from 2 percent
to 10 percent depending on the size of the sale. Weeks later
Sotheby's did the same.
</P>
<P>
   Before the auction houses changed the commission for sellers, in
1995, they ran the risk of cutting into their profits. They wooed
many of the world's richest sellers and often agreed to cut or
eliminate fees to get their business. If the two conspired to set
the fees in secret, they would circumvent the problem and both make
more money.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's, with the change announced Monday, is signaling that
it will again lower or even drop its seller's charges to lure big
business. Clients who purchase or sell more than $5 million a year
receive special terms negotiated on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this will make us more competitive in winning
business,'' said Edward Dolman, who was named chief executive of
Christie's on Christmas Eve after the abrupt departure of
Christopher Davidge, who had been chief executive for six years.
``We have been planning this for some time. But recent events have
accelerated this announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   A week and a half ago, Christie's announced that it had given
federal investigators information about ``possible conduct'' at the
firm that was relevant to the antitrust investigation, which
includes about a dozen prominent dealers in addition to the two
auction houses. In exchange for its cooperation, the company was
``conditionally accepted'' into the Justice Department's amnesty
program, Christie's said.
</P>
<P>
   Collusion in setting the commissions would constitute an illegal
restraint of trade under the Sherman Antitrust Act. Penalties for
violations can include substantial fines and imprisonment of up to
three years.
</P>
<P>
   One art lawyer familiar with the case noted that changing the
fee structure would be a natural result of the investigation.
``This signals there may have been collusion not just on the
sellers but on the buyer's premium,'' he said.``Since the present
commission schedule is presumably collusive, they now have to take
themselves out of a conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But other auction house experts disagreed, saying that they
thought the investigation concerned only seller's fees, not the
buyer's premium. The increase in the premium, they said, would be a
logical step, intended to offset the loss of revenues from the
reduced seller's commission.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Art dealers had other theories concerning Christie's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find Christie's announcement consistent with their decision
to concede the Internet auction business to Sotheby's,'' said Vance
Jordan, an American painting dealer who runs a Madison Avenue
gallery. Last year, Sotheby's invested $40 million to create two
Internet sites, one with Amazon.com, the other managed soley by the
auction house. Christie's said it would not team up with an
Internet company to sell its lower-priced items online.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan added that the new fee structure, ``if unmatched by
Sotheby's, would give Christie's a clear competitive advantage with
upper-end buyers and sellers because it gives them preferential
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust investigation will make it difficult for Sotheby's
to exactly match Christie's fees, experts say. But if Sotheby's is
to remain competitive, it will have to lower its seller's
commissions also. Matthew Weigman, a spokesman for Sotheby's, said,
``we will be reviewing the changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolman of Christie's said the new rates apply only to the
company's higher end or what he called its ``principal sales
rooms,'' which allows it to retain the ability to compete with the
online auction businesses like E-bay that charge only 7.5 percent
to sellers and nothing to buyers. The principal sales rooms include
Christie's headquarters in London on King Street, its Rockefeller
Center location in New York and its Los Angeles salesroom.
Christie's lower-priced auction rooms like South Kensington in
London and Christie's East in New York will change their seller's
fees in the coming weeks, the company said. Its other European and
Asian locations, including Amsterdam, Netherlands; Hong Kong, and
Singapore, will also change their fee structures but the rates have
yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   The new commission terms will automatically apply to consignment
agreements that have already been signed, Dolman said. &QL;

(With BUDGET-CLINTON) 
(js) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The budget unveiled Monday by President Clinton
shows his extraordinary persistence as an architect of domestic
policy. In health care and other social programs, he is pursuing
many of the same goals as in 1993, though often by different means.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is still trying to expand health coverage, still trying
to expand eligibility for food stamps and other nutrition programs,
still trying to increase the Earned-Income Tax Credit, one of the
nation's biggest anti-poverty programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't call him the comeback kid for nothing,'' said
Edward M. Cooney, a special assistant to the secretary of
agriculture, noting how Clinton had pressed on despite setbacks and
detours.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, his first year in office, Clinton proposed a big
expansion of the food stamp program under the Agriculture
Department, and Congress approved it. The 1996 welfare law cut food
stamp spending, especially benefits for legal immigrants. Clinton
won restoration of some of the cuts for legal immigrants in 1998,
and on Monday he asked Congress to restore the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, on health policy.
</P>
<P>
   No longer does Clinton try to guarantee health insurance for all
by redesigning the health care system from top to bottom. Rather,
he is proposing more modest steps to insure a dozen different
groups including workers between jobs, people age 55 to 64,
uninsured parents of children eligible for Medicaid, legal
immigrants and low-income women with breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In his new budget request, Clinton proposed to expand plans that
failed in recent years, and he asks Congress to spend more money on
them in the hope that the proposals will prove more popular if they
are more generous. Clinton would use anticipated budget surpluses
to finance many of his ambitious plans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton described his approach in his State of the Union Message
last month. ``The lesson of our history, and the lesson of the last
seven years,'' he said, ``is that great goals are reached step by
step, always building on our progress, always gaining ground.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Clinton acknowledged that his original proposal for
universal health insurance coverage would not work. But he said:
``Maybe we can do it in another way. That's what we've tried to do,
a step at a time until eventually we finish this.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart M. Butler, a vice president of the conservative Heritage
Foundation, said Clinton had persuaded Congress to accept major
changes in health and domestic policy by pursuing an incremental
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say it's more palatable,'' Butler said, ``but it's
harder to resist. It's directed at very tangible aspects of
people's lives. The president can say he's just solving people's
problems, not expanding the role of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, for the third year in a row, Clinton proposed to let
people age 55 to 64 buy Medicare coverage. Stung by criticism that
the premiums would be too high, he is now proposing tax credits to
offset 25 percent of the cost. He would, in effect, offer a tax
break to encourage people to participate in a government program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also sweetened his proposal to offer prescription drug
coverage to all Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Congress last year balked at Clinton's proposal to have Medicare
cover prescription drugs _ half the annual drug expenses, up to a
maximum federal payment of $2,500 a year. Monday Clinton enlarged
his original proposal, adding coverage for the costs of people with
Medicare coverage who have extraordinarily high prescription drug
expenses. He gave no details of how he would design or finance such
``catastrophic coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Clinton last year proposed a $1,000 tax credit for
people providing long-term care to relatives with chronic
illnesses. The proposal was well received in Congress, but never
became law. Monday Clinton proposed to triple the amount of the
credit, in the hope of winning more support.
</P>
<P>
   The president also returned to one of his favorite programs, the
Earned-Income Tax Credit, a refundable credit available to poor
working families. In 1993, Clinton proposed an expansion of the
credit costing $28 billion over five years; Congress approved $20
billion, providing help to 15 million low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Clinton proposed a further expansion of the
Earned-Income Tax Credit, providing tax relief to 6.8 million
families at a cost of $2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   From his earliest days in office, Clinton has been trying to
expand Head Start, the development program for preschoolers, with a
goal of serving 1 million youngsters. When he took office in 1993,
Head Start was providing health, education and social services to
713,900 children at a cost of $2.8 billion a year. This year
877,000 children participate, and the program has a budget of $5.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In his budget request Monday, Clinton sought $6.3 billion, for a
total enrollment of 950,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been equally persistent in trying to immunize
children against measles, mumps, polio and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he and Hillary Rodham Clinton said they wanted the
federal government to buy up all childhood vaccine and distribute
it at no charge to all children. They later settled for a program
guaranteeing free vaccine for millions of children who were poor or
uninsured. But the program went awry when the administration
insisted on storing large quantities of vaccine in a federal
warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the White House scrapped plans for the warehouse,
scaled back the government's role and sought more money to help
drug companies distribute vaccine to state health departments and
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Isabelle Claxton, a spokeswoman for Merck &AMP; Company, which makes
several pediatric vaccines, said: ``The lesson is that the
marketplace can work. Once you got past the politics, it became
clear that the price of individual vaccines was not the main
barrier. The Clinton administration reached out to states and
worked with them to do a better job of educating physicians and
parents to immunize children on time.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a two-day respite from the campaign trail, Vice
President Al Gore stepped up his New York campaign in earnest
Monday, paying homage to the labor unions he is counting on to
mobilize for him in the March 7 primary and spending the evening
courting arts patrons at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   And in recognition of Bill Bradley's popularity here from his
days as a star basketball player and a senator from New Jersey,
Gore opened a new attack against his rival for the Democratic
nomination, saying that Bradley's proposals, particularly on health
care, education and the budget surplus, would be bad for New York.
</P>
<P>
   New York is seen as Bradley's best hope for a breakthrough after
his losses to the vice president in Iowa and New Hampshire, and
Gore made it clear Monday that he was not going to give Bradley an
inch of breathing room here. His line of attack was tailor-made for
hard-core Democrats in New York, playing on party loyalty and the
economic success of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to describe to you one of the big differences between
myself and my opponent in the Democratic primary,'' Gore told about
1,000 people in Lower Manhattan at the headquarters of District
Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that you can run for the Democratic nomination
by running down the progress and achievements of the Democratic
Party over the past seven years,'' he said, ``because in fact our
policies have been good for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Asked later if he would campaign in New York with President
Clinton, Gore said, ``I've got to win this race on my own, and I'm
campaigning on my own vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would campaign with Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is
running for Senate in New York, Gore said: ``It's a matter of
scheduling, not just me, but also her. I hope so. But that's yet to
be worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While Gore was courting New York Democrats, Bradley appeared in
Tampa, Fla., and took aim at the Republican governor, Jeb Bush, who
signed an executive order last year, ending affirmation action in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has long been a staunch defender of affirmative action,
as has been his opponent, Vice President Al Gore. But by choosing
to attack Bush, the brother of the Republican presidential
candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Bradley delivered notice
that he was prepared to take on any elected official or
presidential candidate or relative of a presidential candidate, in
his uphill fight for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he has demonstrated a lack of vision and
leadership by repealing affirmative action in the state of
Florida,'' said Bradley about JEb Bush at a raucously supportive
town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's brief appearance in Florida, whose primary is March
14, was his second in two days focusing on race relations. On
Sunday, he visited a church with a large black congregation in the
New York City borough of Queens, and on Tuesday, he will appear in
South Carolina, which has no Democratic primary, to criticize the
Confederate flag's presence over the State Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance Monday before the labor group, Gore assailed
Bradley for having retired from the Senate in 1996 instead of
fighting against what Gore called the Gingrich Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he retired from the Senate during President Clinton's
first term, Sen. Bradley spoke about what he called a budget
stalemate and a process that was, in his words, paralyzed, a
continual deadlock,'' Gore said. ``And so he decided to leave. But
he was wrong. We broke that deadlock.''

   He added: ``If Sen. Bradley could not foresee the progress that
we made when we decided to stay and fight against the Gingrich
Republicans, what else does he not see now? How can he be counted
on to see what is right for working families today?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's remarks seemed to turn the tables on Bradley, who
recently has been accusing Gore of waging a campaign of distortions
and falsehoods.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore cannot tell the truth as a candidate, Bradley has been
asking audiences, how can the nation expect him to tell the truth
as president? And now Gore is asking about Bradley: If he did not
fight the good fight a few years ago, how can the nation expect him
to fight as president?
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said that Bradley's health-care proposal would
``eliminate Medicaid for more than 3 million New Yorkers who depend
on it, people with disabilities, people with AIDS, the elderly, in
nursing homes,'' substituting vouchers or subsidies of $150 a
month. ``See if you can find a health-care plan in New York for
$150 a month that pays your prescription drug benefits as Medicaid
does, that pays the kind of benefits that Medicaid pays,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Union members account for 30 percent to 40 percent of the
Democratic primary vote in New York, much higher than they figured
in Iowa and New Hampshire, and they drew most of Gore's attention
Monday. He began with an appearance via satellite at the United
Food and Commercial Workers meeting in Naples, Fla., then met at
his hotel with about 65 labor leaders from across New York state.
</P>
<P>
   He later went to a construction site on Manhattan's West Side,
at 63rd Street and West End Avenue. As he walked through the muddy
site in his heavy topcoat, business suit and cowboy boots, he shook
hands with carpenters and masons.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To help Gore, the state AFL-CIO distributed 1 million pieces of
Gore literature Monday at 10,000 work sites across the state. The
fliers exclaim, ``No presidential candidate has ever been more
supportive of working families than Al Gore!''
</P>
<P>
   Denis M. Hughes, president of the New York State AFL-CIO, said,
``I don't know of any organized support for Bradley in the
trade-union movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore took about an hour and a half out of his labor
supplications to rehearse at Avery Fisher Hall for his nighttime
performance, in which he was to narrate Aaron Copland's 1942
classic, ``Lincoln Portrait,'' accompanied by the American Symphony
Orchestra, under the direction of Leon Botstein.
</P>
<P>
   The concert is a benefit for seven charities in New York. Tapes
of it are to benefit the Phillips Brooks House, a student-run
public-service organization at Harvard, Gore's alma mater.

 RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MISSED THIS 
 
 REVIEW  of ``GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING'' 
 By Tracy Chevalier (Dutton, $21.95) 
 
 
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The girl looks back over her shoulder with wide eyes and parted
lips, as if someone has come up from behind and taken her by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Her earring, a giant pearl, catches the light, and a blue turban
hides the unruly hair that she never lets anyone see. Her pose
seems natural, but we know she was coaxed into it by the artist who
painted her _ he even instructed her to lick her lips and not to
close them. As she gazes back at him, we also know her secret: She
loves the man, but she can never speak of it to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   She is 17. Her name is Griet, and she is a maid in the house of
Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer, who is known today as the ``master
of light'' but who in 1665 was merely a respected artist struggling
to support a wife and six children (11, by the time he died a
decade later) in 17th century Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeer and his family are real, but Griet is the invention of
Tracy Chevalier in her novel, ``Girl With a Pearl Earring,'' which
was inspired by Vermeer's painting of the same name. Griet is only
16 when she is sent to work in Vermeer's house, a move made
necessary after her father, a Delft tilemaker, is blinded in a kiln
explosion and unable to work.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an easy time for Griet, who has never been away from
her parents. She is Protestant and the Vermeers are Catholic, and
their home is full of religious paintings (Vermeer is a collector
as well as an artist) that are foreign and frightening to her. Her
days are long and hard, and she must fend for herself in the
constant power struggle that simmers among the women of the house:
Vermeer's suspicious and mercurial wife, Catharina; his
mother-in-law, the sly and powerful Maria Thins; Maria's personal
maid, Tanneke; and Cornelia, Vermeer's malicious 7-year-old
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Griet holds her own well enough. She has an instinct for
flattery that disarms Tanneke at first, and she manages to
establish a minor alliance with Maria Thins. But her biggest weapon
is the master himself. From the moment he meets her, Vermeer
recognizes Griet's eye for color and detail. It is not long before
he secretly enlists her as his assistant, teaching her how to mix
paints and plan what will appear on a canvas. And Griet begins to
see him not just as employer but as an artist, and then as a man.
</P>
<P>
   Griet narrates her story with a certain plodding charm, the
voice of a working-class girl who knows her place in life but
cannot resist the allure of what is beyond her. She is
hard-working, cautious, uncomplaining and clever, a Jane Eyre in
the land of canals.
</P>
<P>
   That her story moves so quickly (I read it in two days) is a
reflection of how shallow it actually is _ we never really have a
sense of why any of the characters are the way they are. But that
is not a drawback. Griet does not have time to analyze the people
whose lives touch hers. She must support herself, contribute to her
parents' well-being and navigate the dicey emotional tides in the
house of Johannes Vermeer.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she does not settle happily into her master's arms
like Jane Eyre, but perhaps does something better: She makes a life
for herself and sees it for what it is, growing into a pragmatic
woman who tells her story exactly as it should be told.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeer left only 35 paintings behind at the end of his life.
Several _ including ``Young Woman With a Water Pitcher'' and
``Woman With a Pearl Necklace'' _ make appearances in Chevalier's
book, as if she cannot resist making up stories to explain these
dazzling and enigmatic works of art. Any one of them would have
made a good premise for a novel, but Chevalier has chosen well. We
don't know who really posed for ``Girl With a Pearl Earring,'' but
her Griet is a character worthy of the honor. &QL;

MCCAIN AIDE'S CONSERVATISM RUNS DEEP 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Sen. John McCain has recently been accused by
Republican opponents of being a shadow liberal, but no one has ever
leveled such a charge against his South Carolina political
consultant and the architect of his Southern campaign, Richard M.
Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   Where McCain has policy positions from across the political
spectrum, Quinn is one of the proudest and most vocal conservatives
in the South, editing one of the region's most right-wing
magazines, Southern Partisan. Where McCain has alternately
criticized and sympathized with arguments for displaying the
Confederate battle flag, Quinn has helped lead the fight to keep
the flag flying over the South Carolina Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn's political consulting firm, Richard Quinn Associates, has
worked for such candidates as Ronald Reagan, Sen. Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., and Pat Robertson. At the moment, however, the company is
best known for its work supporting the display of the flag in the
face of an economic boycott by the NAACP. Several state legislators
say the company has conducted private polls that show the flag is
widely popular in Republican areas, which have persuaded many
lawmakers to keep it flying.
</P>
<P>
   One of Quinn's longtime associates at the magazine, Christopher
M. Sullivan, is also the co-chairman of the South Carolina Heritage
Coalition, which organized a large pro-flag rally on the statehouse
steps last month. Sullivan's coalition recently began running
television advertisements urging voters and legislators to stand up
to liberals who are trying to remove the flag. Quinn's son, Rick
Quinn, is majority leader of the South Carolina House of
Representatives, where he has been in the forefront of the effort
to keep the flag flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Quinn is a key person in the pro-flag movement in
South Carolina,'' said Dwight James, executive director of the
South Carolina chapter of the NAACP. ``He and his son have
disseminated a great deal of misinformation to keep that flag
flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, in fact, is such a polarizing figure around South
Carolina that he has stayed in the background to avoid obscuring
his client with a long-running Southern debate. He said Monday that
he would not discuss his position on the flag or as editor in chief
of the Southern Partisan Quarterly Review, which he has led since
1984. In a statement, he disavowed some of the more inflammatory
articles it has published.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not the working day-to-day editor of Southern Partisan,''
he said. ``My title as editor in chief is purely honorary. Frankly,
I do not personally read the articles before they are printed, and
I certainly disagree with many of the opinions expressed by others
on the pages of the magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign also issued a statement, saying that Quinn
was a ``highly respected South Carolina campaign consultant'' who
had worked for a variety of Republicans, including some now
supporting McCain's chief rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A look at some of the articles in Southern Partisan shows why it
has become the nation's leading journal of the so-called
neo-confederacy movement, publishing scholarly treatises, political
interviews and commentary that glorify the Southern traditions
underlying the secession movement.
</P>
<P>
   In issue after issue, writers in Southern Partisan vilify
Abraham Lincoln and other Union leaders, and venerate the rebel
soldiers who fought to secede from the United States. The quarterly
regularly takes the position that the Civil War was fought not over
slavery, but over the preservation of a Southern way of life that
to this day is worth preserving.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine rarely writes about slavery, but when it does, its
positions are usually not those of mainstream historians. A review
of a book on the slave trade in a 1998 issue, for example, includes
this passage: ``Mainstream black leaders perpetuate the myth that
vicious white slave traders dragged Africans from their idyllic
homeland to serve as chattel for arrogant white Americans. Readers
of this magazine know otherwise.'' The review goes on to say that
white slave traders were often less brutal than the African
warlords who traded their subjects for livestock and herbs.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also weighs in on more contemporary topics. One
issue last year criticized The Miami Herald for publishing a
special section devoted to news about gays. ``Who knows, maybe
Miami will someday be an exclusively gay city,'' the article said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the articles, however, are more high-minded historical
reviews in the tradition of the Southern agrarian movement, which
glorified the South's slow-paced traditions of farms and small
towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes back to Jefferson's ideal of the yeoman farmer,'' said
Dr. Blease Graham, an authority on Southern history and politics at
the University of South Carolina. ``They venerate the idea of a
lost way of life, the intrusion of the fast-food chains and
industrialization on the sense of place in the South. Of course,
the grand old days for Southern aristocrats were grim days for
African-American slaves, and there's no way that can be
reconciled.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who knows Quinn, says the consultant does not hold
racist ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is actually a thoughtful intellectual with a square head on
his shoulders,'' said Graham, dean of the university's College of
Criminal Justice. ``But he has that states'-rights, pro-Southern
point of view that some people find disagreeable.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, who often finds himself working for candidates opposed by
the state's Republican establishment, has rarely been accused of
any kind of personal racism. But several black politicians around
the state have said that his association with McCain could diminish
the chances that blacks will support McCain if they vote in the
Republican primary on Feb. 19, which is open to all voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people realize who McCain is associating with, it could
hurt him,'' said state Rep. Todd Rutherford, a Democrat from
Columbia. ``He's lining himself up with positions that offend
people.''

U.N. INCREASES PEACEKEEPERS IN SIERRA LEONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council increased a peacekeeping
force for Sierra Leone Monday to 11,000 from about 6,000 and told
the troops not to shrink from using weapons against some of the
most brutal rebel armies anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded peacekeeping mission, approved unanimously, becomes
the organization's largest. The council hopes the extra troops will
be able to better protect themselves as well as aid workers and the
people of Sierra Leone. The rebel forces, particularly the
Revolutionary United Front, led by Foday Sankoh, have been
responsible for many killings and the amputation of limbs.
</P>
<P>
   A peace agreement signed in July in Lome, Togo, between the
rebels and the government of President Ahmed Tejjan Kabbah,
officially ended a nine-year civil war, but not the attacks on
civilians, U.N. peacekeepers already on duty and African troops
from a regional force known as Ecomog.
</P>
<P>
   Countries contributing troops to the U.N. force were told at a
meeting here on Friday that soldiers will have to be more forceful
in opposing rebels they are charged with disarming.

   &UR; RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED IT &QL; 
 &QL; 
eere are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``MY GENERATION'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Michael Gross (Cliff Street, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gross looks at the cultural impact of the baby-boom generation
(his rather liberal standards include anyone born from the day the
Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941 to the day John F. Kennedy was
assassinated in 1963) by focusing on 19 ``quintessential boomers,''
including Donald Trump, Marianne Williamson, political cartoonist
Doug Marlette, software superstar Steve Capps, porn star Nina
Hartley, New York criminal court judge Leslie Crocker Snyder and
public-relations executive Cynthia Bowman (she once lived with Paul
Kantner of the Jefferson Airplane and was Grace Slick's maid of
honor when she married her lighting director). The story of this
generation and how it evolved, Gross writes, ``is best told not
through the lives of average members but through those who achieved
or failed or both, extravagantly.'' His book is sometimes
scattered, but thought-provoking, and haunted by the belief of
fellow boomer Maureen Dowd that ``we are going to die without
experiencing the nobility that illuminated the lives of our parents
and grandparents.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``GREENE ON CAPRI'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Shirley Hazzard (FSG, $22) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, to be young and well-off and living in Italy, where you
could sit in a piazza and read books or work crossword puzzles
until your friend Graham Greene showed up to share a bottle of wine
and some scintillating conversation. This slight memoir begins in
the 1960s and is set in a succession of villas and cafes on Capri,
where Hazzard and her husband, biographer Francis Steegmuller, got
to know Greene very well. She addresses Greene's religion, his
fiction, his culinary habits, his friends and acquaintances, his
appreciation of women, his feelings about America and his own
country, his alleged anti-Semitism. All of it carries an air of
otherworldliness brought on by the underlying suggestion of leisure
and privilege (there are some references to ``completing
manuscripts,'' but mostly these people just seem to eat and talk).
Most of all, the conversations were literary. After Greene's death
in 1991 and Steegmuller's in 1994, the woman who had been Greene's
companion wrote to Hazzard that ``maybe now they have found each
other, and go on discoursing on Flaubert.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``BECOMING AMERICAN'' &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Meri Nana-ama Danquah (Hyperion,
 &UR; $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Lilianet Brintrup came to the United States from Chile as a
graduate student in 1981, she was humbled by the cold. Winter had
set in, hard and implacable, but the chill was also in the faces of
the people around her. They did not smile. ``I supposed that they
were in a hurry,'' she writes. ``I didn't see any sign of welcome,
not even one small flag waving in the wind as a sign of welcome for
foreign people. This lack of courtesy in a country of immigrants .
. . really surprised me.'' This wonderful collection of essays by
first-generation immigrant women will help you see this country in
a different light, as an adventure and a place of great opportunity
but also as a source of confusion and a sense of displacement. Some
of these women now think of the United States as home, as when
Gabrielle Donnelly, formerly a London journalist, writes with
delightful assurance of her American husband, her American city _
Los Angeles _ and her increasingly American sensibilities. Others
never will. Among the contributors are women from Haiti, India,
Korea, Russia, Ireland, Japan, China and Egypt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``LETTERS FROM THE EDITOR'' &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Thomas Kunkel (Modern Library, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Orson: I was astonished at your column in yesterday's
`Post,' in which you say `The New Yorker' sneers at you. You were
brimful of prunes when you wrote that.'' We don't know about you,
but we are brimful of prunes over the fact that ``New Yorker''
Editor Harold Ross never wrote to  &UR; us, &UR; when he managed to send such
droll missives to everyone else in the world. Included are notes to
the above-mentioned Orson Welles, Katharine and E.B. White, Ring
Lardner, Groucho Marx, F. Scott Fitzgerald, H.L. Mencken, Ernest
Hemingway, Dorothy Parker, James Thurber, Lillian Hellman, Joseph
Mitchell. In short, some of the most luminous people of the day
heard from Ross, and they were lucky for it. He was witty, he was
affectionate, he was irascible _ he once wrote to E.B. White to
denounce the use of the term ``toilet paper'' in his magazine,
which, he said, ``would ruin my meal if I read it while eating. It
might easily cause vomiting.'' Ross is great company _ if you don't
have a letter of your own, this book is the next best thing.  &QL;

   MALIBU, Callf. _ This is the weekend laid-back Malibu needs to
be the nastiest place around. The coffee shops along Pacific Coast
Highway should be empty, the bookstores and restaurants all closed
down.
</P>
<P>
   No rollerblading at the beach or hiking in the Santa Monica
Mountains. They'll be there next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For once, Firestone Fieldhouse at Pepperdine University, the
home of the best college basketball team in town, needs to be
rocking and rolling like those thundering waves crashing onto the
beach across the highway.
</P>
<P>
   The Pepperdine men's basketball team has done its part. First-
year coach Jan van Breda Kolff and his overachieving players have
positioned themselves to win the West Coast Conference
championship. With wins Friday against Portland and Saturday
against Gonzaga, the Waves will pull into a first-place tie with
Gonzaga with four games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time for the Pepperdine student body and local fans to
do their part. When Gonzaga rolls into town, the only appropriate
greeting should be unadulterated noise. Pepperdine fans need to
transform cozy Firestone Fieldhouse into a thundering, madhouse gym
like Duke University's Cameron Indoor Arena.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Waves encountered last Thursday when they
traveled to Gonzaga. There, Pepperdine was met by a rollicking
crowd that danced the line between supportive and bellicose. In the
end, the charged-up atmosphere helped fuel a furious Gonzaga
comeback, enabling the Bulldogs to race back from a 13-point
halftime deficit to win 62-57.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was by far the most hostile environment we've played in
this year, to the point where sometimes it was more then hostile,''
van Breda Kolff said. ``Hopefully, our crowd can be just as intense
and help motivate the team to play as well as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be a nice gesture, if a bit overdue. Over the last
month, Pepperdine has played some of the best basketball in the
country, winning nine of 10 games to make the WCC race a two-team
sprint. The Waves play an exciting style, using a full-court press
to create turnovers and fastbreaks. Van Breda Kolff, who left
Vanderbilt University to replace Lorenzo Romar, is liberal with his
playing time, going nine-deep on the bench and encouraging players
to look for their shots.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine isn't built around one star player. It instead relies
on its depth and unselfishness. At the end of games, opponents
can't focus on stopping one player, since any one of six or seven
can make an important shot. At various times, Brandon Armstrong,
Tommie Prince, Kelvin Gibbs, Nick Sheppard and Tezale Archie have
made huge plays down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   It's a style of play fans generally go for, and with the type of
excitement the Waves are creating, you'd expect Firestone to be
sold out most nights. Unfortuntately, that hasn't been the case.
Pepperdine is averaging less then 2,000 per game.
</P>
<P>
   That needs to change this weekend. The fieldhouse, which seats
3,104, needs to be sold out, loud and rowdy.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the Waves are playing for more then the regular-season
conference title. Pepperdine will earn an automatic NCAA Tournament
bid by winning the WCC Tournament March 4-6, but failing to do that
puts the Waves' fate in the hands of the NCAA selection committee,
which relies on a ratings percentage index (RPI) to determine
tournament-worthy teams. The RPI breaks down every team's strength
of schedule, then ranks them. Right now Pepperdine has a solid 29
RPI, falling between North Carolina and Utah. But much can change
between now and selection day, which means games like Saturday are
critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in good company right now, but it doesn't really mean
much until March,'' van Breda Kolff said.
</P>
<P>
   Make it seem like March this weekend in Malibu.

   Some national parks are strictly warm-weather friends. By early
September, the Going to the Sun Road across Glacier National Park
is dicey: You can get a certain distance and find the road shut
because at those altitudes, it's already snowing on a perilous
route. And on the Blue Ridge Parkway in the Great Smokies, drives
in early spring in search of an ideal hike can also be frustrating
because runoff congeals into sheets of ice, and barriers are up at
tunnel entrances and along cliffs.
</P>
<P>
   But many national park areas in the chill belt remain
accessible, and disclose secrets to those who venture in. ``You can
see all of the animal tracks,'' says Malcolm Wilbur, chief
administrator of the Cape Cod National Seashore, ``if there is a
little frost or snow.''
</P>
<P>
   At Acadia National Park in Maine, a foot and a half of snow
invites cross-country skiers and snowshoers to explore vistas of
ocean and wilderness that are often blocked behind traffic in high
season. The crowding is down every place, and many parks and
recreation areas offer extensive activities to all comers.
</P>
<P>
   David Barna, chief spokesman for the National Park Service, said
he believed that there had been a rise in winter visits, related to
the younger age of retired people and their wish for vigorous
activity. ``Once we had winter activities only at the holidays,''
Barna said, ``but now this broader, younger retired audience has
more flexibility, in addition to college students who are out of
school in January and February.''
</P>
<P>
   Winter tent camping may suit only the hardiest, but for them, no
reservations are needed and space is plentiful. Others can ski,
snowshoe or hike. Most parks charge no admission fee in the
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   There are usually a few nearby bed-and-breakfasts open all
winter, and they are often easy to find through chambers of
commerce or visitor bureaus. Two major parks, Yellowstone in
Wyoming and Montana and Yosemite in California, have their own
lodges or cabins that take guests all winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out here on the ocean, we get rain when others get snow,''
said Ranger Wanda Moran at Acadia National Park on Mount Desert
Island in Maine. But when the park gets snow, as it did toward the
end of January, skiers can travel on the prized carriage roads,
where no vehicles are permitted in any season.
</P>
<P>
   All the parking lots in the park are plowed out, Moran said, and
these are accessible from a road called the park loop. For skiers,
a carriage road makes a six-mile circuit around Eagle Lake that is
easy to get to from Route 233. There is ice skating on the ponds
during a deep freeze (but check the ice, there are no warning
signs). Snowmobiles are permitted on most of the loop road.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwoods Campground, which has a hand pump for water, chemical
toilets and collection bins for refuse, is open all winter (free
till the ground thaws). There are no hookups, but there is a fire
ring at each site. The park's headquarters on Route 233 west of Bar
Harbor is open all winter, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., and provides
information on snow conditions: (207) 288-3338. The Web site is
www.nps.gov/acad.
</P>
<P>
   In Southwest Harbor, outside the park but on Mount Desert, the
Captain Bennett House, (207) 244-9627, a five-room
bed-and-breakfast, is busy ``far beyond what we expected,''
according to its new owners, Jim and Jackie Michaud. They have had
painters, rock-climbers, hikers and sightseers come to an area
filled with crowds in summer. The Web site is
www.captainbennett.com.
</P>
<P>
   As at Acadia, snow is a sometime thing at the Cape Cod National
Seashore. At the end of January, after three good falls, Michael E.
Whatley, a supervisory park ranger at the Salt Pond Visitor Center
in Eastham, said: ``It is spectacular on the beaches. You can hear
the breakers and see the bands of white snow on the dunes.'' But it
disappears fast, he said, noting that rangers often tell callers
they should get their skis on right away because the snow will be
gone in two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Bird-watching, hiking, star-gazing and nature walks are major
activities in the park, Whatley said. ``It is a time to see the
place in its historic perspective,'' he said. ``We are closer to
the life style of the original settlers at this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Pond center, (508) 255-3421, www.nps.gov/caco, is open
9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. all year, and can provide maps and guidance for
hikes, cross-country skiing or exploration of the swamps in the
preserve. The park itself is open till midnight, but the outdoor
water faucets are turned off in winter and toilets are not easy to
find.
</P>
<P>
   A valuable complement to the national seashore is the
state-maintained Cape Cod Rail Trail, a 25-mile former railroad
right-of-way running from Dennis to Wellfleet, with a spur going
south to Chatham. Almost perfectly flat, suitable for both
cross-country skiing and snowshoeing, this trail passes through
pines and oaks and along ponds.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel O'Brien of the State Department of Environmental
Management in Boston says that the trail is not used much in
winter, and since nothing motorized is permitted on it, it provides
quiet and solitude. There are a number of parking lots along the
trail but O'Brien says only the one at Nickerson State Park in
Brewster, about halfway along the trail, is plowed. From there, you
can ski, hike, skate, ride a horse, bike or use your wheelchair in
either direction.
</P>
<P>
   Information on snow conditions on the rail trail may be obtained
from Nickerson Park headquarters, (508) 896-3491.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Matrango, a ranger at Nickerson, said that his park
stocked its pond with landlocked salmon in December and January, as
well as trout, and that many visitors came to fish for these,
either from the shore or from motorboats.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area, between Cleveland
and Akron, was created only 25 years ago, and its winter programs,
mainly on the weekends, have been steadily increasing over the last
five to eight years, according to Karen Kopchak, the chief
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell people that if they can walk, they can snowshoe,''
Kopchak said. And the last weekend in January, she said, 100 people
came out for a winter festival. The park owns 100 pair of snowshoes
and rents them at $3 a pair a day. Rangers lead animal tracking
programs, tree identification walks and other expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The area's main feature is the Ohio &AMP; Erie Canal, with a 20-mile
reconstructed towpath. Cross-country skiers can enjoy the canal,
the locks and the Cuyahoga River.
</P>
<P>
   This coming weekend will include a family winter weekend, with
participants staying in two heated 60-bed dormitories in the park.
Meals are included, and there will be snowshoeing, a night hike and
a campfire. The cost is $55 or $35 for a child, with a maximum
family cost of $190.
</P>
<P>
   The dormitories, normally used for residential student programs,
are five miles north of Akron and 15 miles from Cleveland.
Information or registration: (330) 657-2796.
</P>
<P>
   A regular attraction in the park is ``Sherlock Bones,'' a ranger
disguised as a ``nature detective'' in a trenchcoat, pipe and
deerstalker hat. He is called in to solve mysteries for 3- to
5-year-olds, such as why did the leaves fall off the trees? Or, why
do salamanders move in groups?
</P>
<P>
   The park's winter activities are all listed on its Web site,
www.nps.gov/cuva. Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area,
Brecksville, Ohio 44141; (216) 650-4636.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone is ``another place'' in winter, Rick Hoeninghausen,
a spokesman for the park lodges, said. If you go to visit the
geysers, he said, you see wildlife, snow, ice and steam. Winter
also banishes the automobile blight from the park: except for one
road that dips into the northwest corner of the park, passing
Mammoth Hot Springs, Yellowstone's roads are traversable in winter
only by snowmobile or 10- or 15-passenger commercially operated
``snow coaches,'' closed, heated vehicles on tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the park and Amfac, the company that manages the
lodges, opened the second half of the 100-room Old Faithful Snow
Lodge. This lodge and the 95-room Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel are the
only wintertime lodging places in the park. The snow coaches will
pick up guests for the snow lodge at park entrances, or at Mammoth.
Or one can enter by snowmobile, which may mean towing a sled if
your suitcase is bigger than a breadbox.
</P>
<P>
   The snow lodge was built on the lines of a classic lodge, with a
two-story lobby, using timbers salvaged from buildings that were
being demolished. Two gas fireplaces are in the lobby, along with a
dining room and a fast-food place.
</P>
<P>
   The big activities at Yellowstone are cross-country skiing,
snowshoeing, hiking and snowmobiling. Snowmobiles are available for
rent at both hotels, along with clothing for the ride. Both lodges
have ski shops, which rent all kinds of snow and ski equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The basic room rates range from $51 a night for a room without
bath at Mammoth to $121 a night for a room at the snow lodge.
Two-night packages include things like an hour in a hot tub at
Mammoth, a snowmobile rental at either place, or a snow coach tour.
A snow coach round-trip from the West Yellowstone entrance costs
$79, so a package is worth looking at.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that the park continues its entrance fees
through the winter: $20 for a car, which can go only to Mammoth;
$15 for a snowmobile and $10 a person in a snow coach. The fees
cover a week's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone reservations are available at (307) 344-7311 and
www.travelyellowstone.com. Information on the park itself is at
(307)344-7381 and www.nps.gov/yell.
</P>
<P>
   Yosemite is a four-season park, with four-season lodgings.
Although winter is the slowest time, the great and high-priced 1927
Ahwahnee Lodge stays pretty much booked all winter, according to
Sherry Ward of the Yosemite Concession Corp., which operates the
park hotels.
</P>
<P>
   In winter, Scott Gediman, a park spokesman said, there is a
sharp drop in foreign tourists and most park visitors are from
California. It is a situation that means space for visitors, and
seeing the sequoia hung with snow is better than not seeing it at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The park's Badger Pass ski area offers Alpine skiing and
snowboarding, with four lifts, and there are three areas for Nordic
skiing and showshoeing: Badger Pass, Crane Flat and Mariposa Grove.
Gediman said that Badger Pass was always described as a family
area, not one in competition with Tahoe or similar high-style
resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Lodging is available at Curry Village, which has both wooden and
wood-floored canvas cabins, most of which are heated, for about $40
to $60 a night. There is a skating rink that rents skates. Above
are views of Half Dome, the granite monolith that is one of the
park's great hallmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers lead daily two-hour hikes for many levels; snowshoes are
rented for $3 a pair. The park publishes a 16-page quarterly guide.
For a copy, leave information on the park phone number, (209)
372-0200.
</P>
<P>
   Yosemite Lodge in the valley and the Wawona Hotel at the
southern part of the park offer winter packages that include ski
lift tickets. In midweek, a family of four pays $89 a night Sunday
to Thursday, not including holidays. Lodging only is $33.75 to $69
a night.
</P>
<P>
   Yosemite still has an admission charge in winter: $20 a vehicle
for seven days, or $10 a person. For lodging reservations: (559)
252-4848. Park information is also available at www.nps.gov/yose.

 &HT;    Police make search of Lewis' residence
 &HT;    By Joshua B. Good
 &HT;    and Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The Maryland home of Baltimore Ravens linebacker and
Buckhead double-murder suspect Ray Lewis was searched early today
by police, who confiscated several items.
</P>
<P>
   The officers from Atlanta and Baltimore County arrived at the
home around midnight and spent about three hours there, said Ronald
M. Cherry, Lewis' personal attorney. They could be seen carrying
large plastic containers and loading a computer into a van.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry said he could not comment on what police were looking for
or what was confiscated from the home in Owings Mills, in suburban
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The search came one week after two Decatur men were stabbed to
death in a Buckhead brawl after a night of Super Bowl partying.
Police charged Lewis, who had rented a Lincoln Navigator stretch
limousine that fled the stabbing scene, with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Thelimo driver may not have stopped to help the victims, but he
did drive to a nearby hotel to call police and tell them what he
had seen.
</P>
<P>
   What driver Duane Fassett said led Atlanta police to arrest
Lewis and charge him with two counts of murder.
</P>
<P>
   In a one-paragraph affidavit supporting their arrest warrant,
investigators said Lewis ``along with others did unlawfully and
with malice aforethought cause the death of Jacinth Baker and
Richard Lollar by punching, beating, and stabbing them with a sharp
object. This according to a witness who saw the entire incident.
The witness knows Mr. Lewis by name and sight and has known him for
over a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Atlanta homicide investigators remained in Baltimore Sunday
evening with no plans to leave ``until they get all the information
they need,'' said another investigator from the Criminal
Investigations Division.
</P>
<P>
   The detectives spoke to A.J. Johnson at his Laurel, Md.,
apartment late Friday, and Johnson, who was wanted for questioning
in connection with the killings, has hired an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   A second man wanted for questioning, Kwame King _ who played
high school football with Lewis in their hometown of Lakeland, Fla.
_ is still believed to be in Atlanta and may already have spoken to
homicide investigators, King's relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said last week they believed both men were inside Lewis'
limousine the morning of the stabbings.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has, through his lawyers, denied any involvement in the
slayings. Johnson has said that he was in Baltimore at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis should have been playing in his third Pro Bowl in Hawaii
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he gazed at his mother, grandmother and fiancee through
the thick glass during visiting day at the Atlanta City Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Elease McKinney, the football star's grandmother, vowed Sunday
to remain in the city until Lewis is released from jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only get to see him 20 minutes,'' McKinney said Sunday.
``He's in great spirits. He's happy to see us.''
</P>
<P>
   The three women see Lewis twice a week _ Wednesdays and Sundays.
They can't touch him. They can't hug him. They talk through a
telephone attached to the wall. The middle linebacker's children
have not been taken to the jail to see their father, McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   While Fassett has not spoken publically his friends said he had
no choice but to speed away from the corner where Baker and Lollar
were killed. Bullets were flying and Fassett, 51, could not stop to
help. Instead, he drove a 40-foot long Lincoln Navigator stretch
limousine as fast as he could to the Holiday Inn on Peachtree Road.
</P>
<P>
   Shots had been fired into the driver's side, at least five slugs
from a large caliber weapon, either a .44 or .45 gun, police have
said, and Fassett wasn't about to stick around.
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   In the back seats of the black limousine _ which includes four
TV's, VCRs, bars and a mirrored ceiling _ police said were NFL
football player Ray Lewis and at least seven of his friends. There
were also blood and knives, Atlanta police have said.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett's boss, Tony Toskov, defended his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sit down in that car. You see if you throw it into park or
drive when somebody starts shooting at ya','' Toskov said. As owner
of All Stretched Out Limo the Baltimore-based limousine rental
Toskov said he frequently did business with Lewis, a middle
linebacker with the Baltimore Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday Fassett's attorney David Irwin said his client has
given Atlanta police a lengthy statement. Erwin said he doubts
Fassett's account is the sole reason Lewis has been jailed on
murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a false assumption to make that he's a
star witness against Ray Lewis,'' Irwin said. ``He's told police
what he saw. And he's told police what he didn't see.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin would not divulge Fassett's description of the deadly
fight at the intersection of East Paces Ferry Road and Grandview
Avenue. The attorney, who also represented Linda Tripp, has been in
contact with Atlanta investigators and the Fulton County District
Attorney's Office. He said his client has not been asked to testify
before a grand jury about the fatal stabbings.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Fassett is not working as a result of the incident.
``(Fassett's) not making any money now. He's laying low,'' said
Toscov's brother Larry Toscov.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Lewis remains the only suspect to be arrested in the
deaths of 21-year-old Baker and 24-year-old Lollar.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McKinney, Lewis' grandmother, did not know whether he
would watch the Pro Bowl on TV Sunday evening. That's where her
grandson should have been instead of sitting in a small cell at the
city jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't even talk about that,'' said McKinney referring to
the Pro Bowl.

CULTIVATING SCHOLARS, EVEN IN THE SUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., N.H., Mass.)  (jw) 
 By PATRICIA COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ ``I don't know where this prejudice comes
from,'' that people cannot think unless there is snow on the
ground, Teresa Brennan says.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan teaches at Florida Atlantic University here, where the
average temperature this month dances in the 70s, the sun shines
most every day, and the beach is a mere three miles away. An
enthusiastic woman who looks a bit like Diane Keaton with red hair,
Brennan helped create the university's new doctoral program for
public intellectuals. The program is the first of its kind in the
country and has elicited a late-night monologue's worth of jokes
since it began last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot more palm trees on Florida Atlantic's campus
than public intellectuals,'' said an article in the Chronicle of
Higher Education, which included digs from a number of professors,
all of whom live north of the Mason-Dixon line. ``Can you imagine
`the Boca Raton intellectuals' exercising clout in the national
media?'' another article asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's intellectual snobbism,'' said one of the students,
Rose-Marie Donovan, 44, in Brennan's office on this state
university campus, a series of low-slung, beige blocks surrounded
by parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan left her job as an editor at a local weekly newspaper to
study the effect of fiction on society. She is one of 19 students
in the program working to become the nation's first licensed public
intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   Just what that means, however, is a subject of debate even among
the participants.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the writer or scholar without a vested interest,
speaking out in the public interest, is associated in the United
States with people like Lionel Trilling and Irving Howe, who helped
shape cultural life and political conversation in the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Today, public intellectuals tend to be academic celebrities,
professors who regularly write for magazines like The New Yorker or
television pundits who churn out opinions on topics from campaign
finance to ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   To many of the doctoral students here, however, the razor-thin
specialization of the scholar and the inch-deep expertise of the
journalist are a public intellectual's Scylla and Charybdis.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dottin, 31, who is something of an aspiring Charlie Rose
with hopes of having his own public-interest talk show, said he
wanted to ``speak effectively on a range of issues'' but also
``avoid what we see a lot of pundits do,'' abusing expertise by
knowing a single subject but speaking out on a dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Another student, Frances Chelland, said: ``This is not training
talking heads. That's exactly the thing I'm here to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Chelland, 50, took a two-year leave from her job as an assistant
professor of philosophy and gender studies at a college in New
Hampshire to enroll. She would like to organize training retreats
for teachers to discuss how to bridge what she called ``a deep
divide between ideas and action.''
</P>
<P>
   But can students maintain scholarly rigor at the same time they
speak on any number of topics? And is talking to a small group of
students and teachers sufficient to make the leap from plain old
intellectual to public intellectual?
</P>
<P>
   Dottin said having both breadth and depth was not easy, but, he
said: ``It's a character issue. We should only claim to know what
we know.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the size of the public, Chelland said: ``So what if it's
just my students? I'm contributing to an informed public.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan said Chelland's teacher training program was a model of
what a public intellectual should do. A professor of social theory
who has taught at Harvard and worked on Capitol Hill, she readily
admits that ``you can't train someone to be a public
intellectual.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she continued, ``you can make sure that what's in them that
wants to be isn't killed off'' by the demands of a single academic
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the program offers a wide mix of courses, on issues
from globalization to gender.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan argues that now there are many different kinds of
publics, and environmentalists, union organizers and museum
curators could all be considered public intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   K. Anthony Appiah agrees that the traditional definition has
been too narrow. One of the old-fashioned kind of public
intellectuals, Appiah teaches philosophy at Harvard, writes for The
New York Review of Books, and writes and edits books. He was in
Boca Raton to give a lecture on race and identity to the graduate
students. He forgot a tie, so he bought one, with pictures of
swimming blue swordfish, at the Radisson Hotel gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   To Appiah, new technology is transforming the idea of the
public, not to mention who is considered an intellectual. ``When
you create a certain conversation on the Web, you create a
community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A public intellectual should be what one does, not what one
is,'' he continued. ``It would be wonderful if in a democracy,
everyone could do it for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the students do fit the more traditional definition of an
intellectual, however, is in their passion, a do-gooder sensibility
and willingness to pay _ nearly $13,000 a year for an out-of-state
student, $3,500 for a Florida resident _ for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan says there is one promise she makes prospective
students: ``This is one program which will not get you a job.''

HARVARD SCIENTIST DEFENDS GENE THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The widening debate over the safety of gene therapy has
been fueled by ``an amazing series of events'' that are essentially
unrelated, and shouldn't lead to shutting down human clinical
trials without cause, says a Harvard scientist and longtime leader
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mulligan, a former MIT and Whitehead Institute biologist
who now heads the Harvard Gene Therapy Initiative, has been a voice
of caution in taking gene therapy to human patients, and has
worried that undue haste could not only harm volunteers but
discredit the field.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday Mulligan said he was surprised that Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center had decided to suspend a trial of gene
therapy in hemophilia patients that appears to have been running
smoothly and had been given a recent federal green light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think a moratorium on gene therapy experiments is
warranted at this point,'' said Mulligan, who has no oversight in
the medical center's research and said he had little information
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he added, ``The silver lining of (the debate) is
that it will help reset the course of research.'' Starting with an
unexpected patient death last fall, the episode ``definitely opened
up a wound that probably needed to be opened up: that is, to more
carefully define the goals for the field and how to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   The aim of gene therapy is to treat diseases by replacing
malfunctioning genes in cells or adding new genes to cells that
direct them to make a healthly protein that is missing or abnormal.
Many rare diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, are caused by a single
mutant gene, while more common ones like cancer and heart disease
involve many altered genes and environmental factors.
</P>
<P>
   The snowballing controversy was touched off by the death last
September of an 18-year-old volunteer in a gene therapy trial
headed by Dr. James Wilson of the University of Pennsylvania.
Wilson was a postdoctoral fellow in Mulligan's laboratory at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Following the patient's death, federal investigators reported a
number of flaws in the Penn researchers' conduct of the trial,
including failing to completely inform patients about the risks and
benefits and omitting mention of monkey deaths in preclinical
studies.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, officials of the National Institutes of Health
revealed that more than 600 instances of ``adverse events'' in gene
therapy trials had not been reported to an NIH advisory committee.
Among the events were the deaths of three terminally ill gene
therapy volunteers at Beth Israel Deaconess, which hospital
officials say were unrelated to the therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting to the central issues, Mulligan said Monday in an
interview, the death at Penn really stemmed from ``poor conduct''
in a clinical trial; it was not essentially a gene therapy failure.
And the failure to report adverse events to the NIH, he said, was
more because of confusion about the requirements than an intent to
conceal problems. Mulligan said it was highly unlikely that there
was ``an organized conspiracy'' of hundreds of scientists to flout
the reporting requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at everything, it's an amazing series of events
that are somewhat unrelated,'' Mulligan said, and doesn't suggest
that gene therapy research is shoddy and poorly regulated.
</P>
<P>
   The suspended trial at Beth Israel Deaconess was to have
involved 12 patients with hemophilia, the bleeding disorder caused
by a genetic lack of an enzyme that is crucial to blood clotting.
Unlike the trial at Penn, this one didn't rely on bioengineered
viruses carrying genes into the body. Instead, the researchers
removed a small sample of skin cells, grew them into millions in
the laboratory, and inserted the new genes using an electric shock
to open the cells.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a hypodermic syringe-full of the modified cells was
injected into tissue inside the abdomen. The genes caused the cells
to produce the missing enzyme, called factor VIII.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was sponsored by Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. of
Cambridge, which developed the method. It is known as ``ex vivo''
gene therapy because the gene transfer is performed outside the
body, in contrast with ``in vivo'' therapy when genes are inserted
into cells inside the body.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Kevin Kelley, a product manager at New England Biolabs in
Beverly whose son has hemophilia, said he has closely followed this
and other gene therapy experiments in hemophiliac volunteers, and
was mystified by the suspension of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Transkaryotic Therapies ex vivo method, said Kelley, ``is
far and away the safest approach being developed.'' He added that
the company's scientists, as well as the researchers at Beth Israel
Deaconess, ``have been amazingly concerned with patients' safety.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any good reason why this trial should be stopped''
if there have been no safety problems, Kelley said.``If it's a
political or public relations move, it's going to cause more alarm
than reassurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulligan, who was a pioneer in modifying viruses to carry genes
into cells 20 years ago, is based at Children's Hospital and heads
what he calls a ``virtual gene therapy'' in which investigators
from Harvard Medical School and its affiliated hospitals
participate.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has no ``gatekeeper'' function regarding gene therapy
trials that are now in progress, but that the Gene Therapy
Initiative he heads is planning to set up an ``organized activity''
to oversee gene therapy research throughout the Harvard system.

HARVARD UNIVERSITY SAYS IT'S WILLING TO HELP RESCUE HMO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX AND LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Harvard University _ which lent its brand name 30 years
ago to the health plan that became Harvard Pilgrim Health Care _
has told the Massachusetts attorney general it's interested in
helping rescue its brainchild by loaning the HMO millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard officials and other sources confirmed Monday the
university's interest in a proposal to keep ``the Harvard plan''
nonprofit through a money-raising deal involving major Boston
teaching hospitals, the data processing company Perot Systems, and
other investors.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University has a near $15 billion endowment, but it
wasn't clear if its investment would come from the college's
endowment, from borrowings, or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, further details about the plan began to emerge as
potential investors received packets of financial data from the
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   During a press briefing Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly said
his office has decided that investors will not be allowed a seat on
Harvard Pilgrim's board of directors or have any voting rights _
conditions he previously declined to outline. Investors are being
asked to lend money in exchange for IOUs called ``surplus notes,''
or surplus bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surplus bonds don't carry with them the right to manage
Harvard Pilgrim,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said that he would place additional conditions on the
deal that would prohibit investing hospitals from receiving special
treatment from the HMO. Some smaller hospitals fear that major
contributors to Harvard Pilgrim's rehabilitation would get perks
ranging from seats on the board to more favorable hospital payment
rates to referral relationships that would funnel more Harvard
Pilgrim patients to certain hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as HMO contracts go, this is one that will get quite a
bit of scrutiny,'' said Insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt, the
court-appointed receiver of Harvard Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from both Harvard University and Perot Systems
attended a meeting at a downtown law firm on Saturday, where
investment bankers hired by the state pitched a rescue plan to
potential investors, people familiar with the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Dr. Robert Ebert, then dean of Harvard Medical School,
persuaded the university to lend its imprimatur to the fledgling
Harvard Community Health Plan, New England's first prepaid health
plan, or health maintenance organization. At the time it was a
controversial experiment, much criticized by physicians in the
traditional fee-for-service system. But eventually the Harvard plan
grew by a succession of mergers and aggressive marketing into the
region's largest HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Its growth ultimately was its undoing. On January 3, Harvard
Pilgrim discovered unexpected 1999 losses, forcing state officials
to put the giant HMO into receivership and launch a search for ways
to prevent its liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   Perot Systems, another potential investor in the Harvard Pilgrim
rescue proposal, signed a $700 million, 10-year contract with the
HMO last year to overhaul its disorganized computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of the fragility of the deal and the
uncertainty about who will sign on, Reilly said two other options
are still on the table: the sale of Harvard Pilgrim to a for-profit
insurance company, and liquidation. Proposals are due by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One hospital executive who attended last Saturday's three-hour
meeting said it was unclear whether there will be enough takers to
make the proposed deal viable. ``I honestly don't know,'' he said.
``I think everybody is back at the ranch trying to figure out
whether it makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The core of the proposed plan to keep Harvard Pilgrim nonprofit
is an infusion of cash from investors in exchange for ``surplus
notes.'' It was not clear how much the attorney general is asking
investors to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   These loans would need to be supplemented by a sale of some or
all of the 14 health center buildings that Harvard Pilgrim owns and
leases to Harvard Vanguard, a medical group. A bond issue to effect
this sale, which was cancelled last month when the HMO went into
receivership, was scheduled to raise $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   As explained by state regulators, the tax-exempt, long-term
surplus notes would bear high interest rates to compensate
investors for the high degree of risk involved, and for the fact
that such notes cannot be sold to others, unlike conventional
bonds. Also, bond holders would get repaid only if Harvard Pilgrim
has a surplus, which the HMO would build into its revenues _ that
is, the money it takes from subscribers in premiums.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is advantageous to Harvard Pilgrim because the money it
raised would be counted ``as part of the company's surplus,'' said
Ruthardt, rather than as part of the HMO's debt.
</P>
<P>
   However, the state insurance commissioner would have to monitor
Harvard Pilgrim's finances on an ongoing basis and approve any
interest payments on the surplus notes, based on her assessment of
the health plan's fiscal health.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the conclusion of the weekend we should know where we stand
_ whether there is a viable non-profit option or not, and what the
sales options are,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that beginning next week Harvard Pilgrim will
consolidate its employees in two locations, Wellesley and Quincy,
for an annual savings of $8 million. They now work out of six
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly and Ruthardt said they approved Harvard Pilgrim's plan to
finish construction on the Quincy building in the Crown Colony II
office park. The moves will be completed in August.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, the Ad Hoc Committee to Defend Health
Care, a Cambridge-based group opposed to stockholder-owned health
care companies, accused Cigna Healthcare, one of the potential
buyers of Harvard Pilgrim, of censoring newsletters that the
for-profit HMO sends to its subscribers employed by the Phillip
Morris Co., which makes cigarettes among other products.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Ad Hoc Committee said they learned from company
emails produced as part of lawsuits against tobacco firms that
Cigna consulted Phillip Morris about references to smoking in
articles about asthma, heart disease, pregnancy, and other health
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Cigna representatives could not be reached for comment.

THERE'S NO STOPPING THIS TIGER

   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Under the ceiling of gray air that
covered the Monterey Peninsula Monday, he stood in the final
fairway, 2-iron in hand, 231 yards of golf's most historic real
estate to cover, and cast a casual eye at the numbers on the
leaderboard behind the 18th green. Tiger Woods had not an ounce of
doubt in his mind that he would make a birdie on the last hole and
prove once again that with him, all things are possible on a golf
course.
</P>
<P>
   With that birdie on the 72d hole, Woods capped another
miraculous finish: He played the last four holes in 4 under par,
shot a 31 on Pebble Beach's demanding last nine holes, in the
process erasing a seven-shot deficit in the last seven holes to
capture the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am tournament.
</P>
<P>
   His final-round 8-under-par 64 gave him his sixth straight win
on the PGA Tour, a streak that has commanded the sports spotlight,
though Woods has paid little heed to the commotion. He did,
however, smile and shake his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is more intriguing, no doubt about it,'' said Woods,
whose bogey-free final round put him at 15 under, two shots clear
of PGA Tour rookie Matt Gogel and Vijay Singh. With six straight
wins, Woods ties the second-longest streak in PGA history, that of
legendary Ben Hogan in 1948. Byron Nelson's feat of 11 wins in a
row in 1945, generally considered unbeatable, suddenly seems within
range. Woods plays at the Buick Invitational in San Diego this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Woods had started the day five shots off the lead and walked to
the first tee with one thing in mind: ``I thought I needed to shoot
64 to give myself a chance.'' Woods wanted to make early birdies to
put some fear into those golfers ahead of him, Gogel and Mark
Brooks, both at 12 under. Instead, it was the unheralded Gogel,
playing just his fourth event as a member of the PGA Tour, who
bolted from the starting blocks, making birdies at the first three
holes. When Gogel birdied the par-5 sixth and par-3 seventh, he was
17 under, making the turn in 31.
</P>
<P>
   Woods made three birdies going out, but a cool putter again
frustrated him as he lost ground to Gogel. ``But I know how
difficult it is to win out here,'' said Woods, who at that point
was 10 under and facing the teeth of Pebble Beach, holes 8-10. So
even when he went par-par-par, he knew there was still time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never over till it's over,'' said Woods. ``I just had to
be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   When he birdied the par-3 12th, he had it to 11 under, ``and I
figured if I could somehow get to 14 or 15, I might get myself a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though he possesses unmatched talents, Woods needed
help. He got it in the form of a young golfer who was feeling PGA
Tour pressure for the first time. Gogel got through Pebble's
toughest stretch at 17 under, but then went bogey-bogey at the 11th
and 12th. As he was doing this, Woods was doing what he routinely
does: electrifying the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   On a simple 97-yard second shot to the par-4 15th _ perhaps
Pebble Beach's most routine hole _ Woods choked down on a pitching
wedge and took dead aim. The man who can swing a club more
ferociously than most mortals feathered the shot, landing the ball
less than a foot right of the hole. It checked nicely, then made a
left-hand turn into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   The eagle had landed, and the roar of the crowd let Gogel, three
holes away, know that the Tiger had finally jump-started his round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised that went in,'' said Woods. ``It was one
of those things where you are trying to get it close and leave
yourself a putt at birdie.''
</P>
<P>
   The eagle made him 13 under, and for the first time all day, his
name was the closest to Gogel's.
</P>
<P>
   The game was on. Unfortunately for Gogel, it is a game that no
one is capable of playing quite like the 24-year-old Woods, who
marched to the 16th tee and unleashed another of his massive
drives. He was left with just 114 yards in, the wedge was again in
his hand, and only one thing was in his focus: the pin.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you,'' said Woods, ``I actually hit a better
shot on 16. The shot I wanted, the shape I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   It hit a foot in front of the pin, nearly rolled in, and settled
in tap-in range. He was 14 under and just one shot behind.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit disappeared quietly as Woods walked to the 18th tee.
Gogel had made a bogey at the 15th to fall to 14 under, a score
that got posted on the leaderboard as Woods walked to his drive
some 312 yards down the left side of the final fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he never considered the score, never thought of
anything other than attacking the 18th green. Most of the world's
greatest golfers play Pebble's 18th as a three-shot hole, but most
of the world's greatest golfers lack Woods's tenacity. He rifled
his shot into the cool air but didn't hit it pure. It came to rest
on the slope that fronts the green.
</P>
<P>
   His chip to 4 feet set up his sixth birdie of the day, put the
finishing touches on the 64, and put the pressure squarely on
Gogel, who for the first time all day did not see his name atop the
leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what I had to do,'' said Gogel. ``I was swinging the
golf club so well.''
</P>
<P>
   But not well enough. He came off the bogey at 15 and made par at
16. Then, at the par-3 17th, Gogel's birdie attempt came up one
roll short. At the 18th, with Woods standing greenside, Gogel had
an uphill birdie putt from about 12 feet that could have forced a
playoff. It never had a chance. ``I misread it,'' said Gogel, who
then carelessly missed the comebacker to make a bogey 6, completing
an incoming 40.
</P>
<P>
   A stunning turn of events, to be sure, but nothing out of the
ordinary for Woods, who got a paycheck of $720,000. In his brief
but spectacular pro career, his earnings are up to $12,557,128, but
that figure does not make him blink. History is what he is after,
and next week he takes his quest to San Diego.

   The eagle made him 13 under, and for the first time all day, his
name was the closest to Gogel's.
</P>
<P>
   The game was on. Unfortunately for Gogel, it is a game that no
one is capable of playing quite like the 24-year-old Woods, who
marched to the 16th tee and unleashed another of his massive
drives. He was left with just 114 yards in, the wedge was again in
his hand, and only one thing was in his focus: the pin.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you,'' said Woods, ``I actually hit a better
shot on 16. The shot I wanted, the shape I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   It hit a foot in front of the pin, nearly rolled in, and settled
in tap-in range. He was 14 under and just one shot behind.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit disappeared quietly as Woods walked to the 18th tee.
Gogel had made a bogey at 15 to fall to 14 under, a score that got
posted on the leaderboard as Woods walked to his drive some 312
yards down the left side of the final fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he never considered the score, never thought of
anything other than attacking the 18th green. Most of the world's
greatest golfers play Pebble's 18th as a three-shot hole, but most
of the world's greatest golfers lack Woods's tenacity. He rifled
his shot into the cool air but didn't hit it pure. It came to rest
on the slope that fronts the green.
</P>
<P>
   His chip to 4 feet set up his sixth birdie of the day, put the
finishing touches on the 64, and put the pressure squarely on
Gogel, who for the first time all day did not see his name atop the
leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what I had to do,'' said Gogel. ``I was swinging the
golf club so well.''
</P>
<P>
   But not well enough. He came off the bogey at 15 and made par at
16. Then, at the par-3 17th, Gogel's birdie attempt came up one
roll short. At the 18th, with Woods standing greenside, Gogel had
an uphill birdie putt from about 12 feet that could have forced a
playoff. It never had a chance. ``I misread it,'' said Gogel, who
then carelessly missed the comebacker to make a bogey 6, completing
an incoming 40.
</P>
<P>
   A stunning turn of events, to be sure, but nothing out of the
ordinary for Woods, who got a paycheck of $720,000. In his brief
but spectacular pro career, his earnings are up to $12,557,128, but
that figure does not make him blink. History is what he is after,
and next week he takes his quest to San Diego.

<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia _ Yugoslavia's defense minister was shot and
killed Monday night when unidentified gunmen fired automatic
weapons through the windows of a Belgrade soccer club where he was
eating, the Belgrade police said.
</P>
<P>
   The minister, Pavle Bulatovic, 51, was from Montenegro and was a
close ally of Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic. Bulatovic
had been defense minister since 1998 and previously from 1993-1996
and had served earlier as interior minister.
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic was an important member of Milosevic's allied party in
Montenegro, the Socialist People's Party.
</P>
<P>
   The party is now in opposition in Montenegro, Serbia's sister
republic, which is led by Western-leaning president Milo
Djukanovic. Djukanovic has become an outspoken opponent of
Milosevic and has supported an eventual referendum on Montenegro's
independence from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear why Bulatovic, a relatively colorless figure
with a low profile in Belgrade, might have been assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   His killing bore the hallmarks of a gangland-style murder, like
many of the political killings in Belgrade that have never been
solved. It came just one month after the Serbian paramilitary and
criminal leader, Zeljko Raznatovic, also known as Arkan, was shot
dead after eating dinner in a Belgrade hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The police say that they have captured most of those responsible
for that killing but that the organizers of the deed remain at
large. More than a dozen prominent people, some close to Milosevic,
have been killed in Belgrade in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Montenegro noted that Bulatovic was considered an
important player in the tense relationship between Serbia and
Montenegro. During the NATO bombing war against Yugoslavia last
year, he pushed for a more robust Yugoslav military intervention in
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   They also suggested Monday evening that Bulatovic had been
active in organizing military police that could be used in any
clash between Milosevic's Yugoslavia, which has up to 12,000 troops
in Montenegro, and Serbia's sister republic, where Djukanovic has
built up an equal number of well-armed police, a quasi-military of
his own.
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic was a fierce critic of Djukanovic and was active in
organizing pro-Milosevic local assemblies in northern Montenegro,
an area that Belgrade has hinted could secede if Montenegro
declared independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government, which met in a special session Monday
night after the killing, sent condolences to Bulatovic's family and
said in a statement that he ``was the victim of a classic terrorist
act'' and urged the launching of a fight against such terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government gives full support to the relevant
state organs in their uncompromising struggle against terrorism,''
the statement said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bulatovic often ate at the restaurant of the soccer club Rad,
near the military clinic where he was pronounced dead. His two
companions _ banker Vuk Obradovic and restaurant owner Mirko
Knezevic _ were wounded. They were sitting at a corner table when
the gunmen, apparently standing on the soccer field outside, fired
through the windows just before 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Ljubisa Mitrovic, the editor-in-chief of the independent
Montenegrin newspaper Vjesti, said Monday night that Bulatovic
``was another victim from Milosevic's inner circle, another in a
series of murders whose motives are not clear but were obviously
well-planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic is no direct relation to Momir Bulatovic, the Yugoslav
prime minister and leader of the Socialist People's Party. But the
two men became friendly while working together at a newspaper in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic was also a close relative of an important member of
the Belgrade criminal world, Darko Asanin, who was killed two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic was born in the Montenegrin village of Gornji Rovci in
the northern part of the coastal republic. He was trained as an
economist, was married and had three children.

   KEYES RULES OUT McCAIN: Alan Keyes said Monday that if Sen. John
McCain won the Republican presidential nomination he would not
support him because, in his view, McCain was not unequivocally
opposed to abortion. ``Anyone who votes for John McCain betrays the
pro-life call,'' Keyes said in a speech at the National Press Club
in Washington.

   FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY IN RACE: A month after he resigned as U.S.
attorney for New Mexico, where he won an indictment of the nuclear
scientist Wen Ho Lee on security charges, John J. Kelly announced
on Sunday that he intended to seek the Democratic nomination for
the 1st congressional District, which is largely the Albuquerque
metropolitan area. Kelly, who is 52 and a native of Albany, N.Y.,
joins a field that includes three other announced primary

BUSH INSISTS HE IS THE REAL REFORMER, QUESTIONS MCCAIN'S
`RESULTS'

 By JIM YARDLEY with FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. _ Signaling a new, aggressive tone to his campaign
Monday, Gov. George W. Bush proclaimed that he was the true
reformer in the Republican field and portrayed his chief opponent,
Sen. John McCain, as someone who ``says one thing and does
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain has been wearing the reform mantle throughout
his campaign, Bush on Monday called himself ``a reformer with
results'' and pointed to his record as the governor of Texas on
issues like education, taxes and civil justice to justify the
claim.
</P>
<P>
   And in the wake of his 18-point loss to McCain in the New
Hampshire primary, he conceded that he had failed to define himself
in the eyes of voters there and asserted that McCain distorted his
proposed tax cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got defined,'' Bush said at a news conference. ``Those days
are over with. You can cut it any way you want, but I'm going to
take it to him, I'm going to take it to him. I'm not going to let
this happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   In a swing through Delaware the day before the state's
Republican primary, Bush used the news conference to raise
questions about McCain's credentials as an agent of reform, and
criticized him for accepting campaign contributions from lobbyists
for companies that have business before the Senate Commerce
Committee, which McCain heads.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, citing a news report but not giving its source, claimed
that the Arizona senator had received ``more money than anybody''
from Washington lobbyists. ``On the one hand he preaches campaign
finance reform. On the other hand he passes the plate,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington said
campaign finance records through the first three quarters of 1999
indicated that Bush received almost five times as much money from
lobbyists and their immediate families as McCain. His aides later
explained that Bush was referring to a report in The Wall Street
Journal that said that among the candidates, McCain had the highest
percentage of total campaign contributions from lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's escalating fight with McCain has also been reflected over
the airwaves in South Carolina, the site of the next major
Republican primary, on Feb. 19. On Friday, Bush began running a
commercial that accused McCain of distorting elements of the
governor's tax cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   And Monday, McCain, using the harshest language of any political
ad so far this political season, began running an ad accusing Bush
of negative campaigning. The spot ends with the line: ``Do we
really want another politician in the White House America can't
trust?''
</P>
<P>
   That prompted a response from Bush's spokesman Ari Fleischer,
who said: ``Suggesting that Gov. Bush is as dishonest as Bill
Clinton is a disservice to our party and our principles. Our nation
has been through enough and John McCain's ad has gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Bush's stinging loss in New Hampshire and his sagging
poll numbers in South Carolina, Bush spent the weekend in Texas,
where he and his aides plotted a response to McCain's rising
popularity. The new theme became quickly evident as Bush arrived at
a luncheon sponsored by local Republican officials in Dover _ and
it was strikingly similar to McCain's campaign hallmarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Reformer with Results,'' announced a large blue and white
sign. Bush also shortened and revised his stump speech, leaving
more time for questions and answers, which the campaign dubbed
``One on One'' sessions. Again and again, Bush described himself as
a reformer, always careful to add the phrase ``with results.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as Bush and his campaign struck out in a slightly new
direction, they kept one wheel on the old track.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign announced Monday that the Texas governor's parents
would be back out on the campaign trail this week. Former President
Bush has one event scheduled in Michigan on Tuesday and and three
on Wednesday; Barbara Bush has three appearances scheduled in
Virginia on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Their appearance with the governor at a rally three days before
the New Hampshire primary was widely criticized by political
strategists and even a few people affiliated with the Bush campaign
as an ill-conceived publicity stunt that fed notions that Bush was
trying to inherit, not earn, the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It did not help that Bush spoke for just a few minutes, making
no case for himself other than his bloodline. Additionally, his
father's reference to him as his ``boy'' arguably diminished the
governor's stature.
</P>
<P>
   Bush advisers said there had been top-level discussions about
the wisdom of using the former president and first lady as
surrogate campaigners, and that the consensus was that the couple
should no longer appear with the governor, but remained useful
campaigners on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a net plus,'' said one adviser, alluding to the
couple's popularity in many key states. ``It also helps up
establish ourselves as the alternative to Clinton by reminding
people: This is what you had.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few Republican strategists said that the Bush campaign was
playing a dangerous game with its use of surrogates and its parade
of endorsements, essentially urging voters to support Bush simply
because so many other people do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten to the point where the issue of Bush's gravitas
and abilities as a candidate are the driving issues of the
campaign,'' said one strategist. ``Having his parents work for him
doesn't address those.''
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance here Monday, Bush, while not using the word
hypocrite to describe his opponent, criticized the senator for
making campaign finance the centerpiece of his campaign while
taking contributions from lobbyists with business before his
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're tired of no results and simple, empty rhetoric,''
Bush told the lunch crowd, ``If you're tired of people who say one
thing and do another, come join our team.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain chose not to campaign in Delaware, focusing his resources
on South Carolina. Bush is the favorite in Delaware, where his main
challenger is Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's luncheon, the governor sought to highlight McCain's
absence, saying: ``I look forward to going to every primary.''

MICHELE SAVOIA'S TIME HAS COME 
</HEADLINE>
   UNIFORMS BY DE LA RENTA(jw) 
THE LINK TO GLAMOUR   
 By GINIA BELLAFANTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For 16 years Michele Savoia has been sewing
custom-made suits for men in the manner of those worn during the
1940s. For just as many years, most of his adult life in fact, he
has longed for a return to midcentury civility.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see people out at night in T-shirts that say things on
them,'' he lamented from his East Village studio and shop. ``They
were out all day in those T-shirts, and that's what you're sitting
next to in a restaurant. It's unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   There is not a huge following for the kind of anachronistic
wide-bodied clothes Savoia makes. Still, the tailor, who was
trained by his Sicilian grandfather and at the Fashion Institute of
Technology, has made a living assembling suits for men who compete
in dance competitions.
</P>
<P>
   He has outfitted the cast of the Broadway musical ``Swing,'' as
well as the occasional soul who wants very little to do with
anything one might find in a Banana Republic.
</P>
<P>
   After years of working quietly removed from fashion's circle,
Savoia had his moment on Thursday morning when he presented the
first show of his career, under the tents in Bryant Park. The
audience raved as dancers and a Frank Sinatra impersonator and even
Dominic Chianese (Uncle Junior from ``The Sopranos'') paraded down
the runway in Savoia's masterly cut trousers and jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Savoia emerged from backstage with tears in his eyes. ``I think
fashion is finally cathing up with me,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNIFORMS BY DE LA RENTA
</P>
<P>
   It is fairly certain that when an appointed commission met to
examine police corruption in New York, no one suggested creating
new uniforms for officers to ensure their superior behavior. Things
are apparently different in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, Oscar de la Renta, who shows his fall 2000
women's wear collection on Tuesday, was asked by the country's
chief of police to design a new look for the law enforcers of the
Dominican Republic. The police force in that country, where de la
Renta keeps an oft-visited home, is being revamped in the wake of
corruption scandals that led to the firing of thousands of
officers.
</P>
<P>
   De la Renta, who is not being paid for his designs, says that
Dominicans are seeking a police force that is more civic-minded
than it has been in the past. The old uniforms were gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dark gray was a threatening color,'' de la Renta
explained. His uniforms will be less elaborate and more functional,
he said, adding that he is paring down on gold medals and ``things
one associates with a Latin American police.''
</P>
<P>
   His uniforms will be navy blue and white, ``more pleasing to the
eye,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, it is hoped, less intimidating to Dominican citizens.
</P>
<P>
   THE LINK TO GLAMOUR
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of what is done today on the Web is done by kids in
their teens and 20s who have no sense of aesthetic offline.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the words of Terron Schaefer, long out of his 20s, who
worked for 10 years as an advertising executive before moving into
marketing and helping to revamp Bloomingdale's, Macy's and Harrods.
(``They were selling Tampax and toilet paper on the first floor
when I arrived,'' he said of Harrods.)
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, at a party at the Four Seasons, he unleashed his
latest venture, Style365.com, a Web site that sells nothing but
links users to prescreened sites selling what, in Schaefer's view,
is the best of everything.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer is a man of impressive connections. His site has been
designed by the legendary graphic designer Massimo Vignelli. Its
board of advisers includes Frank Gehry; Joyce Ma, a Hong Kong
retailer; and Lady Victoria Waymouth, a British interior designer.
</P>
<P>
   If one clicks on the fashion category on Style365, one is
connected to the Web sites of houses like Yves Saint Laurent,
rather than houses like the Club Monaco. A food search links to a
Parisian bakery, Boulangerie Poilane, that for $37 will send its
famed sourdough bread.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer refers to the site as ``a finishing school.'' Rather
than flashing banner ads, he offers glamorous advertising images
shot by people like Bruce Weber, which, he hopes, will keep eyes
lingering longer. &QL;

 NOW, EVEN REBELS ARE LOOKING LADYLIKE  (ART ADV: Photo NYT20 is
being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers can make
individual purchase by calling (888) 603-1036.) 
(jw) 
 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Until now, the difference between being a lady and
dressing like a lady was usually a drag queen. The whole notion of
dressing up had degenerated into such a parody, a freak show of
Upper-East-Side-luncheon-suit gaiety, that only a few designers
would try it. But after last season's tony Prada show, and with a
new generation of women dressing like their mothers, even their
grandmothers, it's apparently safe again to be a lady.
</P>
<P>
   What's remarkable about this flowering of chic understatement
and such formerly stodgy details as piping and covered buttons is
that it isn't confined to the predictable designers, like Carolina
Herrera and Victor Alfaro, although they are firmly in the groove.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoon, in the opening round of the women's fall
2000 collections, Susan Cianciola abandoned her art-house
wanderings into the meaning of seams and put on a real show, with
models and clothes that were as much about technique as the
innately feminine world of dressing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that I had to take everything I had done before and
throw it into the garbage,'' Cianciola said.
</P>
<P>
   And that night, in a community theater on the Lower East Side,
Miguel Adrover, whose collection last season made him the new
designer to watch this week, put on a brilliant show. It, too,
presented a more polished view of clothes, although Adrover, being
still young and ornery and poor, is too much of a rebel to fall
into conventional traps.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway into his show he sent out an elegantly cut coat made of
mattress ticking. It was stained with water marks and patched in
places with squares of the same fabric, and was buttoned over a
skirt of cotton shirting stripes, so that it looked like a simple
but respectable Sunday-going-to-church outfit out of a Willa Cather
story.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, afterward, when Adrover sweetly explained that the source
for the ticking had been a mattress that had belonged to his
neighbor, the recently deceased writer Quentin Crisp, the coat
suddenly acquired a macabre dimension. Having once absorbed the
shocks of life as a mattress, what future delights would it hold as
a chic town coat?
</P>
<P>
   Adrover put a lot of himself into this collection. One could see
that. For instance, he took an ordinary navy sweatshirt and a
couple of Yankee baseball caps and ingeniously worked the hats into
the shoulders of the sweatshirt, so that the model had these
built-up looking shoulders, except that they had NY's on them.
Wonderful. He made a similar play with a Burberry raincoat, turning
it inside out and around, so that the label was in front. But the
upshot was not a backward-looking Burberry or another avant-garde
instance of deconstructing a luxury label. It was, rather, a
beautifully finished dress.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Adrover's clothes _ the high-neck Princess Leia
blouses and pencil-thin plaid coats, the dresses in tea-stained
decorator fabric and a poncho made of reversed pieces of the
Burberry tartan loosely connected by scarf fringe _ demonstrate
that he wants to be taken seriously as a designer. ``I don't want
to end up with samples hanging in my closet,'' he said. ``I want to
sell clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cianciola's collection was a bit harder to follow, although it
may be a matter of looking more closely at the details _ the
delicate, almost invisible fraying on a turned-back cuff, or the
hand-stitching on a coat-and-skirt ensemble _ and getting beyond
the overall impression of 1950s, tearoom dowdiness. The results of
Cianciola's desire to change direction, to explore construction,
may be a case of the emperor's new clothes. But she is right to
move on.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the kind of people who sought out her influential
arts-and-crafts ideas, fellow artists and downtown style seekers,
will likely only be satisfied with sophistication on their own
offbeat terms. And that could be something as coyly wholesome as a
belted olive jumper over a black jersey top etched with beads.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any irony in the new ``new dressing,'' it is how
someone like Miuccia Prada or, for that matter, Adrover, can take a
formerly frumpy style like an A-line skirt or a classic town coat
and make it look cool and young, while designers known for ladylike
clothes haven't completely broken out of the old formulas.
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot to admire in Richard Tyler's collection Monday,
shown in his town house overlooking Gramercy Park: the boned
jackets and sharply cut trousers in faded chalk-striped navy; the
elegant, portrait-collared wool tops that fit the body like a tight
T-shirt; a sturdy brown herringbone coat playfully embroidered with
wisps of feathers; and a tunic made of tiles of pieced-together
brown leather.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, what has become of the light, frisky hand of Richard
Tyler? As sexy as his tailoring was _ and Tyler knows better than
most how to cut a suit or a pair of pants _ the clothes, often in
matchy-matchy combinations, lacked that loose, offhand edge that
separates modern ladylike dressing from the old uptight variety.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Herrera could have loosened things up a little, too,
but just a little. Her show Monday opened with slim belted coats in
black wool and leather, and dark pants suits with ultratight,
three-quarter-sleeved tops. There was a conspicuous richness in the
materials _ gray flannel, boucle mixed with georgette, broadtail
with chiffon _ and a familiar sense of Herrera's relaxed chic,
notably in a black merino sweater with wide mink cuffs and a cowl,
shown with sleek black wool pants.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also a self-consciousness about the clothes, as if
they had been studied too long _ a correctness that might have been
softened with humor and attitude that says, ``Let's not take any of
this chic business too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bill Blass was one designer who knew how to do that _ and no
self-consciously hip red-leather A-line skirts with dipping
waistlines for him. Make it light, babe.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Alfaro put on a good, cool show on Sunday. His slinky
velour trousers in abstract checks and snug leather jackets evoke a
skinny socialite of the 1970s era, Lee Radziwill twirling the food
around on her plate and eating nothing; thin women who liked
chain-link belts and poor-boy sweaters and who could see the charm
in a black corduroy coat piped in kelly green, with a chain belt
looping in and out, as they went skipping through the bright, neon
stimulation of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Catherine Malandrino sent out cute pieces like gauzy,
bead-embroidery shirts, argyle sweaters in vivid shades of magenta
and violet, and fuzzy mohair tops with leather hot pants. But as
outfits they added up to a shuddering mess.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Cooper, an Australian designer making his first appearance
on the New York catwalks, showed halter-style jumpsuits, fuzzy
vests over slinky turtlenecks and buff suede trousers with a
chocolate, kimono jacket. The cuts evoked some of Alexander
McQueen's flair without his gothic overtones.
</P>
<P>
   Fause Haten, who apparently has a following in his native
Brazil, also showed Monday, with a jolting soundtrack that sounded
like ripping sheet metal at the Riverhead Raceway. There were black
coats and jackets that looked as if they had been slashed, and lots
of gold. Gold distressed leather. Gold flecked boots. Gold-Lurex.
Gold floral brocade. It was like being smothered by a Godiva
chocolate box. &QL;

BRIEF ABSENCE OF GUNFIRE EMERGES AS A KEY ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also DIALLO-TRIAL) 
(js) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As the prosecution continues presenting its case
against four officers charged with murder in the death of Amadou
Diallo this week, a pause in the fusillade of 41 shots that the
officers fired is becoming almost as central as the gunfire itself.
</P>
<P>
   Three witnesses for the prosecution have testified to a pause in
the 41 shots fired _ one witness said it was as long as five
seconds _ and more may do so.
</P>
<P>
   While defense lawyers say the pause was so brief as to be
insignificant, prosecutors may use it to show that the encounter
with Diallo on Feb. 4, 1999, did not unfold as quickly as the
defense has maintained and that the officers had time to realize
that Diallo did not pose a threat to them.
</P>
<P>
   The brief absence of gunfire could prove troubling for defense
lawyers. In past police shootings in which there was a pause in
gunfire, state courts have ruled that the pause was a legitimate
issue for the jury to consider.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the 1984 shooting of Eleanor Bumpurs, a mentally
disturbed woman killed by the police in her Bronx apartment, the
State Court of Appeals cited an interval between the two shots that
killed her in upholding the indictment against Officer Stephen
Sullivan, who was ultimately acquitted of manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case, a decade later, an appellate court upheld the
conviction of Officer Peter Del-Debbio for assault in the shooting
of a fellow officer who was undercover. The court ruled that the
judge had correctly instructed the jury to analyze each shot fired
by Del-Debbio separately in determining whether the shooting was
justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if a defendant is justified in using deadly physical
force at the beginning of a single, ongoing encounter with an
assailant,'' the court said, ``his right to use that force
terminates at the point he can no longer reasonably believe the
assailant still poses a threat to him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Diallo case, the question is whether any pause in the
gunfire was long enough for officers to realize that Diallo, who
did not have a weapon, did not pose a threat. He was later found to
be carrying only a wallet and a beeper when he was shot outside his
Bronx apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution has argued that Diallo had fallen or was falling
to the ground after some shots were fired, a point that is to be
supported by the city medical examiner in testimony on Tuesday. The
prosecution is likely to argue that the pause should have allowed
the officers to see that Diallo was incapacitated and that he did
not have a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers have objected to the very word ``pause,'' and
say the ``break'' _ their term of choice _ was not long enough for
the officers to have made such a determination.
</P>
<P>
   They have attributed any interruption in the shots to Officer
Edward McMellon, who was one of the two officers who opened fire
first, falling backward off the stoop in front of the vestibule of
Diallo's apartment building on Wheeler Avenue, leading the other
officers to believe that McMellon had been shot and to redouble
their fire.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Litman, a criminal defense lawyer, said the issue could
rest on the length of time between the shots. ``The less time that
goes by between shot one and shot last, the more a person can argue
that he or she was in the same state of mind at shot one and shot
end,'' he said. ``The more time that goes by, the more time for
reflection.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was a pause in the sequence of shots, Litman added,
``the more the prosecution's going to argue that restarting wasn't
justified.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In testimony last week, the first witness to describe a pause,
Debbie Rivera, tapped out a pause of a second or less. The second
witness who was on Wheeler Avenue that night, Ida Vincent, had
agreed in front of the grand jury that the pause was ``about a
second''; Monday, she described it as ``a few seconds,'' but the
sounds she tapped out suggested a briefer break.
</P>
<P>
   On the witness stand Monday, Thomas Bell, who lives around the
corner from the scene of the shooting, described hearing four or
five shots, followed by a pause of three to five seconds or four to
five seconds. As he tapped out the sounds of the shooting, the
pause was about four seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers honed in on Bell's distance from the scene of
the shooting, and his previous description to investigators of a
``slight pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Vivian Berger of Columbia Law School said a pause could
bear on the charge of intentional murder the officers face. ``It is
much harder to infer intent at the beginning _ the officers were
reacting in fright,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they had even a few seconds to stop and think it over
and realize their mistake,'' Berger said, it could support a murder
charge.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution could urge Justice Joseph C. Teresi of state
Supreme Court, who is hearing the case, to consider the cases of
Sullivan and Del-Debbio as precedent or simply persuasive
precursors as he charges the jury.

CLINTON PUTS FORTH $1.84 TRILLION BUDGET PROPOSAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trims) 
 
By JOHN C. HENRY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton sent Congress a $1.84 trillion
spending plan for the federal government Monday, the opening salvo
in an election-year battle over cutting taxes, reducing debt and
financing health care.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who wants spending to increase by 2.5 percent in
2001, urged lawmakers to approve billions more for new programs, a
direction that would assure Clinton a policy legacy well beyond his
January departure from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This budget, in short, makes really strong and significant
steps toward achieving the great goals that I believe America
should pursue in this new century,'' the president said at a
ceremony unveiling the 10 1/2-pound document for the fiscal year
that begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans quickly voiced their opposition,
characterizing Clinton's proposal ``a fantasy'' and ``a mockery.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has outmaneuvered Republicans in past budget
fights, loaded his 2001 spending plan with politically potent
proposals, providing Democrats with a checklist to carry into the
fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with his fourth consecutive budget surplus, Clinton urged
Congress to approve $351 billion in tax cuts for low- and
middle-income Americans to help pay for college, care for sick
relatives and save for retirement. He also wants to spend more on
schools, environmental protection, gun-law enforcement, and erase
the publicly held portion of the national debt by 2013.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who came into office in 1993 promising to expand health
care, included in his budget the initial funding for a 10-year,
$110 billion program to help provide health insurance for almost
one-fourth of the 44 million uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Again looking a decade ahead, the president asked Congress for a
$160 billion program to provide prescription drugs for the elderly.
He also called for setting aside another $35 billion under Medicare
as a reserve fund to cover ``catastrophic'' drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   The president also proposed saving $70 billion in Medicare funds
over the next decade by allowing the program to employ cost-cutting
methods used by private health plans, like creating networks of
care providers who agree to charge less for services.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also wants the Republican-led Congress to eliminate
corporate tax breaks totaling $96 billion, increase cigarette taxes
by 25 cents a pack and impose a $3,000 fine on tobacco companies
for each smoker under 18.
</P>
<P>
   The president's budget would increase funding for the Department
of Education to $4.5 billion, up 13 percent from the current level.
The increase _ the largest since the agency was founded in 1979 _
would be earmarked for reducing class size, increasing teacher pay,
and rebuilding and modernizing school buildings, including wiring
classrooms for access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also wants $1 billion more for Head Start, a boost that
would pay for an additional 70,000 children to participate. About
880,000 preschoolers currently are enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   The president's budget also seeks more money to restore coastal
areas damaged by offshore oil drilling and to protect historic
places and natural treasures, proposals that are gaining support
from both parties in Congress. He also proposes spending more to
help restore the Everglades, fight pollution in the Great Lakes and
assist the salmon recovery in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   On law enforcement, Clinton proposes spending $150 million to
hire investigators and prosecutors to step up enforcement of the
nation's gun laws. He also wants $2.4 billion for a three-year
prison building program, the largest expansion of federal lockups
since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Although he proposes no increase in the defense budget, the
president wants to refocus spending to procure $60 billion worth of
new weapons, to increase military pay by 3.7 percent, and upgrade
health and housing benefits for the nation's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans dismissed Clinton's budget as a campaign
document for Vice President Al Gore's bid for the White House and
the Democratic Party's effort to take control of Congress in the
November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has all things for everyone they feel they'll need to get
Al Gore elected president,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman
John Kasich, R-Ohio. ``This budget is nothing more than a fantasy.
It's going nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in both the House and Senate, which begin budget
hearings in the coming weeks, said they plan to provide a bigger
tax cut and hold the line on spending. Clinton's suggested tax
increases, GOP lawmakers said, will be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be very clear,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R-Texas. ``This Congress will not raise taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Rep. Bill Archer's count, the president's proposed tax
increases would amount to $181 billion over the next decade. ``This
is the Regis Philbin approach to budgeting, except the government
gets all the checks,'' the Texas Republican and House Ways and
Means Committee chairman said, referring to the host of
television's popular game show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said Clinton appears to
be conspiring with House Democratic leaders ``to obstruct any
progress this year on any issue'' before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's budget is a mockery,'' DeLay said. ``He makes
no credible attempt to address tax relief, fiscal responsibility or
preserving Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Dallas, said she welcomes some of
Clinton's initiatives because they resemble what Republicans have
tried to pass in recent years. She cautioned that the difficulty
will come in negotiating details of the budget with the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be up to the (Republicans) in Congress to protect the
Social Security Trust Fund, strengthen our national defense and
return to hard-working Americans their due share of the income-tax
surplus,'' the senator said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For 2001, Clinton envisions a $184 billion surplus. Of that
amount, $160 billion will come from the Social Security retirement
system. He proposed using the Social Security surplus to help pay
off the federal debt by 2013, then dedicating the interest savings
on the debt to extend the solvency of Social Security to 2050.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget forecasts a $746 billion surplus over the next
decade in the federal budget outside Social Security. The
Congressional Budget Office estimates a $1.9 trillion surplus, a
figure Republicans prefer when arguing for a larger tax cut than
the president has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The president is pushing to use almost $300 billion of that
surplus to bolster the Medicare system, extending it through 2025.
Democrats already are honing their rhetoric to attack tax-cutting
Republicans as willing to sacrifice the long-term viability of the
medical program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans' mantra is massive tax cuts first and not a
penny for Social Security and Medicare,'' said House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. ``They have no budget _ only a reckless
plan to spend the surplus on an irresponsible tax cut for their
special-interest allies with no investment in Social Security and
Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   At an issues conference in Hot Springs, Va., Clinton urged House
Democrats to help him press congressional Republicans to approve
his spending plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the better of the budget battle the last couple of
years because we stuck together,'' he said.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Palestinian Authority froze peace talks with the
Israelis on Monday and released from prison a charismatic Islamic
fundamentalist leader from Gaza who is an outspoken opponent of the
peace effort and of the authority.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and U.S. officials interpreted the release of Dr.
Abdel-Aziz Rantisi, a senior Hamas official, as a provocative and
intentional coincidence with the suspension of the peace
negotiations. But Palestinian officials disagreed with their
interpretation, saying that Rantisi, a 52-year-old pediatrician,
had been held for nearly two years without charges and was due to
be released.
</P>
<P>
   For Prime Minister Ehud Barak, whose agenda since he took office
last July has been almost entirely focused on peacemaking, it was
not a good day. Indeed, with Syria having broken off negotiations
last month, Barak now faces a freeze on two peace fronts at once.
And with the intensification of fighting in Lebanon, where Syria is
a powerbroker, February appears bound to be a difficult month.
</P>
<P>
   By early Tuesday, the outlook for peace was further complicated
when Israel launched air strikes in southern Lebanon, according to
wire reports.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who is also the defense minister, ordered the strikes
against the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, guerrillas.
According to the wire reports, warplanes made three strikes on a
power station in Baalbek city in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa valley.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen Lebanese civilians were injured, one of them seriously,
and 11 of them were taken to a hospital, according to Agence
France-Presse. All the injuries were caused by flying glass or
debris from about a dozen missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The escalation in the conflict in southern Lebanon may well
affect _ some say jeopardize, others say kick-start _ the
resumption of talks with Syria, which Israel holds responsible for
the recent escalation of fighting in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli-Palestinian relations began to cool last week when a
summit meeting between Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and
Barak ended in deadlock, despite the fact that they have held
regular and generally productive meetings. And although the
Israelis predicted late last week that the negotiations would
resume as scheduled on Sunday, the Palestinians did not show up.
Finally on Monday, they indefinitely suspended their participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no desire to return to the table in order to go around
in empty circles,'' said Yasser Abed Rabbo, the chief negotiator.
``That gives a tricky impression that the peace process is still
going on and is only facing small problems. In truth, the crisis is
a deep one.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Palestinian negotiators said they were awaiting
answers from the Israelis on three key questions before they would
resume talks. The questions were tough ones, and it seemed unlikely
that answers from the Israelis would be imminent or to the
Palestinians' liking.
</P>
<P>
   The issue that drove a wedge between them concerned the next
transfer of West Bank land, which was supposed to take place this
week. The Palestinians wanted the Israelis to include villages near
Jerusalem, and the Israelis refused, maintaining that the fate of
Jerusalem needs to be negotiated separately.
</P>
<P>
   That land dispute made it clear that the larger issues of the
final status talks _ borders, settlements, Jerusalem and refugees,
among others _ would not be resolved, even in broad brush, by the
original target date of Feb. 13.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That was a written goal for a framework agreement; the full,
detailed treaty is supposed to be accomplished by mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   So the Palestinians, in a meeting with the Israelis on Saturday
night at the home of Martin Indyk, the new U.S. Ambassador to
Israel, posed the three questions.
</P>
<P>
   First, they asked, ``since the February 13 target date is as
good as over,'' if Barak wanted to eliminate the framework
agreement _ which had been his idea _ and go straight to the final
treaty. Or, they asked, did he want to extend the deadline?
</P>
<P>
   Second, they asked if Israel accepted _ which Israel never has
-_ that the maps for the next land transfer of 6.1 percent of the
West Bank should be decided jointly.
</P>
<P>
   Third, they asked when Israel intended to carry out the final
interim phase of withdrawal from the West Bank, after the 6.1
percent and before the final treaty. Israel has indicated that it
prefers to skip that stage of withdrawal because the territory will
be divided once and for all in a final agreement. But the
Palestinians, fearing that a final agreement may never be reached,
insist that it must happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fate of the negotiations depends on the answers to these
questions,'' said Nabil Aburdeineh, a senior adviser to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   When Rantisi was released on Monday in Gaza City, he boasted
that Arafat had personally ordered that he be set free. But,
outspoken as ever, he disparaged the notion that his release would
be seen as a provocation by the Israelis, saying that ``the
Zionists are not paying that kind of attention, and if it was meant
that way, then our leaders are playing and not practicing
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor was greeted at the headquarters of Hamas, which
carried out a series of suicide bombings that killed dozens of
Israelis four years ago, by the spiritual leader of the movement,
Sheik Ahmed Yassin.
</P>
<P>
   Many consider Rantisi to be the second most powerful person in
the movement after the sheik. He spent eight years in Israeli
prisons, one year in deportation to Lebanon, and 21 months in the
custody of the Palestinian Authority, which accused him of
incitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that the Palestinian Authority is sending a green
light to Hamas, just like Assad is sending a green light to the
Hezbollah to hit Israeli soldiers,'' a Palestinian political
analyst in Gaza said, referring to Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian
president.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had warned Israel not to undertake a military retaliation
against Lebanon. But, as Barak flew to northern Israel to meet with
residents of the border towns, it was clear that Israel was headed
in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will fight,'' Barak said earlier on Monday, ``and we will
make sure that anyone who struck at us will be hit, and that it is
impossible to continue in this this way, to act against the Israeli
army without the aggressors and their operators being punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak faced rising pressure to order a large reprisal attack
after Israelis grappled for what analysts said was the first time
with live images of their wounded soldiers on television. Hemi
Shalev, a columnist for the Maariv newspaper, said the ``Lebanese
killing valley invaded the living room of Joe Israeli after 18
years of repression.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Israeli politicians had urged Barak to continue his
policy of restraint. ``We are not in Lebanon in order to take
revenge but to defend ourselves,'' said Yossi Beilin, the Justice
Minister. But most said Israel could no longer put itself in the
role of a sitting target for the guerrilla forces as it waited for
Syria to return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   And the repercussions were bound to be felt. ``As Lebanon heats
up,'' a senior U.S. official said, ``the chance of a break-through
on Syria goes down.''

CLINTON PROPOSES $435 MILLION BOOST TO NASA BUDGET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Monday requested a $435
million increase for the space program, including money to begin
planning for a successor to the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   NASA chief Dan Goldin said that after years of cutbacks in
spending, the president's budget proposal for the fiscal year 2001
would finally allow the agency to grow again.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in seven years the NASA budget is really
going up,'' he said. In the current fiscal year the agency's budget
is $13.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said the space agency is proposing to spend $6 billion by
2005, including a half billion dollars in the next fiscal year to
jump start stalled efforts begun in 1996 to develop a successor to
the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 billion pledged by the space agency four years ago for a
reusable prototype called the X-33 has encountered a series of
setbacks. The obstacles forced plans to select a shuttle successor
this year to be postponed until 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The new money will be used for research and development to
further determine the safest, most efficient way of launching
humans into space. NASA's goal is a spacecraft that is 100 times
safer than the 19-year-old shuttle and 10 percent of the cost to
operate.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed budget, which is virtually certain to be changed by
Congress, would also provide money to hire 500 new employees and
replace 1,500 current workers who are expected to retire or leave
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Not all areas of NASA are projected to grow under the
president's budget.
</P>
<P>
   The operational funding for the Johnson Space Center in Houston
would rise slightly from the current $4.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Overall funding for the international space station would
decrease from $2.3 billion to $2.1 billion as private firms
complete hardware for the station.
</P>
<P>
   However, the budget would allocate $300 million, $100 million
more than last year, to build back-up equipment to Russian pieces
of the station.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian-made crew module is more than two years behind
schedule and station planners question whether the Russians can
successfully carry out plans to restaff their aging Mir next month
and keep their commitments to the new international outpost.
</P>
<P>
   The president's budget also calls for an increase in research
funds for the space station from $394 million to $455 million.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed budget for shuttle operations would rise from $2.9
billion to $3.1 billion, enabling managers to more than double
annual investments in shuttle safety upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   Under the upgrade strategy, NASA would spend $2.1 billion
through 2005 to improve sensors that monitor the safety of powerful
rocket engines; replace a volatile hydraulic system with safer
electrical components and install electronic cockpit displays.
</P>
<P>
   The president also proposed an increase in NASA funding for
academic programs from $7.3 million to $10.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Texas, said that the NASA budget proposal
was better than those submitted in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to previous budgets this appears to be more
realistic,'' he said. ``And I would hope majority in Congress would
follow this and we do not have to fight like we did last year to
restore $1 billion to the NASA budget.''

TURNER BROADCASTING EXECUTIVE IS NEW PRESIDENT OF PBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Public Broadcasting Service announced the appointment Monday
of Pat Mitchell, a longtime news producer and executive for Turner
Broadcasting, as its president.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, the 57-year-old president of CNN Productions, the
documentary arm of CNN, will be responsible for navigating PBS
through an increasingly difficult landscape, marked by intensified
competition from cable channels like Discovery, A&AMP;E and the History
Channel, and by continued pressure to raise money from both the
federal government and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Mitchell acknowledged several
challenges, perhaps chief among them trying to lead an organization
that has a longstanding conflict between its central programming
arm and its member stations, almost 350 of them, many of which
believe they should control their own program schedules. The
situation has been described as a quagmire by numerous producers
and former PBS executives.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said she hoped to turn that situation into an advantage
by finding ways to make use of attractive local programming on a
national level _ which PBS' cable competitors cannot do _
especially in news and public affairs programs. In general, she
said, ``we need to maximize the promise of PBS.''
</P>
<P>
   Colin G. Campbell, the chairman of the PBS board, acknowledged
that differences in philosophy between the central PBS organization
and its station members had bedeviled the service in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``With any organization which is a membership organization,
there is going to be some tension at the center,'' Campbell said.
``We believe Pat will be able to operate with that and keep it to a
minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Campbell and Mitchell cited the coming digitalization of
television, which will open up a whole new range of channels, as a
means to help PBS in several ways, including making it easier for
the organization to fulfill its educational mission, while also
supplying national programs of quality. But Campbell said that PBS
stations would need help to raise the money needed to convert their
signals to a digital format.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell also emphasized that PBS, which has fought several
battles in Congress over federal financing, would continue to seek
government money as well as contributions from corporations and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nonprofit, noncommercial operation,'' Mitchell said.
``I'm going to meet with congressmen and discuss our goals. My
message will be, How can we be a country without an organization
like this?''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell replaces Ervin Duggan, who served for five and a half
years and left in October. The organization has been without a
chief program executive since last May.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell conceded that PBS also needed to affirm its status as a
leading television outlet for certain kinds of programming like
science, nature, children's, cultural and public affairs programs,
all of which have been usurped to some degree by channels that
cater to specific audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, she said she planned to use her own
extensive background as a news producer to upgrade programming in
those areas. Indeed, besides being the first woman to lead PBS, she
said it was far more important that she was the first former
full-time television producer to head the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how the process works,'' she said. ``I think I can help
in making the process of getting shows on the air work even
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is scheduled to start at PBS on March 1.

CADILLAC CHIEF MOVES TO GM SERVICE UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Call him Mr. Goodwrench. John F. Smith, charged three
years ago with fixing the General Motors Cadillac division, was
named Monday as general manager of the company's service and parts
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The unit, which sells GM and ACDelco parts and accessories
worldwide and markets the Goodwrench service brand name, has 12,000
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cadillac is very important, but this clearly is a promotion
for him,'' said Christopher W. Cedergren, managing director of
Nextrend Inc., a Thousand Oaks, Calif., consulting firm. ``He was
instrumental in putting together a new portfolio of products that
focus on a central theme and unfortunately aren't out yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 49, presided over a redesign of the Cadillac line, but
most of the new cars and trucks will not appear in showrooms for
another two years. Until then, Cadillac sales are likely to
languish, or to improve only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of tinkering with Cadillac, Smith will replace William
J. Lovejoy in the service unit. Last month, Lovejoy was put in
charge of G.M.'s sales, service and marketing in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was unavailable for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under Smith's watch, Cadillac sales stalled while the division
planned a unified theme for the cars and trucks of the future. That
design is embodied in the Evoq, a roadster with a closer
resemblance to the Batmobile than traditional slab-sided Cadillacs.
</P>
<P>
   The first Cadillac to sport that futuristic design is the 2001
Escalade sport utility vehicle, which is scheduled to appear in
dealerships this fall. A year later, a racy new Catera sedan will
appear; about the same time a cross between a sport-utility vehicle
and a pickup truck will go on sale, according to industry
executives. In the autumn of 2002, the Evoq will finally go on
sale, along with a car-based sport utility vehicle, the executives
said.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Cadillac is fated to struggle, analysts and industry
experts said. For 57 years, Cadillac was the nation's best-selling
luxury car brand, a title it finally lost to Lincoln in 1998. Last
year, both Lincoln and Cadillac were passed by Mercedes-Benz and
Lexus. Cadillac sales fell 2.2 percent in 1999, to 178,507 cars.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's replacement has been chosen and is expected to be named
later this month, said Steven J. Harris, a GM spokesman. Until
then, Martin Walsh, Cadillac's general marketing director, is
running the division.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is not related to John F. Smith Jr., GM's chairman and
chief executive. G. Richard Wagoner Jr. is scheduled to take over
as chief executive in June. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: HERE COMES THE JUDGE FOR ROCKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Rocker surely did not realize that the foot he
was putting in his mouth might someday judge him, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing I don't like about New York are the
foreigners,'' the Atlanta Braves' left-hander told Sports
Illustrated in December. ``I'm not a very big fan of foreigners.
You can walk an entire block in Times Square and not hear anybody
speaking English. Asians and Koreans and Vietnamese and Indians and
Russians and Spanish people and everything up there. How the hell
did they get in this country?''
</P>
<P>
   Those words have suddenly increased in irony.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's arbitration hearing in the Major League Baseball
offices over Rocker's suspension until May 1 and $20,000 fine,
baseball's arbitrator will be Shyam Das, an American citizen who
would fall under Rocker's definition of ``foreigners'' because he
was born in England.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the eminently ethical Das would hold Rocker's words
about ``foreigners'' against him, but they are part of the
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   How Das got to this country from England is not known; he was
described as unavailable Monday at his office in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Simpson's, which publishes biographical
information on labor arbitrators, Das' resume is impressive.
Educated at Harvard, the University of Chicago and Yale. Law
professor at the University of Pittsburgh, an attorney at the New
York law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &AMP; McCloy. Member of the
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker might also want to know that Das, 55, was the author of
``Discrimination in Employment Against Aliens _ The Impact of the
Constitution and Federal Civil Rights Law.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, Rocker would not be expected to appear anywhere near
the No. 7 train until June 29, when the Braves open a four-game
weekend series against the Mets at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine having to take the 7 train to the ballpark, looking
like you're'' riding through Beirut, he told Sports Illustrated,
``next to some kid with some purple hair next to some queer with
AIDS right next to some dude who just got out of jail for the
fourth time next to some 20-year-old mom with four kids. It's
depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   But sometime Tuesday, New York's public enemy No. 1 is expected
to arrive here, perhaps at La Guardia Airport, for the arbitration
hearing in the city he so dislikes. Unless he's in disguise, he
will surely be recognized and hooted, if not on his way to a
Midtown Manhattan hotel, then on his way into Wednesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   For Rocker, those hoots should be even more depressing than
riding the No. 7 train, especially with Commissioner Bud Selig's
suspension and fine hanging over him.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the Major League Baseball Players Association, which
filed the grievance on Rocker's behalf, has defended what Rocker
said, including his reference to a teammate as a ``fat monkey.''
Rocker subsequently described that phrase as clubhouse humor, but
Randall Simon, a first baseman from Curacao who believed Rocker was
referring to him, didn't find it funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he said that to my face,'' Simon told a reporter not long
ago, ``I'd tear him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig tore Rocker up instead, suspending him for all 45 days of
spring training and the first 28 days of the season, in addition to
the $20,000 fine. But the commissioner has allowed Rocker to join
the Braves' minor leaguers in spring training on April 3, when the
regular season begins.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's hearing, the players union will argue that, in an
industry where players are told to talk to the news media, such a
long suspension is excessive because it will discourage other
players from speaking out. Selig disagrees, citing an athlete's
social responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling here is that Rocker should have been fined a record
amount for a player, at least $100,000 if not $250,000, but that to
suspend him hurts the innocent ones affected by his comments _ his
team and his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   If Rocker were being disciplined for the usual team-related
baseball incident, such as throwing beanballs or being involved in
a bench-clearing brawl, he would deserve a suspension. But his
tirade against New York and its ``foreigners'' was not
baseball-related. His absence during his suspension punishes his
team and his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But now a ``foreigner,'' to descend to John Rocker's vocabulary,
will be judging his grievance.

   COLONIE, N.Y. _ All but ruling out his party's support for Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's Senate run, the Conservative Party leader said
Monday that he would prefer that the mayor drop out of the race,
and said his party would readily nominate Rep. Rick A. Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I would rather that he didn't run,'' the party
chairman, Michael Long, said at a news conference at the party's
annual conference here, near Albany.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed out that Public Advocate Mark Green, a liberal
Democrat, would become mayor if Giuliani was elected to the Senate
with a year left in the mayoral term. ``He'd be doing the voters
and the taxpayers a favor if he stayed as mayor,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that any number of other Republicans, like Lazio, who
are more conservative but less polarizing than the mayor, would
fare better against the Democratic candidate, Hillary Rodham
Clinton. ``I submit to you if Rudy got out of the race and someone
like, for instance, Congressman Lazio, got into the race, she
loses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who also attended the Conservative conference, had
considered entering the Senate race earlier, and said Monday that
he had not ruled out doing so, but added that if he did, he would
want to be on the Republican line as well as the Conservative line.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor deflected questions about Long's comments, and
declined to say whether he would seek the Conservative Party
nomination. ``Generally, what I am interested in is not what a
political party thinks,'' he said. ``It is what the people in the
state think.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Conservative Party is small _ its 170,000 registered
voters are 1.6 percent of the state total _ it wields a
disproportionate influence in state politics. In statewide
elections, Republicans who also have the Conservative nomination
can count on getting about 300,000 votes on that line, or 4 percent
to 8 percent of the total vote, often enough to decide a close
race.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between Long and Giuliani has been simmering for
months, as Long repeatedly complained that the mayor had not called
him or met with him to discuss a possible endorsement. But their
rift was deepened by many of the mayor's comments on television
news programs on Sunday morning, the day of Clinton's official
announcement of her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said on television that he would not change his
position and support a ban on the abortion procedure that opponents
call partial-birth abortion, although the Conservative Party has
called such a change in position as a minimum condition for
considering endorsing him. If he is elected to the Senate, Giuliani
said Sunday on ``Meet the Press'' on NBC, ``I would vote to
preserve the option for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing the same day on ABC's ``This Week,'' the mayor said:
``I'd like to run on all the lines. I'd like to run on the Liberal
line, the Conservative line. I'd like to run on the Democratic
line, if I could figure out how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Long said Monday that if the mayor stood fast on the abortion
issue, ``he doesn't get a ticket to the dance.'' But he also
suggested that Giuliani would never make a long-awaited pitch for
Conservative support, the closest Long has come to saying outright
that his party would not nominate the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Long and Giuliani talked briefly in March last year,
Conservative Party leaders have been increasingly frustrated with
Giuliani's refusal even to discuss the possibility of a pact. And
several people close to Long said the mayor's comments on the
Sunday talk shows might have been the final insult. Aside from
Giuliani's unwillingness to compromise on abortion, his suggestion
that party identity and party ideology are meaningless sounded to
Conservatives like an attack on their reason for being.
</P>
<P>
   Long repeatedly used the word ``liberal'' to describe Giuliani,
who has taken positions, like supporting abortion rights and
endorsing gay rights, that the Conservative Party opposes. And
several times, Long questioned whether the mayor really planned to
run, noting that Giuliani had not definitively stated his
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Giuliani said: ``I have not given up anyone's
endorsement. But the reality is I don't think that endorsements
really matter, particularly in my case. I am well known. I have a
record that people can look at and they can judge whether they like
that record and they would like to see that kind of dedication,
that kind of conscientiousness, that kind of hard work that I put
out on behalf of people in the city done for the people of the
state.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani narrowly leads Clinton in public opinion polls,
those surveys have reflected a two-way race, without a third,
Conservative candidate. In any case, it is expected to be a close
contest, and no Republican has won statewide office in New York
without the Conservative nomination since Sen. Jacob Javits and
Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz were re-elected in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   New York is the only state that allows a candidate to be
nominated by more than one party and to compile the votes received
on the ballot lines of separate parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservatives have shown that by running their own
candidates, they can play havoc with the Republicans. In 1990, when
Gov. Mario Cuomo, a Democrat, would have been vulnerable to a
strong Republican challenge, the Conservatives nominated their own
candidate, Herbert London, drawing more than 800,000 votes and
helping assure Cuomo an easy victory.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Long has said that he was talking with a handful of
people who may run on the Conservative line, though he has refused
to name any of them.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, he went out of his way to talk up the prospects of
Lazio as a more acceptable, more conservative Republican _
intentionally provocative talk meant in part to tweak the
Republican establishment. Lazio, from Suffolk County, had wanted to
run for the Senate, and Gov. George Pataki was at first seen as
promoting his candidacy. But in August, Pataki and others pressured
him into stepping aside to clear the primary field for Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and other party leaders have had rocky relations
with Giuliani, but most consider him their party's best hope to
capture a seat now held by a Democrat, Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, who is retiring. While many would prefer Lazio, they see
him as a weaker candidate against Clinton, and they desperately
want to avoid a primary fight and a party split in November.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's appearance here Sunday night, playing host at a dessert
reception for Conservative leaders, ``certainly raises
speculation'' that the congressman still might run, Long said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if he made a phone call, we're ready to move,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said Monday, as he has before, that he still had not ruled
out a run. ``I am thinking it through, and I have not closed the
door,'' he said. But, he added, ``I would not pursue the
Conservative nomination without pursuing the Republican nomination
at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Conservative Party gathering, ``There was what I would
characterize as overwhelming support for me to get into the Senate
race,'' he said. ``It is very clear to me that if it is not me,
there will be some other Conservative candidate,'' running to the
mayor's right in November.
</P>
<P>
   Long revealed Monday that his party, which opposes abortion in
all forms, had been conferring with the Right to Life Party about
the possibility of both parties' nominating the same candidate for
Senate. ``Hopefully, we're going to do that,'' he said.

MAYOR ASSAILS SONG AT HILLARY CLINTON EVENT  
(DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign says it was
intended to serve just as an innocuous bit of background music. But
a 27-year-old Billy Joel song played before she announced her
candidacy for the U.S. Senate on Sunday inspired an attack Monday
from her opponent, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   A Billy Joel greatest hits album played for the audience at the
campaign event in Purchase, N.Y., included Joel's 1973 song
``Captain Jack,'' which tells the tale of a frustrated young man
who spends a Saturday night listening to music, smoking marijuana
and masturbating. ``Captain Jack will get you high tonight and take
you to your special island,'' Joel sings.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Clinton's campaign, said the
first lady and her campaign staff did not pick the song, which he
agreed should not have been played. He said a sound technician
chose the song.

CLINTON PROPOSES $1.84 TRILLION BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton sent Congress a budget proposal
Monday built on the idea that the budget surplus will allow the
nation to have it all, from increased government spending to tax
cuts and big reductions in the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The president's budget, his eighth and last, calls for
additional spending across the range of issues that have long been
central to his agenda, including health care, education and the
environment, as well as increases for the military.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it stresses fiscal responsibility and maps out
a path to eliminate the portion of the national debt held by the
public over the next 13 years. And it tries to define the size of
the surplus in a way that builds Clinton's priorities into the
budget mix for the next decade and leaves Republicans relatively
little room to pursue the sweeping tax cuts they want.
</P>
<P>
   There is no argument between the parties that projected budget
surpluses, assuming they materialize, present the nation with
tremendous opportunities, including a chance to pay down the debt
and insure Social Security's long-term solvency.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's exchanges vividly illustrated the continuing
deadlock over how to apportion the surplus. Republicans have
generally emphasized tax cuts, Democrats for the most part have
called for maintaining or increasing spending on critical needs,
and each has labeled the other's approach a threat to debt
repayment and the future of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget blueprint is unlikely to break that impasse,
and the debate this year is raging not just on Capitol Hill but on
the campaign trail, where there are stark divisions within and
between the parties over how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget calls for total spending in 2001 of nearly
$1.84 trillion, including an increase of 3.9 percent in spending on
the third of the budget accounted for by basic government
operations like the military, national parks, education and law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   That increase, and proposed growth in this discretionary
spending of about 2.5 percent a year for the rest of the decade,
would, at least by the White House's accounting, cover the costs of
a wide range of initiatives laid out by Clinton over the past few
months. They range from an expansion of basic scientific research
to new training for preschool teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a balanced budget with a balanced approach to our
national priorities,'' Clinton told reporters. ``It maintains our
fiscal discipline, pays down the debt, extends the life of Social
Security and Medicare, and invests in our families and our
future.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also an election-year platform, chock-full of programs
that Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton and other
Democratic candidates can use to defend themselves, attack their
opponents and illustrate their stands on issues.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans derided the administration's overall proposal as a
liberal tax-and-spend manifesto that they would discard as they set
about drafting their own tax and spending bills.

FIRE THEN ICE   _ KINGS MIDSEASON REPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the weary Los Angeles Kings left for the
All-Star break Thursday after an impressive 6-3 victory over the
mighty Detroit Red Wings, they looked more like they had just ended
the season rather than the season's first half.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways they had. They had gone from one of the NHL's top
teams in October to a club scarred by injuries and doubt just a few
weeks later. Players came back, but the victories did not, at least
not until the final two games, when they looked like the group that
came flying out of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The second half opens tonight at the Staples Center against the
Mighty Ducks, who also have had an erratic season. Both teams have
been guilty of thinking they had found themselves after a big win,
only to disappear again.
</P>
<P>
   Can the (23-21-7) Kings develop any consistency during the final
two months? The answer is yes. Can they overcome an overwhelming
lack of playoff-tested veterans? The answer is no, but the trade
deadline is March 14. Right now, the only thing this team cares
about is making the playoffs. It should have enough to get there
but not beyond the first round.
</P>
<P>
   First things first. The Kings are only two points behind No.6
San Jose in the Western Conference playoff race and have played
five fewer games. But they also are just two points from being out
of the postseason with 31 games to play.
</P>
<P>
   There were several signs during the victories over the Red Wings
and New York Islanders _ their first two-game winning streak since
Nov. 16 _ that should have a carry-over effect for the rest of the
season. There also is a favorable schedule that includes just seven
road games in the final six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The first line of Luc Robitaille, Jozef Stumpel and Ziggy Palffy
were big scorers in the last two games. They will be needed the
rest of the way. Stumpel, who missed 10 weeks because of hernia
surgery and three more with a knee problem, has been the playmaker
at center that he was two years ago when he had 58 assists and 79
points. That, by the way, was the only time in the last six years
the Kings made the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille is Robitaille, 25 goals on his way to another 40-goal
season. Sadly, Robitaille might be the most taken-for-granted
player in the league because his overall game does not match his
goal- scoring ability. But the Kings' slide in November began when
he missed a month with a broken foot. No one picked up the scoring
slack.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy has been bothered by a sore lower back the past two
months. But in the past two games, he has played like the Palffy
who scored 40 or more three straight seasons for the Islanders.
Palffy never has been to the playoffs and knows he needs that to
let people see his talent. He was snubbed for the All-Star game
even though he was among the top vote-getters among the reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The second line is missing Donald Audette, who has been
sidelined almost a month with an ankle sprain. He has been replaced
by Jason Blake, who has played nicely with veterans Bryan Smolinski
and Glen Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski, who also came over from the Islanders, has actually
been more valuable than Palffy. But Murray, who has one of the
hardest slap shots in the league, has been streaky. Against New
York and Detroit, he and Smolinski worked wonderfully together.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, captain Rob Blake is having the type of season that
could win him his second Norris Trophy in the past three years.
Garry Galley has overcome a concussion to contribute some offense.
Jere Karalahti has joined the team from Finland and made steady
progress.
</P>
<P>
   But Aki Berg remains a mystery. Some nights he is the best
player on the ice. More often he looks lost. The Kings know he is
just 23 and missed last season in a contract dispute. He is better
than when he left but needs to be better every night.
</P>
<P>
   The goaltending has been erratic since Stephane Fiset was
sidelined in November for six weeks with a badly bruised hand. He
returned too early because Jamie Storr had a concussion and was out
of sync. Fiset has looked sharp the past six games, giving Storr
time to find his game.
</P>
<P>
   They need to come up with big saves when the team is struggling,
but they also will be only as good as their defense is at clearing
rebounds in front.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, coach Andy Murray brought accountability and discipline
to a team that underachieved last year under Larry Robinson. The
way Murray kept the Kings working hard through losses in December
and January is proof the club made the right choice hiring him last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   But like the rest, Murray's performance will be considered
successful only if the team makes the playoffs. That should happen,
but the first step begins tonight. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
OFFENSE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not a stretch to say the season might hinge on the performance
of first-line center Jozef Stumpel. Great playmaker but needs to
stayhealthy _ a problem throughout his career. Has missed almost
three months with knee and abdominal trouble. Luc Robitaille and
Ziggy Palffy are gifted scorers, but Palffy is bothered by back
trouble that must be monitored the rest of the season. Second-line
center Bryan Smolinski has been the steal of the Palffy deal last
summer with the Islanders. He has averaged a point a game and made
up for inconsistent effort by linemates. &QL; 
C &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DEFENSE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Captain Rob Blake is having perhaps his best season and is a
strong candidate for the Norris Trophy as the league's best
defenseman. Mattias Norstrom has been solid and Garry Galley has
contributed some offense after coming back from a concussion. Aki
Berg continues to struggle, but his overall game has improved from
two years ago. The group has not always picked up goaltenders on
off nights. Need to clear more rebounds in front of the net.
Coaches have tried to get forwards to come backon defense. When it
works, the Kings win, when it doesn't, they don't. &QL; 
C &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GOALTENDING &QL; 
Stephane Fiset was impressive to open the season and Jamie Storr
was named NHL Player of the Week in early December. Both not only
missed considerable playing time but struggled when they returned.
Fiset, who was rushed back when Storr was lost with a concussion,
fell out of sync and needed time off to regain his rhythm. Storr is
still looking for his. The second half will determine which one is
protected in this summer's expansion draft. &QL; 
B &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SPECIAL TEAMS &QL; 
The power-play and penalty-killing units have been erratic since
November. When snipers Robitaille and Palffy are at full strength,
the power-play numbers go way up. When Larry Robinson was coach,
Blake often played around the net on the power play. Under Andy
Murray, he is back at the point firing away. WhenRobitaille and
Palffy are healthy, that means rebounds become goals, which didn't
happen the past two months. Rookie defenseman Jere Karalahti also
has shown a big shot on the power play. &QL; 
C- &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
COACHING &QL; 
Andy Murray looked like coach of the year the first six weeks when
his team had the NHL's best record _ and helpless to stop the slide
when injuries decimated the team in December. Inherited team with a
lot of baggage and got it to stay positive. His greatest strength
has been keeping the players working hard through lean moments.
Admits he brought back Fiset too soon in December. Has backed off
from telling team tonight's game is the most important game of the
season. &QL;

CLINTON TURNS FOCUS TO EASING UPSTATE ECONOMIC TROUBLES
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEEKTOWAGA, N.Y. _ With her official declaration for the U.S.
Senate behind her, Hillary Rodham Clinton flew into a region of New
York on Monday that is likely to be a prime battleground in the
race this fall, turning her attention to what has long been a
dominant concern among voters here: the region's long-suffering
economy.
</P>
<P>
   With President Clinton back in Washington, the first lady moved
to settle into life as just another candidate running for public
office. She gave the first of what aides said would be five
speeches this week, this one offering measures to spur economic
growth here, including about $550 million worth of tax incentives
and grants to encourage Internet development. She granted three
one-on-one interviews with reporters, a notable break from her more
cloistered ``listening'' tour of the state last year. She visited a
part of New York where Democratic candidates for office always
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But she was also trailed by a presidential-size press corps and
Secret Service brigade that served as a reminder of just how
complicated it is going to be for Clinton to be just another
candidate running for public office. The most routine of political
rituals _ the official airport greeting by local politicians _
turned into a shoulder-to-shoulder commotion as local Democratic
officeholders competed for space with television crews from
Washington and Secret Service agents trying to maintain security as
they waited for Clinton's Air Force jet to emerge from the low
clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton walked into the terminal and climbed onto a marble
ledge, where she declared her affinity for this part of New York.
``I did grow up on the Great Lakes,'' she said, referring to
Chicago. ``I have spent time in western New York. I listened in
western New York.''
</P>
<P>
   In her policy speech, delivered at a job training center here,
Clinton laid out what will be one of the major themes of her
campaign against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, noting the economic
decline of upstate New York and advocating _ in sometimes dry
fashion _ a package of programs intended to help the nation, in
general, and the region in particular. Her aides said her total
program would cost $550 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, she called for creation of tax-exempt bonds
to be issued by the federal government to finance the creation of
lines for high-speed Internet access. She also endorsed grants to
pay for the creation of broad-band networks in urban and poor rural
areas, again to provide the high-speed Internet access that she
asserted was key to the upstate economic revival.
</P>
<P>
   ``If upstate New York State were an independent state, it would
consistently rank in the bottom-fifth of job growth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's emphasis on measures to, in effect, transform the
economy here _ from its traditional if now faltering manufacturing
base to one geared to the Internet _ came with a more typical
prescription for the region's problems. Like other candidates for
statewide office, notably Charles Schumer, who was elected to the
Senate in 1998, Clinton said she would support efforts under way in
Washington to deregulate utilities as a way to try to reduce
electric costs.
</P>
<P>
   And like other candidates running for Senate, Clinton complained
that New York taxpayers were sending more money to Washington than
they were getting back. She said the historical justification for
this, that New York was more prosperous than the rest of he nation,
was no longer so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, New York has the largest gap between the rich and the
poor of any state in the United States,'' she said. ``Therefore, it
is time for our friends in the rest of the country to return the
favor, to change the way business is done in Washington, to give
New York its fair share.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democrat Clinton and Giuliani
are running to replace, has issued an annual report keeping track
of that disparity. To date, though, no New York senator has had
much luck in changing that formula.
</P>
<P>
   On another hot-button issue, Clinton, in an interview with The
Associated Press, one of the three she did Monday, said she would
all but set a litmus test for how she would vote on judges for
federal courts. ``I can't imagine that I would vote to confirm''
someone who opposes abortion rights, she said

PROPOSED TAX LAW MAY CUT CLUB'S VALUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Clinton administration wants to curb the high cost of
buying a sports team, it may have found a way.
</P>
<P>
   In its proposed $1.8 trillion budget for the 2001 fiscal year,
which was unveiled Monday, the White House took aim at a 1976 tax
law that lets a buyer assign half the purchase price of a team to
player contracts and then amortize that valuable deduction over
five years.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sweet deal that has made the rich richer. Let's say
you're Robert Wood Johnson IV. You've just bought the Jets for $635
million. Under current Internal Revenue Service law, you can _ with
the requisite proof _ write off $317.5 million from your operating
income over five years. By reducing income, you reduce your taxes.
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't have enough income from the Jets, you can use
the yearly $63.5 million deduction to offset income from your other
businesses. It's good to be a king.
</P>
<P>
   This tax treatment survived a congressional change to the law in
1993 _ which required a few years to enact _ that codified a
hodgepodge of rules governing the amortization of intangible assets
in other businesses at 15 years. In amortization, a business writes
off, as a loss, the cost of buying assets against profits. By
reducing profits, you reduce taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But the IRS kept sports exempt from the 15-year rule,
maintaining an anomaly; it was a tradeoff for letting teams write
off short-term assets like player contracts, but disallowing
amortization of long-term ones like the values of the franchise and
its television contract.
</P>
<P>
   But disputes kept arising. Most notably, Pat Bowlen, the Denver
Broncos' owner, won a case in United States Tax Court two years ago
that allowed him to assign more than 50 percent of the value of the
team to the contracts he acquired in 1984 from the partnership that
formerly owned the team.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the Treasury Department has determined that ``there
exists no apparent justification for treating acquisitions of
franchises to conduct sports enterprises differently than the
acquisitions of other trades or businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   A Treasury Department official said Monday that the White House
had proposed changing the tax law so that ``all intangible assets
for sports franchises would be amortized over 15 years,'' including
such things as the franchise value and television contracts. The
official added, ``We could have raised more money by just extending
amortization of player contracts for 15 years, but we thought this
was fairer.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House's Office of Management and Budget figures that,
if enacted, the regulation would raise $509 million from 2001 to
2006. (The figure would probably rise if team price tags keep
soaring.) Still, half a billion dollars is a pittance in a $1.8
trillion budget. Just enough to build two nice arenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will raise that much assuming that franchises will change
hands at the same rate they have been,'' said Robert Willens, a
managing director of Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the Clinton administration's desire to change the
taxation of sports teams is a different philosophy from the one
that guided a failed campaign last year to provide a tax break to
help Abe Pollin, a major contributor to the Democratic Party,
refinance his debt at the MCI Center in Washington at a lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   The White House chose a propitious time to seek greater benefits
from team purchases. The Washington Redskins (and FedEx Field) sold
for $805 million last year. The Cleveland Indians went for $320
million last year, and the Los Angeles Dodgers were bought by Fox
for $311 million in. The Yankees were valued at $600 million when
they merged recently with the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   According to Willens, the proposed 15-year amortization for
sports teams will increase the burden of buying a franchise. He
calculated that the present value of the proposed new rule would
have added a present value of $33 million to Johnson's costs and
might have led to a lower bid for the team, if he were subject to
it. But the rule would not be retroactive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would affect the price a buyer is willing to pay for the
team, but not the interest in buying it,'' said Marc Ganis, the
president of Sportscorp, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Art Modell, who recently agreed to sell 49 percent of his
Baltimore Ravens, said: ``I think this will have a deterring effect
on people buying.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sam Grossman, who tried to buy the Jets, said it wouldn't
matter to him. ``So they want to change the tax law. So what?'' he
said. ``There are so many intangibles, so many values, I don't
think it will matter.''
</P>
<P>
   As sweet a tax break as the five-year amortization schedule has
been, the IRS wasn't a pushover. The agency dared owners to prove
they were worthy, establishing a sports examiners team to determine
who was overstepping the bounds of appropriate valuation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to defend the value,'' said Steve Matt, the partner
in charge of the sports valuation practice at the Dallas office of
the accounting firm Arthur Andersen. ``The salary you pay a player
is not just the value of the contract, just one component.
Ultimately, it's an evaluation of the market demand of the player
and how much they would be paid on open market.''
</P>
<P>
   As team prices have soared, proving that the value of the
contracts equaled 50 percent of the purchase price has grown grew
more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went face to face with them on the Dolphins,'' Matt said,
``and they sat there with a spreadsheet of all the NFL teams sold
and what their allocations of player contracts were. They looked
for inconsistencies.''
</P>
<P>
   By seeking to eliminate inconsistencies, the IRS hopes to raise
more money. The rich get richer. &QL;

STUDENT SHOT ON COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALHALLA, N.Y. _ A man, apparently enraged over the end of a
relationship, shot a Westchester Community College student Monday
as she fled down the hallway of a campus building. The man then
dashed across campus to a small hill by the student center and
fatally shot himself as a few students watched, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Joy Thomas, 18, from Mount Vernon, suffered a gunshot
wound to the forehead. She was listed in critical condition at
Westchester Medical Center, but a police spokesman said the injury
was not life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The attacker was in his 20s and was not a student, said
Detective William Rehm, a police spokesman. He did not identify the
man. ``There was an ongoing prior relationship terminated by one
party or the other,'' Rehm said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was shot about 12:15 p.m., after she and the man
argued in the first-floor hallway of a classroom building, Rehm
said. She turned from the man and walked briskly away, and
realizing that he was following her, she entered an office, asking
for help. The man pulled out a handgun and shot her, Rehm said.
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified employee and a student who were in the office
locked the door after the woman fell, preventing the man from
entering, Rehm said.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings alarmed many on campus, coming in the middle of a
school day and just two days after a 19-year-old Columbia
University sophomore was fatally slashed in her dormitory room. The
suspect in that attack, a 23-year-old man who the police believe
was a former boyfriend of the victim, later jumped to his death in
front of a subway train.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Ford, a vice president of the community college, said
this was the first shooting on the 219-acre campus. Founded in
1946, it has 20,500 students, all of them commuters.

 VALHALLA, N.Y.: them commuters. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite a facade of normalcy _ classes were not canceled and
pedestrians walked the snowy grounds as on any other afternoon _
yellow police tape flapping from trees and squad cars parked here
and there piqued the interest of passers-by. As word of the
shootings spread, in part because of a mass of reporters and
photographers that quickly converged on campus, students gathered
in knots to express their shock and concern.
</P>
<P>
   Yovanny Otalvaro, 20, a sophomore from Ossining, said he heard a
shot near the student center, and when he and other students went
to see where it came from, they found the man lying on the ground
in the fetal position.
</P>
<P>
   Don Gregory, an assistant professor of journalism, said he was
walking out of the student center and saw the commotion moments
after the man shot himself in the head near a stand of evergreens
that is a popular gathering spot for smokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just so happens that there was blood on the snow,'' Gregory
said, who saw about six students standing near the man. ``I thought
he had fallen and hurt his leg. But one held up her hand and said:
`I can't believe he did that. Call 911.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that to avoid disrupting student life, there were no
plans to cancel classes Monday or Tuesday, though counselors would
be made available. Some students were considering taking up the
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear stories about people spraying bullets at school, but
you never realize you could be a part of it,'' said Regina Benchs,
21, from Putnam Valley. ``You just don't feel safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhea Williams, another student, said: ``I'm trembling. Why don't
they close the school?''
</P>
<P>
   Ford said unarmed guards patrolled each of the 10 or so
buildings on campus. A guard responded to the shooting, Ford said,
but he did not know what action the guard took. The university will
review its security, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amir Sharif, 19, from Hartsdale, said students at the college
tended to keep themselves. Some, he said, ``carry baggage'' from
rough neighborhoods, but violent disputes are rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it's Westchester Community College,'' he said,
standing in front of the Academic Arts Building, where the first
floor was closed off but classes were under way on other floors.

GOP WANTS INFERTILITY TREATMENTS INSURED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Republican leaders of the state Senate said
Monday that they intended to pass a bill on Tuesday that for the
first time would require health insurance companies to pay for some
infertility treatments, edging the Legislature closer to action on
the highly contentious issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats who control the state Assembly passed a similar
bill early last year, only to see it blocked in the Senate amid
fierce opposition by some of the Capitol's most influential
lobbying groups, including chambers of commerce around the state
and the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   The move in the Senate is somewhat unexpected, because the
Republican majority leader in that house, Joseph L. Bruno, has
expressed serious reservations about mandating insurance coverage
for costly treatments like in vitro fertilization and artificial
insemination.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans' turnaround can at least partly be
attributed to election-year politics.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Republican leaders, including Gov. George E.
Pataki, promised Orthodox Jewish leaders that they would give
serious consideration to such a bill as they sought their support
for a Republican candidate in a highly contested state Senate race
in Rockland County.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Orthodox Jewish leaders in the county threw
their support behind the Republican candidate, Thomas P. Morahan.
Morahan, who won, is up for re-election this year, along with every
other member of the Legislature, and he will need the help of the
Orthodox community once again. Both the Democrats in the Assembly
and the Republicans in the Senate are eager to protect their
majorities in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   The issue represents the latest front in a long-running battle
that has pit consumer advocates, who want the coverage of certain
treatments and services mandated, against insurers and employers,
who complain that such requirements raise health care costs and
therefore premiums.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Pataki and the Legislature have enacted laws
requiring insurers to pay for procedures and services that they had
refused to cover _ from chiropractic care and diabetes treatment to
reconstructive surgery for women who have undergone mastectomies.
</P>
<P>
   Although a few health insurers in New York already pay for some
infertility treatment, the industry as a whole objects to
legislation that would force the companies to do so. If the measure
is enacted, New York will become the 14th state _ including
California, Texas, Connecticut and Massachusetts _ to require
insurers to pay for infertility treatments, according to the
National Conference of State Legislatures, which monitors state
policies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Leslie Moran, the spokeswoman for the Health Plan Association, a
trade group representing the state's health maintenance
organizations, said the bill would drive up health care costs _
ultimately increasing premiums and leading large corporations to
drop commercial coverage in favor of self-insurance plans. That,
she noted, would increase rates even more for smaller businesses
that cannot afford self-insurance. ``There's no free lunch,'' Moran
said. ``Higher benefits equal higher premiums.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill proposed by the Senate, health insurance
companies and health maintenance organizations would be required to
pay for the diagnosis and treatment of infertility. The treatments
covered under the bill include hormone drug therapy, artificial
insemination, in vitro fertilization and gamete and embryo
donation.
</P>
<P>
   But the fate of the Senate proposal is unclear, largely because
it differs from the version that the Assembly passed last year, and
intends to pass again, in several important ways. A key difference
is that the Senate bill does not apply to employees of the Roman
Catholic Church or any other organization with religious objections
to infertility treatments. By contrast, some Orthodox Jewish groups
welcome the procedures and have lobbied Albany to require insurance
companies to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference is that the Senate bill would limit to
$60,000 the amount that insurers would be required to pay to cover
infertility procedures. In addition, the Senate bill applies only
to people between the ages of 25 and 44, while the Assembly bill
has no age restrictions. The Senate bill also says that insurance
coverage must be provided for infertility treatment only if there
is a ``reasonable expectation that treatment will result in a
healthy child.'' The Assembly bill has no such language.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the two bills could lead to
confrontations between the two houses. Sheldon Silver, a Democrat
who is the speaker of the Assembly, objected to the Senate plan,
saying that it had loopholes. He said the Assembly would pass its
own bill again Tuesday, and urged the Senate to pass the same bill.
``It's time for the Senate to come on board and provide that
coverage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate proposal also received a cool response from groups
that have supported mandating insurance coverage for infertility
treatments. Lisa Angerame, the public policy director for the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said the
organization welcomed the Senate's interest in the issue. But she
added that the bill did not go far enough toward ensuring that
people who need coverage would get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is problematic and needs fine-tuning,'' Angerame said.
``But we wholeheartedly embrace the concept of insurance coverage
for infertility treatments. We hope this will be a springboard for
further fruitful discussions.''

AFTER SEATTLE, TRADE GROUP SCALES BACK ITS AGENDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The World Trade Organization, seeking to move beyond
its highly publicized failure in Seattle to start a new round of
global trade negotiations, has agreed instead to begin negotiations
limited to opening markets in agriculture and services.
</P>
<P>
   In the two months since the collapse of the Seattle meeting, the
organization's 135 member countries have been groping for ways to
resurrect the effort to convene negotiations aimed at dismantling
barriers to global commerce. But the members had been unable to
agree on a broad agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to these realities, at least for now, the trade
organization formally set out a blueprint for how to proceed with a
narrower agenda Monday that would attempt to revamp trade rules for
farm goods and services. Countries agreed during the 1993-94 trade
negotiations in Uruguay that efforts to widen trade in at least
these two areas would begin this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO is back in business,'' said Mike Moore, the
organization's director general, expressing relief that it had
broken an impasse. Members had been meeting steadily since early
January to lay the groundwork for the meeting Monday, the first
formal session of the organization's governing body, called the
General Council. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Delegates have set a framework for negotiations, which will be
handled within existing WTO committees. This means negotiations on
trade in farm goods will likely start in late March, and services,
which include insurance and banking, in late February. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Figures compiled by the trade organization show that agriculture
and services account for 65 percent of global output and 80 percent
of the world's jobs. Agriculture alone employs half the world's
work force, according to recent World Bank statistics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, no deadlines were set to conclude the talks, which
means they could drag on for months or even years. Agriculture, in
particular, is a difficult issue because countries like France and
Japan are firmly opposed to the Australian and U.S. view that farm
goods should receive no special treatment that protects domestic
producers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also still under negotiation is a request by developing nations
for extensions of deadlines to honor agreements made in the Uruguay
round of talks, particularly in the area of intellectual property
rights. This request has become a major source of contention
between industrialized and developing countries, and contributed to
the collapse of the Seattle meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Developing countries are seeking solutions to help meet their
obligations to respect intellectual property rights and upgrade
customs valuations methods and investment policies.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the biggest trading powers indicated willingness to
extend the Dec. 31, 1999, deadline on an individual country basis.

HIKERS FACE NEW FEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY MARK SHAFFER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(SEDONA, Ariz.) _ If you plan on hitting the trails along the
famous red rocks, best bring some cash along with the hiking shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Come May, Coconino National Forest officials say, treks up such
scenic trails as Bell Rock, West Fork and Vultee Arch will likely
cost $5 for each carload for a day pass or $20 for a yearlong pass.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest installment of the federal government's
Recreation Fee Demonstration Program, started four years ago to
give the local forest officials the ability to raise more money for
wildlife and watershed protection and for tourist services.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the fees are a long time in coming. The Sedona
area attracts more than 4 million people a year, almost as many as
Grand Canyon National Park. And although visitation to the area has
increased about 250 percent over the past 20 years, the forest's
recreation budget has dropped - by nearly a third in the past
decade alone, Forest Service officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About 95 cents of every dollar from the new fees will stay in
the Beaver Creek-Sedona Ranger District of the Coconino forest, an
agency spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Sedona Mayor Alan Everett, who backs the fees plan, ``The
fees they have mentioned aren't bad for what you get. The state
parks around here like Tuzigoot (ruins), Red Rock State Park and
Slide Rock all charge and I haven't heard anyone complaining about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett, however, said he is concerned that Arizona may end up
like California, where administrative costs eat up about a third of
the money taken in.
</P>
<P>
   Federal public lands officials first embraced the pay-as-you-go
concept in late 1996 when a $4 fee was charged to vehicles entering
Saguaro and Canyon lakes east of Phoenix. Soon, the other four
lakes in the Phoenix area had the same fee for entry, as did the
two most popular trails in the Superstition Mountains, Peralta and
First Water _ other outdoor destinations followed.
</P>
<P>
   Raquel Poturalski, a Coconino National Forest spokeswoman, said
the fees will apply to 160,000 acres extending from near the
Village of Oak Creek in the south to the scenic area of Oak Creek
Canyon on U.S. 89A to the north.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the annual and daily fees can be applied to enter
Crescent Moon Ranch near Red Rock Crossing and archaeological sites
on the Coconino forest which already require an entrance fee.
</P>
<P>
   Poturalski acknowledged that at the second of two public
meetings late last month, a number of the 125 people in attendance
spoke out against the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sedona Councilwoman Sheri Graham isn't surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bureaucracy at its best, charging for access to public
lands which we are already being taxed to maintain,'' she said.
``The Forest Service just looks at this like its their own private
property to do what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   But her colleague, Councilman George Tice, can see both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to see fees on the use of forest land but at least they
can use the money locally and may be able to hire some more
people,'' Tice said. ``But they need to be careful about this. If
you push tourists too much they may decide to stay at home.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: RUSSIA'S EMPTY VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial for Tuesday, Feb. 8: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The year may be 2000, but Grozny could easily be mistaken for
the smoking rubble of a European city circa 1945. Russian forces,
using the blunt weapons of World War II, have shelled and bombed
the Chechen capital into an uninhabitable hell, a city so
devastated that it will most likely be abandoned by the Chechens
who long called it home and by the Russians who now cruelly declare
that it has been ``liberated.'' For a world that has watched the
Russian military offensive with revulsion, the Russian tricolor
flag that now flies over Grozny seems a symbol of shame.
</P>
<P>
   It did not have to be this way. When Chechen fighters raided the
neighboring Russian region of Dagestan last summer, Moscow
justifiably used military force to repel them and talked of carving
out a buffer zone within Chechnya. After bombings last fall in
Moscow and other cities for which Russian authorities blamed
Chechen separatists, Russian security forces set out to hunt down
suspected terrorists, a reasonable response. The Kremlin at one
point said it would work with moderate Chechen leaders to
strengthen the uneasy peace that followed the 1994-1996 conflict
between the rebels and Russia, a peace that gave Chechnya
near-autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear that preventing Chechen terrorism was never the
Kremlin's primary purpose, and these moderate approaches were soon
overtaken by a war strategy. The central aims were to avenge
Russia's military defeat in 1996 and to lift the political fortunes
of Vladimir Putin, the prime minister who became acting president
when Boris Yeltsin resigned on Dec. 31. Both goals have been
achieved, at a heavy cost in blood and principle.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's generals have demonstrated that a scorched-earth
campaign can drive guerrillas into the hills, demolish a sizable
city and kill thousands of civilians trapped in the combat zone.
More than 200,000 Chechens who were lucky enough to survive have
fled Chechnya. Many of Russia's sons were also sacrificed. Since
October more than 1,000 Russian soldiers have lost their lives in
Chechnya, and almost 3,400 have been wounded there.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, for his part, has exploited public support for the war to
make himself the leading contender in presidential elections next
month. Few Russian politicians have summoned the courage to
question the carnage in Chechnya and the damage it has done to
democratic values in Russia. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
was right to challenge Putin on the war during her recent visit to
Moscow. An end to combat in Grozny should not bring an end to
American criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The best that can now be hoped is that Russia will let
international aid organizations provide humanitarian relief to
Chechen civilians, and will make good on its 1996 promise to help
rebuild the shattered ethnic enclave. Moscow will be fortunate if
the war does not produce retaliatory terrorist attacks. Many
Russians seem to think the capture of Grozny is cause for
celebration. Putin does his countrymen no favor by encouraging that
misguided reaction. &QL;

EDGAR BOWERS, 75, A POET IN THE FORMALIST STYLE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Ga., N.C.)   (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edgar Bowers, a poet whose luminous, finely wrought prose earned
him the Bollingen Prize, died on Friday at his home in San
Francisco. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was non-Hodgkins lymphoma, said a friend, Helen P.
Trimpi of Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers was awarded the Bollingen Prize in Poetry, among the
genre's foremost awards, by Yale in 1989. The $10,000 prize, whose
recipients have included Ezra Pound, Wallace Stevens and Marianne
Moore, is awarded every two years to one or more living American
poets for the best collection published during that period or for a
body of poetry. In selecting Bowers, the judges cited his 1973
work, ``Living Together: New and Selected Poems,'' saying that it
``cemented Bowers' reputation as a poet of enduring work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowers wrote five collections of poetry, including ``For Louis
Pasteur'' (1990), ``The Astronomers'' (1965) and ``The Form of
Loss'' (1956).
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many writers of his generation, Bowers was a formalist,
writing in metered verse. The rhymed verse of his earlier work
evolved into the blank verse for which he was heralded.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Rome, Ga. His schooling was interrupted by World
War II, when he served in the Counter Intelligence Corps. After his
discharge in 1946 Bowers returned to the University of North
Carolina. He earned a doctorate in English at Stanford, where he
studied with the poet and critic Yvor Winters.
</P>
<P>
   After dabbling in experimental prose, he turned, under the
tutelage of Winters, to formal verse and at 32 published his first
poetry collection, ``The Form of Loss.'' That book, Winters said,
included works that numbered ``among the best American poems of
this century, and nine or 10 of them among the very great poems.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Justice, a poet who won the Pulitzer and Bollingen prizes
and who was a student with Bowers, said Monday: ``No one could
continue to live up to that for the next 40 years, but Edgar did. I
think he was a very good poet and somewhat neglected in large part
because he did write formally, and that's against the grain of
contemporary poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowers described ``Autumn Shade,'' from ``The Astronomers,'' as
his ``breakthrough blank-verse effort.'' It solidified his
reputation as perhaps the most accomplished blank-verse writer in
the second half of the 20th century with such passages as:
</P>
<P>
   My shadow moves, until, at noon, I stand
</P>
<P>
   Within its seal, as in the finished past.
</P>
<P>
   But in the place where effect and cause are joined,
</P>
<P>
   In the warmth or cold of my remembering,
</P>
<P>
   Of love, of partial freedom, the time to be
</P>
<P>
   Trembles and glitters again in windy light.
</P>
<P>
   For nothing is disposed. The slow soft wind
</P>
<P>
   Tilting the blood-root keeps its gentle edge.
</P>
<P>
   The intimate cry, both sinister and tender,
</P>
<P>
   Once heard, is heard confined in its reserve.
</P>
<P>
   My image of myself, apart, informed
</P>
<P>
   By many deaths, resists me, and I stay
</P>
<P>
   Almost as I have been, intact, aware,
</P>
<P>
   Alive, though proud and cautious, even afraid.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers published his last book, ``Collected Poems,'' in 1997.
The critic Harold Bloom called it ``an amazing achievement, one of
those rare collected volumes that when you go from beginning to end
the poetry improves on each successive page.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowers was awarded two Guggenheim fellowships, as well as the
Harriet Monroe Poetry Prize, given by Poetry magazine, in 1989. He
taught English at the University of California at Santa Barbara for
most of his professional career.
</P>
<P>
   His companion, James Davis of Los Angeles, died on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An ill Bowers wrote his final poem two years ago, ``The Poet
Orders His Tomb.'' In it he says:
</P>
<P>
   I see myself unnoticed on the stair
</P>
<P>
   That underneath a clear
</P>
<P>
   Welcome of bells, had promised me a fair
</P>
<P>
   Attentive hearing's joy, sometime, somewhere.

SEEKING STRONG FINISH _ DUCKS MIDSEASON REPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Mighty Ducks have reached a
critical point in the National Hockey League season, but they are
hardly in ideal position. As the All-Star break ends, the Ducks sit
10th in the Western Conference, three points out of a playoff
berth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing some wildly inconsistent hockey in the first
2months of the season, Anaheim looked good the day after Christmas.
They were four games over .500 (18-14-4-1), sixth in the conference
and optimistic they could climb higher.
</P>
<P>
   But then center Steve Rucchin went down with a staph infection
in his left ankle. When he returned 11 games later, the Ducks were
two games under .500 (20-22-6-1) and out of a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   They still are. The team suffered through a 3-11-2 stretch Dec.
22 to Jan. 26, including an embarrassing loss to the lowly New York
Islanders at The Pond.
</P>
<P>
   They remain in the playoff hunt, however, because of the
brilliant play of team captain Paul Kariya, Teemu Selanne, Oleg
Tverdovsky and Guy Hebert on a make-or-break East Coast road trip
last week. The 2-0-2 trip was just what the Ducks needed as they
prepare for the last 28 games of the season. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
OFFENSE &QL; 
Scoring is up ever so slightly this year in the NHL, but the Ducks'
offense has stood still despite improved five-on-five production.
Anaheim is averaging only 2.52 goals per game, compared to 2.6 last
season. But there have been positive signs in the last few weeks.
Paul Kariya (30 goals, 58 points, plus-20 rating) has taken his
game to a new level (15 goals, 24 points in the last 17 games), and
Teemu Selanne (23-2750) has broken out of a season-long funk.
</P>
<P>
   The Finnish winger has seven goals and 13 points in the last
seven games after scoring only two goals and four points in the
previous 14. Three of his goals have come on the power play _ he
had only two in his first 47 games.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Tverdovsky, who went 35 games without a goal, also is hot.
The defenseman has put together a career-high seven-game
point-scoring streak (2-1113). Steve Rucchin, so vital in the
defensive end and on faceoffs, has six points (2-46) in five games
since returning.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya and Selanne are the obvious keys (scoring 51 of the
team's 136 goals), but the Ducks will need some timely
contributions from the likes of Marty McInnis, Matt Cullen, Fredrik
Olausson, Rucchin and Tverdovsky to keep defenses honest. &QL; 
C-  &QL; 
DEFENSE &QL; 
Heading into the Dec. 22 game versus Phoenix, the Ducks were
nearing the top of the NHL defensive class, allowing only 2.15
goals a game. But they were embarrassed by the Coyotes 8-2, the
start of a 16-game stretch that saw them allow 3.55 goals a game.
After giving up four or more goals only four times in the first 34
games, the Ducks gave up four or more 10 times in that 16-game
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ducks are fourth in the Western Conference in goals
allowed (2.59), 10th in the NHL and have improved depth on the blue
line thanks to the additions of Tverdovsky and Niclas Havelid, the
emergence of Pavel Trnka (plus-15 rating) and the recent call-up of
hard-hitting, 19-year-old Vitaly Vishnevski.
</P>
<P>
   Havelid, who was becoming an mainstay, is sidelined with a
broken finger, but veteran Kevin Haller, bothered by knee injuries
earlier in the season, has picked up his game considerably. So has
Ruslan Salei, who has struggled with a turf-toe-type injury all
year. On the recent road trip, Anaheim allowed only eight goals in
four games. &QL; 
C+  &QL; 
GOALTENDING &QL; 
Hebert was a legitimate all-star candidate for the North American
team the first 34 games. He was among the NHL leaders in wins,
goals against average, save percentage and shutouts. But Hebert
suffered a strained neck versus Phoenix and, like the rest of the
team, went into a slump, giving up soft goals when the Ducks could
least afford them and not coming up with big saves when they were
needed most. Coach Craig Hartsburg challenged Hebert and Dominic
Russell to pick up their games, and Hebert has responded. Instead
of sulking, he was brilliant on the East Coast swing, especially in
ties against Buffalo and Philadelphia. He seems primed for another
late-season run. &QL; 
B  &QL; 
SPECIAL TEAMS &QL; 
The Ducks would be sitting in a much more comfortable position if
their special teams, especially the power play, hadn't needed
nearly 50 games to get on track.
</P>
<P>
   The power-play and penalty-killing units have been ranked near
the bottom of the league all season. But after going 5 for 82 in
the first 23 road games, the Ducks' power play is 7 for 20 in the
last four road outings. Moving Kariya to the point kick-started the
power play last season. This year, the key might turn out to be the
move of Kariya to the half boards.
</P>
<P>
   The 24th-ranked penalty-killing unit has been either very good
or very bad. Ten times the Ducks have allowed two or more
power-play goals in a game, but recently they have been very good,
killing off 18 of the last 19 penalties. &QL; 
D &QL; 
COACHING &QL; 
Hartsburg has taken a lot of flak for supposedly stifling Kariya
and Selanne with a defense-first system. Nobody complained when the
Ducks were four games over .500. Hartsburg has done a admirable of
maintaining his cool and keeping his team together during the long
slump. Now is the time to show he can keep the team rolling. &QL;

SETON HALL HALTS SYRACUSE'S STREAK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ Surviving a desperate run and the deafening
roar of the Carrier Dome crowd, unranked Seton Hall handed
Syracuse, the nation's last unbeaten team, a 69-67 loss Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In snapping Syracuse's winning streak at 19 games, the Pirates
left the Orangemen tied with Connecticut for the longest streak to
start the season in Big East Conference history. In an unlikely
twist, it was the third straight time that Seton Hall (16-4, 8-2 in
the Big East) triumphed at the Carrier Dome after losing all 16
games here before that.
</P>
<P>
   The fans were spread out throughout the spacious arena, but as
Seton Hall's Shaheen Holloway rose in the corner for a 3-point
attempt with 11 minutes 46 seconds to play, the sound reached high
school pitch, as if walls surrounded the court. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The screams came with good reason as fourth-ranked Syracuse,
19-0 entering the game and 9-0 in the conference, had just taken
its first lead since the opening basket of the game. Now the
screams were as much of desperation as exuberance, and they grew
louder as Holloway calmly ignored the sound and serenely dropped in
the shot to give Seton Hall the lead back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To win Monday night, it took the calm that Holloway displayed in
the corner, as well as the fire he showed in the final minutes,
when he nearly came to blows with Syracuse's Jason Hart. But it
took more than just Holloway's play.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pirates' lead went from 35-24 with 1:33 left in the
first half down to 35-32 in the opening minutes of the second half,
Seton Hall went 4:43 without a point. But with 16:50 left in the
game, Darius Lane calmly unleashed a 3-pointer that slipped through
the net. Then, on the next trip, Holloway buried a shot from beyond
the arc. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In all, Seton Hall made 12 3-point field goals. After Syracuse
battled back, taking the lead, 67-66, with 1:07 to play, Lane
drained his sixth 3-pointer of the game, giving Seton Hall the lead
for good with just 40 seconds remaining. Seton Hall then survived
five shots by the Orangemen to hold on for the victory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Seton Hall leading by 60-55, Al Harris was holding the ball
in the lane, pumping and trying to think of some sort of way out of
the jam he found himself in. With two defenders between him and the
basket and Hart clawing at the ball from behind, Harris, a freshman
averaging just 1.9 points a game, lost the ball. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Harris came up with an unlikely play, picking the ball back
up and hoisting a hook shot over the Syracuse defenders that
rattled around the rim and dropped through. Then, the next time
upcourt, Harris drove the lane and his shot was blocked, but a
goaltending call gave him the basket and Seton Hall a 9-point
lead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, the outcome went down to the buzzer as Syracuse freshman
DeShaun Williams scored 5 straight points to cut the lead to 64-63.
Lane, who provided the game-winner, also provided a scare by
missing the front end of two free throw opportunities, the second
one coming with 16.8 seconds to play. &QL;

YAHOO BLAMES A HACKER ATTACK FOR A LENGTHY SERVICE FAILURE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Yahoo Inc. blamed a ``planned attack'' by
computer hackers for a service failure that lasted nearly three
hours Monday, in a rare interruption of one of the most popular and
best performing sites on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The company said one or more hackers flooded a network with a
steady stream of data, causing the network to become clogged.
</P>
<P>
   The assault, which is known in the industry as a distributed
denial of service attack, directed a flood of data from at least 50
computers, making it impossible for the company to exchange
information with its regular customers.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, said Jeff Mallett, Yahoo's president and chief
operating officer, the attack directed one gigabyte of traffic a
second at Yahoo _ the amount of traffic some sites get in an entire
year. ``It clogged our routers, to say the least,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that the attackers did not break into the Yahoo
network, and did not gain access to any internal files or data.
</P>
<P>
   He said Yahoo did not yet know who perpetrated the attack but
was ``starting to get clues.''
</P>
<P>
   It is usually difficult to trace this type of attack because the
instigators normally use dozens of computers they have hijacked.
</P>
<P>
   Elias Levy, chief technology officer for SecurityFocus.com,
which researches computer security issues, called the attack
remarkable because of how heavily reinforced the Yahoo site is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Yahoo was taken down means nobody is really
safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's Web site was down starting about 10:20 a.m. Pacific
Standard Time and was out ``intermittently'' for 2 hours and 45
minutes, said the company, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   This is the broadest attack ever on the Yahoo network, a company
spokeswoman said. The site is usually among the Internet's best
performers; its main page, yahoo.com, is accessible 99.3 percent of
the time, according to Keynote Systems, which monitors Web site
reliability and performance.
</P>
<P>
   The failure caused a great deal of inconvenience to Yahoo's
millions of users, but analysts said the revenue impact would be
insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the disturbance did not seem to affect the company's
stock. Yahoo shares closed at $354, up 50 cents, in Nasdaq trading
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Yahoo said it was serving up to 465 million Web
pages each day, meaning it may have lost as many as 100 million
page views during the failure, said Jordan E. Rohan of the Wit
Capital Group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But he and other analysts said the cost to Yahoo in lost
advertising and e-commerce revenue would be slight, perhaps in the
range of $500,000. ``That's really a rounding error for the
company,'' Rohan said.

ONE GOALIE NEEDS TO WIN THIS RACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There are two candidates of decidedly different
personalities vying for their party's nod. Their stumping will take
them on the road later this month, to Chicago and Buffalo and on
into Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Goaltenders Stephane Fiset and Jamie Storr are the John McCain
and George W. Bush of the Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset is emotional, with frayed rope for nerve endings. He is a
brooder. Storr is hard to read. His self-possession can come across
as ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   With the stretch half of the NHL regular season having now
officially arrived, it's time for either Fiset or Storr to step to
the fore. Platoon? It's not per chance that it rhymes with swoon.
</P>
<P>
   It says here the Kings have to have a clear-cut No.1 to rally
behind (or in front of, as it were) if they are to rise above
Western Conference foes such as Edmonton, San Jose and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   There's much at stake in the last 31 games, starting with
tonight's Super Tuesday showdown against the Mighty Ducks at the
Staples Center. Home ice in the playoffs is there for the taking
but only if one of their goaltenders asserts himself the same way
Guy Hebert did with the Ducks three years ago, or Olaf Kolzig did
with the Washington Capitals in 1998, or former King Byron Dafoe
did with Boston last year.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, we don't blame the Kings' brass for inquiring as to the
availability of a third candidate, in this case the league's
reigning, two-time MVP, Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset and Storr, while marvelous in stretches, have suffered
enough setbacks to make one question their staying, starring power.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings employ Don Edwards as a goaltending consultant, but
maybe what Fiset and Storr really need is Naomi Wolf. The author
and informal advisor to the Clinton White House could help the
goaltenders become alpha males.
</P>
<P>
   For the 29-year-old Fiset, it all comes down to reveling in the
competition that Storr provides rather than resisting it. He is an
incredibly hard worker who is incredibly hard on himself. Some of
the worst shots he absorbs are self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Edwards said, ``you almost have to tell Stephane
to take a deep breath and relax.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to see the ice like Paul Kariya to notice that
the Kings skaters seem to summon more energy in front of Fiset.
Without question, his teammates respect his work ethic and
appreciate how much he cares.
</P>
<P>
   Like Republican presidential hopeful Bush, Storr's future has
long been preordained, since the Kings selected him with the
seventh overall pick in the 1994 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Again, like Bush, it's not always clear how consumed Storr is by
ambition. He doesn't match Fiset's practice intensity and he can be
quiet to the point of inscrutability.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Jamie,'' Edwards said, ``you maybe have to get in his
face a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Storr should have spoken up in December, when he was
sent out against the New Jersey Devils and New York Rangers just
days after hitting his head on the crossbar in a collision with
Montreal's Martin Rucinsky. Storr was experiencing headaches,
dizziness and a stiff neck and thought his symptoms were, as he
recalled last week, ``very noticeable.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors kept clearing him to play, though, and so he did.
The Kings lost his next two starts by a combined score of 15-4,
after which Storr was placed on the injured list with
post-concussion syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Storr; he tried to tough it out for the benefit of his
teammates and ended up taking it on the chin. He'll be the first to
tell you, this alpha-male stuff is tough.
</P>
<P>
   Storr is 24, which the Kings will tell you is young. However, he
is older than Buffalo's Martin Biron (22), the league leader in
shutouts, and Philadelphia's Brian Boucher (22), owner of the
league's second best goals-against average (2.02).
</P>
<P>
   His time isn't tomorrow. It has arrived, slipping in quietly
behind injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Storr has sat out a total of 11 games with post-concussion
syndrome and a right groin strain.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset missed 14 games in November with a right-hand contusion.
They're both healthy now, ``for the first time since the fourth
game of the season,'' first-year coach Andy Murray hastened to add.
</P>
<P>
   All that means is the Kings finally are free to find out whether
their netminding problems of December and January were purely
physical or somewhat psychological. With another expansion draft on
the horizon, they really need to know: Do Fiset and/or Storr have
the mindset to carry the Kings to the next level?
</P>
<P>
   The Kings must have some doubts or they wouldn't be calling
Buffalo about Hasek, who missed the first three months of what was
supposed to be his final season. The problem was a torn groin.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek is the league's headmost goaltender. He's also a bit of a
head case and 35 years old, with one foot back in the Czech
Republic (the way he's straddling continents, no wonder he keeps
straining his groin).
</P>
<P>
   Even if Hasek doesn't follow through on his announced intentions
to retire after this season so he and his wife can raise their
children in their homeland, we'd pursue Phoenix holdout Nikolai
Khabibulin before dealing for Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin is 27 and playing in Long Beach after appearing in 63
games for the Coyotes last year and posting the sixth-best
goals-against average in the league (2.13).
</P>
<P>
   The best-case scenario has Storr playing the rest of the way as
he did in November and Fiset's confidence not getting dislodged,
and in their spirited skirmish a greater battle being won.

A RESTED GORE GOES AFTER HARD-HAT AND HIGH-HAT VOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: SUBS second-to-last graf, Gore took ..., to update with Gore
having narrated concert.)

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a two-day respite from the campaign trail, Vice
President Al Gore stepped up his New York campaign in earnest
Monday, paying homage to the labor unions he is counting on to
mobilize for him in the March 7 primary and spending the evening
courting arts patrons at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   And in recognition of Bill Bradley's popularity here from his
days as a star basketball player and a senator from New Jersey,
Gore opened a new attack against his rival for the Democratic
nomination, saying Bradley's proposals, particularly on health
care, education and the budget surplus, would be bad for New York.
</P>
<P>
   New York is seen as Bradley's best hope for a breakthrough after
his losses to the vice president in Iowa and New Hampshire, and
Gore made it clear Monday that he was not going to give Bradley an
inch of breathing room here. His line of attack was tailor-made for
hard-core Democrats in New York, playing on party loyalty and the
economic success of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to describe to you one of the big differences between
myself and my opponent in the Democratic primary,'' Gore told about
1,000 people in Lower Manhattan at the headquarters of District
Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that you can run for the Democratic nomination
by running down the progress and achievements of the Democratic
Party over the past seven years,'' he said, ``because in fact our
policies have been good for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Asked later if he would campaign in New York with President
Clinton, Gore said, ``I've got to win this race on my own, and I'm
campaigning on my own vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would campaign with Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is
running for Senate in New York, Gore said: ``It's a matter of
scheduling, not just me, but also her. I hope so. But that's yet to
be worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While Gore was courting New York Democrats, Bradley appeared in
Tampa, Fla., and took aim at the Republican governor, Jeb Bush, who
signed an executive order last year, ending affirmation action in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has long been a staunch defender of affirmative action,
as has been his opponent, Vice President Al Gore. But by choosing
to attack Bush, the brother of the Republican presidential
candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Bradley delivered notice
that he was prepared to take on any elected official or
presidential candidate or relative of a presidential candidate, in
his uphill fight for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he has demonstrated a lack of vision and
leadership by repealing affirmative action in the state of
Florida,'' said Bradley about JEb Bush at a raucously supportive
town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's brief appearance in Florida, whose primary is March
14, was his second in two days focusing on race relations. On
Sunday, he visited a church with a large black congregation in the
New York City borough of Queens, and on Tuesday, he will appear in
South Carolina, which has no Democratic primary, to criticize the
Confederate flag's presence over the State Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance Monday before the labor group, Gore assailed
Bradley for having retired from the Senate in 1996 instead of
fighting against what Gore called the Gingrich Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he retired from the Senate during President Clinton's
first term, Sen. Bradley spoke about what he called a budget
stalemate and a process that was, in his words, paralyzed, a
continual deadlock,'' Gore said. ``And so he decided to leave. But
he was wrong. We broke that deadlock.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If Sen. Bradley could not foresee the progress that
we made when we decided to stay and fight against the Gingrich
Republicans, what else does he not see now? How can he be counted
on to see what is right for working families today?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's remarks seemed to turn the tables on Bradley, who
recently has been accusing Gore of waging a campaign of distortions
and falsehoods.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore cannot tell the truth as a candidate, Bradley has been
asking audiences, how can the nation expect him to tell the truth
as president? And now Gore is asking about Bradley: If he did not
fight the good fight a few years ago, how can the nation expect him
to fight as president?
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said that Bradley's health-care proposal would
``eliminate Medicaid for more than 3 million New Yorkers who depend
on it, people with disabilities, people with AIDS, the elderly, in
nursing homes,'' substituting vouchers or subsidies of $150 a
month. ``See if you can find a health-care plan in New York for
$150 a month that pays your prescription drug benefits as Medicaid
does, that pays the kind of benefits that Medicaid pays,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Union members account for 30 percent to 40 percent of the
Democratic primary vote in New York, much higher than they figured
in Iowa and New Hampshire, and they drew most of Gore's attention
Monday. He began with an appearance via satellite at the United
Food and Commercial Workers meeting in Naples, Fla., then met at
his hotel with about 65 labor leaders from across New York state.
</P>
<P>
   He later went to a construction site on Manhattan's West Side,
at 63rd Street and West End Avenue. As he walked through the muddy
site in his heavy topcoat, business suit and cowboy boots, he shook
hands with carpenters and masons.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To help Gore, the state AFL-CIO distributed 1 million pieces of
Gore literature Monday at 10,000 work sites across the state. The
fliers exclaim, ``No presidential candidate has ever been more
supportive of working families than Al Gore!''
</P>
<P>
   Denis M. Hughes, president of the New York State AFL-CIO, said,
``I don't know of any organized support for Bradley in the
trade-union movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore took about an hour and a half out of his labor
supplications to rehearse at Avery Fisher Hall for his nighttime
performance, in which he narrated Aaron Copland's 1942 classic,
``Lincoln Portrait,'' accompanied by the American Symphony
Orchestra, under the direction of Leon Botstein.
</P>
<P>
   The concert was a benefit for seven charities in New York. Tapes
of it are to benefit the Phillips Brooks House, a student-run
public-service organization at Harvard, Gore's alma mater.

was suspected of helping Patricia Hearst elude capture in the
Symbionese Liberation Army case, died Sunday night in Eugene, Ore.
He was 57.
</P>
<P>
   He had throat cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Scott was the captain of his city championship high school
football team in Scranton, Pa., in the late 1950s and a sprinter at
Stanford University. But he became disenchanted with the sports
world, voicing his views in books, as an athletic administrator and
through a sports institute. He spoke out against authoritarian
coaches, excessive commercialization in sports and the use of
performance-enhancing drugs, and he called for greater inclusion of
women and members of minorities in sports programs and for giving
both college and professional athletes a voice in team management.
</P>
<P>
   Sports, he said, should be a joyful experience oriented to
participants rather than spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty is in the classic struggle of man against man, man
against nature and man against himself,'' he said. ``If you don't
struggle well, you should feel badly. But you shouldn't feel badly
just because you lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who graduated from Syracuse University in 1966 and held a
doctorate in sociology from the University of California, took aim
at authoritarian coaches in his first book, the privately published
``Athletics for Athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lombardi and other over-authoritarian coaches have proved that
heavy discipline can produce winners,'' he once said. ``But it is
also possible to learn and develop in a more free and creative
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Scott launched his Institute for the Study of Sport and
Society, which he ran out of an office above his apartment in
Oakland, Calif., its newsletter giving a voice to disaffected
athletes and coaches. He served as an adviser to Dave Meggyesy, the
pro football player who was critical of the game in ``Out of Their
League.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``The Athletic Revolution'' (The Free Press, 1971),
Scott wrote that intercollegiate athletics are essentially
worthwhile but need to be put under the same controls and
guidelines as university academic departments.
</P>
<P>
   After expressing criticism of Bear Bryant, the Alabama football
coach, Scott drew enmity from Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, who in
a speech before the Birmingham Touchdown Club in 1972 called Scott
an enemy of sport, a ``permacritic'' and a ``guru from Berkeley.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott put his views into action when he served as athletic
director at Oberlin College in Ohio from 1972 to 1974. He appointed
three black coaches, including Tommie Smith, the sprinter who
gained notoriety for his raised, gloved fist on the victory stand
at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, and he provided an enhanced role
for women in Oberlin athletics.
</P>
<P>
   While at Oberlin, Scott became fascinated with the persona of
Bill Walton, the UCLA basketball star, an outstanding athlete who
also had social and political concerns, having demonstrated against
the Vietnam War. When Walton was breaking into the National
Basketball Association with the Portland Trail Blazers, he lived
with Scott and Scott served as his business adviser.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1975, Scott was in the public eye on a far larger
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, the granddaughter of the publisher William Randolph
Hearst, had been kidnapped by the revolutionary Symbionese
Liberation Army in February 1974, when she was a 19-year-old
college student. She later joined her captors in various crimes,
and in the summer of 1975 was the object of a nationwide search. A
federal grand jury in Harrisburg, Pa., was seeking to determine
whether Scott had a role in harboring Hearst, but he declined to
testify, alleging governmental misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst was arrested in San Francisco in September 1975 and was
convicted of armed bank robbery in March 1976. At her trial, she
testified that she met Scott at an apartment in Berkeley or Oakland
after a gunfight with the police in Los Angeles in May 1974 had
killed six SLA members. Hearst said Scott and several other family
members drove her east in the summer of 1974. She said that Scott
and she then drove alone to Las Vegas, where he left her.
</P>
<P>
   Scott later admitted to having sheltered Hearst, but no criminal
charges were filed. In 1984, Scott received $30,000 in settlement
of a libel suit against Hearst in which he contended that in her
book ``Every Secret Thing'' she falsely linked him to terrorist
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's death came while his videotaped testimony was being
sought by defense lawyers for Sara Jane Olson, who is to go on
trial in Los Angeles on charges that she planted pipe bombs under
two police cars in that city in 1975 in retaliation for the deaths
of the SLA members in the 1974 shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Scott later worked with world-class track athletes as a
physiotherapist, specializing in the use of electric stimulation to
heal injuries. He helped Joan Benoit Samuelson recover from
injuries and win the first Olympic women's marathon in 1984 and
treated the track stars Carl Lewis and Jackie Joyner-Kersee.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Micki; his son, Jonah; and his
daughters, Lydia and Emma.

KENYANS MAY MISS RICH SUMMER TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PAUL GAINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenya's famed distance runners will not be able to participate
in the International Amateur Athletic Federation's prestigious
Golden League series this summer unless agents and the IAAF can
persuade Kenyan authorities to reverse their decision.
</P>
<P>
   The country's national Olympic committee president, Kipchoge
Keino, blames his country's poor showing at the 1999 world
championships in Seville, Spain, on burnout after the athletes ran
in meets all over Europe for large cash prizes. At the world
championships, the usually dominant Kenyans won six medals to five
each for the Moroccans and the Ethiopians. Now Keino wants the team
to prepare for this year's Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, by
training for six weeks at a high-altitude camp, instead of
competing in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting on Feb. 19 in Nairobi, Kenya, will bring together
about a dozen athlete representatives, the Kenyan Amateur Athletic
Association and the IAAF competitions director, Sandro Giovannelli,
who will try to avoid a conflict that could seriously damage the
IAAF program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's a serious matter, but we have to discuss and find a
solution between us,'' Giovannelli said. ``It is difficult to say
if we will succeed. In the end the athletes must respect the wishes
of the federation and the national Olympic committee, and of course
if the federation says, `No you are not allowed to run the Golden
League meets,' then they don't run the Golden League meets. They
need the agreement of the federation. They are not free to do
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Olympic track and field program scheduled for Sept. 22
to Oct. 1, the IAAF Golden League meets in Europe have been pushed
back into August and September. Those meets have become the
showcase for world class track and field and offer a $1 million
jackpot to be shared by athletes who win their events at all Golden
League meets.
</P>
<P>
   If the Olympic training camp takes place in Kenya, some of the
best athletes will not compete in meets in Zurich, Switzerland;
Monaco; Cologne and Berlin in Germany, and Brussels, Belgium, nor
in many of the IAAF Grand Prix meets.
</P>
<P>
   Keino said: ``You blame Kenyans when they are not performing
well, but on the other hand they are the best athletes. So when the
team is selected they should train themselves up for the Games.
Which is more important? The Golden League or the Olympics?
Somebody has to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The athletes and their representatives stand to lose hundreds of
thousands of dollars if Keino and the Kenyan amateur association
cannot be swayed from their position. Kenya is no longer the
world's dominant distance-running nation, and the Kenyan
authorities are in a bitter mood.
</P>
<P>
   Just recently, Isaiah Kiplagat, president of the Kenyan
association, lashed out at one of the country's leading coaches,
accusing him of allowing foreign news media into the country to
illegally film Kenyan runners. The coach, an Irish missionary named
Brother Colm O'Connell, has developed most of the Kenyan runners at
St. Patrick's Boys' School in Iten. Kiplagat's public outburst has
disturbed many of O'Connell's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Athlete representatives have also come under fire. They are
blamed for everything from racing the athletes too much to luring
young athletes to Europe. Their reception in Nairobi is expected to
be cool. Some of the agents, meanwhile, are tired of the posturing
by Kenyan authorities, whom they perceive as trying to gain control
of the athletes and their money.
</P>
<P>
   Gianni De Madonna, an Italian agent who represents a number of
top Kenyans, said: ``I am very happy for Keino's decision, because
finally we can demonstrate if the Kenyans train at home for the
Olympic Games, nothing will change. They will see the number of
medals will not increase, it will stay the same. The situation in
distance running has changed with the Ethiopians and the Moroccans
and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an Olympic year, athletes usually choose their racing
programs more carefully, and they earn less prize and appearance
money. And, unlike the world championships where a gold medal is
rewarded with a $60,000 bonus, there are no bonuses for Olympic
medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand their concern because some of those people
got burned out before they went to the world championships last
year,'' said Jos Hermens, manager of the Ethiopian superstar Haile
Gebrselassie and many Kenyans. ``But the athletes must also make
some money. I mean, what are the federations going to pay them back
for, not running? So there has to be a balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, two of Hermens' athletes, the Kenyan steeplechaser
Bernard Barmasai and Gabriela Szabo of Romania, won the overall
men's and women's Grand Prix events, earning $200,000 each. In
addition, Szabo won $500,000 for winning the 3,000-meter run in all
her Golden League meets. Hermens earned a 10 percent commission on
that prize money.
</P>
<P>
   Szabo has already decided to concentrate on the Olympics at the
expense of the Golden League.
</P>
<P>
   Hermens also represents about 20 Ethiopian runners, and he has
already had a confrontation with their federation. In December he
met with Ethiopian federation officials who told him that they
intend to keep their Olympic athletes in a training camp for up to
three months before the Games. He has argued against this but
ultimately he must abide by the federation's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the athletes, individual meet directors who rely on
the well-known Africans to promote the meets are expected to be
hurt financially. The Kenyans, Ethiopians and Moroccans have proved
invaluable because of their record-breaking performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they start to do this, then they should realize that the
Kenyan athletes will no longer be welcome at the Grand Prix meets
where they make their earnings,'' said Andreas Bruegger, meet
director of the Zurich Weltklasse meet and spokesman for the Golden
League Series. ``We will fill up with others and if they perform
well, then there is no need to invite the Kenyans next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruegger can afford to make such threats. The Zurich Weltklasse
meet is sold out six months in advance and he does not spend a
dollar on advertising. With a budget of $2.5 million, the big names
are usually easily persuaded. But the same is not true for the
other meets, which have recently experienced a decline in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the athletes also have a lot to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Most of their money comes from the European circuit _ but at the
same time, running for their country means a lot to them.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tergat, the Kenyan who won a silver medal in the 10,000
meters in Atlanta and took the world half-marathon championship
last October, said, ``I know everybody back in this country has the
best welfare of our national team, maybe for more medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``So maybe what Kip Keino meant is that he needs to be sure that
by the time the team is leaving for Sydney they should be well
prepared as a team, not as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially you have to run the Golden League competition to
see exactly where you are, what kind of shape and what kind of form
you are. I don't think they are going to stop us completely.''
</P>
<P>
   That remains to be seen. Under IAAF rules, the various national
federations control travel permits and have the power to keep
athletes from competing overseas. In Ethiopia, the athletes also
need exit visas and are much more tightly controlled.

A VALUABLE STAMP COLLECTION IS FOUND WITH NO SUSPECTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BARTH HEALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A million-dollar collection of stamps and envelopes
from 1869 that was snatched on a New York City street in November
1998 has been recovered by the FBI and returned, the owner said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, there are no suspects in the case, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The hobbyist who built the collection, Jeffrey Forster, a lawyer
in San Jose, Calif., said in an interview Monday that the
individual items were intact and accounted for but that they had
been removed from the pages on which they had been mounted for
exhibit at stamp shows.
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor his insurance company, the Hugh Wood Agency, paid
a ransom for the collection, Forster said. Hugh Wood, which
specializes in insuring collectibles and had a $1 million policy on
the envelopes, had offered a $25,000 reward for return of the
stamps and envelopes.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the world of top-flight philatelic exhibits, Forster's
collection is exceptional. He has concentrated on the 1869 U.S.
issue, the first in this country whose designs come in two colors,
because they depicted scenes from history, rather than the usual
dead statesmen. The stamps are popular with collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Forster's collection focuses on postal history _ how the stamps
were used on envelopes _ and includes mail sent to exotic
locations. Some individual items were valued as high as $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   After exhibiting his collection at the Javits Convention Center
in November 1998, Forster put it in a briefcase and left the center
to go to the airport. When his back was turned to signal the car
service driver, someone grabbed the briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which entered the case because it involved interstate
commerce, recovered the collection last spring, Forster said. They
told him then but asked for his silence while the investigation
continued.
</P>
<P>
   He kept his silence but pestered the FBI to return the
collection, and on Jan. 18, the bureau handed it over to him.

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Someday, maybe, Tiger Woods will suffer a
bee sting, twist his ankle getting out of a bunker, break an arm
hitting from the rough and say a naughty word to make the golf gods
turn against him.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That'll be the day he loses by a stroke. Otherwise, there's no
end in sight for the young master.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's Hail Mary comeback at the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am, fans and pros alike are wondering if there is
nothing Woods cannot overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the 12th tee at Pebble Beach Golf Links, he was
seven strokes behind leader Matt Gogel. Two hours later, Woods had
joined Ben Hogan in golfing history with an amazing rally that
featured a 97-yard wedge shot that was every bit as spectacular as
any 97-yard touchdown pass, finding its mark perfectly for an eagle
2 at the 15th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about destiny,'' said the latest of Woods'
victims, Gogel. ``He's just damn good.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, 24, finished the weather-delayed AT&AMP;T with a dazzling
8-under-par 64 and wound up with a 15-under-par 273 total and a
two-shot victory after Gogel three-putted the 18th hole from eight
feet.
</P>
<P>
   If you're counting _ and the whole world is counting Woods'
victory streak now _ that's six consecutive starts on the PGA Tour
that Woods has won. Not since Hogan in 1948 had anybody won six in
a row.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one player ahead of Woods on that list now. Byron
Nelson owns the record with 11 consecutive wins in 1945. Once
thought to be an unbreakable record, it's conceivably in Woods'
sights.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who has 17 career victories, still doesn't think of his
run as a streak, because it has spanned two calendar years and two
PGA Tour seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But as the string of wins grows, ``it's definitely more
intriguing,'' he admitted. ``I'm more proud of the fact that I've
won eight out of nine, if you include the other tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods went two-for-three in post-PGA Tour events outside the
United States in November.
</P>
<P>
   Once every half-century or so, a unique kind of greatness
presents itself in sports. The world is seeing it now in Woods, who
won this time with the biggest comeback of his professional career.
And, he said, it was one of his most enjoyable wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``This definitely ranks right up there,'' Woods said. ``Coming
from behind is definitely a pretty nice taste in your mouth. I
don't know why. Maybe because it generally happens when you shoot a
great round of golf. Rarely do you see guys shooting 72 or 70 to
come from behind. They have to go mid- to low 60s in order to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods played his final four holes in 4 under par. In his first
start of 2000, the Mercedes Championships at Kapalua, Hawaii, Woods
played his final three holes in 4-under and edged Ernie Els in a
playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some pretty good tournaments down the stretch where
I've been able to pull it off, and also some times when I didn't do
it,'' Woods said. ``Last year, I think I realistically could have
won two more majors if I would have just putted a little better at
the right times. So I have messed up a couple of times.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also have the confidence to know I have done it before
in the past, coming from behind or edging someone out. That
definitely gives you a little shot in the arm, because you know the
feeling; you know how to handle it and deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really interesting when you're coming down the stretch in
a tournament and everything is on the line at that moment. You
forget everything else you've done. What really counts is the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   And nobody is better right now at capturing a moment than Woods.
</P>
<P>
   He's doing the stuff Jack Nicklaus did in his prime. That Tom
Watson did. That Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead did.
</P>
<P>
   He's already part of that select company.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's performance will be remembered forever. Woods started
the day five strokes behind Gogel and Mark Brooks, who took a quick
dive down the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   But Gogel was sensational early and threatened to run away and
hide.
</P>
<P>
   Things looked gloomy for Woods after he failed to birdie the
par-5 14th hole. At that point, he still was five shots behind
Gogel, who was beginning to wobble. The leader bogeyed the 11th and
12th after shooting a sizzling 31 on the front nine.
</P>
<P>
   Woods had fired a respectable 3-under 33 on the front yet had
seen the deficit he was facing grow from five to seven shots.
</P>
<P>
   When he couldn't convert on the 14th, it appeared his rally had
stalled, although he refused to give up the chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over until it's over,'' he said. ``I know how
difficult it is to win your first tournament. I've been there. I
blew one at Quad Cities, and I know how difficult it is to go
through all the emotions and to have a lead like that. It's not
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``So on the 12th tee, I figured if I could somehow get to 14 or
15 (under par), I might give myself a chance. Lo and behold, I got
to 15.''
</P>
<P>
   His comeback started with an incredible lightning bolt. From 97
yards, Woods nudged a wedge that landed a few feet to the right of
the 15th hole and spun straight to the left and into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, he was 13 under par, just two shots behind
Gogel. Woods said he figured he needed to birdie the final four
holes to have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do that,'' he said. ``But I still played them in
4-under.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods had struggled with his putter throughout the week on the
spongy, bumpy greens on the Monterey Peninsula. So he made sure he
didn't have to make any putts of significance down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   He birdied the 16th when he hit a wedge from 115 yards to two
feet. After a solid par on the par-3 17th, Woods hit a driver and a
2-iron that came up 10 yards short of the green on the par-5 18th
along the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   He chipped up to three feet and made the birdie putt to finish
at 273.
</P>
<P>
   Gogel, meanwhile, was feeling his collar tighten. He fumbled
away another stroke on the 15th when he couldn't get up and down
after missing the green.
</P>
<P>
   That left him at 14 under par. He needed a birdie on the 18th to
force a playoff. He laid up on his second shot, then hit a 9-iron
to eight feet. His putt, however, never had a chance, and he missed
the comebacker as well to make it a two-shot win for Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to somehow post my number early, and I figured they'd
be on No. 16 and have three holes left,'' Woods said. ``If I didn't
win, I definitely wanted to make it difficult for him to win. I
wanted to at least make it interesting and not just hand it to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was Gogel doing the handing. But in Woods' case
these days, he simply takes whatever he wants, regardless of who's
in the way.

EDITORIAL: LAST-LAP BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, Feb. 8: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The $1.8 trillion budget proposed by President Clinton Monday
was for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, when he will have only
a few months left at the White House. But Clinton's fiscal
priorities could long outlive his tenure. The president called once
again for using projected surpluses to shore up Social Security and
Medicare, rather than to grant big tax cuts. He would also spend
additional money for education and other domestic needs.
Republicans in Congress may rewrite the numbers but are unlikely to
reorder his priorities in this election year. In part that is
because Sen. John McCain's challenge to party orthodoxy in his
presidential campaign has thrown Republicans on Capitol Hill into
disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Coming after his triumphalist State of the Union Message,
Clinton's valedictory Budget Message spent as much time looking
backward as forward. The president credited the longest recorded
economic boom in American history to the tough decisions he made in
1993 to restrain spending and increase taxes, and in 1997 to accept
budget cuts, especially in Medicare, demanded by Congressional
Republicans. His Budget Message was a kind of victory lap for
policies reviled by many Republicans and in truth not always
welcomed by his fellow Democrats. Indeed, Sen. Bill Bradley's
presidential campaign appeals to those Democrats tired of Clinton's
embrace of spending restraint.
</P>
<P>
   The budget was also significant for injecting a dose of reality
into budget calculations. Clinton wisely called for scrapping the
unrealistic spending caps enacted by Congress two and a half years
ago, which would destroy domestic spending programs if they were
ever adhered to. Congress has all but ignored these caps in the
last two years, sometimes by employing gimmicks like labeling
regular programs as ``emergencies'' and therefore outside the caps.
The much-quoted projection that there will be more than $2 trillion
in budget surpluses in the next decade is predicated on these cuts
taking place, which is extremely unlikely. It makes more sense to
assume that domestic spending will stay pretty much at current
levels, growing at something like the rate of inflation, as Clinton
has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Only last month the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office
projected that, if spending remains at these more realistic levels,
the 10-year surplus outside the Social Security system will be only
$838 billion. Monday the president projected a surplus of $746
billion, roughly in the same ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, that is not enough money to pay for the large tax
cut proposed by Gov. George W. Bush in his presidential campaign.
The budget numbers suggest instead that McCain is on sounder ground
in favoring more limited tax cuts. Congressional Republicans should
not be reluctant to go along with these realistic numbers, even if
they undercut the presidential candidate most of them seem to
favor.
</P>
<P>
   With the presidential race heating up, Democrats and Republicans
in Congress are once again divided over whether it is more
advantageous to try for budget compromises or to draw lines in the
sand and hope to reap the benefits of confrontation. If they choose
to compromise, they could make some progress in bolstering Medicare
with money for prescription drugs for the elderly, and they could
increase spending for education and children, as the White House
wants. A small tax cut acceptable to all sides could become part of
this mix.
</P>
<P>
   In their hearts, many voters would prefer results rather than
confrontation to provide more fodder for campaign commercials.
Clinton's budget does ratchet domestic spending up, but in a modest
way that should be acceptable in Congress. Republicans in Congress
should be rethinking their demand for big tax cuts, especially now
that the issue is not working even in the Republican presidential
race. &QL;

TRIAL FOR CLINTON-GORE FUND-RAISER BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs to delete California from hed) 
(DW) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A longtime fund-raiser for Vice President Al Gore
went on trial here Monday on charges that she helped disguise
illegal campaign donations to the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign,
including at least $55,000 connected to a controversial appearance
by the vice president at a Buddhist temple in California.
</P>
<P>
   In opening statements before a federal jury, a Justice
Department prosecutor asserted that the fund-raiser, Maria Hsia,
employed a scheme to violate the law and deceive the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Yaffe, the prosecutor, said Hsia arranged for people to
write checks to make it appear they were making political
donations. In reality, Yaffe said, these straw donors were
illegally reimbursed by other wealthy donors, including the Hsi Lai
Temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The real donors were ineligible to give the money either because
the amount of their donations exceeded legal limits or they were
foreign nationals who were prohibited from giving campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people used as straw donors, the government has
charged, were dozens of nuns and monks at the Buddhist temple where
Gore attended an April 1996 event.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will doubtlessly serve as a reminder of what became a
deeply embarrassing incident for Gore, and has provided material
for his political opponents. At first, Gore asserted that his
attendance was merely something that he called ``community
outreach,'' but he later acknowledged that he knew it had something
to do with fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond serving as an untimely reminder of the 1996 Democratic
fund-raising practices, the trial may not produce any fresh
damaging information against Gore. In his opening statement, Yaffe
asserted that Hsia engaged in the deception by herself along with a
few close associates. Among those who were deceived, he said, were
people at the Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia, a California immigration consultant, has denied any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In describing how Hsia allegedly arranged for the nuns and monks
to pretend they were actual Democratic donors, Yaffe said, ``She
didn't tell the Clinton-Gore committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaffe is part of a special task force named by Attorney General
Janet Reno to investigate possible fund-raising abuses in the 1996
campaign. Reno formed the task force in place of seeking the
appointment of an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In Yaffe's telling, among those who were duped by Hsia were the
finance chairmen and treasurers of the Clinton-Gore campaign, the
Democratic National Committee and the finance committee for the
re-election bid of Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, a Rhode Island
Democrat, who also received contributions in the name of nuns and
monks from the California temple.
</P>
<P>
   Yaffe said Hsia even concealed her actions from John Huang, a
former fund-raiser for the Democratic National Committee who has
been depicted by Republicans in Congress as a major figure in
fund-raising irregularities involving Asians.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia, a naturalized American citizen born in Taiwan, has had a
long association with Gore, and is equally unlikely to suggest in
her defense that either Gore or President Clinton were part of some
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Nancy Luque, said in her opening statement that no
scheme existed because Hsia was unaware that those people who wrote
checks were not using their own money.
</P>
<P>
   Luque sought in her remarks to narrow the scope of the case for
the jury. She argued that Hsia is not charged with undermining the
political system or engaging in illegal schemes to conceal
donations as the prosecution had just told the jury. The actual
charges, five felony counts, are that Hsia ``caused someone else to
make false statements'' to the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case about five lies, and they claim she caused
these five lies,'' Luque said. If any lies were made, she said,
they were by the officials of the Clinton-Gore campaign, the
Democratic National Committee and Kennedy's finance aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Maria never spoke to any of those people,'' Luque said,
adding that even if Hsia knew there were falsely listed donors _
something she denies _ that would not be a crime because she was
not obligated to inform the campaign officials.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges in two counts that for a 1995
fund-raising dinner at the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles, Hsia
found straw donors to help buy two tables.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Hsia is said to have arranged for a wealthy
businessman to donate $10,000, but since federal law limits a
single donor to $1,000 per election, she had him distribute $5,000
among five family members. She had five others write checks for
$1,000 each and they were reimbursed in cash, the prosecution says.
</P>
<P>
   For the second table, she found straw donors because the real
donor was a foreign national, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Three other counts concern the Hsi Lai Temple. One of those
involves donations to the Patrick Kennedy campaign and two involve
the Clinton-Gore campaign, which the government said received as
much as $100,000 from the temple, funneled through nuns, monks and
others.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the April 29 luncheon with Gore, the government
charges that Hsia ``arranged for Gore to be invited'' and that
``she and John Huang were the driving force behind this event.''

EDITORIAL: THE FLAW IN BUCKLEY VS. VALEO 
 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 8:
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is property; it is not speech.'' So wrote Justice John
Paul Stevens late last month, using his concurring opinion in a
campaign finance case from Missouri to attack the basic equation of
money-equals-speech that was the analytical basis for the Supreme
Court's 1976 Buckley vs. Valeo decision.
</P>
<P>
   In the helpful part of the Buckley decision, the court upheld
the constitutionality of campaign contribution caps, a position
wisely reaffirmed in the Missouri case. But it prohibited spending
limits on spurious free-speech grounds. Any effective campaign
finance law must address both contributions  &UR; and  &LR; spending.
Stevens' observation signals that the court may be getting ready to
take another look at the question of spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the court sidestepped that task in deciding the
Missouri case. The majority opinion reaffirmed the principle that
contribution limits help combat corruption, giving a boost to
ongoing efforts in Congress to bar unregulated soft-money donations
to the political parties by interest groups and wealthy
individuals. But it studiously avoided confronting Buckley's core
error of holding that mandatory limits on campaign spending would
unconstitutionally limit free speech.
</P>
<P>
   That part of the 1976 decision continues to inflict great harm
on the political process. It gives rich candidates like Steve
Forbes an unwarranted advantage over candidates without personal
fortunes. It also guarantees a ceaseless chase for special-interest
money by nonwealthy candidates. Reviewing this landscape in his
dissenting opinion in the Missouri case, Justice Anthony Kennedy
declared that ``Buckley has not worked,'' having created a
``misshapen system.'' He was correct, but his response _ a vote to
overturn the sound portion of Buckley that preserved contribution
limits _ was not. Even Kennedy, though, left open the possibility
that in a future case he might uphold limits on both expenditures
and contributions.
</P>
<P>
   When that case comes _ and it should not be long _ the court
should take to heart Stevens' admonition that money is not speech.
It must also take a realistic look at what has occurred in the 24
years since Buckley. If experience has taught anything, it is that
the corruption rationale the court used in Buckley, and has now
reiterated in upholding contribution limits, applies no less on the
spending side. The absence of mandatory spending limits pressures
candidates to amass ever-larger war chests and produces a political
finance system based on influence-peddling.
</P>
<P>
   In another thoughtful concurring opinion, Justice Stephen Breyer
began to provide a framework for the court's future review of
campaign regulations, including spending limits. The opinion cited
the valid role of restrictions in protecting ``the integrity of the
electoral process'' and in enabling ``a fairer election debate.''
Breyer also suggested that the compelling free-speech issue here
was not the right of individual candidates to raise and spend
unlimited amounts of money. It is the right of all Americans to a
campaign financing system that respects the democratic process.

NCAA FAILS TO RULE ON BARKLEY'S ELIGIBILITY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the National Collegiate Athletic Association not yet ruling
on an appeal over his eligibility, St. John's point guard Erick
Barkley was left behind in Queens on Monday when his teammates
boarded a bus for Providence, R.I., where they will play the Friars
on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's had expected a decision on Barkley's appeal seeking
reinstatement on Monday. The university hopes to get a decision
from the NCAA on Tuesday, in time to get Barkley to the game if the
NCAA rules in his favor. Wally Renfro, a NCAA spokesman, did not
return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was declared ineligible by the university on Saturday,
after the NCAA told the school that he had violated one of its
regulations. The alleged infraction involved a vehicle Barkley is
driving and the NCAA's edict against preferential treatment and
special benefits, according to a university official and an
associate of another university official.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley usually drives a Jeep Cherokee that is owned by his
brother. But he recently traded the Jeep for a Ford Explorer owned
by a longtime family friend who is a coach in the Rucker League and
who coached Barkley about eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, St. John's said the NCAA had asked Ed Manetta,
the athletic director, for ``further clarification from St. John's
as it relates to Erick Barkley's case.'' Manetta declined to
comment and the university did not make clear what information was
sought, but it was likely to include information on ownership,
title and insurance for the car. Barkley is not permitted to travel
with the team while he is ineligible, but he was allowed to
practice with the team Monday before it left for Providence.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Monday if St. John's first appeal had been turned
down and they had tried a second appeal, or if the NCAA had not yet
ruled on the first appeal. If an appeal is granted, Barkley would
be reinstated and allowed to rejoin his team. If the appeal is
denied, Barkley could seek a court injunction against St. John's
that would allow him to play while the case is sorted out. Barkley
would have to go to court against St. John's because it was the
university that suspended him, not the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley could have gone to court Saturday to try to become
eligible for the game against Boston College, but St. John's was
undoubtedly reluctant to have a player go to court against his own
school. That last-ditch option remains open Tuesday, though. But it
would have been more viable if the NCAA had ruled Monday, giving
Barkley time to go to court Tuesday and then, if the injunction
were granted, get to Providence for the game, which starts at 7
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope and pray Erick will play,'' Coach Mike Jarvis said. ``I
think his reputation has been damaged more than enough. I was
disappointed the right thing wasn't done today. There are many,
many things that could happen. I'm going to end up doing what I
think is right and what is in the best interests of Erick and of
this team. I'm not going to do anything to hurt Erick.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis lashed out Saturday in the wake of the NCAA's decision _
he compared college athletics' governing body to the Gestapo _ but
he apologized on Sunday for comparing the NCAA's handling of the
case to a rape. He said that if Barkley's appeal is not upheld
Tuesday, he would give Barkley ``all the necessary information to
make an educated decision,'' presumably about whether to seek an
injunction. Jarvis said he was unconcerned about the narrowing
window of opportunity if the NCAA rules against Barkley to get
Barkley declared eligible for the game Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes it more difficult, but there's always time,''
Jarvis said. ``There's planes, trains, buses and automobiles. When
he is declared eligible, we will get him to Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   With Barkley, who is averaging 16.9 points and 4 assists a game,
in the lineup, St. John's (14-6 over all, 6-3 in the Big East)
should have little trouble handling Providence (8-14, 1-8), the
worst team in the Big East this season. But on Saturday, with
Barkley suspended, the Red Storm looked disjointed and nearly lost
to the second worst team in the league, Boston College (9-13, 1-8).

WOODS FASHIONS AN UNFORGETTABLE COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ The streak is alive, and so is the magic
of Tiger Woods. In a comeback of epic proportions, on one of the
world's great golf courses, Woods overcame a seven-stroke deficit
with seven holes to play to win the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National
Pro-Am by two strokes over Matt Gogel and Vijay Singh.
</P>
<P>
   By winning his sixth consecutive start on the PGA Tour, Woods
tied Ben Hogan, who won six consecutive starts in 1948, for the
second-longest streak in professional golf history.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Nelson holds the longest winning streak with 11
consecutive victories in 1945, a record that has long been
considered untouchable. But the genius of Woods, who has already
won 17 tournaments in three and a half years as a professional, has
allowed him to achieve remarkable feats, such as Monday's comeback,
when he seemed hopelessly behind on Pebble Beach's picturesque back
nine only to storm back for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dramatic achievement, and fantastic even by Woods' high
standards. Shooting a final-round eight-under-par 64, the best
final round ever for a champion at Pebble Beach, Woods changed the
momentum of the tournament with one brilliant shot _ holing a wedge
shot from 97 yards for an eagle at No. 15. When the ball landed
about four-feet right of the cup, then spun into the hole for
eagle, Woods gave his signature fist pump, and it was almost like a
knockout punch to everyone else on the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   While Woods made three birdies and an eagle on the back nine,
Gogel, 28, a tour rookie looking for his first victory, collapsed
with four bogeys on his final nine holes, squandering a commanding
lead and becoming another of Woods' many victims.
</P>
<P>
   Woods finished at 15 under par for the tournament (273 _
68-73-68-64), two strokes ahead of Gogel, who shot a final-round
71, and Singh, who shot a 70. By succeeding the late Payne Stewart
as the champion at Pebble Beach, and by winning on a course that he
first played at age 12, Woods continued a steak of superb golf that
has lasted almost six months. Since last August, Woods has won
eight of his last nine starts on tour, including the PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The more Woods continues to win, the more confident he seems to
become. Though Woods was beaten in November in Taiwan, and at the
Williams World Challenge in January, he has not lost an official
PGA Tour event since the Sprint International last August. And
Monday, when almost any chance to win seemed lost, Woods never lost
faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the confidence to know I have done it before in the
past, coming from behind, or edging someone out,'' said Woods, who
won $720,000 to push his career earnings above $12.5 million, only
about $31,000 behind Davis Love 3rd, the career Tour money leader.
``I've had a pretty good run throughout my career of comebacks.''
</P>
<P>
   This comeback was one of the best. Starting the day five strokes
behind Gogel and Mark Brooks, who shot a 74 and finished tied for
seventh, Woods shot three-under par on the front nine. Yet he still
lost ground to Gogel, who had a blistering start. Playing like a
veteran instead of a tour rookie, Gogel birdied five of his first
seven holes to reach 17 under par, and at that point, it appeared
he might run away.
</P>
<P>
   When Woods reached the 12th tee, he was 10 under par, still
seven strokes behind Gogel, who was at 17 under par playing the
ninth hole. But from then on, Woods went into a different zone. On
the par 3, 202-yard 12th, Woods hit a 5-iron tee shot to five feet,
then made the putt for birdie. Then Gogel suffered his first
setback at No. 11, hitting a poor second shot over the green, then
failing to get up and down, leading to his first bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Gogel was a six-time winner on the Nike Tour, but this wasn't
the Nike Tour. This was Pebble Beach, Tiger Woods in pursuit, and a
tour rookie trying to deal with it all. Eventually, it was too
much. Gogel's first bogey was the first crack in his armor, and he
was never the same thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the first pro that has struggled on the back nine at
Pebble, and won't be the last,'' said Gogel, who has two top-10
finishes in four starts this year. ``Trying to win a golf
tournament for the first time, battling the emotions, it was quite
a test.''
</P>
<P>
   Gogel kept making mistakes, while Woods kept making terrific
shots. After a second consecutive bogey by Gogel at No. 12 dropped
him to 15 under par, Woods was four strokes behind.
</P>
<P>
   Then Woods made his dramatic eagle at No. 15, another example of
Woods' ability to make things happen when the stakes are raised, to
almost will himself to victory. Even Woods was surprised when the
ball sailed high into the air, landed softly on the green, then
took a hard left and disappeared into the cup. But players who are
good are often lucky. Monday, Woods was both.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those things where you are trying to get it
close and leave yourself a putt for birdie,'' Woods said. ``It just
happened to go in.''
</P>
<P>
   That pulled Woods to within two shots of Gogel. Then Woods made
another birdie at No. 16, and now he was one back, with Singh,
Gogel, and Notah Begay III all struggling on the back nine. Another
bogey by Gogel at No. 15, when he missed a five-foot putt, dropped
him into a tie with Woods. After a par for Woods at No. 17, when he
almost chipped in for birdie from 20 feet, Woods made a crucial
birdie at Pebble Beach's famous par 5, 543-yard finishing hole.
</P>
<P>
   There, he hit a solid drive down the left side of the fairway,
then hit a 2-iron that landed about 10 yards short of the green,
about 40 feet from the pin. After a delicate chip shot that Woods
hit four feet from the pin, he made the putt for birdie and a
one-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   Woods signed his scorecard, then waited and watched television
in the press room.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a birdie on one of the last two holes to at least force
a playoff with Woods, Gogel failed. He barely missed a birdie at
No. 17, when his 30-foot putt stopped one turn short of falling in
the cup. Then after a 3-wood and a lay-up at No 18, Gogel hit a
nice approach shot that stopped 10 feet from the pin. But Gogel
misread the putt and it slid past the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who had gone to the driving range to warm up for a
possible playoff, hugged his coach, Butch Harmon, knowing his
improbable victory had been secured. Obviously shaken, Gogel missed
his three-footer for par, and fell into a tie with Singh for second
place, and they settled for second-place checks of $352,000.

FROM SINGULAR VISIONS TO THE GENTLY USED 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By GINIA BELLAFANTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To sit through a succession of fashion shows requires
a certain kind of stamina. It isn't the sort a trek through
Patagonia demands _ though the women who have been making their way
to the fall 2000 collections wearing bare sandals through the icy
slush make one wonder why Outward Bound hasn't raided the ranks of
fashion magazines to find its expedition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   No, the strength sometimes needed for runway shows is like the
strength one presumes television executives deploy during pilot
season, as they watch dozens of new sitcoms, many trying to ape
whatever might be the existing hit of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Angie Harmon possesses enviable fashion stamina. She
goes to the collections for fun, she says, and she's even content
to sit in the back row, as she elected to do at the Oswald Boateng
show on Thursday evening, before a publicist shepherded her to the
front row. Harmon, who plays a prosecutor on the NBC drama ``Law
and Order,'' says she has to get up at 5:30 and doesn't have much
free time; still, she spent her weekend with a digital camera going
from Tommy Hilfiger to DKNY to Victor Alfaro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see that red outfit on Maggie?'' she said on Sunday,
referring to the Hilfiger jeans and cashmere turtleneck worn by the
model Maggie Rizer. ``I wanted to jump up on the runway, rip it off
her and put it on right there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to share much of her passion for what Hilfiger sent
down the runway in a joint presentation of his men's and women's
lines at Roseland ballroom. Just a few weeks ago, Hilfiger signed
up Daryl K to consult on future collections, perhaps to broaden his
appeal beyond 14-year-olds who listen to Jay Zee and attract
28-year-olds who listen to Aimee Mann and do yoga.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger's collection seemed more grown up than in the past, but
grown up in an imitative Ralph Lauren sense more than in a TriBeCa
sense. He showed full-length tartan skirts and Donegal A-line
tweeds. There was pony skin and leather mixed with mink. When he
wasn't alluding to the British Isles, he was aiming for
Continentalism. Yet, there was something off-putting about seeing
Hilfiger, who came to the world's attention by emblazoning his name
and flag across sweatshirts, shrink down his logo to a tepid ``TH''
embossed on slim trousers that mimicked the trend begun on European
runways for spring.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Donna Karan seemed to have Prada and Gucci on her
mind with her DKNY collection. The press material stated,
``Polished is the message!'' It's also the buzzword that magazines
have attached to the well-photographed Prada collection now in
stores. Karan showed lightweight, low-slung pleated skirts
reminiscent of the ones editors witnessed in Milan just a few
months ago. And she showed bright-colored hose with strappy shoes
in the manner that Tom Ford did for his equally praised spring show
for Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Melillo, a former fashion editor and stylist, managed to
stay true to his own very American vision for his Nova USA line.
Shortly after moving into his studio on West 26th Street, he
befriended a neighbor, painter Hunt Slonem, who lent Melillo his
10,000-square-foot loft for his show of men's and women's wear on
Sunday evening. ``I've never been to a show in an aviary,'' said
Kal Ruttenstein of Bloomingdale's, alluding to Slonem's enormous
bird paintings around the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Some might find Melillo's clothes mundane. He showed corduroy
warm-up suits for men, clean-lined moleskin coats and simple,
fitted herringbone dresses for women. One and all were shod in
black track shoes. But you have to appreciate the impish attitude
Melillo brings to fashion, a subject so many take so deadly
seriously. ``A lot of people want to look good without looking
crazy,'' he said before his show. ``This is what people wear. This
is pretty accessible to me and to Barry Diller and Leonardo
DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz.''
</P>
<P>
   Diller might find himself a bit on in years for some of the
lean-cut, popsicle-colored suits Oswald Boateng showed. But
DiCaprio surely could get away with wearing them. Boateng, based in
London, has shown in Paris for a number of years, but presented in
New York for the first time this season. He's brought hipness to
Savile Row tailoring and has developed a devoted following. He has
yet to perfect his women's wear, though. The suits with
ankle-length jackets and slit skirts lacked the thought and verve
of his men's suits. Still, they bore his own imprint. He's not in
the spinoff business.

WITNESS SAYS SHE HEARD TALK AFTER POLICE FIRED FATAL SHOTS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JANE FRITSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A woman who heard the gunshots that killed Amadou
Diallo testified Monday that moments after the shooting stopped,
someone outside her bedroom window said, ``OK, OK, we just want to
say this.''
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of the woman, Ida Vincent, 25, whose first-floor
apartment in the Bronx was near Diallo's apartment, was a
particular disappointment to lawyers for the four officers charged
with his murder.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Justice Joseph C. Teresi had granted their
motion to bar the testimony. But later, the judge said the defense
itself had ``opened the door'' to the testimony during
cross-examination of Vincent, and allowed her to say what she had
heard.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent was the third witness to testify that there was a pause
between two volleys of gunshots. She said the pause was several
seconds, but as she tapped out her recollection of the shots, she
paused for only a second or less between volleys. She also said she
heard no shouted warnings before the gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, a West African immigrant, was standing, unarmed, in the
vestibule of his apartment building about 12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4,
1999, when he was hit by 19 of 41 shots fired at him by the police
officers. They have said that they thought he had a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent was one of two witnesses who testified Monday that there
was a pause between the two volleys of shots. Thomas Bell, who
lived around the corner from Diallo, said that he heard a pause of
three to five seconds. His tapped rendition of the sounds included
a break of that length.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who is to graduate from the New York Police Academy this
month, had apparently taken the same subway home from Manhattan
that night as Diallo and had seen him walk into his building around
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whether there was a pause in the shooting, and how long it
lasted, is significant because it could suggest that the officers
had time to assess the situation but kept firing anyway. This would
undermine their contention that the shooting was justifiable.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, defense attorneys played down the damage that may
have been done by Vincent's testimony that someone said, ``OK, OK,
we just want to say this.'' They said that she was confused about
the sequence of events after the shooting and that she had no idea
who might have made that statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hearsay and can't be attributed to anyone,'' said James
Culleton, who represents one of the officers, Richard Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been attending the trial and
organizing demonstrations in support of Diallo, said the statement
``certainly suggests that they began to put together some story.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Before Vincent took the stand, the lawyers had made a motion to
bar testimony about the statement on the grounds that it was
hearsay and prejudicial and that she did not know who had been
speaking. The judge agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, during cross examination, Stephen Worth, who represents
Officer Edward McMellon, asked Vincent whether police officers
investigating the shooting had questioned her about things she had
said regarding the minutes immediately after the shooting. After
that, Teresi allowed prosecutors to ask her about what she heard.
Without explaining, he said the defense had ``opened the door.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution is expected to rest its case on Tuesday after
calling Dr. Joseph Cohen, the medical examiner who performed the
autopsy on Diallo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vincent, who has four children, said she had had trouble going
to sleep that night and was coloring in a coloring book because she
found it soothing. A window in the bedroom was open about 2 inches,
she said, adding that she always kept it open because she has
asthma. Her building was separated from Diallo's by an alley.
</P>
<P>
   She said she knew Diallo only casually and did not know any of
his roommates.

DORIS KENNER-JACKSON, 58, SINGER IN THE ORIGINAL SHIRELLES
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doris Kenner-Jackson, a founding member of the Shirelles, one of
the first and most emotionally affecting of pop's girl groups, died
on Friday at a hospital in Sacramento, Calif. She was 58.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was breast cancer, said her niece, Lauren Nance.
</P>
<P>
   Kenner-Jackson was born Doris Coley in 1941 in Goldsboro, N.C.,
and moved with her family to Passaic, N.J., as a teen-ager. She
soon began performing at parties and talent shows with her friends
Shirley Owens (later Shirley Alston Reeves), Addie Harris and
Beverly Lee.
</P>
<P>
   A classmate introduced the foursome to her mother, Florence
Greenberg, the pioneering manager and a founder of Tiara Records,
who soon signed the group.
</P>
<P>
   The Shirelles co-wrote their first single, the precocious
schoolyard round ``I Met Him on a Sunday,'' which earned so much
radio play that Decca Records bought it and distributed it
nationally. After that, the group recorded many hits and earned
ardent fans including the Beatles, who covered the quartet's songs
``Baby It's You'' and ``Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenner-Jackson usually sang harmonies during the Shirelles'
heyday, but she did take the lead on the group's passionate version
of the Five Royales' song, ``Dedicated to the One I Love.'' Her
vocals captured the reckless yearning of the teen-age heart.
</P>
<P>
   She also sang the lead on many lesser-known Shirelles songs,
including ``Blue Holiday'' and ``I Saw a Tear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shirelles stayed together until 1968, broke up and reunited,
and finally splintered in the 1970s. Kenner-Jackson kept performing
in one of three postbreakup versions of the group.
</P>
<P>
   She briefly worked for Federal Express in the 1970s, but mostly
stayed active on the oldies-revival circuit. Despite her two-year
fight with cancer, she was entertaining audiences until a few weeks
before her death, said Nance, of Paterson, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when the Rhythm and Blues Foundation gave the Shirelles
a Heritage Award, Kenner-Jackson sang with the group's other
surviving members, Alston Reeves and Lee, for the first time in 19
years; Harris died in 1982. The threesome met again when they were
inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Kenner-Jackson, who was married and divorced twice, is survived
by four children, Antonio Kenner, Gary Kenner, Tracey Jackson, and
Staci Jackson-Richardson, all of Sacramento; two sisters, Ernestine
Francies of Passaic and Agnes Coley of Bloomfield, N.J.; a brother,
Jeremiah Coley of Paterson; four grandchildren and a
great-grandchild.

VANISHING HMOS LEAVE RURAL RESIDENTS AT RISK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY MAUREEN WEST  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(UNDATED) - Seniors and the disabled are being stranded in
Arizona's rural areas by evaporating HMO plans, leaving many unable
to afford the drugs they need to treat their diseases and pain.
</P>
<P>
   While state and federal lawmakers scramble for an answer, many
rural elderly are returning to urban areas so they can rejoin a
health maintenance organization. Others can't afford the move or
the higher urban living costs.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year ago, Arizona was a national model because of its
numerous health-care options in rural areas. Today, seniors in only
four of the state's 13 rural counties _ Pinal, Gila, Santa Cruz and
Cochise _ have access to an HMO.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Health Care Financing Administration estimates that
30,000 Medicare beneficiaries in rural Arizona lost their HMO
coverage this past year as five companies pulled out. The five are:
Premier Healthcare, United Healthcare, PacificCare of Arizona,
Healthplan of Nevada and Humana Health Plan. Premier, the largest,
left Dec. 1. Others withdrew a month later.
</P>
<P>
   Intergroup is the only HMO serving seniors in rural counties,
and it has trimmed its benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Without an HMO Medicare program, many elderly and disabled
people cannot afford ever-more-expensive prescriptions. Some are
taking their medications half as often as prescribed to stretch out
their supply. For many, that could mean greater health problems or
premature death.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton in his State of the Union address last month
called for a prescription drug supplement to Medicare, and one bill
has been introduced in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But to thousands of desperate seniors in rural Arizona, that
Washington pipeline is several thousand miles too long.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, bills are moving through the Legislature to
offer what may be faster assistance. Senate Bill 1271, sponsored by
Chris Cummiskey, D-Phoenix, and Tom Freestone, R-Mesa, asks for $10
million from the general fund to help subsidize prescription
medication coverage for low income seniors in counties without
HMOs. A similar bill, House Bill 2551, introduced by Andy Nichols,
D-Tucson, is moving through the House.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, SB 1270, sponsored by Cummiskey and Freestone,
calls for $200,000 to establish a statewide prescription medication
purchasing program. It would enable seniors to negotiate as a group
for discounted drug rates.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Lindeman, executive director of the Governor's Advisory
Council on Aging, favors the subsidies because they would provide
relief as early as this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The worst hit, Lindeman said, are those just above the federal
poverty line who can't get other state or federal assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them are elderly women with incomes no more than
$700, and with prescriptions that can easily run $200 or $300 a
month,'' she said. The average senior takes seven prescriptions a
month, and the average cost increased 20 percent in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Since December, the State Health Insurance Assistance Program
has received 100 or more calls each day asking for information or
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty to 40 percent of the callers are desperate,'' said
Martha Taylor, coordinator of the state office. ``They say, `I have
to sell my house or my car to pay for prescriptions.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In Bullhead City, where Taylor recently talked about medical
coverage, a small crowd was expected but more than 1,500 elderly
showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get healthy seniors, but the sickest of the sick _
people in the middle of chemotherapy, seniors with limbs missing,
those hooked up to oxygen tanks _ all wanting to know where they
could turn for help,'' said Taylor, who wishes she had more
answers. &QL; 
Ida Ramirez, 64, of Lake Havasu City, who has multiple sclerosis,
would move to Maricopa County if she could.
</P>
<P>
   ``But where could I afford to live there?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez moved to Lake Havasu City when her husband died and her
income dropped. She lives in a mobile home that once was their
weekend retreat. Now, it is all she can afford, and she has a loan
on it.
</P>
<P>
   On advice from the state help program, Ramirez applied for a
public assistance program through a pharmaceutical company that
makes her MS drug affordable. Last week, she learned she was among
the few applicants who were accepted. She can pay $900 for a year's
supply of the drug, which normally would cost almost $11,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves her with an additional $162 in monthly prescriptions
she can't afford. For now, she will take her cholesterol and
thyroid pills every other day, and skip her pain pills and muscle
relaxants.
</P>
<P>
   Her friend, Teresa Shields, 43, who also has multiple sclerosis,
moved to Las Vegas a few months ago when she heard her carrier was
going under. With prescriptions running $1,100, she didn't want to
risk being without prescription coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed the lakes, but I also thought I would have access to
good health care,'' said Shields, who had moved to Lake Havasu in
1997. ``I wouldn't have moved there in the first place if it didn't
have an HMO.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 14 percent of Arizonans are 65 and older. But in
Yavapai, Mohave and other rural counties, the number is 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are going to see a slowdown in the migration of seniors to
rural areas,'' said Bob Tippett, head of economic development for
Lake Havasu City, where two of every five residents are over 55. It
lost both its HMO providers last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Commerce Department last month began encouraging
more retirees and senior-related xi;UMtries to locate in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be by moving to rural Arizona you could make your
money go further,'' said Cindy La Rue, director of the Commerce
Department's Office of Senior Industries. ``This could change the
profile of persons moving to rural Arizona _ only those who are
healthier, wealthier and younger would be able to move there.''
</P>
<P>
   Health care overall in most rural communities is generally more
expensive, Intergroup spokeswoman Sally Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs say they do not get enough money from government
reimbursements to serve rural beneficiaries. HMOs also have
difficulty recruiting health care providers in rural areas. &QL;

GAD RAUSING, 77, BILLIONAIRE HEAD OF PACKAGING EMPIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A milk carton made Dr. Gad Rausing, who died on Jan. 28 at the
age of 77 in Montreux, Switzerland, one of the wealthiest men in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish-born Rausing, along with his younger brother, Hans,
took their father's idea for a new type of paper carton that
extended the shelf life of milk and extended it into a global
packaging empire, the privately held Tetra Laval Group in Lausanne,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The secretive billionaire died after a brief illness, said a
company spokesman, Jorgen Haglind, who did not disclose the cause
of death.
</P>
<P>
   Rausing's personal fortune _ an estimated net worth of $9
billion, according to Forbes magazine _ grew from the 1952
invention of a tetrahedron-shaped milk carton by his father, Dr.
Ruben Rausing.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish-born Ruben Rausing studied economics at Columbia
University and while there took note of the advanced food packaging
methods he saw in the United States. Company legend has it that in
the 1940s he was watching his wife, Elizabeth, make sausages by
tying off the ends, and he wondered if a similar system could be
applied to milk.
</P>
<P>
   His attempts, aided by an engineer, Erik Wallenberg, led to a
Tetra Pak, a carton made of paper, plastic and aluminum, that
eliminated the need for refrigerating milk.
</P>
<P>
   The cartons, now usually shaped more like a small brick and
called Tetra Brik, are ubiquitous in Europe. In the United States,
the packages are better known simply as the small rectangular juice
containers, usually with a built-in plastic straw, that children
often take to school.
</P>
<P>
   Rausing and his brother joined their father's company shortly
after the Tetra Pak was invented. Over the next 10 years, they
helped the company grow into a conglomerate, selling water
purifiers, bank-note dispensers and other products, as well as
other types of containers, like Tetra Rex, the gable-topped carton
for refrigerated milk that is common in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, the family sold every part of the company except for
the Tetra Pak. Then, in 1991, the Rausing brothers bought
Alfa-Laval, a large packaging group in Sweden, and created
Tetra-Laval.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company, which moved to Switzerland in 1981 to escape
Sweden's high inheritance taxes, produces about 85 billion Tetra
Paks, Tetra Briks and Tetra Rexes a year, collects about $6.5
billion in sales and has operations in 170 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Gad Rausing was born on May 12, 1922, in Stockholm. At the
University of Lund, he earned college degrees in economics and
statistics, as well as a doctorate in archaeology.
</P>
<P>
   Rausing had a lifelong interest in archaeology; his doctoral
dissertation was on bows and arrows. He was an expert on
prehistoric boats and he financed research and frequent excavations
in Sweden, where he was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of
Letters, History and Antiquities. He also supported a variety of
institutions, among them a chair at Oxford University for Icelandic
studies.
</P>
<P>
   His wealth made him a target for terrorists and blackmailers,
too. In 1969, he received death threats and ransom demands by
carrier pigeon. Later, Middle Eastern terrorists in Copenhagen,
Denmark, were found guilty of plotting to kidnap his son Jorn and
hold him for a $25 million ransom.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son Jorn and his brother, Hans, who both live in
London, Rausing is survived by his wife, Birgit; another son, Finn
Rausing, of Stockholm; and a daughter, Kirsten Rausing, of England.

KNICKS ARE NO MATCH FOR HORNETS, INSIDE AND OUT
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ The Knicks stitched the remains of their team
together Monday night and displayed the kind of character it took
to challenge the Charlotte Hornets, but they could not find an
answer for Eddie Jones and Derrick Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter what worn bodies Jeff Van Gundy sent out to
greet Jones and Coleman. Jones scored 34 points and Coleman added
29 as the Hornets left the depleted Knicks behind, 95-85, at the
Charlotte Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston scored 26 points and Patrick Ewing added 15, but
the Hornets, who shot 47 percent, leaned on their main twosome. The
Knicks came with just nine men because of injuries to Marcus Camby,
Larry Johnson and Chris Childs.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Childs and Johnson is only temporary, but Camby
will miss at least six to eight weeks. Camby, who will undergo
diagnostic arthroscopic surgery on Tuesday to determine how badly
he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee on a bad
fall against Miami on Sunday, usually provides the energy the
Knicks need on nights when their bodies are worn and spirits are
flat.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks did not lack effort, pride or will. They lost the
rebounding edge by just 42-39 and played hard to keep the Hornets
from gaining the momentum for a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the Knicks tried to inch close, Jones came up with an
array of trick shots as he pulled up off the dribble and banked in
jumpers off the glass. As effective as Jones was, Coleman was just
as dominating as he left the Knicks' big men lunging in vain with
his jumpers from the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   It was too much for the Knicks to handle though they were able
to cut the Hornets' lead to 88-83 with 3 minutes 41 seconds left as
Ewing, of all players, raced in for a reverse layup. Once again,
Jones and Coleman came right back and pried open the Hornets' lead.
</P>
<P>
   This was a test of the Knicks' resiliency. Not only was their
roster threadbare from injuries, but the Knicks were also playing
their second game in two days. This was to have been an off day,
but the schedule was changed when the Jan. 14 game was postponed
because of the death of guard Bobby Phills, who lost control of his
Porsche less than a mile from the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were faced with keeping up the intense energy level
they had against the Heat on Sunday afternoon. Against Miami, Ewing
played a season-high 44 minutes and dominated with a 25-point,
14-rebound effort.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt the Knicks need him to make up for the loss of
Camby, but at 37, Ewing does not have the same elasticity he used
to have. The Knicks have not bounced back well as a whole in
back-to-back games this season _ with a 2-7 record on the second
night of two games in a row _ and showed signs of fading at the end
of the third quarter after sticking close in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Although their defense wasn't crisp and Ewing was the picture of
fatigue, the Knicks trailed by 51-47 at the half. They allowed the
Hornets to shoot 50 percent, but the Knicks stayed close in
rebounding with 20 to the Hornets' 22 and turned the ball over just
five times.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were signs of trouble. The Hornets seemed to be
biding their time, almost waiting for the Knicks to wilt. In the
third quarter, they made a move. With Ewing staggering in the
paint, the Hornets' big men bulled their way inside while Jones and
Coleman continued to pop outside shots during a 15-5 run to end the
third quarter with a 77-63 lead.
</P>
<P>
   As the Hornets began to pick up steam, the Knicks were hit with
another major blow. With 3:42 left in the third quarter, Houston,
who had 20 points at the time, rolled his left ankle after having a
jumper blocked by Elden Campbell. After the Hornets built a 68-58
lead with 3 minutes left in the third, the Knicks exhaled a sigh of
relief when trainers told Van Gundy that Houston could return. But
Van Gundy didn't go to him right away, perhaps worried that his
ankle was too stiff.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was crucial to the Knicks' ability to stay in the game.
Latrell Sprewell was getting worn down by guarding Jones. Through
three quarters, he was 4 of 12 from the field while Jones had 27
points. Beyond Sprewell, Kurt Thomas had cooled down from his
10-point first quarter and Ewing was struggling to get 8 points
through three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was starting to slip away as the Knicks began to
fade. They were not getting back in transition and losing their
battle to rebound. Normally, this is where Camby provides a boost.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were running on fumes. Early on, Ewing looked tired
and ragged when he began the night 1 for 5 from the floor. In a
way, it was almost a reprieve for him when early foul trouble _ he
had three fouls before the six-minute of the first half _ left him
on the bench.

BUSH, McCAIN TRADE JABS AS RACE HEATS UP 
 
By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
and GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. _ The race for the Republican presidential
nomination became even more overheated Monday as John McCain
responded to George W. Bush's negative attacks with an ad that
suggests Bush cannot be trusted in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has been attacking McCain since the Texas governor's
stinging defeat in New Hampshire last week, emerged from a weekend
of rest and ``retooling'' with a new, even more aggressive posture
and a new mantle _ that he, not McCain, is the reform candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Delaware on the eve of Tuesday's Republican
primary, Bush brandished a new slogan, a slightly different style
but the same basic message as he plowed into crowds of supporters
at a Kent County GOP luncheon and an American Legion post
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is skipping Delaware to concentrate on more crucial
states in the delegate race, took a day away from his South
Carolina campaign to search for independent-minded voters in Macomb
County, Mich., home of the so-called Reagan Democrats, who deserted
the party in 1980 to help deliver the White House to Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in Saginaw, Mich., McCain hoped to resurrect those same
kind of voters, but this time, they would be ``McCain Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has the overwhelming support of the state's GOP
establishment, including popular Gov. John Engler.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by nationwide criticisms that he was too aloof, Bush kept
a hectic pace, made more time for supporters' questions and fielded
more reporters' questions than usual, using every opportunity to
question McCain's commitment to campaign finance reform and
outsider persona, the centerpieces of his surging campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of smiling and sitting back and letting Senator
McCain define me are over,'' Bush told reporters, even though
McCain had restricted the rhetoric to the differences over their
tax cuts. ``I am going to defend my record ... with all my vigor.
And that's exactly where this campaign is headed. I welcome the
battle and I welcome the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight took another dimension Monday when McCain's South
Carolina campaign complained that Bush had launched a ``push
polling'' campaign in which callers, ostensibly taking a
public-opinion survey, badmouth a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few people do this any more,'' said Richard Quinn,
majority leader of the South Carolina House and a key McCain
supporter. ``When they do use it, they're usually desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign held a news conference in Columbia at which
Suzette Latsko, a student at the College of Charleston, said she
received a telephone call Sunday from a woman who identified
herself as working for Voter/Consumer Research and calling from
Houston. Voter/Consumer Research of Washington is listed as a
polling contractor on the Bush campaign's filings with the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Latsko said the caller misrepresented several of McCain's
positions and asked if she knew that McCain was reprimanded for
intervening with federal regulators in the savings and loan
scandal. A Senate ethics committee said McCain had shown ``poor
judgment'' in accepting free holidays from scandal figure Charles
Keating but had not broken Senate rules.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer denied it was a push poll, but
noted the importance of the Republican Party remembering McCain's
role in the S&AMP;L crisis.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had dismissed Bush's increasingly strident attacks until
Monday. But he returned fire with a new ad chastizing Bush for
breaking a promise made over a handshake at a Republican debate not
to run negative campaigns against each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we really want another politician in the White House ...
America can't trust,'' an announcer says at the end of the
30-second television spot that shows a clip from a Bush ad that
accuses McCain of lying, a clip of a Bush speech in which he
promised to run a positive campaign and a clip of the two men
shaking hands on their promise.
</P>
<P>
   McCain later insisted he thought the governor could be trusted,
but he added: ``We shook hands and now he's attacking me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been called a liar, a hypocrite ... and I've been accused
of abandoning veterans,'' McCain said. ``We're going to fire back
and every time he does it, we're going to fire back doubly.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain acknowledged a risk that voters would be turned off by
the negative tone, but said he weighed that risk against the risk
of ``letting it go.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of trust is an important one for McCain, who tells
people at every stop that he will ``always tell you the truth.''
His aides believe it is one of the reasons his message of reform is
attracting increased support across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bush somberly assailed McCain's new ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the senator is referring to me, I'm going to defend my
record,'' Bush said. ``I did in office what I said I would do. The
people in my state ... know they can trust me to bring honor and
dignity to the office.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in months, Bush abandoned his standard stump
speech to focus on his new message that he, the son of the former
president, is the outsider reform candidate and one who can connect
with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Those two elements are precisely the ones that have propelled
14-year Senate veteran McCain to a lead in polls South Carolina and
a surge in such key states as Michigan and California.
</P>
<P>
   McCain insisted that the main focus of his Michigan campaign
will be to recruit more Republican voters. But he said he hopes his
message will attract voters across party lines.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, McCain said labor unions _ usually a Democratic
domain _ played a ``vital role'' the nation's history. ``I don't
think it's appropriate for any president to be anti-union,'' McCain
told the predominantly blue collar crowd in Macomb County. He added
that he does support right-to-work laws.
</P>
<P>
   In Delaware, Bush began his drumbeat that McCain is a Washington
insider without naming him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to remind people who sits on the inside, who resides
in the halls of power in Washington,'' Bush said. ``I'm going to
remind people that I'm a reformer with a record, a reformer with
results.'' The new ``reformer'' theme was repeated throughout the
day and was spelled out in huge new banners draped behind him at
his campaign stops.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush opposes most of McCain's campaign finance reform
proposal and is enthusiastically backed by the nation's Republican
establishment, he is trying to wrest the reformer mantle from
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent said that he is the only person who can stand up
with Al Gore'' to debate campaign finance reform, Bush said. ``As
it turns out there's new evidence that may not be the case,
including the fact that he has received more money from lobbyists
than anyone in the campaign,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's response has been that he must compete within the
current system and that he wants to ban so-called soft money, or
unlimited contributions to the political parties.
