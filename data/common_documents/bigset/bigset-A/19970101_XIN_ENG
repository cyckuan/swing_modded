<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- China's aviation authority has
announced that it had another successful year in its safety with
the landing of CA 176 at Beijing's Capital International Airport

The Sydney-Shanghai-Beijing flight was greeted by Bao Peide,
deputy director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China
(CAAC), and Yin Wenlong, president of Air China, and other major
aviation officials.
</P>
<P>
Despite frequent aviation disasters in other parts of the world
this year, China's aviation sector has set a record of 29 months
and 2.33 million hours of safe flying, Bao Peide said in a
greeting speech. Air China, the country's flag carrier, announced
it has had 42 years without a mishap.

<HEADLINE> Swiss President Rejects Jewish Demand for Creation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Swiss President Jean-Pascal
Delamuraz has rejected the demand for the creation of a
compensation fund of 250 million francs (about 200 U.S. dollars)
for Nazi victims during World War Two, said local press reports
today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Swiss reporters Monday, Delamuraz said
that the creation of a compensation fund is not a good idea, which
could make the investigation of the alleged Jewish assets in Swiss
banks more difficult. He denounced the demand as "no less than
ransom and chantage."
</P>
<P>
"What should be done now is to have the facts come to light
rapidly and, especially, clearly," said Delamuraz. He said that an
investigation commission of experts established recently should
deal with issues concerning the alleged Jewish assets in
Switzerland before a conclusion is made.
</P>
<P>
According to the Swiss press, Jewish groups have asked the
Swiss government to set up a compensation fund during the
investigation, which is due to last three to five years.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Swiss Ambassador to the United States Thomas Borer,
head of a fact-finding task force of Jewish assets in Switzerland,
announced that Switzerland might set up a compensation fund in
1997.
</P>
<P>
However, Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti said on December
23 that he was opposed to the creation of the fund.

<HEADLINE> Liberation Army Daily On Stationing Troops In Hong Kong Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- China's Law on Stationing
Troops in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), or
Garrison Law will ensure that the troops perform their duties
well, a commentator's article in today's Liberation Army Daily
says.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, the troops will go to station in Hong Kong to take
charge of the special administrative region's defense duty, which
"will be an important indication that China is resuming the
exercise of its sovereign over Hong Kong and put an end to the
rule of Britain in Hong Kong," the artile said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the "one country, two systems" policy, the
law explicitly defines the duties of the PLA troops to be
stationed in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
What image the troops will present to Hong Kong society is
matter of concern to the Party Central Committee, the State
Council and the Central Military Commission on one hand and the
residents of Hong Kong on the other.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Garrison Law has set strict demands on the tasks
and disciplines for the men of the stationed troops. And they are
expected to abide not only by national laws and army disciplines,
but also by the laws of the HK SAR, the commentator articles says.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the article says, the stationed troops should respect
Hong Kong's social system and way of life, and protect public
assets and personal property. And on no account, are they allowed
to engage in profit-making business or other activities that are
incompatible with the status of armymen.
</P>
<P>
The article goes on to note that the Garrison Law is the norm
of standards formulated by the state for the troops to be
stationed in Hong Kong to follow in carrying out various
activities,
</P>
<P>
The article prompts the troops and other military personnel to
acquaint themselves with the Garrison Law and prepare themselves
for its implementation.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that the troops to be stationed in Hong Kong,
who have undergone rigid education and formal training giving them
top-notch qualifications, will carry out their duties in strict
accordance with the law after they go to station in Hong Kong on
July 1, 1997, and prove themselves to be a army worthy of both
might and hight moral standards," the commentator's article says.

<HEADLINE> UK House Prices Set to Increase 7-8 Pct in 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- House prices in Britain are set
to increase by 7 or 8 percent in 1997-1998 as the country moves
towards a steadier housing market reminiscent of the 1960s,
according to a report of Britain's largest building society,
Halifax.
</P>
<P>
The Halifax forecast, in line with those of the other major
building societies, such as the Nationwide and Abbey National,
will help to cheer the government over the new year as it seeks to
foster a "feelgood factor" in the run-up to the general election
due to be held next May, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Halifax report stressed that the recovery should neither
run out of control, as in the late 1980s, nor be derailed by a
"moderate" rise in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"We do not forecast a boom that has to be halted by much
sharper rises in interest rates. A return to the steadier housing
market growth of the 1960s rather than the sharp fluctuations of
the past 25 years is a distinct possibility," it said.
</P>
<P>
The report also pointed out that the only danger was that too
strong a recovery would prompt higher interest rates or a further
withdrawal of tax relief on mortgages after an election.

<HEADLINE> US New Home Sales Up Sharply in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- New home sales in the U.S.
shot up by 14.2 percent in November, the largest advance in more
than three years, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that sales of single-family homes totaled a
seasonally adjusted 772,000 annual rate, up sharply from the sale
in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The department also revised down the sales in October to
676,000 from the initially estimated figure of 714,000. The
decrease pushed the sales rate below 700,000 for the first time in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The new home sales in November were the highest level since an
820,000 rate in August and the biggest increase since sales rose
by 16.6 percent in April 1993.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, sales of new homes in the U.S. were 13.2
percent above those in the first 11 months of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The big jump in new home sales resulted mainly from lower
mortgages in the country. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. has
reported that 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.62 percent
in November, down from 7.85 percent in October and 8.32 percent as
recently as last June.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales increased by 40.3 percent in Northeast, the
largest since sales rose 67.4 percent in December 1995. They rose
by 16 percent in the Midwest and 11.5 percent in the West. The
sales were up by 10.2 percent in the South, the largest gain since
sales increased 28.7 percent in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
The housing industry has been a major source of strength during
the six-year economic expansion in the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Association of Realtors also reported Monday
that sales of existing homes increased by 1.8 percent in November,
reversing a five-month string of declines.

HARARE, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's stockmarket, one of
Africa's largest stock markets, today ended the trading year
on a high note, with the key industrial index reaching an all-time
high of 8,786.26 points.
</P>
<P>
The index edged up another four points to draw the curtain on a
year that was characterised by a protracted bull-run caused by
increased foreign and institutional investor participantion, an
anticipated good agricultural season as well as falling interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
From just below 5,000 points at the end of last year, the index
has had a roller-coaster performance during the year to hover around
the 8,000-point mark during the greater part of the year.
</P>
<P>
Falling investment rates in the money market have discouraged most
investors, forcing them to turn to the stockmarket for better returns
on their investments.
</P>
<P>
In minings, trading continued quiet with coal producedr, Wankie,
edging up 40 cents to end the year at 600.

<P>
HARARE, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Cattle
Producers Association of Zimbabwe Les Mallet today called for
investment and funding to revive the country's beef industry.
</P>
<P>
Mallet appealed to the Agricultural Finance Corporation and
the Cold Storage Company to support the initiative and consider
operating medium-term cattle finance.
</P>
<P>
He also welcomed the easing of interest rates, saying if the
trend continued, it would become easier for the beef industry,
currently facing viability problems, to raise funds on the local
money market for on-lending.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates this year fell from above 30 percent by three
percentage points due to the fall in the reserve bank rediscount
rate, Mallet said, adding that it is the association's wish that the
year be as good as 1996.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the drought period of the 1991/92 season, the
national herd stood at approximately seven million and after the

<P>
LAGOS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Embassy in Nigeria
has cancelled its annual New Year party for its citizens living
in Nigeria following the hostage saga in the Japanese embassy
in Peru.
</P>
<P>
An embassy spokesman announced the cancellation, saying it had
received an order from Tokyo against "circumstances beyond our
control."
</P>
<P>
But analysts here said it might be connected with fear for
insecurity. Armed leftists rebels of Peru's Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement stormed the residence of the Japanese
ambassador in Peru on December 17 during a reception marking
Emperor Akihito's birthday and seized more than 650 hostages.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have so far released 570 of the hostages while
negotiations are still going on to free the rest.
</P>
<P>
According to the News Agency of Nigeria, there are about 100
Japanese residing in Nigeria. They usually perform rituals
associated with Japanese Shinto religion and Buddhism at the New
Year party.

MAPUTO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Minister of Foreign
Affairs and Cooperation, Leonardo Simao, confirmed here today
that his country has withdrawn from the Common Market of the
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
"It is in our interest that we engage ourselves in the
cooperation with Southern African Development Community (SADC)
instead of joining the COMESA, an organisation with more members
and more problems," said Simao.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Mozambique had merely signed an agreement to
join COMESA, but had never ratified the membership.
</P>
<P>
"it is our experience that the smaller the organisation is,
the better it can function, because in that case it would be more
convenient for its members to communicate and compromise with
each other," he said, referring to the SADC.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying that there is a danger of break-up for COMESA.
I'm just saying that Mozambique is not interested in joining it,"
said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Simao added that apart from doing business with SADC, his
country is also tapping potentials for closer business ties with
Southeast Asia and the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Croats Accuse Muslims of Checking Refugee Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 31 (Xinhua) -- A senior Bosnian Croat
official today blamed the Muslims for obstructing the return of
130,000 Croat refugees to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) leader in Bosnia Bozo
Rajic said in a new year message to the Croats that the
Muslim-Croat Federation would not work unless all banished Croats
return to Muslim-controlled areas next year.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Muslims and Croats formed the federation in March
of 1994 under the sponsorship of the United States. But due to
different national interests, the federation has failed to work
smoothly so far.
</P>
<P>
Rajic said the Croat side demanded that refugees of the
federation be repatriated in line with the principle of "all for
all," while Muslims asked for the refugee return on a "one for
one" basis.
</P>
<P>
If the Muslims' proposal is accepted, then 130,000 Croats will
not be able to return home because about 180,000 Croats have been
expelled from Muslim-controlled areas while 50,000 Muslims from
the Croat community of Herzeg-Bosna, he explained.
</P>

Speaking about the areas where Croat refugees should return,
Rajic included parts of the municipalities of Bugojno, Travnik,
Vares, Kakanj, and Zenica in central Bosnia-Herzegovina among the
"historical" Croat lands.
</P>
<P>
Even if the Croats could return to these areas, however, the
situation would still be difficult for them as the Muslims were
against the new Croat municipalities with full local
self-administration.

<HEADLINE> Swiss President Rejects Jewish Demand for Creation  of Compensation Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Swiss President Jean-Pascal
Delamuraz has rejected the demand for the creation of a
compensation fund of 250 million francs (about 200 million U.S.
dollars) for Nazi victims during World War Two, said local press
reports today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Swiss reporters Monday, Delamuraz said
that the creation of a compensation fund is not a good idea, which
could make the investigation of the alleged Jewish assets in Swiss
banks more difficult. He denounced the demand as "no less than
ransom and chantage."
</P>
<P>
"What should be done now is to have the facts come to light
rapidly and, especially, clearly," said Delamuraz. He said that an
investigation commission of experts established recently should
deal with issues concerning the alleged Jewish assets in
Switzerland before a conclusion is made.
</P>
<P>
According to the Swiss press, Jewish groups have asked the
Swiss government to set up a compensation fund during the
investigation, which is due to last three to five years.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Swiss Ambassador to the United States Thomas Borer,
head of a fact-finding task force of Jewish assets in Switzerland,
announced that Switzerland might set up a compensation fund in
1997.
</P>
<P>
However, Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti said on December
23 that he was opposed to the creation of the fund.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Pledges to Facilitate Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides pledged here today that he will do all he can to
facilitate the peace efforts toward a solution to the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
The president made the pledge in his new year message. However,
he said that he is not prepared to make any concessions that
would not secure the future of coming generations on the island.
</P>
<P>
"Any solution should secure the fundamental freedoms and
human rights, rid Cyprus of the Turkish occupation troops and
settlers and create such conditions, within the context of a
workable constitution, which would allow Greek Cypriots, Turkish
Cypriots, Armenians, Latins and Maronites to live together on
the island," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops
and took control of the northern third of the island following
a short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The problem has remained unsolved despite all the U.N. and
international peace efforts for the past 22 years.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, President Clerides reaffirmed today
that the republic's arms acquisition program will not be modified
regardless of any threats.
</P>
<P>
"I give you my word of honor, as Glafcos Clerides, as
President of the Republic of Cyprus and as a Cypriot, that
we shall not, no matter what the threat, alter the arms
purchasing program which we believe to be essential for our
defense," the president said during a visit to National Guard
posts along the demarcation line.
</P>
<P>
The resident referred to the statements by Turkish officials
that Turkey will not remain silent in the face of the Greek
Cypriot side's purchasing of arms of offensive nature.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has purchased tanks and armored vehicles from Russia
and now is negotiating a deal with Russians to buy anti-aircraft
missile system S-300.

<HEADLINE> 2 Islamic Militants Killed in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Two leading Islamic militants
suspected of a string of robberies and assaults were killed in a
shootout with state security police Tuesday in southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
An official source at the Ministry of Interior said the two
men, identified as Saleh Mahmoud Saleh and Hassan Abdel Mawla,
were killed near the town of Adwa, Minya, 220 kilometers south of
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
A machinegun, a local-made rifle, a sum of money and ammunition
were found with the two militants, the Egyptian MENA news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The source said the two persons were detected as carrying
machineguns in a bag by the security police, who laid an ambush as
part of the operation in hot pursuit of militants across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The two militants, believed to be local leaders of the
outlawed Jamaa Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, were involved in a
number of robberies and attacks.
</P>
<P>
They killed the owner of a jewellry shop in a forced break-in
and robbed the Bank of Agricultural Development and Credit in a
village in Minya and injured the bank manager.
</P>
<P>
They also attacked the chief officer at Kahk police station in
Fayoum, 90 kilometers southwest of Cairo, and killed eight civilians
during the assault.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they were charged of assaults on the Banque Misr
branch in Giza and the rest house of police officers, the interior
ministry source said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian police, which are targeted by the waves of violence,
have tightened security in southern Egypt where terrorist attacks
by suspected Moslem militants have broke out almost on a daily
basis.
</P>
<P>
The militants have waged a violent campaign against the
government since 1992 in an attempt to install Islamic rule in
Egypt. More than 1,035 people have died in the violence.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: PA Ready to Initial Agreement on Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat said today he was ready to
initial the agreement on Israeli army's redeployment in the West
Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who has been blamed by the Israelis for delaying the
negotiations on the Hebron redeployment, made the remarks in
Gaza, as the negotiations continued in Jerusalem to finalize the
details of the accord.
</P>
<P>
However, the summit meeting between Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Arafat, scheduled to open tonight at the
Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip to close the
deal, is likely to be held Wednesday to allow Netanyahu to
take part in the 1997 budget debate in the Knesset (Israel's
parliament).
</P>
<P>
A Marathon Debate on the budget has been held in the Knesset
plenum throughout the day, and will be resumed in the evening
again before the deadline at 6 a.m. local time (0400GMT)
Wednesday when the budget should be passed and made into law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, negotiators from both sides said that almost all
issues have been resolved with U.S. special Middle East
coordinator Dennis Ross, who arrived here Monday in a continued
shuttling between Netanyahu and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Ross met Netanyahu again this afternoon, with the
participation of the Israeli negotiating team who took part in
today's talks with the Palestinians, held in a hotel in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Ross and the negotiators left the hotel to
continue the discussions, before the U.S. envoy's scheduled travel
to the Gaza Strip again this evening to meet with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's office said after the Netanyahu-Ross
meeting this afternoon that "as up to now there is no summit
meeting schedule between the Israeli prime minister and Arafat
either for tonight, or for tomorrow."

<HEADLINE> Opposition Agrees Dialogue at Serbian Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Opposition Serbian Renewal
Movement (SPO) spokesman Ivan Kovacevic said today that the
opposition representatives would take part in panel discussions at
the Serbian assembly after election results were reinstated,.
</P>
<P>
The opposition coalition Zajedno (Together), formed by the SPO
with the Democratic Party and the Serbian Civil Alliance, has been
organizing demonstrations and rallies to protest against the
annulment of the local election results. The political
confrontation between the opposition and the Serbian government
has caused a crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Kovacevic told a press conference in Belgrade that dialogue
between the authorities and opposition on media, election
conditions and overall transformation of society was necessary.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, this dialogue could take place only after
"local election results are recognized."
</P>
<P>
"We are for dialogue, because Serbia cannot become an equal
partner of the international community, as it deserves, without
it," Kovacevic said.
</P>
<P>
The recognition of the annulled local election results was one
of the key demands of the opposition to cease massive
demonstrations and hold dialogue with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian parliament speaker proposed a panel debate last
week among the assembly deputies on the settlement of the
political crisis in Serbia, but the opposition, which has
boycotted most of the parliament sessions, has refused to take
part in the panel.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia to Normalize Ties With World Financial Bodies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Minister Without
Portfolio Vuk Ognjanovic said today that 1997 would be marked by
the normalization of relations between Belgrade and international
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the new year edition of the Belgrade
economic daily Privredni Pregled, Ognjanovic said the admission of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to the World Trade Organization
(WTO) was also the country's major task.
</P>
<P>
"Economic preconditions and conditions were created in which
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should and could have acted
differently, and not postponed the full normalization of
relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We really did everything that was...within the powers of the
federal institutions for relations with international financial
and trade organizations to be normalized," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
After the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia in 1991, the
rump Yugoslavia has so far failed to be admitted into the United
Nations and many other key international financial institutions,
such as the IMF and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"With the suspension and then the lifting of the sanctions, the
political reasons which the IMF usually gave practically ceased to
exist," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
On December 14, the IMF's board of directors extended for
another six months the deadline within which Yugoslavia should
regulate its membership with this institution. The IMF said the
membership would not be considered unless Yugoslavia had given up
its condition of the exclusive continuity with the former
federation of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"By postponing the deadline for the normalization of relations,
the IMF has inflicted serious damage to our country, because other
partners thus also partly suspended their activities and put off
the closure of the talks," Ognjanovic said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said talks with the London Club and at the World
Bank were expected in the second half of January since its
technical mission, which recently visited Belgrade, gave a good
report on what Yugoslavia was offering and asking at this time.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia is eager to join the international financial
organizations so as to get a large sum of loans and aid to revive
its economy which was devastated during the four-year-long
sanctions that were formally ended only three months ago.

<HEADLINE> Ethio-Djibouti Railway Company to Be Structured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister for
Transport and Communications Abdulmejid Hussien said here today
that a new organizational structure will soon be implemented for
the Ethio-Djibouti Railway Company.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of the 23rd Regular Meeting of the
Ethio-Djibouti Railway Company's Administative Council, Abdulmejid
said the new organizational structure will enable the company to
correct its shortcomings and become efficient and profitable.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the company which has served as a
significant economic tool for both countries during the past 90
years, registered poor performances for dozens of years,
due to obsolete machineries.
</P>
<P>
Abdulmejid said a study of the new organizational structure of
the company was conducted by experts drawn from Ethiopia and Djibouti
and included all the possible proposals for the improvement of the
company.
</P>
<P>
The study indicated that obsolete rails, locomotives and a
century old communication systems should be replaced by modern and
new ones to bring the company to efficiency and profitablity, the
Ethiopian minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the European Union, the Kuwait Fund, the World Bank and
the governments of France, Germany and Switzerland have expressed
readiness to give assistance for the improvement of the company in
line with the new study.
</P>
<P>
He added that six new locomotives will be acquired in six
months in a bid to increase the cargo capacity of the company and
measures are to be taken to improve its communication infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The 781-km Ethio-Djibouti railway was built at the beginning of
this century and administrated by both Ethiopian and Djiboutian
governments. enditem

<HEADLINE> South Africa to Hasten Reconstruction: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said on the new year's eve that his government
will speed up national reconstruction next year.
</P>
<P>
In his new year's message, Mandela said "1996 draws to close
as South Africa enters a new stage in the nation's efforts to
build a better life for all".
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa's first democratically elected government
has laid solid foundations, stressing that the signing into law
of the new constitution has paved the way for speedy national
development.
</P>
<P>
On achievements South Africa obtained in the past year,
Mandela said, South Africans could be proud of the increased
access to domestic water, electricity and health care and of a
national education system bringing quality education to all.
</P>
<P>
While the land reform and housing programs were firmly on
track, the president said, the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission also had proved itself a powerful instrument of
healing and reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
On problems of violence and crimes, Mandela said, "we have
taken the war against the criminals, and we are gaining the upper
hand. This we owe to our security forces and to every South
African who has joined the campaign to combat crime."
</P>
<P>
Referring to correct attitude towards the current
difficulties, Mandela said, the year 1997 would be a testing time
for the South African government and people.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africans should keep their sights on the
long-term in order to be able to manage the ebbs and flows of the
present.

Council President Francesco Paolo Fulci of Italy told the press
that members of the council "expressed their serious concern over
lack of progress in efforts to solve the questions of prisoners of
war and missing persons of Kuwait and third nationality."
</P>
<P>
The council also expressed displeasure over Iraq's failure to
return properties of the government of Kuwait, including the
"official documents removed from national archives seized by
Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is something like the loss of memory for an entire
nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted Iraq's recent failure to cooperate with weapon
inspectors of the UN Special Commission, who were twice blocked to
remove the destroyed missile engines for analysis in the United
States in November and earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The council issued a presidential statement on the question
Monday, expressing support for the Special Commission and urging
Iraq to cooperate with the Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has imposed harsh economic sanctions on Iraq
since its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. To alleviate the
consequences of the embargoes, the Security Council adopted
Resolution 986 in April 1995, allowing Iraq to export oil worth 2
billion dollars in six months for import of food, medicine and
other civil goods. The implementation of the resolution started
early this month under strict supervision of the UN experts.

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Concerned Over Food Situation in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 31 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin
Mkapa today urged Tanzanians to carefully use available food,
warning that many parts of the country will in 1997 be hit by
food shortage because of scarcity of short rains.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the new year message, President Mkapa said that the
government will take all necessary measures to ensure there is
normal supply of food.
</P>
<P>
He asked farmers to reserve their stocks instead of selling
them all.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that short rains have not started in many
parts of our country, and we should, therefore, use our food
carefully," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the food situation in the 1995/96 farming season
was impressive, saying that there was an increase of 2.4 percent
in food grain.
</P>
<P>
He asked Tanzanians to increase agricultural and industrial
production.
</P>
<P>
The president directed all government officials, including
those in rural areas, to speed up production processes at their
respective areas.
</P>
<P>
He asked every Tanzanian to co-operate with his government in
development activities, saying that the government will put more
efforts in improving the national economy.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: Cyprus Issue: Stalemate in 1996, Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.N.-proposed package includes unmanning of the areas
where the two sides are at close proximity with each other, the
prohibition of loaded weapons along the cease-fire line and the
code of conduct for the military along the cease-fire line.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official has expressed optimism that an agreement
will be reached soon.
</P>
<P>
The intensive international peace moves on Cyprus also
included the visit of the representative of the Irish presidency
of the European Union (EU), Kester Heaslip.
</P>
<P>
Heaslip expected that direct talks between the leaders of the
two communities for a Cyprus settlement will begin by March next
year, and hoped a solution to the Cyprus problem would be reached
in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
His expectation was echoed by British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind, who paid a two-day official visit to the island
this month, during which he had separate talks with Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind put forward a 10-point proposal, which he hopes
President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash will turn
into the provisions of a detailed settlement.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that before the end of the first half of 1997,
there should be an open-ended session of face-to-face
negotiations between the two sides under the aegis of the U.N.,
and hoped that both leaders will work whole-heartedly and
energetically for a settlement in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind also reiterated his position that he favored Cyprus-EU
membership talks to be conducted after a federation is
established, the view which has been criticized by Cypriot
politicians on the island.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided last year that accession talks with Cyprus
will start six months after the end of the EU Intergovernmental
Conference.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here noted that some EU members have used
the EU accession talks as a pressure on the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot sides to reach an early settlement.
</P>
<P>
However, the gap between the two sides has remained wide on
the main aspects of the Cyprus problem, with focus on security of
the two communities, guarantees, the issue of EU accession,
territorial and constitutional matters.
</P>
<P>
Both President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash,
however, have emphasised that "1997 is the year of opportunity."
</P>
<P>
There are signs that there is a change in the attitude of the
two communities' leaders toward their desirability of having
face-to-face negotiations in the first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
If this happens, it will be the first direct negotiations
between the two leaders since May 1993 when President Clerides and
Denktash met under the U.N. auspices in New York.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and seized the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks, aimed at reuniting the island
under a bizonal and bicommunal federal state, have been held on
and off for the past 22 years, but so far no tangible results
have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the task facing Cyprus in 1997
should not be underestimated, there is a prospect of direct
negotiation between the two sides; and in the event of this, a
major step will be taken toward a comprehensive settlement of the
protracted Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: Mideast-North Africa Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Although the economic
cooperation between the Middle East and north African nations,
launched at the first Mideast-North Africa Economic Summit two
years ago, greatly backslided in 1996, the blue-print of the
scheme is still kept there to be adopted.
</P>
<P>
The third Mideast-North Africa Economic Conference held in the
Egyptian capital of Cairo in November has saved the process of
economic cooperation from collapse and kept alive the wish of the
regional states to shape another economic block for much better
status in the international rivalry in the future.
</P>
<P>
The first Mideast-North Africa Economic Summit convened in the
Moroccan city of Casablanca in November 1994 set forth the idea
of economic cooperation between foes and allies alike in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The concept, which for the first time was welcomed and
supported not only by Arab nations and Israel but also by the
international community, was developed at the second summit in
the Jordanian capital of Amman in November 1995. At the Amman
summit, concrete rules and norms were worked out, thus building
an atmosphere of trust that geared up the momentum.
</P>
<P>
At the Casablanca summit, leaders of most Arab countries and
Israel gathered under the same roof for the first time to discuss
ways of promoting economic cooperation between the Middle East
and north African nations.
</P>
<P>
It led to the withdrawal or halt of the boycott of Israel by
Arab states, turning foes into partners after half a decade of
enmity.
</P>
<P>
At the Amman summit, it was agreed to establish a
Mideast-north Africa development bank, a regional council of
businessmen and a regional tourism council. Since then
encouraging signs of regional economic cooperation, including
Arab-Israeli economic cooperation, have emerged.
</P>
<P>
But the Likud government of Israel headed by Binyamin
Netanyahu who came into power in May 1996 has adopted a chain of
hardline policies that blocked the Middle East peace process and
are greatly detrimental to the momentum of regional economic
cooperation gained at the first summit.
</P>
<P>
Although the third Mideast-North Africa Economic Conference
was convened on schedule and the regional nations do cherish the
idea of collective action, the prospects of economic cooperation
between the Middle East and north-African nations in the
foreseeable future are not much encouraging because of
difficulties lying ahead.

<P>
The first difficulty is the lack of political guarantee as
Arab-Israeli relations have receded.
</P>
<P>
As soon as Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu came into power,
he declared "three No's", announcing that Israel would not
withdraw from the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, would not allow
Jerusalem to be partitioned and would not agree to setting up an
independent Palestinian state. He even threatened to cancel the
Oslo accords reached by Israel with the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) in 1993. Hence the Middle East peace process
was once again stumbled.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's actions have triggered a wave of indignation and
condemnation from Arab countries and spoiled the favorable
atmosphere for further Arab-Israeli cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The second difficulty facing economic cooperation between the
Middle East and north-African nations is that inter-Arab economic
cooperation has its own obstacles.
</P>
<P>
Facts have shown that it is easy to talk about Arab-Arab
cooperation while it is difficult to translate such cooperation
into a reality.
</P>
<P>
The third problem is the failure to establish three
already-declared institutions.
</P>
<P>
Both the Casablanca and Amman economic summits called for
establishing a Mideast-north Africa development bank, a regional
council of businessmen and a regional tourism council. But the
Cairo conference failed to set dates for the establishment of
those institutions.
</P>
<P>
The fourth problem is the lack of infrastructure. It is
estimated that investments needed for infrastructure projects in
the Middle East and north Africa amount to 350 billion
U.S. dollars during the period from 1997 to 2006, a sum
impossible to raise by the countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East and north Africa, with an area of more than 15
million square kilometers and a population of 300 million, have
great potentials for economic development, but the blueprint
approved by the three conferences can be turned into a reality
only after real peace prevails in the region.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Welcomes Qatari Decision to Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain today expressed
appreciation of Qatar's decision to return a Bahraini military
helicopter which landed at Doha airport Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bahrain demanded that Nasser Majid Nasser al
Khalifa, the Bahraini pilot who flew the helicopter and asked for
political asylum in Qatar, be handed over to the Bahraini
authorities at the earliest possible time.
</P>
<P>
A statement to this effect was made today by Bahraini
Information Minister Mohammad al-Muttawa to the Gulf news agency.
</P>
<P>
The minister said in his statement that the pilot was not
banned from going abroad, and could go to any other country
whenever he wished.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari government decided to return the military plane to
Bahrein, while granting asylum to the pilot and giving him the
freedom of choice whether to stay on in Qatar or to return to the
Bahraini capital of Manama, or to go to anywhere else he wants.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari news agency quoted a Qatari Foreign Ministry source
as saying earlier today that Qatar had sent an official note to
the Bahraini Foreign Ministry in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The source noted that Qatar, taking into account the existing
fraternal relations between the two countries and peoples, decided
to return the military plane to Bahrain, while granting political
asylum to the pilot.
</P>
<P>
Both Bahrain and Qatar are members of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC), but they have a territorial dispute that has led to
Bahrain's boycott of the GCC summit convened in the Qatari capital
of Doha on December 7-9. This was the first such incident since
the GCC's foundation in 1981.

<HEADLINE> Arafat-Netanyahu Summit Due to Seal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 31 (Xinhua) -- A summit between Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat will be held Wednesday to seal the Hebron deal, Israel
Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that the Arafat-Netanyahu summit will be held
Wednesday afternoon at the Erez checkpoint between Israel and
the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the summit would have taken place today in
 order to meet the new year deadline, but Netanyahu was too busy
in the Knesset (Parliament) to make this schedule, Netanyahu's
spokesman Shai Bazak was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset is holding heated debate, which will last till
early Wednesday morning, on passing the 1997 budget, which
Netanyahu wanted to see it passed before going to deal with the
Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Due to the strong opposition even within his coalition,
Netanyahu wanted to make sure that his coaliation partners would
support the budget to avoid a possible government crisis. The
budget, which is to cut 7 billion shekels (2.3 billion dollars),
has aroused strong protests from various walks of life in the
Jewish states.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross held a meeting
with Netanyahu but failed to fix the summit for late today as
was predicted by local media.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who returned to the region Monday, held separate
meetings with Netanyahu and Arafat Monday night to bridge the
remaining gap between the two sides. Arafat said he was willing
to hold a meeting with Netanyahu later today to wrap up the
long-delayed deal on the Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said the Hebron agreement had in fact been
completed and was only waiting for the two leaders'
signature. Until today, the two sides were said to be split over
the issues of conducting joint police patrols near the Tomb of
Patriachs in Hebron and the timetable for Israeli troop's further
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side insisted on the demand for joint patrols
near the Tomb of Patriachs, the religious shrine holy to both
Jews and Moslems. But Netanyahu rejected such demand, saying
Israel would retain sole security control in the area to protect
the holy site and the safety of 450 settlers living among
200,000 Palestinians in the city.
</P>
<P>
If the Hebron deal is signed, it will be the first
breakthrough in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process which has
been virtually stalled since Israel's hardline Likud government
took power in June.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: Cyprus Issue: Stalemate in 1996, Hope for Progress in 1997 (I) (By Huang Jianming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The year 1996 witnessed
another stalemate in the intermittent efforts to solve the
country's problem and ease tension along the 180-kilometer-long
buffer zone across this East Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Parties involved, however, still hopes for a breakthrough in
working out a solution to the long-standing Cyprus problem in the
first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Greece and Turkey were once on the brink of
open hostilities over the sovereignty of uninhabited islets in the
Aegean, which affected the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The United States, who claimed to impose a solution to the
Cyprus problem in 1996, postponed its initiative due to the
killing of a Greek Cypriot and later the U.S. presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
In June, tension between the opposing forces were on the rise
after Greek Cypriot soldier Stelios Panagyi was shot dead when he
reportedly went to exchange hats with a Turkish Cypriot soldier
in the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. permanent representative to the U.N. Madeleine
Albright came to the island in July, brokering an agreement on a
meeting between commanders of the National Guard, the Cyprus armed
forces and Turkish forces in Cyprus. The move was aimed at
easing tension along the Green Line.
</P>
<P>
However, the agreement failed to take effect due to the Turkish
side's insistence that the commanders of Turkish Cypriot forces
also participate in the talks. The Turkish demand was rejected by
the Greek Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
In August, tension escalated again when some Greek Cypriots
demonstrated against the Turkish occupation near the
U.N.-controlled buffer zone, resulting in clashes between the two
sides and two unarmed Greek Cypriots were killed consequently.
</P>
<P>
Clashes intermittently plagued the island. Since June this
year, four Greek Cypriots have been killed and a Turkish soldier
mysteriously murdered in the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, both of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides
staged military exercises with the participation of Greek and
Turkish warplanes.
</P>
<P>
The fatal incidents and military buildup on the island prompted
the U.N. and international community to intensify their peace
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali sent his
special representative for Cyprus Han Sung Joo to the island in a
bid to break the impasse and bring about early direct talks
between leaders of the two communities.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council also adopted a resolution in June,
expressing serious concern about the continued modernization and
upgrading of military forces in Cyprus, excessive levels of
military forces and armaments as well as lack of progress toward
a significant reduction in the number of foreign troops on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. auspices, an indirect military dialogue between
Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides is now underway, with the aim to
ease tension along the cease-fire line.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. resident representative in Cyprus Gustave
Feissel, the two sides have agreed to deal with the entire
package of measures which the U.N. suggested.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: Solution to Israeli-Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The summit between Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat will be held Wednesday to seal the Hebron deal, Israel
Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The long-delayed Hebron deal between the Israelis and
Palestinians will be the first major development since the
right-wing Israeli government assumed power last June as it would
pave the way for further progresses in negotiations between
Israel and Palestine and between Israel and other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interim Agreement, known as Oslo II, the
Israeli army was originally supposed to complete its redeployment
in the Hebron area by March 28.
</P>
<P>
However, following a series of suicide bombing attacks in
Israel last February and March, which left more than 60 people
dead and some 100 wounded, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres
delayed the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Peres, defeated by Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu in the
elections on May 29, said afterward that he would leave the
decision of the redeployment to the new prime minister and his
government.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 30 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a place
of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Moslems alike, and
tradition has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their
wives are all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram al-Khalil, or
the Ibrahimi Mosque).
</P>
<P>
In Hebron, unique among the West Bank cities, Jews live side
by side with Palestinians, approximately 450 Jewish settlers
among 200,000 Arabs, which explains why until now Hebron remains
the only major West Bank town still under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
Israel had completed its army's redeployment by the end of
last year in the other West Bank towns of Jenin, Tulkarm,
Kalkilya, Nablus, Ramallah and Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
The name "Hebron" is thought to come from the Hebrew HAVER
(friend), while in Arabic, the town is called Al-Khalil, with a
similar meaning, after Abraham (Ibrahim) "the friend of God."
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the city has been split into two, the north cut
off from the south by a series of roadblocks and check points set
up to secure the Jewish neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
In order to minimize friction between the Jewish and
Palestinian populations, the Israelis ordered the nearby market,
the now well-known Shuhada Street, and the bus station closed,
and extra security measures were introduced throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo II, 80 percent of Hebron is to be handed over
to the Palestinian Authority (PA), which will be able to deploy
400 uniformed policemen with 200 pistols and 100 assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 20 percent of the city, the eastern side that
includes the Jews, the Tomb of the Patriarchs, and about 12,000
Palestinians, will remain under Israeli control, as will the
roads linking the city to Kiryat Arba, home to 6,000 Jewish
settlers.
</P>
<P>
In October, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators started a new
round of continuous talks on the redeployment in Hebron, which
had already been delayed for more than half a year.
</P>
<P>
At the talks, Israel insisted on changes in the security
arrangements agreed upon under the Oslo accords, in light of the
violent confrontations between Israelis and Palestinians in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip in September.

<P>
During the confrontations, triggered by the opening of the
Hasmonean Tunnel by Israel in Jerusalem's Old City, more than 70
people were killed and hundreds of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the confrontations, U.S. President Bill Clinton
called for an emergency summit in Washington to resuscitate the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
As one of the few results of the summit, Israel and Palestine
agreed to hold round-the-clock talks in an attempt to resolve
their differences on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
However, after four weeks of continuous talks, with the
participation of U.S. special Middle East coordinator Dennis
Ross, both sides failed to complete a deal.
</P>
<P>
In November, they once again tried to close the Hebron deal
through U.S. mediation, but failed at the last minute to work out
an agreement on the security arrangement and other related issues.
</P>
<P>
Israel media then reported that the main stumbling blocks
continued to be the right of "hot pursuit of terrorists" into
the Palestinian-ruled areas required by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel also requested reducing the number of individual
weapons Palestinian police would be carrying, insisting that the
Palestinian policemen should be armed with revolvers instead of
rifles as stipulated in Oslo II.
</P>
<P>
Clinton sent Ross to the region again in another effort to
help Israelis and Palestinians to narrow their differences over
the Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
After two days of continuous shuttle, the U.S. envoy finally
brought Netanyahu and PA President Yasser Arafat together for a
summit meeting, the first between the two since the Washington
summit in October.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Netanyahu and Arafat made key
security-related "trade-offs" and instructed their negotiators to
accelerate work on details of a Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Israeli senior officials revealed that under the "trade-offs,"
the Palestinians adhere to "perimeter zones" outside the Jewish
areas of Hebron, where restrictions on Palestinians using rifles
will prevent sniping at settlers.
</P>
<P>
In return, Israel will relinquish its insistence on explicit
language that would enable it to act preemptively against
potential attacks from the Palestinian controlled area.
</P>
<P>
The Hebron agreement is reportedly to be accompanied by a
U.S. document, currently entitled "Note for the Record," in which
"reciprocal" Palestinian obligations to Israel and Israeli
obligations to the Palestinians beyond Hebron will be spelled
out.
</P>
<P>
This document will also contain the date of the first Israeli
army pullback beyond Hebron, something mandated by Oslo II,
which is expected to occur in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected that the U.S. document will note other
unresolved issues, such as prisoner releases, establishment of
the Dahaniya airport in the Gaza Strip, implementing
safe-passage routes between the West Bank and Gaza, and further
easing of closure.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel is insisting that the Palestinians "first
and foremost" enumerate what parts of the PLO Covenant have been
abrogated, disarm Hamas, and reduce the number of Palestinian
policemen in accordance with ceilings set in Oslo II.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the Hebron redeployment would put the peace
process back on track, and pave the way for further progresses in
negotiations between Israel and Palestinians, and between Israel
and other Arab countries.

In walking out of the U.N. Secretariat Building accompanied by
his aids and security guards, he warmly shook hands with the staff

NEW YORK, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average dove 101 points today, sliding into the close of 1996
after some unexpectedly strong economic data.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 101.10 points to
6,448.27. It was the biggest one-day point drop since a 161-point
plunge on July's 15. But the famed barometer of 30 big U.S.
companies, now below 6,500-mark, still has a healthy 26 percent
gain for the year.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,298 up, with volume reaching
395.15 million shares, as against 339.01 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 13.11 to 740.74,
leaving the widely watched index of large companies with a gain of
about 20.3 percent on the year.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 35.13 to 392.29, ending 1996
with a 19.1 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 3.27 to 1,291.02, up 22.7
percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
The American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 0.18 to
583.28, up 6.4 percent on the year.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 list of smaller companies rose 2.62 to 362.61,
up 14.8 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market measures fell sharply too, ending a surprisingly
lucrative year on a discouraging note.
</P>
<P>
Stocks dropped with bonds after the Commerce Department said
new home sales shot up 14.2 percent to 772,000 in November, the
steepest advance in 3 years and more and fresh evidence the
housing industry continues to help drive the economy.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, meanwhile, the Conference Board research
group said consumer confidence rose sharply to a seven-year high
in December, its second straight monthly increase.
</P>
<P>
The reports jostled widespread hopes that the pace of the
economy has moderated enough to contain inflationary pressures
such as rising production costs.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices fell, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
jumped from late Monday's 6.54 percent to 6.64 percent.
</P>
<P>
Banks and other financial issues, which enjoy a smaller profit
margin on the loans they make when interest rates rise, were among
the day's weakest groups.
</P>
<P>
The Dow's biggest decliners included several of the year's
leaders, including General Electric and IBM.

<HEADLINE> Man Shot Outside Home of Alleged Former Nazi in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- A man was shot and wounded
by police outside home of an alleged former Nazi, whose U.S.
citizenship was sought by the Justice Department to be revoked.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear if the elderly man was Michael
Kolnhofer, 79, of Kansas City, Kansas, an immigrant suspected of
being a former concentration camp guard and member of the
Waffen-SS during the World War II.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the Justice Department's Office of Special
Investigations (OSI) in Washington filed court papers seeking to
strip him of his U.S. citizenship that often lead to deportation.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report said at the home listed by federal
officials as Kolnhofer's address, a man came out and waved a black
handgun at reporters and said, "Are you going to go away? Are you
going to go away?"
</P>
<P>
The man cocked the gun and pointed it at several reporters, who
scrambled for cover, it said.
</P>
<P>
When police were called to the scene, the man fired shots and
police returned fire.
</P>
<P>
Citing captured wartime Nazi records, the Justice Department
said Kolnhofer in January 1943 became a member of the SS Death's
Head Guard Battalion at Sachsenhausen, near Berlin, where he served
as a guard until January 1944.
</P>
<P>
SS personnel records show Kolnhofer was transferred in January
1944 to Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar, Germany.
</P>
<P>
"The defendant concealed his Nazi concentration camp guard
service from U.S. immigration officials when he immigrated to this
country from Germany in 1952, and he never would have received a
U.S. visa had he disclosed the truth," the OSI said in a statement
today.
</P>
<P>
To date, 57 former Nazis have been revoked of U.S. citizenship
and 48 have been removed from the United States since OSI began
operation in 1979, the U.S. attorney's office said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy indicated
surprising signs of strength today as reports showed consumer
confidence at a seven-year high and new home sales up
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a business research group based in New
York, said its Consumer Confidence Index for December rose
markedly by 4.3 points from November to 113.8, its highest level
since November 1989, when it reached 115.1.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Commerce Department reported new home sales
unexpectedly rose 14.2 percent in November, the steepest advance
in 3 years and more.
</P>
<P>
The figures were well above economists' estimates.
</P>
<P>
Both reports disappointed financial markets, which have been
hoping for continued signs of moderate economic growth and low
inflation that have spurred big gains throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
The yield on the Treasury's main 30-year bond rose 0.09
percentage point to 6.63 percent. Blue-chip stock prices plunged,
with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 101.10 points to
6,448.27, the biggest since a 161.05-point drop July 15.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Confidence Index, calculated from a 1985 base of
100, is derived from responses to questions sent to 5,000
households nationwide, polling them on matters ranging from job
availability to home-buying plans.
</P>
<P>
A separate measure of sentiment about current business
conditions rose to a seven-year high of 136.4 in December, up
three points from November.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30 percent of surveyed families described current
business conditions as good in December and only 6 percent of
consumers expected conditions to deteriorate, the lowest figure in
eight years.
</P>
<P>
About 14 percent said jobs were difficult to find this month,
down from 17 percent in November.

<HEADLINE> Murders Rate Drops in Major U.S. Cities in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The rate of murders in most
of U.S. cities has dropped in 1996 due to the reenforcement of
police and tougher punishment to criminals, the Police Executive
Research Forum said today.
</P>
<P>
Boston and New York dropped to their lowest levels since the
1960s. As of Tuesday morning, Boston had 58 murders, fewer than
any 12-month period since 1966.
</P>
<P>
In New York, murders have dropped more than 50 percent since
1990, from 2,245 to fewer than 1,000 in 1996, the lowest number
since 1968. Phoenix kept the number of homicides to 205 in 1996
from 244 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
As of December 14, Los Angeles reported 688 homicides, 141 less
than the same period last year, or an 11.1 percent drop. And
Dallas reported 219 homicide toll in 1996, half its homicide toll
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The drop of murders rate coincideds with the increase of police
forces in the cities. Over the past two years, Boston has added
300 officers and New York put 7,000 more police officers in the
street. Phoenix has increased the 10 percent of its law
enforcement force since last year.
</P>
<P>
The drops were also attributed to longer, mandatory sentences
for violent criminals and a decline in the number of men in their
late teens and early 20s.
</P>
<P>
However, some big cities, including Atlanta, Las Vegas, Miami
and Washington, reported higher numbers of homicides.

<HEADLINE> CIA Says Bosnia Has No Military, Intelligence Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) said today Bosnia has broken military and
intelligence ties with Iran and no organized foreign forces remain
on its soil, a condition for the U.S. to go ahead with a plan to
train and equip troops of the Balkan country early next year.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic was credited with taking an
aggressive approach in breaking with Iran. "He recognizes his
relationship with us is more important than anything he could have
with Iran," said John Dinger, a State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The largely Muslim government in Bosnia-Herzegovina made
liberal use of weapons from Iran and other Muslim countries to
fight Serbs in their conflicts before U.S.-led negotiations that
produced peace accords a year ago.
</P>
<P>
After the Dayton peace accords were signed, scores of Iranian
and other foreign fighters remained behind. The western nations
showed their concern about it and delayed delivery of weapons to
Bosnian forces under a "train-and-equip" program designed to put
them on a relatively equal footing with Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
American intelligence has concluded Bosnia has severed its
military and intelligence links with Iran, Central Intelligence
Agency spokesman David Christian said Tuesday.

SHANGHAI, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest

RIO DE JANEIRO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Joao Havelange
reaffirmed on Tuesday that he would stand down as president of
FIFA, international soccer's governing body, when his mandate
expired in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
"I will be 82 by then and the descent to 86 is fast," he told
the Jornal do Brasil daily newspaper in an interview. "I want to
spend more time with my grandchildren and not have to worry about
airline timetables."
</P>
<P>
He said he would not back any possible replacement. "I'm not
going to propose anyone. I have a lot of friends and it would not
be correct to give one of them my preference."
</P>
<P>
He promised that 1998 World Cup would be "a show of
organisation in modern installations" and claimed that football
could succeed where politics had failed.
</P>
<P>
"Only football has the power to solve the problems of
international conflicts...In Asia and the East, we have had
football matches between countries in conflict."
</P>
<P>
Havelange claimed that he had an average of 800 hours' flying
time year and said he had visited 186 countries since taking over
as president in 1974.
</P>
<P>
He said that each of the 32 finalists at the 1998 World Cup in
France would receive one million U.S. dollars per game played from
FIFA. "In the past, the teams spent a lot of money on the World
Cup. Today, it is when they get their biggest income."

"Few players can be relaxed if the results don't come,"
Savicevic told Italian RAI television.

"There is still time for agreement. I hope to stay at Milan,"

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Grain Production Hits New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Xinjiang, a major bread basket in
northwest China, produced over eight million tons of grain in
1996, up by 700,000 tons over that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The new record was broken after the Uygur autonomous region
achieved an annual grain increase of 200,000 to 300,000 tons each
year in the past few years and suffered from a major natural
disaster in 1996, said Zhang Hen, vice chairman of the autonomous
region.
</P>
<P>
Zhang attributed the new bumper harvest to the increase in sown
areas, larger investment and greater application of new
agro-technologies.
</P>
<P>
The construction of water-saving and grain production projects
as well as China's latest increase in grain purchasing prices in
1996 have encouraged local farmers in grain production, prompting
them to buy more chemical fertilizer, farm machines and new
agro-technologies, he said.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Rebels Release Two More Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian rebels occupying the
residence of the Japanese ambassador here released two more
hostages today, leaving 81 hostages in the compound.
</P>
<P>
The two men were identified as Honduran Ambassador Jose Eduardo
Martel Mejia and Argentine Consul General Juan Antonio Ibanez.
</P>
<P>
They, accompanied by Red Cross officials, walked out the
Japanese ambassador's residence just hours before New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
The release of the Honduran ambassador came shortly before
Honduran Foreign Minister Delmer Urbizo Panting arrived here at
18:30 local time.
</P>
<P>
The rebels allowed reporters and photographers to enter the
residence of Japanese Ambassador Morihisa Aoki for the first time
today since a group of some 20 rebels of the Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) occupied the compound on December 17.
</P>
<P>
Four hostages, including Peruvian Foreign Minister Francisco
Tudela, Congressman Gilberto Siura and Ambassador Morihisa Aoki,
were allowed to meet the press.
</P>
<P>
Tudela said that he was going through difficult times in the
past few days and he was reading and thinking about his country.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader, Nestor Cerpa Cartolini, read a message to
reporters, insisting that some 400 imprisoned MRTA members be set
free from jails to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
His tough public line contradicted earlier hints that the
rebels might soften their demands.
</P>
<P>
Cerpa Cartolini proposed that the crisis be solved with no
"losers or winners."
</P>
<P>
The local radio station "Programa" reported that President
Alberto Fujimori and Domingo Palermo, the government delegate for
the hostage crisis, met later in the day to discuss the MRTA
message.
</P>
<P>
The International Red Cross Committee in a bulletin emphasized
its intention to contribute to the establishment of direct
contacts between the government mediator and the MRTA commando.

<P>
Guangzhou, January 1 (Xinhua ) -- A new trend in China's
Guangdong Province is for large and medium-sized industries to
invest in farming, and to run farms as large-scale businesses, a
move that has intensified agricultural development, according to
some local experts.
</P>
<P>
The companies have invested in growing fruit, forestry, and
raising fish, and are building farm products-processing factories
in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of last year, over 50 local companies drew
up plans to invest several billion yuan in farming, and so far,
over one billion yuan has been put into the area, according to
provincial statistics.
</P>
<P>
With the extra funds, the companies have introduced new
technology and management to the agricultural sector, bringing a
large number of farmers to intensively-managed, modernized
agricultural production, and allowing them to reduce their risk.
</P>
<P>
Most of the companies have shown a profit and have helped
farmers have a better life, according to the experts, who say that
industrialized production and better management could make
agriculture one of the most profitable sectors.
</P>
<P>
Some of the companies have expanded their investment to other
provinces in northeast and northwest China, which are the
country's major grain and cotton producers.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Lifts Ban on Russian-Made Helicopters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 1 (Xinhua) -- A ban on passenger services by
Russian-made Mi-17 helicopters in Nepal was lifted only hours
after it came into effect, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The government has granted permits to operators of the
Russian-made helicopters allowing them to continue passenger
operations soon after the ban was imposed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Civil Aviation had earlier announced that the
existing 12 Mi-17s in the country, belonging to four private
airlines, would be forbidden to carry out passenger operations
starting December 30 because of safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
Helicopter operators complained that such a ban would have an
adverse impact on the country's tourism industry and obstruct
disaster relief operations in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
They said the Russian-made helicopters, which began their
commercial services in Nepal in 1993 and account for about 46
percent of Nepal's domestic air seat capacity, have made a
significant contribution to the transportation of goods and
passengers to remote hilly areas, especially some favorite tourist
destinations.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the Department of Civil Aviation would set up
a technical committee, comprising experts from the government and
private airlines, to study the passenger-carrying capabilities of
the Mi-17 helicopters.
</P>
<P>
A final ruling on these helicopters is to be made on the basis
of the technical committee's report, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> India to Introduce New Population Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 1 (Xinhua) -- India is expected to introduce
a new national population policy soon in a bid to curb population
explosion in the country, a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft of the new national population policy,
which is on the anvil, all new entrants to the government who are
married before the legal age will be debarred from recruitment.
</P>
<P>
Steps will also be taken to see that the two-child norm is
adopted by government employees both at the national and state
levels. Promotion policies will also be formulated to encourage
the two-child norm in an effort to control growth in the country's
population, which is expected to exceed 1 billion by the turn of
the century.
</P>
<P>
The new policy will make it mandatory for employers of the
organized sector to provide for group health insurance as
incentive. Besides, legislation will be enacted to debar from
elective offices those people who do not adopt the small family
norm.
</P>
<P>
The draft population policy also stresses the need for men to
be equal partners in family planning.
</P>
<P>
It warns that if the population policy goes wrong, "nothing
else will have a chance to go right."

<HEADLINE> India, Bangladesh Start Sharing Ganges Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- India and Bangladesh today
formally started sharing the common Ganges water after India
opened 75 sluice-gates of its Farakka barrage at 06:30 a.m. local
time (0030 GMT) in implementation of an agreement between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
India and Bangladesh signed a 30-year water-sharing treaty on
December 12, 1996, to resolve their long-standing dispute over the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh had accused India of withdrawing the Ganges water at
the upper stream, thus greatly reducing the water flowing into
Bangladesh during the dry season beginning in January.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, the release of the Ganges water through
the Farakka will enable Bangladesh to irrigate vast tracts of
land, increase underground water level, check desertification and
ease salinity in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
To monitor the flow of water, Indian experts have been staying
at the Farakka point since December 25 while Bangladeshi water
experts are expected to arrive there at noon today.

<HEADLINE> Child Rights in Nepal in "Depressing" State: NGO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 1 (Xinhua) -- A non-governmental
organization (NGO) in Nepal described the state of child rights in
the country as "depressing" in its annual report released here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Child Workers in Nepal (CWIN) Concerned Center said that
despite positive developments, child rights violations are still
common in Nepal in forms like child labor, child marriage and
trafficking of children for forced prostitution.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that 1 million Nepali children are engaged
in child labor, with about 60 percent of them working in high-risk
conditions, such as the sex trade, mines, stone quarries and the
carpet industry.
</P>
<P>
It also said that every year some 4,000 to 5,000 Nepali
children, mostly girls, are trafficked into neighboring India for
prostitution or bonded labor.
</P>
<P>
Despite the prohibition of child marriage by a law enacted more
than 30 years ago, such marriages still prevail in rural and poor
urban areas in the country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The CWIN report also noted some favorite developments in
protecting child rights in Nepal, such as the government's
commitment to the implementation of the U.N. Convention on Child
Rights, a national plan of action for protecting child rights and
an increasing social awareness on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The NGO report urged the government to provide free and
compulsory education for children in the country.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Vows to Resist Ruling Party's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP), the country's main opposition, has warned the government
that the party will soon build resistance instead of just
protesting against the ruling party's "conspiracy" to run
parliament without opposition.
</P>
<P>
The BNP, the second largest party in the parliament next to the
ruling Awami League (AL), walked out of the house on November 10
to press for its 10-point demand including a "neutral role" of the
speaker and the state-run Bangladesh TV as well as halting
"repression" on BNP workers.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the BNP's peasant front -- the Jatiyatabadi
Krishak Dal -- last night, BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan
Bhuiyan said that the government hatched a conspiracy so that the
opposition cannot return to parliament.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party "did not hold any formal or informal
discussion with us to resolve the crisis through meeting our
demands," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to go back to the parliament and we have
already placed our demands in this regard," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local English newspaper the Daily Star today
reported that both the ruling AL and the opposition BNP have
softened their stance, signaling a solution to the stalemate in
the house.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the daily last night, leaders of both sides
expressed their hope to resolve the main issues that created the
stalemate and showed eagerness to ensure that the parliament sits
with members of both benches when its first session of the new
year begins on January 15, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Israel Begins 'Door-to-door' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian exporters as of today
can deliver their goods directly to the Israelis without
unloading them to be checked near the borders.
</P>
<P>
The "door-to-door" arranmgement, which took effect today, was
signed last November by Jordan and Israel to replace a
"back-to-back" system under which all Jordanian goods entering
Israel had to be offloaded on the Jordan's side of the border
crossings and reloaded after Israeli inspections onto Israeli
vehicles on the other side.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of Transport Nasser Lawzi has said that
the "door-to-door" arrangement allows the direct transport of
goods across the Jordan Valley and the Wadi Arab crossings all
week days except Fridays and Saturdays, Jordan Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangement, large vehicles will be issued
extendible three-day entry permission at the crossing points. If
the driver of the vehicle could not return to his country on the
same day, he should call the nearest police station to register
his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
The driver should also hold a valid license, passport and
entry visa.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement was worked out after persistent efforts by
the Jordanian government following complaints by exporters that
the "back-to-back" arrangement caused undue delays and
expenses. In many cases, goods were damaged or became rotten in
the process.
</P>
<P>
The "door-to-door" arrangement is limited to Jordanian exports
to Israel now and will be applied to the flow of goods between
Jordan and the Palestinian territories at a later stage, Jordan
Times said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Israel has agreed to allow Jordanian trucks
carrying cement to the Palestinian territories to be covered
under the new arrangement. Oil shipments are also permitted, but
the actual flow of such items is expected later.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Israel in 1994 signed a peace agreement in which a
transport accord was also included. But Israel did not fully
implement the agreement. In the past two years, it had always
been criticized by Jordan for delaying the Jordanian exports to
Israel on purpose.

<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general-secretary
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
met in Beijing this morning with newly-elected leaders of three
non-communist parties.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, Jiang congratulated He
Luli, chairperson of the Central Committee of Revolutionary
Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Ding Shisun, chairman of the
Central Committee of China Democratic League, and Cheng Siwei,
chairman of the Central Committee of China Democratic National
Construction Association.
</P>
<P>

non-communist parties, replacing the old core with new leadership
in the three parties, something that once again shows that the
non-communist parties in the country have made good progress in
improving themselves including efforts made organizationally,
and that there is no lack of successors of the non-communist
parties."
</P>
<P>
Strengthening multi-party cooperation under the leadership of
the Chinese Communist Party is significant, he added, and said
that there is a fine tradition of major leaders of the CPC Central
Committee maintaining unity and friendship with leaders of the
non-communist parties.
</P>
<P>
During the past decades of revolution and construction, he

<P>
Ever since China's reforms and opening to the outside world,
Jiang said, every non-communist party, concentrating on the
country's central task, involves itself actively in political
affairs, putting forth many valuable suggestions, and doing much
practical and beneficial work, playing an important role in the
country's reforms, development, and stability.
</P>
<P>
He said that the goal of realizing the four modernizations and
reunifying the motherland requires unity and the common effort of
people of all ethnic groups, the non-communist parties included.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized multi-party cooperation and a political
consultative system under the leadership of the Chinese Communist
Party as one of China's basic systems, in conformity with China's
actual situation and political system with Chinese
characteristics. "This system must be adhered to for a long time
and constantly consolidated and developed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Adhering to and perfecting multi-party cooperation under the
leadership of the Chinese Communist Party calls for the common
efforts by the CPC and every non-communist party, and especially
that major leaders of non-communist parties should keep the
general situation in mind, show great foresight, and cooperate
with the Communist Party unswervingly.
</P>
<P>
"Our party will continue to implement the basic principle of
long-term coexistence and mutual supervision and treating each
other with sincerity and sharing bad times and good, bringing the
non-democratic parties into full play in political affairs and in
democratic supervision and pushing socialist democratic and
political construction forward," he said.

AMMAN, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti Tuesday made telephone calls to Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu, urging them to speed up action for final status talks,
the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti made the calls in response to the fact that the two
sides signed an initial accord on Israeli handover of the West
Bank city of Hebron to the Palestinians after a whole day's
negotiation, the local daily Jordan Times reported.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides did not succeed in reaching a final
agreement on Hebron which was expected to be signed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hebron is the last West Bank city still under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
Under the Palestinian-Israeli peace accord, the Palestinians
will experience a five-year period of self-rule as transition to
a permanent settlement, beginning in April 1994. By April 1997,
final status negotiations shall begin on Jerusalem, settlements,
refugees, borders and security.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti pressed Arafat and Netanyahu to implement provisions
of interim agreements, so that the final status talks could begin
in a positive spirit that would contribute to enhancing prospects
for achieving a just, comprehensive and durable peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has recently been criticizing Israel for its hardline
policy and is eager to see the Hebron agreement to be finalized.

More than six million workers will visit some 230 million rural
households in approximately 800,000 villages and more than 20
million rural enterprises for the survey.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the quality of registration work should be high

<HEADLINE> Chinese President's New Year's Greetings (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today
hailed the achievements scored in China's reform, opening-up and
modernization drive, and extended greetings to non-Communist
parties, personages without any party affiliations, workers,
farmers, intellectuals and cadres, police officers and men, and
security officials, and to compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao
and Chinese nationals from overseas.
</P>
<P>
At a new year's reception, Jiang, who is also general secretary
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said that
China has made a good start in implementing the Ninth Five-Year
Plan (1996-2000) and Long-Range Objectives for the year 2010 for
national economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
China has maintained the momentum for rapid economic growth and
effectively curbed inflation, and further improved macro-economic
environment.
</P>
<P>
The country had good harvests despite natural calamities in
some of its areas, and reforms in its state-owned enterprises
accelerated, he said. Coastal areas have continued to excel and
the central and western parts of China have stepped up its pace
for growth. The country's hard currency reserves exceed the 100
billion US Dollar-mark.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, socialist democracy and development of
legality has progressed steadily, and still more prominence has
been given to the role of cultural and ethical progress.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that 1997 will be an extraordinary year in the
history of the development of the CPC and the Chinese nation, with
the convocation of the 15th National CPC Congress, which will map
out the strategic plan to further China's future reform,
development and stability, and with the Chinese government's
resumption of the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong, an
important step toward the accomplishment of the motherland's
reunification.
</P>
<P>
Concerning economic development, Jiang said China will work
hard to advance two fundamental shifts, namely, shifting the
economy from the planned economy to the market one and shifting
the economic growth mode from being extensive to
intensive. Agriculture's role as the foundation will be
strengthened and reforms in the state-owned enterprises and their
pace for development will be further stepped up.

<P>
China will also strive to accelerate readjusting the economic
structure, and keep improving macro-economic environment and
expanding foreign trade and raising the utilization ratio of
overseas investment, he said, adding that the people's material
and cultural life will further improve on the basis of economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, greater efforts will be made to promote cultural and
ethical progress in the new year in line with the decision adopted
by the Sixth Plenum of the 14 National CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Hong Kong to the embrace of motherland is an
important event that will go down in history as splendid
achievements, and we will implement the policy of 'one country,
two systems' and exercise 'Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong'
with 'a high degree of autonomy'," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the backing of the central government and the Chinese
people, more than six million Hong Kong compatriots will certainly
make Hong Kong even more prosperous, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Taiwan, he explained, "We will also promote
contacts, exchanges, and cooperation across the Taiwan Straits in
line with the 'peaceful reunification' and 'one country, two
system' policies between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits."
</P>
<P>
"We welcome constructive views from different political parties
and groups and personalities from all walks of life in Taiwan on
relations across the Straits and on peaceful reunification. So we
hope that the Taiwan authorities, in keeping with principle of
righteousness of the Chinese nation, conform to the historical
trend of our times, cease all their activities that are aimed to
split the motherland and resort to actions practical in improving
cross-straits relations," he noted.
</P>
<P>
China's reforms, opening-up, and modernization drive require a
peaceful and stable international environment and the Chinese
government will strengthen friendly and cooperative relations with
neighboring countries and with all other countries around the
globe, based on the five principles of peaceful co-existence, he
noted, saying that "China will, as always, make further efforts to
establish a just, fair and reasonable international political and
economic order."
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, Jiang said he hopes that the people's political
consultative conference will strengthen political consultations
and democratic supervision, and go in for greater involvement in
political affairs in the new year, so as to contribute more to the
the country's economical development and all-round social
progress.

<P>
BEIJING, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Communist Party and state
leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji,
Liu Huaqing, and Hu Jintao attended a new year's reception
held by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
In addressing the reception, President Jiang Zemin hailed the
achievements of the country's reforms and opening-up and
modernization drive, and noted that China has made a good start in
its Ninth Five-Year Plan and Long-Range Objectives for the year
2010. China is prosperous and stable, and its people live in
harmony, he told those present.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) and chairman of the Central Military Commission, called 1997
an extraordinary year in the history of the Party and the
country. He said that the Party will hold its 15th National
Congress which will further map out the strategic plan of future
reforms, development, and stability of the country and lead the
people throughout the country to advance the great cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics into the new
century.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, he said, China will also resume the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, something that represents an important
step towards the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
To be ready for danger in peacetime and to make a good
beginning to bring about a good finish are the extremely important
results of experiences gathered over a period of several thousand
years for running a country and exploring a cause, he said, adding
that, "we face heavy tasks in the reforms and construction, and
the times have high expectations for us."

<HEADLINE> Philippines Enters New Era of Peace, Development: Ramos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has made
remarkable progress in peace and development during the past year,
according to Philippine President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the nation to be delivered in the
Presidential Palace tomorrow, Ramos said that the country is now
"politically stable and the Filipinos are more united than ever."
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement between the government and the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF), which was signed last September,
is a tribute to all Filipinos and the Philippines has entered a
new era of peace and development, the president added.
</P>
<P>
With respect to the rebel groups which consider themselves
outside the government-MNLF peace pact, Ramos said that the
government also opened venues for dialogue and conciliation.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF has so far been the only rebel group that struck a
peace deal with the government. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front,
the Abu Sayyaf extremists group and other insurgency groups in the
country all oppose the peace accord between the government and the
MNLF.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also said that there is now a widespread consensus that
the country has entered an era of sustained growth, with all the
leading economic indicators pointing to a strong and continued
growth.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippines reached a gross national product growth
of 7.1 percent for the first three quarters of 1996, making the
country one of the fastest growing economies in Asia last year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate was at a low of 8.7 percent for the first 11
months of last year while the average unemployment rate for the
first three quarters fell to 8.9 percent, the lowest since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The country also had a good performance in exports with a
growth of 16.7 percent for the first 10 months. Its gross
international reserves reached a record high of 11.6 billion U.S.
dollars as of November.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said although these accomplishments rekindled greater
hope and optimism for the future, the country is facing some major
challenges.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the country is being challenged by continuity
and durability of its reforms, alleviation of mass poverty and the
strengthening of law and order.

<HEADLINE>   Roundup: Reactions to Hebron Shooting Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu today sharply condemned this morning's shooting
incident carried out by an Israeli soldier in downtown Hebron.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest Israel Radio report, which could not be
confirmed by either the Israeli Government Press Office or the
Army's spokesman, six Palestinians were wounded, and one of them
seriously, during today's shooting attack.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian's Jerusalem Media and Communications
Center, contacted by phone, said that plus the six wounded by
gunshots five other Palestinian shoppers were beaten and injured
by Israeli soldiers shortly after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Radio report said that Noam Friedman, 19, an
Orthodox resident of Ma'aleh Adumim, who is in his three-year
mandatory  military service, but not posted in Hebron, carried
out the attack by himself.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that Friedman came to Hebron early this
morning, and had been wondering around the city, apparently
looking for a better position to carry out his plan, before he
entered the vegetable market and started shooting.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports said one Palestinian was killed at the scene,
and at least nine others were wounded, three of them seriously,
before three Israeli soldiers, posted in Hebron, jumped to
Friedman and subdued him.
</P>
<P>
He later admitted to investigators that he came to the Hebron
area with the premeditated intention of carrying out this attack,
in his own words, "to stop the Hebron accords that are planned to
be signed."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that he would not allow today's attack, which
he termed as "a criminal act," to hold up the signing of an
agreement on the Israeli army's redeployment in the West Bank
town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who was meeting with US special Middle East
coordinator Dennis Ross in Jerusalem this morning, called
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat in front
of Ross and made the condemnation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli premier also called on the Palestinians
to show restraints and responsibility in the wake of the shooting
attack.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Arafat urged the Israelis to go ahead with the
implementation of the Oslo peace accords, while instructed
Palestinian Security forces to help the Israelis to keep calm in
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Jibril Rajoub, head of the Palestinian Prevention forces in
the West Bank, visited the scene today and said that the shooting
incident approved that it was the Palestinians who were in
danger.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian negotiator Sa'eb Erekat has expressed his
"outrage," and called on Netanyahu to move ahead with the Hebron
talks and to stick to the Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said that if Netanyahu "believes the settlers and the
Arabs can live next to one another with fences, he is
wrong. Today, we see once again the settlers must be removed
(from Hebron)."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, accompanied by
Israeli army Chief of Staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, also visited the
scene and called on both Israeli and Palestinian residents in
Hebron to maintain calm.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who is traveling to Gaza to meet with Arafat at this
hour, has issued a statement on behalf of US President Bill
Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher, denouncing the
shooting attack.
</P>
<P>
Labor member of the Knesset (parliament) Ehud Barak said
shooting of innocent people "hurts Israel's interest."
</P>
<P>
Yossi Beilin, also from the Labor Party and one of the
architects of the Oslo peace accords, warned that further delay in
signing the Hebron redeployment accord would lead to further
violence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, right-wing Likud member Ze'ev Begin, who opposes
the Hebron redeployment, also denounced the wounding of innocent
people, but added it should not pressure Israel into the
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Although both Israel and the Palestinians vowed to conclude
the Hebron deal as soon as possible, the Palestinians suspended
this morning's scheduled talks for consultation after the Hebron
shooting attack.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear yet whether a summit meeting between Netanyahu
and Arafat will still take place today, as previously expected,
to initial the Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Israel Radio quoted Ross as saying that the two sides
are stilling working on the Hebron redeployment deal, and that he
hoped the agreement "will be reached soon."
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian officials had said that Netanyahu and
Arafat would probably meet today at the Erez checkpoint between
Israel and the Gaza Strip, as negotiators iron out the final
issues.
</P>
<P>
However, so far the two sides apparently have failed to reach
an agreement on Israel's further redeployment in the West Bank
after Hebron, and on the release of Palestinian prisoners from
Israeli prisons.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Tops World Traffic Safety League: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Sweden has the best traffic
safety record in the world, the "Dagens Nyheter" daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 565 people died in traffic accidents in the country,
the lowest in the world when set against the number of vehicles on
the road. There are four million vehicles registered in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
However, Claes Tingv All, the official in charge of traffic
safety in Sweden's Highway Bureau, stressed that 565 deaths mean
565 tragedies, so this was nothing to be proud of.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents soared in Sweden in the mid-1960s, with some
1,300 deaths annually. But the number has fallen steadily since
1989 when traffic-related deaths dropped to 904.
</P>
<P>
The Highway Bureau attributes the drop to improved traffic
safety measures, including better quality vehicles, better roads
and reducing the number of drivers under 18 years of age.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia to Carry Out New Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia will carry out
a new fiscal budget for 1997 with an emphasis on manpower
training, gaining competence in the public sector and further
promoting the private sector.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer and
exporter, announced the new budget last Tuesday, saying that the
budget aimed to continue his country's development drive and
achieve a strong and balanced economy.
</P>
<P>
He added the new budget emphasized on three pivotal
points: development and training of Saudi manpower and increasing
employment, achieving competence in both public and private
sectors, and consolidating the role of the private sector in the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The budget projects revenues of 164 billion Saudi Riyals
(43.73 billion U.S. dollars), up 32.5 billion Riyals (8.67
billion dollars) from last year. And an expenditure stands at 181
billion Riyals (48.27 billion dollars), an increase of 31 billion
Riyals (8.27 billion dollars) over the last budget.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit will be up to 17 billion Riyals (4.5
billion dollars), or 3 percent below the level of 4.9
billion dollars in 1996. Saudi Finance and National Economy
Ministry has been authorized to borrow to offset the deficit,
Saudi official sources said.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd considered the new budget as "an important step
toward achieving balance and reaffirming the Kingdom's economic
strength."
</P>
<P>
He said Saudi economic "growth bas reached 8.6 percent at
current rates compared with the 4.3 percent growth rate in 1995,"
achieving a positive rise for the third consecutive year in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that as Saudi Arabia enters the third year of its
sixth Five-Year-Plan, he is optimistic that the target of the
plan designed to "achieve qualitative and speedy progress to
ensure high standard of social security and economic prosperity"
will be reached.
</P>
<P>
Economic sources said the oil price rise encouraged the state
to push up overall 1977 spending by 8,27 billion U.S. dollars
compared with that of 1996. They expected that the oil price
would remain stable at the same level seen in the last quarter of
1996. The current five-year plan targeted the creation of
120,000 jobs totally for the local workforce over the five years.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, this is possible through expanding
activities of both the government and private sectors as well as
replacing expatriate workforce with the indigenous.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Finance Ministry said in a statement that 11 billion
dollars or 22 percent of the new budget is earmarked for
workforce training.
</P>
<P>
Health and social service spending rates second for 4.7
billion dollars or 9 percent of the new budget.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.33 billion dollars has been set for state funds
on industrial, agricultural and real estate projects.
</P>
<P>
According to the same statement, the balance of payments
improved notably in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The current account surplus stood at 186 million dollars
compared with 5.3 billion dollars deficit in 1995 as a result of
the rise in oil prices, despite the fall in world prices of
petrochemicals and agricultural exports, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector's performance was also positive in 1996
with the financial position of banks standing at 93 billion
dollars last November.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Paints Hopeful Picture For 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard today painted a hopeful and confident picture for his
country in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In his new year message, Howard said Australians had every
reason to look forward to 1997 with hope and confidence.
</P>
<P>
"Very low inflation, lower interest rates, more flexible labor
market conditions and substantial progress in cutting the budget
deficit all bode well for strong business investment and greater
consumer confidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Howard pointed out that much of the government's economic
reform agenda had been achieved in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He named the waterfront, small business red tape, the Telstra
(telecommunication ltd.) sale and the National Heritage Trust
environmental agenda as reform priorities for the new year.
</P>
<P>
"We still have many blemishes, some of our fellow Australians
remain profoundly underprivileged living in or at the edge of
poverty. They continue to need our compassion and help. If we can
keep that balance, 1997 will be a very good year for Australia,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer called on
Australians to "be nice to our tourists" in his new year's
message.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- American Chanda Rubin ousted
Croatia's Iva Majoli in a women's singles clash at the Hopman Cup
tennis mixed teams tournament in Perth, Australia Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Rubin, 20, ranked 12th in the world, beat Majoli, 19, ranked
7th, in three sets, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6(7/3) over almost two hours.
</P>
<P>
Rubin's surprise success is a major upset to Croatia's hopes of
winning the tie and boosting their chances of reaching the final
of the contest they grabbed a year ago.
</P>
<P>
To win the tie, they will now be relying on world No four Goran
Ivanisevic to beat little known Justin Gimelstob in the men's
singles, and for Ivanisevic and Majoli to team up and overcome
the Americans in the mixed doubles.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles, Majoli romped to a 4-0 lead in the
final set, but Rubin displayed marvellous grit in fighting back
to force a tie-breaker, which she won convincingly.

CANBERRA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Brenda
Schultz-McCarthy of the Netherlands beat countrywoman Miriam
Oremans in a second-round match at the Gold Coast Classic tennis
tournament in Australia on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Oremans saved four set points in the first set tiebreaker
before losing. Schultz-McCarthy took only 22 minutes to wrap up
the second set and the match.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Russian Elena Likhovtseva also advanced to the third
round by defeating Romanian qualifier Catalina Cristea 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded Sabine Appelmans of Belgium beat Sandrine Testud
of France 6-4, 6-4 and Ai Sugiyama of Japan, the sixth seed,
advanced with a 6-7 (5-7), 6-2, 6-3 win over Rita Grande of Italy.
</P>
<P>
Maria Louisa Serna of Spain upset fifth-seeded Ruxandra
Dragomir of Romania 6-4, 7-6 (7-1).
</P>
<P>
Rachel McQuillan of Australia, trying to break back into the
top 100, beat Germany's Barbara Rittner 7-5, 6-4 in blustery
conditions.
</P>
<P>
McQuillan was ranked as high as 28th in 1991, but injuries and
loss of form have seen her plummet to 186.
</P>
<P>
Her win over Rittner, ranked at 47, and her first-round
three-set victory over Taiwan's Shi-Ting Wang, also a top 40
player, should see McQuillan improve her ranking in this
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Seventh seed Katarina Studenikova of Slovakia was forced to
retire in her match with Anne Gaelle Sidot due to a shoulder
injury. Sidot led 6-4, 1-1 when Studenikova made the decision to
retire.

<HEADLINE> Soldier Admits to Prevent Hebron Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli soldier who
carried out a shooting attack in downtown Hebron this morning
said that he came to prevent the implementation of Israeli troop
redeployment in the West Bank town.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Army Radio report, the soldier, Noam
Friedman, 19, an Orthodox resident of Ma'aleh Adumim, is in his
three-year mandatory military service, but was not posted in
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that Friedman came to Hebron early this
morning, and had been wondering around the city, apparently
looking for a better position to carry out his plan, before he
entered the vegetable market and started shooting.
</P>
<P>
One Palestinian was killed at the scene, and at least nine
others were wounded, three of them seriously, before three
Israeli soldiers, posted in Hebron, jumped to subdue Friedman.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Friedman fired until the magazine of his
M-16 rifle was emptied.
</P>
<P>
He later admitted to investigators that he came to the Hebron
area with the premeditated intention of carrying out this attack,
in his own words, "to stop the Hebron accords that are planned to
be signed."
</P>
<P>
Riots have been reported near the Ali'ya Hospital in Hebron,
where the wounded Palestinians are being treated.
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of Palestinian civilians are also heading
towards the hospital, Palestinian Radio said, many of them are
trying to donate blood to help the victims of the attack.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu immediately condemned
today's shooting incident in Hebron, and vowed to move ahead
with the planned signing of the Hebron Accord.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who was meeting with US special Middle East
coordinator Dennis Ross in Jerusalem, called Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat and made the pledge.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier said that the shooting attack was aimed at
stopping the planned Hebron redeployment, as well as the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu expressed his determination that he would not let
the incident destroy the Hebron agreement, which is currently
under intensive negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the incident, Palestinian Prevention forces
head in the West Bank Jibril Rajoub said that the shooting
incident approved that it was the Israelis who endangered the
security in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian negotiator Sa'eb Erekat has expressed
his outrage, and called on Netanyahu to move ahead with the
Hebron talks and to stick to the Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said that if Netanyahu "believes the settlers and the
Arabs can live next to one another with fences, he is
wrong. Today, we see once again the settlers must be removed
(from Hebron)."
</P>
<P>
A curfew has been imposed on Hebron by the Israeli army, and
armored personnel carriers are reportedly being brought into
Hebron from nearby Kiryat Arba in order to prevent follow-up
confrontations.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear yet whether a summit meeting between Netanyahu
and Arafat will still take place today, as previously expected,
to finalize the agreement on Israeli army's redeployment in Hebron
despite the shooting incident.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Israel Radio quoted US special Middle East
coordinator Dennis Ross as saying that the two sides are stilling
working on the Hebron redeployment deal, and that he hoped the
agreement "will be reached soon."
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian officials had said that Netanyahu and
Arafat would probably meet today at the Erez checkpoint between
Israel and the Gaza Strip, as negotiators iron out the final
issues.
</P>
<P>
However, so far the two sides apparently have failed to reach
an agreement on Israel's further redeployment in the West Bank
after Hebron, and on the release of Palestinian prisoners from
Israeli prisons.

<HEADLINE> Citibank to Conduct Renminbi Business in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Citibank, one of the major
U.S. banks and largest ones in the world, will conduct Renminbi
(the Chinese currency) business in Pudong New Area (East
Shanghai).
</P>
<P>
An official of the bank's North Asia headquarters in Hong Kong
said Tuesday that Citibank will make Pudong its main branch in
Shanghai, and its original branch in Puxi (West Shanghai) a
subbranch according to the requirements in starting Renminbi
business.
</P>
<P>
Daisy Sham, vice-president of Corporate Communications of
Citibank North Asia Office, said that its Pudong branch will
provide Renminbi-denominated services to corporate customers who
are foreign-invested enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The branch is also engaged in foreign currency-denominated
services allowable under the prevailing codes for foreign banking
operations in China which include trade services, cash management
and foreign exchange products, lending and financial advisory
services, she said.
</P>
<P>
John Beeman, Citibank's Country Corporate Officer for China,
said, "We are excited about this market-opening move for Citibank
in China."
</P>
<P>
He said, "I am confident that the bank's role in China will
grow in the years ahead through our Pudong branch and with the
help and support of our global network which spans 98 countries
and regions."
</P>
<P>
With the latest addition of the Pudong branch, Citibank has the
 largest network among American banks on the Chinese mainland,
with branches in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, representative
offices in Guangzhou and Xiamen, a subbranch in Puxi and a head
office for the mainland in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Choose Between Peace, Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- In an angry reaction to the
Hebron shooting today, Palestinian senior negotiator Saeb Erekat
said that Israel must choose between settlement and peace.
</P>
<P>
In the terrorist shooting early this morning, an Israeli soldier
shot at Palestinians in a central Hebron market, killing one and
wounding nine others.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said that once again the incident proved that Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was wrong in saying that he
could make peace with the Palestinians while expanding Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
"We want to tell the Israeli government once again that the
choice is yours: peace or settlement, you can't have both," he
told the U.S. television network CNN.
</P>
<P>
He prodded Netanyahu to "make up his mind" and to take genuine
efforts to push forward the peace process. He said that
settlements and terrorism should "belong to the past."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Erekat said that the peace process should
not be affected by today's incident, adding the talks on Israeli
troop withdrawal from Hebron would proceed as usual.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the shooting, Netanyahu telephoned
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to express his regrets over the
incident and sympathy for the victims, Netanyahu's senior adviser
Dore Gold said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu condemned any terrorist acts and reiterated his
determination to continue the peace process with the Palestinian
Authority (PA), Gold added.
</P>
<P>
Before today's incident, there had long been speculation about
plans by extremists on both sides to sabotage the upcoming Hebron
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The incident has apparently further shadowed the signing of an
impending Hebron agreement, which was expected to be initialled
today at a possible summit between Netanyahu and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said that the Hebron talks would continue today, but he
refused to speculate on the timing of signing the deal.

<HEADLINE> 400 Ugandan Rebels Retreat into Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 1 (xinhua) -- Over 400 rebels of the Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA) have retreated from Uganda into Sudan,
reported the local daily ''the Monitor'' today.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are alleged to be withdrawing to avoid the
much-hyped offensive to be launched by the government army during
the dry season, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Shaban Bantariza, the public relation officer of the
government troops in the north, was quoted as saying that it is
possible for the rebels to retreat into Sudan on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
In November alone, some 500 IRA rebels had withdrawn to Sudan,
he revealed.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1987 the IRA has troops of some 2,000 men
currently.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Kony, the IRA leader, threatened last September that
the IRA would abduct 10,000 Ugandans into Sudan for military
training. Its final goal is to create a multi-party country in
Uganda headed by Kony.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Sudan provided the IRA with arms to
enable them to cope with Sudanese rebels in south Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Report: Netanyahu, Arafat May Not Meet Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Meeting between Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat appeared unlikely to take place today,
according to an Israel Radio report.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted U.S. special Middle East coordinator Dennis
Ross as saying that the two sides are still working on the Hebron
redeployment deal, and that he hoped the agreement will be
reached soon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian officials said earlier that Netanyahu
and Arafat would probably meet today at the Erez checkpoint
between Israel and the Gaza Strip after negotiators iron out the
final issues.
</P>
<P>
However, so far the two sides have apparently failed to reach
an agreement on Israel's further redeployment in the West Bank
after Hebron, and on the release of Palestinian detainees from
Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said earlier this morning he was still uncertain if
he would meet with Arafat today to initial an accord on Hebron,
adding he would not sign any agreement concerning Hebron until he
was absolutely sure that security provisions for the Jewish
community there will meet Israel's standard.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier said that it would be decided later in the
day if the two leaders will meet today to close the Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Arafat and his deputy Abu Mazen stated they
were ready to meet with Netanyahu to discuss the Hebron
redeployment accord.
</P>
<P>
However, they also said that there was still a great deal of
work concerning subsequent stages of the Oslo Accords and a
timetable for further Israeli troop redeployment from the West
Bank.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Down, Exports Up in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania saw apparent
declines of the inflation rate and importing, while its national
revenue and exports shoot up at double-digit rates at the end of
1996.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Tanzania (BOT) said in its monthly economic review
issued Tuesday that the inflation rate fell to 16.2 percent in
November and possibly to 15 percent in December, compared with
18.8 percent in October, and the record 21.8 percent in December
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Such a decrease was a result of the slight drop of food prices
and the tightened monetary policies the government has been
pursuing especially on the cash-budget system, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The BOT, the central bank of the eastern African country, also
predicted the inflation rate might drop to 10 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tanzania's state revenue reached some 372 million
U.S. dollars in the first four months of 1996-1997 fiscal year,
about 10 percent above the set target.
</P>
<P>
The exports of the country also hit 661.2 million dollars
between January and November in 1996, up 12 percent over the same
period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Much of this improvement is due to the increase in export
volumes as well as general improvement in export prices," the BOT
report said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's imports dropped by 10 percent to 1.27 billion
dollars from January to November, down from 1.41 billion dollars
during the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Imported capital goods, intermediate and consumer items have
sharply declined, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Condemns Shooting Incident in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu condemned today's shooting incident in
Hebron during which one Palestinian was killed and nine others
were wounded, Israel Army Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who is currently meeting with U.S. special Middle
East coordinator Dennis Ross in Jerusalem, called Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat and made the
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier said that the shooting attack was aimed at
stopping the planned Hebron redeployment as well as the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu expressed his determination not to let the incident
destroy the Hebron agreement, which is currently under intensive
negotiations between Israeli and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
An initial report said that an Israeli soldier entered the
vegetable market in central Hebron with his M-16 rifle and
suddenly opened fire on Palestinians in the market.
</P>
<P>
One Palestinian was killed at the scene, and the wounded were
rushed to a nearby hospital outside Hebron, where doctors said two
of the wounded were in serious conditions, said the report.
</P>
<P>
A doctor from the hospital told Army Radio that three out of
the nine were badly wounded and one of them was still in a very
serious condition at this hour.
</P>
<P>
The soldier was caught by Israeli troops stationed in
Hebron, and Israel Radio said that he apparently came from
Ma'aleh Adomim, a Jewish settlement north of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted army sources as saying that the soldier
claimed that he was chasing and shooting Palestinians who threw
stones at him.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the incident, Jibril Rajoub, head of the
Palestinian Prevention Forces in the West Bank, said that the
shooting incident approved that it was the Israelis who posed a
danger to the security in Hebron.

ANKARA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) attacked a Turk-Telekom radio-link
station in southeastern Turkey on the new year eve.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News said today that no casualties
were reported in the attack in Ergani district of Diyarbakir.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted security officials as saying that
operations were underway in the region to capture the PKK
militants.
</P>
<P>
Turkish security forces have killed 13,255 PKK militants,
wounded 244 and captured about 2,000 in the past ten years,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3,900 soldiers of the security forces have been also

<HEADLINE> 7 Fires Hit Philippine Capital on New Year's Eve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- At least seven fires hit the
Philippine capital of Manila on the New Year's eve and the biggest
one gutted the Logistics Command of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines (AFP), the Bureau of Fire Protection reported here
today.
</P>
<P>
Two soldiers were injured in the blaze that razed the
two-storey administration building of the logistics command
located inside the compound of the AFP at Camp Aguinaldo in the
capital, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Military officials said the fire, which broke out at about
20:15 (12:15 GMT), was due to faulty electrical wiring.
</P>
<P>
However, they said, the supply depot was spared by the fire.
</P>
<P>
At least six other fires broke out later in the city and the
amount of damage was not immediately known, the Fire Protection
Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The bureau did say what had caused the fires but analysts
attributed the incidents to the explosion of firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Manila residents went out into the streets last
night, exploding firecrackers, throwing sparklers, and spraying
multi-colored fireworks rays into the sky.
</P>
<P>
As the clock moved closer to the midnight, bursts of
firecrackers were all over Manila. The explosions continued up to
early this morning. Many people were reportedly injured by the
firecrackers.

<HEADLINE> Fatah Marks Anniversary of Anti-Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- With fireworks and street
gatherings, Fatah, the largest faction of the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO), celebrated today the 32nd
anniversary of its anti-Israeli struggle.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the new year, tens of thousands of Palestinians
held demonstrations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to show their
support to Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat,
who founded the Fatah Movement 38 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza, thousands of people took to the street in a show of
support for Arafat and his efforts to make peace with Israel. Some
demonstrators held placards reading "Fatah can make war and peace
in victory and sacrifices" and "We promise to keep the guns held
high along the olive branches."
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank city of Ramallah, fireworks display was held
to mark the group's 32nd anniversary, followed by a torch-light
procession joined by thousands of civilians.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities erected a flashing orange neon sign on
top of a building in the city center, which says "Call all our
people who have weapons and say long live Fatah."
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 Palestinian policemen held a player ceremony
before the Palestinian flag in Jericho, the first West Bank town
that came under Palestinian autonomy in 1994 under the
Israeli-Palestinian peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Last year, with Fatah Day coming while the PA took charge of
six West Bank towns, celebrations could not be prepared in
time. So this year's anniversary was marked on a large scale to
salute Arafat's leadership and "the struggle for an independent
Palestinian state."
</P>
<P>
Fatah was founded in 1959 in Kuwait where Arafat, a civil
engineer, established a construction company, but its existence
is traditionally dated from January 1, 1965 when a cell of the
organization launched the first attack against Israel's
occupation.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Against Sectarian Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim has
cautioned political party leaders in Africa against antagonizing
the people to meet their own political aspirations.
</P>
<P>
Salim, a Zanzibari, who is in Zanzibar for Christmas and News
Year holidays, met Zanzibar President Salmin Amour at State House
in the town of Zanzibar on Tuesday and and said political party
leaders should discourage the sowing of seeds of hatred and
division.
</P>
<P>
He added that unity is the pillar of stability.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief also said that political parties in Africa
should build a culture of respecting their countries
constitutions to avoid unnecessary friction and conflicts,
according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning any political party, Salim underscored the
need for parties to accept election results instead of waging war
on the outcome of the polls.
</P>
<P>
Salim emphasised that unless African countries cooperate and
utilize fully resources available within the continent, living
standards would continue declining.
</P>
<P>
He discouraged the habit by African nations of depending on
donor support to bail them out of economic quagmire, insisting
that the countries should stand up together and look for a
solution to their common snags.
</P>
<P>
The Isles president, on his part, assured the OAU chief that
Zanzibar's situation is calm and requested him to persuade donors
to support development projects.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the OAU secretary General met the Isles Chief
Minister Mohammed Ghari Bilal for discussion.

<P>
LAGOS, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State, General
Sani Abacha said he advocates French as the country's second
national language after English.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks on Tuesday while receiving an interim
report of the Committee on the Future of Higher Education headed
by Etsu Nupe.
</P>
<P>
Abacha said that, given the imperativeness of international
relations, Nigeria should consider becoming an official bilingual
country as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Nigeria is surrounded by French-speaking
countries on all sides, Niger to the north, Benin to west, Chad
and Cameroun to the east.
</P>
<P>
Closer cooperation with these neighbors, to be fostered by
linguistic affinity, would enhance social and economic benefits
for all concerned, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abacha claimed that the lack of communication has eroded the
common values and aspirations of Nigeria and its French-speaking
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He also called on these neighbors to also learn to speak
English for political, social and economic benefits.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Knesset Passes 1997 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The Knesset (Israel's
parliament) today approved the 1997 budget bill totaling 190
billion shekels (some 60 billion US dollars) by a vote of 60-42.
</P>
<P>
The vote in the third and final reading took place at 04:45 am
local time (0245GMT), one hour before the deadline for the bill
to be passed into law.
</P>
<P>
The ratification came after a Marathon debate throughout the
day in the Knesset, during which some coalition members of the
government threatened to vote against the budget.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, the Knesset approved the Economic
Arrangements Law, which gave the green line to the government's
planned 7.2 billion shekel (some 2.4 billion US dollars) deficit
reduction.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said after voting that the
passage of the budget bill proved his government knows how to take
difficult steps.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu held a series of meetings with the various coalition
factions during the day to give them a tongue-lashing on the need
to present a unified front during voting.
</P>
<P>
He postponed a summit meeting with Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat Tuesday to close the Hebron
redeployment agreement, so as to make sure that the budget would
be passed.
</P>
<P>
However, the government is still facing a 270-million-shekel
(some 90 million US dollars) hole due to its failure to pass a
measure on Monday to eliminate the half tax credit given married
working women. The Treasury said it has still not decided how to
fill this hole.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the government's failure on the half tax
credit, the key measures originally proposed by the Treasury in
the Arrangements Law -- cuts in child allowances, institution of
payments for doctors' visits and a hike in copayments for
medicine -- were withdrawn due to pressure from coalition members
in the Knesset Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
They were replaced with a series of tax hikes, despite
Netanyahu's repeated promises not to raise taxes.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Non-Traditional Exports Perform Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's non-traditional exports
did very well on the international market in 1996 and its
earnings are expected to exceed the 15 percent increase projected
for the year.
</P>
<P>
This is revealed by Mwansa Musonda, Executive Director of the
Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) in a radio interview with Zambia
National Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Non-traditional exports earned the country 216 million U.S.
Dollars in 1995, which are expected to reach 250 million US
Dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Musonda attributed the improved performance to the textile,
agricultural and floral cultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
The textile sector has been earning an average of 3.5 million
US Dollars per month mostly from lint and yarn which are expected
to bring in about 14 million Dollars by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural produce such as soya beans and maize are on high
demand but there is need for mass production in order to satisfy
the rising demand in the export market.
</P>
<P>
Floral cultural products in form of cut flowers are another
export whose demand has been increasing in the European market.
</P>
<P>
Musonda said his organization is working flat out to ensure
that non-traditional exports become more popular in both
potential and target markets.

<HEADLINE> Chissano Calls for National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has put both the first local autonomous elections and
the population census at high agenda of the government in 1997,
the Noticiais newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
When delivering a New-Year address Tuesday, Chissano
reiterated that the elections, scheduled for November, "will not
include all of the towns, villages or residential areas" in the
once war-torn southern African country.
</P>
<P>
However, the poll will be conducive to the promotion of
national unity, the further economic and social reconstruction
and the improvement of Mozambicans' living standard, Chissano
noted.
</P>
<P>
He called for administrative reforms in 1997 so as to enhance
the efficiency and transparency of the governmental bodies.
</P>
<P>
With the development of national harmony and democracy,
Mozambique also succeeded in curbing inflation and decreasing
foreign debts and its gross domestic product went up six percent
in 1996, said Chissano.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chissano called on all the Mozambicans to
maintain "national unity" when fighting crimes and defending
social moral values.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Declares 1997 Year of Savings for Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh has declared 1997 "the year of savings" in line with
the government's policy to promote savings and ease the current
account deficit.
</P>
<P>
In a new year message, available today, Chavalit urged the
public and private sectors and the people to spend money prudently
throughout this year.
</P>
<P>
"Let us tighten our belts. We must be thrifty and austere," he
said, adding "let's cut unnecessary spending, especially overseas
spending, to reduce the current trade deficit."
</P>
<P>
Thailand's current account deficit in 1996 was expected to be
at a high 8.2 percent of gross domestic product and the government
aimed to reduce it to 7.9 percent in the new year.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also urged the people to cooperate with the
government in the face of economic and social problems.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports in 1996 recorded a near-zero growth, as
against a 24-percent increase in 1995. The abrupt growth drop had
caused much worry for the Thai economy in the new year.
</P>
<P>
In the social field, the prime minister said that the
administration will push for improvement and effective enforcement
of laws and regulations to tackle social problems, including
drugs, prostitution, child labor, crime and aids.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Takes Steps to Curb Illegal Gold Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is lossing up to 50
million U.S. Dollars worth of gold annually through illegal
exports, prompting the government to introduce experimental
measures to curb the problem, the Daily Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mines Deputy Minister Zenzo Nsimbi told the Herald that the
government had introduced an experimental permit system under
which designated agents would buy gold from small-scale producers
and sell to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
At present, it is difficult for small-scale producers to sell
gold of less than 50 grams to the Central Bank, forcing them to
find alternative markets for their products, thereby falling prey
to illegal exporters, the deputy minister said.
</P>
<P>
''We are worried about the illegal sale of gold, mainly to
South Africa. the government has since decided to take up this
licensing thing. We will be making a maximized month to month
assessment to see whether we are making any impact,'' he said,
adding that the permits would be issued this month.
</P>
<P>
A private mining consultant from Harare John Hollaway said it
was estimated there are about 80,000 illegal gold panners in
Zimbabwe and these account for about four tons of the 24 tons
produced annually the country.
</P>
<P>
This means that Zimbabwe may loss between 25 and 50 million
U.S. Dollars worth of gold annually through illegal exports.
</P>
<P>
Hollaway said because of the regulations regarding the amount
of gold that could be sold to the Central Bank, most panners sold
their gold to unlicensed dealers.
