Sirajuddoula and Song Yueming, president of the Chinese company.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, valued at 5.53 billion taka (106 million U.S.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Budget for 2000-2001 Shows Big Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah AMS
Kibria Thursday placed a national budget of 8.5 billion U.S.
dollars for fiscal 2000-2001, showing an overall deficit of 3.7
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He estimated the revenue income at 4.8 billion dollars, 13.3
percent higher than the revised income for the outgoing fiscal
1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
The non-development expenditure was estimated at 3.9 billion
dollars, up from the revised estimate of 3.68 billion dollars this
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister proposed to meet the big deficit, which is
equal to 5.9 percent of gross domestic product, from foreign
grants and loans of 1.88 billion dollars, domestic sources of 1.1
billion dollars and from bank borrowings of 0.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Defending the much talked excess borrowings by the government
from the banking sector, Kibria said the experience of financial
management in Bangladesh during the last two years suggests that
harmful effects of bank borrowing are limited.
</P>
<P>
"There is no direct correlation between government borrowing
and inflation in Bangladesh. On the contrary, inflation rate in
Bangladesh has been continuously falling during last ten months
despite a surge in government borrowing," he said in the
parliament Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Proposing 3.5 billion dollars for the Annual Development
Program (ADP for fiscal 2000-2001, which is 13 percent higher than
the current year's revised size, Kibria said more than half of the
resources would be provided by domestic sources while 49.8 percent
from foreign sources.
</P>
<P>
The allocation for rural development has increased by 250
percent over the last five years. In 1995-96, the allocation for
the sector was 145 million dollars while 364 million dollars has
been proposed under the ADP for the coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Allocation of 1.1 billion dollars for the education sector has
been proposed in the new budget for fiscal 2000-2001 marking it
the highest allocated sector both in terms of revenue and
development expenditure.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth budget of the Awami League (People's League)
government led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina since it assumed
power in the general elections held in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The entire opposition continued their abstention from the house
as the finance minister placed the budget.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Holds Reception to Mark 50-Year Ties With Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Liang Dong held a
grand reception here Thursday in warm celebration of the 50th
anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between
China and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Attending the reception were Second Secretary of the Myanmar
State Peace and Development Council Lieutenant-General Tin Oo and
other government officials as well as some 200 representatives
from different circles.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Liang said at the reception that 50 years ago on
this day, China and Myanmar formally established diplomatic
relations and since then the long-standing friendly exchanges
between the Chinese and Myanmar peoples have opened a new page.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1950s, the leaders of the two countries jointly
advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, smoothly
settling the issue of demarcation of boundary left behind by
history in the spirit of mutual respect, understanding and
friendly consultation, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
With great vision and foresight, leaders of elder generations
of the two countries laid down solid foundation for Sino-Myanmar
friendship, he said, adding that from then on, the friendly
exchanges and cooperation between the two nations in various
fields have been steadily developed.
</P>
<P>
He believed that such relations of friendship and mutually-
beneficial cooperation will not only serve the fundamental
interest of the two peoples, but also be conducive to the
prosperity and stability of the whole region.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador pointed out that after the Cold War, the
international situation has witnessed drastic changes, saying that
the Sino-Myanmar traditional friendship has stood the test in the
complicated international environment and showed stronger and
stronger vitality.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that since the very day China and Myanmar
established diplomatic relations, Myanmar has acknowledged that
there is but one China in the world, that is the People's Republic
of China, with Taiwan being part of the Chinese territory, and the
government of the People's Republic of China is the sole
legitimate government representing all Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government highly appreciates Myanmar's stance that
the successive Myanmar governments have always adhered to the "One
China" policy and never involved in official ties of any form with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Tin Oo said at the reception that due to the mutual respect and
good-neighborliness that Myanmar and China entertain towards each
other, the two countries, with long historical ties, continue to
enjoy friendly relations till date.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence,
which Myanmar and China jointly advocated, not only serve as
guiding principles in Myanmar's foreign policy but also continue
to exist as firm foundations in the conduct of present day
international relations.
</P>
<P>
Tin pointed out that all necessary assistance provided by China
at the time when Myanmar is striving for its economic development
is highly beneficial.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that on Myanmar's part, it will continue to pursue
the "One China" policy which it has been practicing steadfastly.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his country's firm conviction that Myanmar and
China will successfully overcome the myriad challenges of the 21st
century through their joint efforts.

<HEADLINE> Chittagong Trade Unions Agree to Building Second Terminal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Work for building a second container
terminal at Chittagong Port, the largest port in Bangladesh, will
start soon as trade unions withdrew their objection to foreign
involvement in the venture, the United News of Bangladesh Thursday
quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has offered an investment of 7.
37 billion taka (142 million U.S. dollars) in the New Mooring
Container Terminal, which was vehemently protested against by the
port workers, opposition parties, and even by the Chittagong city
mayor who belongs to the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The mayor had described the government's decision on the
foreign involvement in the second container terminal as a threat
to national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Main trade unions, namely Bandar Sramik Dal (Port Workers'
Organization), Bandar Sramik League (Port Workers' League), Islami
Sramik Sangha (Islami Workers' Association) and Bandar Sramik
Union (Port Workers' Union), in a body had opposed the ADB
involvement in the project, fearing that the donor would grab port
business.
</P>
<P>
However, these labor organizations, except Bandar Sramik Union,
in a meeting last week changed their minds and gave their consent
to the implementation of the scheme with condition.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Chittagong Port Authority, they pleaded that
it should be a joint venture with the management control in the
hands of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Chittagong port is not capable of coping with the bulk
import and export cargo. Official sources said the proposed
terminal will reduce container jams and enhance operational
capacity of the port.
</P>
<P>
It will also bring more dynamism into the country's export and
import business, they added.

<HEADLINE> Manpower Export, Remittances from Expatriates Increase in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Manpower export and remittances from
the expatriate Bangladeshis increased over 11 percent in the last
fiscal year and showed a positive impact on the economy.
</P>
<P>
According to Economic Survey Report 2000 released in parliament
Thursday, in 1998-99, over 270 thousands of Bangladeshi citizens
went abroad with jobs.
</P>
<P>
The increase in manpower export was 11.11 percent over the
previous year, the report said, adding that the amount of money
sent by the expatriates was 1.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1998-99,
an 11.82 percent increase compared to the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Qualitative changes in the exported manpower of Bangladesh are
also remarkable. The number of skilled manpower export is
increasing day by day.
</P>
<P>
A good number of laborers are going to the Middle East
countries every year and most of them to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
Besides the Middle East, the Bangladeshi laborers are also going
to Malaysia, Singapore Brunei, Mauritius and Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Water Level of Tsho Rolpa Lake to be Reduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The project of reducing the water
level of the Tsho Rolpa glacial lake, which is feared to burst out
due to global warming, began Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no danger of the lake bursting when the water
level is reduced three meters after the completion of the project,
" said Adarsha Pokherel, director general of the Department of
Hydrology and Meteorology.
</P>
<P>
The Tsho Rolpa glacier lake is located 110 kilometers northeast
of Kathmandu at an altitude of 4500 meters in Rolwaling Valley of
Dolakha district.
</P>
<P>
The area of the lake is gradually increasing and if the lake
bursts it is likely to affect 10,000 people living in the
Rolwaling valley.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government had installed flood warning sirens at 19
settlements of 17 villages in the lake area to check the loss of
lives and property from the possible outburst of the lake.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Nuke Capability "Modest:" Foreign Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday said its
nuclear capability is "modest" and solely aimed at deterring
aggression.
</P>
<P>
This was stated in a Foreign Office statement issued here in
reaction to a report of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC of
America which claimed that, as compared to India, Pakistan
possesses far larger nuclear capability and arsenal and better
delivery systems.
</P>
<P>
The claim was "removed from reality and appears to be motivated,
" said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"This is an extraordinary assertion in view of the fact that in
comparison with a few Pakistani nuclear facilities, India has a
vast nuclear program comprising dozens of nuclear installations
outside international safeguards, which have been operating to
produce fissile materials over decades," it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the NBC report also falsely surmised
that Pakistan's program relied on generous outside assistance,
while crediting India's nuclear arsenal to indigenous effort.
</P>
<P>
"It ignores the fact that a large part of the Indian nuclear
facilities is of Western origin in addition to a vast number of
Indian nuclear and missile specialists who had been trained in the
West. On the other hand, Pakistan has been constantly subjected to
economic and technological sanctions and its program kept under
close scrutiny."
</P>
<P>
The report carried "dangerous implications" as it "tends to
justify the ambitious Indian program for nuclear and conventional
build-up," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating that Pakistan will continue to follow a policy of
restraint and responsibility on nuclear issues, it said, "Pakistan
's nuclear capability is modest and solely aimed at deterring
aggression. We are opposed to an arms race and will maintain
nuclear deterrence at the minimum credible level."

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Euro 2000 Ticket Sales Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Thursday it had approved Euro 2000's ticket sales policy.
</P>
<P>
The championships kicks off in Brussels on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes the day after Amsterdam-based agency
Cupido Tickets formally complained to the Commission and Dutch
competition authorities that the tournament's ticketing
arrangements violated EU law.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said ticketing policy was in line with the bloc'
s competition rules and respected the EU's principle of non-
discrimination between nationalities.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said its statement was intended to reassure fans
following the fiasco of the 1998 World Cup, after which the EU
executive fined the French organisers a symbolic 1,000 euros (959.
7 U.S. dollars) for favoring French residents in ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
"By contrast, the arrangements agreed for the Euro 2000
tournament appear to have given European consumers a genuine
possibility to obtain tickets for all matches under fair and non-
discriminatory conditions," the Commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Amelia Torres said the Commission had received a
complaint against the Euro 2000 ticketing policies and had taken
it into account in deciding the system was fair.
</P>
<P>
Euro 2000 said on Wednesday it had sold 97 percent of the
available 1.2 million tickets, with 39 percent going to the
general public and 36 percent to the national football
associations of the participating teams.

<P>
CANBERRA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada upset China and the United
States beat Japan, leaving three teams tied for first place in the
Pacific Cup women's soccer tournament Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Canada beat leaders China in Newcastle, winning 5-3 on
penalties after an exciting 2-2 draw to join the Chinese on top of
the ladder.
</P>
<P>
In the day's second game, world champions the United States
scored a convincing 4-1 victory over Japan to also reach nine
points.
</P>
<P>
The first Canadian goal came in the second minute when striker
Christine Sinclair got in behind the Chinese defense and rolled
the ball home. Sinclair extended Canada's lead in the 19th minute
when she received a pass in the penalty area, rounded the keeper
and tapped home.
</P>
<P>
Chinese striker Sun Wen scored a goal from an indirect free
kick disallowed, but she made amends in the 67th minute, reducing
the deficit with a shot from 10 meters. Bai Jie equalized for
China with 11 minutes to time when her left-foot shot from the
edge of the penalty area found the back of the net.
</P>
<P>
In the penalty shoot-out China's first penalty taker Zhang
Ouying had her shot saved. Canada's first four penalty takers all
converted theirs as the rest of the Chinese followed suit.
</P>
<P>
The decider came in controversial circumstances when Canada's
fifth penalty taker Isabelle Harvey had her shot saved, but the
referee ruled that the Chinese goalkeeper had moved before the
kick was taken and ordered it retaken.
</P>
<P>
Harvey scored with her second shot.
</P>
<P>
A perfectly executed free-kick gave the United States the lead
over Japan in the 16th minute when striker Cindy Parlow knocked
the ball in from close range.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Yumi Obe shocked the Americans in the 22nd minute with
a drive from 40 meters out which flew past the American keeper.
</P>
<P>
The United States exerted its authority in the second half,
Shannon MacMillan poking the ball home from eight meters out to
restore its lead in the 56th minute.
</P>
<P>
And then World Cup hero Brandi Chastain extended it to 3-1 in
the 62nd minute. American substitute Aly Wagner tapped home from
close range to make it 4-1 in the 88th minute.
</P>
<P>
The final games of the tournament will be played on the weekend,
with Canada playing Japan and China taking on winless New Zealand
on Saturday and the United States playing hosts Australia on

<HEADLINE> Pierce Upset Hingis to Face Martinez in Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- French Mary Pierce stunned top seeded
Swiss Martina Hingis 6-4, 5-7, 6-2 on Thursday to seal her place
in the French Open women's singles final.
</P>
<P>
It was only Pierce's sixth win in 16 meetings with Hingis and
her first in their last eight. She won the match in two hours 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Pierce will now face Conchita Martinez, who turned the tables
on fellow Spaniard Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, winning 6-1, 6-2 in
the other semi-final.
</P>
<P>
Martinez reached only the third Grand Slam final of her career -
and her first in 13 appearances at Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
Pierce, 25, has a 10-6 career head-to-head record against
Martinez. If she wins she will become the first French women's
champion here since Francoise Durr in 1967.
</P>
<P>
She will be playing in only her fourth Grand Slam final after
winning at the Australian Open in 1995 and losing here in 1994 and
Melbourne in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The loss was another Centre Court nightmare for Swiss teenager
Hingis, beaten in the final here in both 1997 and last year - when
she lost in a torrent of tantrums and tears against the now-
retired Steffi Graf.
</P>
<P>
The French Open remains the only Grand Slam title the 19-year-
old prodigy has never won. The crowd greeted her politely on
Thursday, but whistled several times when she disputed line calls.
</P>
<P>
Martinez, who won Wimbledon in 1994, is now 54-12 here and will
be playing in her first Grand Slam final since the 1998 Australian
Open.
</P>
<P>
She had lost in all three of her previous semi-final
appearances here and improved on what had been a dismal 2-9 record
in Grand Slam semis coming into the match.
</P>
<P>
Both men's semi-finals are slated for Friday afternoon with
third-seeded Swede Magnus Norman taking on unseeded Argentine
Franco Squillari and 1997 champion Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil
playing 16th-seeded Spanish phenomenon Juan Carlos Ferrero.
</P>
<P>
Norman, who has never won a Grand Slam title, is expected to
meet Kuerten in Sunday's final - but this has been a tournament
marked by a number of upsets.

LUSAKA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- About 2,000 striking workers of
Lusaka City Council of Zambia have been suspended with immediate
effect after they defied an ultimatum issued on Wednesday to
report to work Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The city council workers started to call a strike last Tuesday,
 demanding 40,000 Kwacha (about 13 U.S. dollars) outstanding
arrears per month to individual employees backdated to July last
year.
</P>
<P>
The workers are also demanding their April and May salaries
this year be paid along with the arrears in full.

<HEADLINE> Britain Promises Continued Commitment to S. Leone Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Two warships and about 200 British
soldiers will remain in Sierra Leone to show Britain's commitment
to the country's fragile peace after the bulk of the British
troops leave on schedule next week, said British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Freetown quoted Cook as saying that
the British frigate, HMS Argyll, and a support vessel, Sir
Percivale, would serve as "visible, clear evidence of Britain's
commitment."
</P>
<P>
Cook is paying a visit to Sierra Leone. During his meeting with
Sierra Leonean President Ahmad Kabbah at the heavily guarded state
house in the capital, Cook said that a team of about 200 British
soldiers would remain to train Sierra Leone's newly recruited
national army.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Britain sent a naval task force and more than 1,000
troops to the West African nation to help withdraw British
nationals and beef up the United Nations' operations, which were
nearly paralyzed by the rebels' sudden attacks and hostage-taking.
</P>
<P>
"British troops are withdrawing on schedule because they have
carried out their objective which was to make sure that British
nationals could get out safely and also that the U.N. forces could
get in and get deployed," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah government had been trying to persuade the British
government to maintain its troops in his country but in vain.
</P>
<P>
According to Cook, despite the withdrawal, Britain still has a
three- point plan to help Sierra Leone: to repel the rebels,
restore the peace process and rebuild the country.
</P>
<P>
He promised "a very much hands-on involvement", saying that the
British government would "want to see this job through".
</P>
<P>
Cook also suggested an international embargo on rebel diamond
sales. The British government wants to consult with the United
States and the European Union on ways of achieving this, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he would also press for rebel leader Foday Sankoh,
currently under arrest, to be "brought to justice".
</P>
<P>
Serious clashes have been continuing in parts of the country
and gunfire was reported near pro-government militia leader Johnny
Paul Koroma's house in Freetown on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
According to a military spokesman, government forces retook
control of the strategic town of Lunsar on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lunsar, which is located on the road leading to the rebel
stronghold of Makeni and the eastern diamond fields, is the first
rebel position lost to the government since the counteroffensive
began after last month's hostage drama.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Notes to U.S. Envoy on Violating Diplomatic Norms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government has
served a note on U.S. Ambassador Reverend Charles Stith, accusing
him of violating diplomatic norms by airing his views on Zanzibar
through the mass media instead of the acceptable diplomatic
channels.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of Tanzanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation told a press conference here on Thursday
that as a foreign envoy, the U.S. ambassador has to abide by the
standing orders to deal with issues in a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
Clarifying the union government's stand on the recent remarks
by Stith on Zanzibar, Director of Information and Research Patrick
Chokala said that mass media is not one of the channels of
communication between foreign envoys and host governments.
</P>
<P>
"We have served him with a note asking him to use the
acceptable diplomatic channels," said Ambassador Chokala without
disclosing more contents of the note and the date Stith was
served.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar government issued a similar statement on Tuesday
night asking foreign envoys based in Tanzania to refrain from
making statements which jeopardize the good relations with their
host governments.
</P>
<P>
The statement was apparently referring to reports by local
media quoting Stith as telling British Broadcasting Corporation
program, Focus on Africa, that he was against Zanzibar President
Salmin Amour's dictation of the next Zanzibar president.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy is said to have portrayed President Amour, whose
second and last term will expire in October, as "a lame duck".
</P>
<P>
However, Stith clarified later on with the media that he was
misquoted and that he believed the decision to choose a candidate
was solely the responsibility of the political parties.
</P>
<P>
"This is totally against diplomatic norms," said the statement,
 expressing further concern over Stith's remarks that Zanzibar
could be another Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar was also displeased with Stith's violation of
diplomatic ethics by "often entering Zanzibar without informing
the Zanzibar office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation", the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar has requested foreign envoys accredited to Tanzania to
abide by diplomatic norms and refrain from intervening in
Tanzania's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The semi-autonomous Zanzibar region in the Indian Ocean joined
with mainland Tanganyika to form the United Republic of Tanzania
after a revolt in 1964 that ousted the sultan and Omani Arabs who
ruled the island.
</P>
<P>
There are four candidates from the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi
(CCM) party vying for Zanzibar presidency, including Zanzibar
Chief Minister Mohammed Gharib Bilala, Zanzibar Finance Minister
Amina Salum Ali, Zanzibar Communication and Transport Minister
Aman Karume, and Union Deputy Finance Minister Abdisalam Khatibu.
</P>
<P>
The CCM's National Executive Committee is scheduled to meet in
Dodoma on Saturday to scrutinize the four names by the central
committee and come up with one name.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the National Electoral Commission Judge
Lewis Makame said on Thursday that a total of 12.5 million of the
30 million population are expected to vote in 232 constituencies
throughout the country in this year's general elections on October
29.
</P>
<P>
The elections will involve the union presidential candidates,
aspirants for membership of parliament and councilorship, and the
Zanzibar presidential candidates.

<HEADLINE> UAE Air Force Launches Annual Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates' air
force has started its annual training exercises as part of a
program to keep its soldiers' combat readiness, according to a
statement released by the official WAM news agency Friday.
</P>
<P>
The one-week drilling, code named "Emirates 2000 flag," is aimed
at increasing the level of coordination between the various units
of the air force.
</P>
<P>
Symbolic air force units from the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC), which groups six Gulf Arab states -- Saudi Arabia, UAE,
Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman -- are participating in the
exercises.
</P>
<P>
The Emirates air force has some 4,000 army personnel equipped
with 97 warplanes and 39 gunships. It has a brigade of anti-
aircraft force.
</P>
<P>
UAE leaders have reiterated that the country is building its
armed forces for the purpose of protection, not aggression.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 Gulf War, which ended with Iraq being driven out
of Kuwait by the U.S.-led alliance, the UAE has bought huge amounts
of weapons and military equipment, including the most advanced F-16
fighters, from the U.S., France, Britain to strengthen its forces.
</P>
<P>
It has been locked in territorial dispute with Iran, of whom the
Emirates is particularly wary, over the three islands of Abu Musa,
Greater and Lesser Tunbs, in the mouth of the strategic Strait of
Hormuz.
</P>
<P>
The GCC backs the UAE in its claim of sovereignty over the three
islands now controlled by Iran.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Chides Israel for Delay in Carrying out Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said on Friday that Arabs are "sick and tired" of Israel's
procrastination in implementing its agreements with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting between Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Moussa
expressed hope that the next few weeks will not witness more "
wasted time and unkept promises" as the Arab public opinion has
been "fed up" with Israeli procrastination.
</P>
<P>
It is now widely feared that the Palestinians will again become
victim of Israel's internal political struggle. Israeli Knesset
(parliament) on Wednesday supported in the preliminary reading an
opposition bill calling for dissolving the parliament and holding
early elections.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought the move was a maneuver to delay
implementation of signed agreements, Moussa said "Everything that
has happened has been intended to waste time, and serious final-
status issues such as Jerusalem, refugees, borders and settlements
have not been raised."
</P>
<P>
He called on Israel to respect commitments so that the Middle
East peace process will succeed.
</P>
<P>
Arafat wrapped up his brief visit to Egypt after the hour-long
meeting with Mubarak, during which the two leaders discussed the
Israeli foot-dragging.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have yet to resume talks on final-
status issues and thrash out a framework agreement, in preparation
for a permanent peace deal by September 13.
</P>
<P>
Arafat frequently visits Egypt to discuss with Mubarak ways of
pushing forward the peace process and seek advice from Mubarak, an
important peace process mediator whose country was the first Arab
country to sign a peace treaty with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Italy, Germany Launch Idea of Common Constitution in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi
and his German counterpart Johannes Rau rounded off a two-day
visit to Italy's Sicily Friday, issuing a joint statement which
focused mainly on the idea of solidifying European unity through a
common constitution.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents promised to "contribute to the development
of decision making processes for European unity and to support
efforts to design a constitutional framework for Europe."
</P>
<P>
Ciampi and Rau agreed that they "share a similar vision of the
future of European development", and said they believe their views
"reflect the expectations and feelings of the citizens" of their
respective countries.
</P>
<P>
In their statement, the two presidents agreed to "encourage and
support studies in all of Europe directed at sparking the European
constitutional debate."
</P>
<P>
The presidents stressed that "the European Charter of
Fundamental Rights must be an essential part of the European
Constitution."
</P>
<P>
The two presidents, the statement said, also discussed the
importance of inter-cultural dialogues between the West and Islam
and stressed that Mediterranean regions could bring much color to
these exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Putin Speak on Phone over Missile Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
White House Spokesman Joe Lockhart said the two leaders
discussed a wide range of subjects in the 15-minute conversation.
"They did some discussion about missile defense and some of
President Putin's ideas."
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Clinton last week, Putin, who opposes
Washington's plan for a limited missile defense system, suggested
that European nations and the United States jointly develop a
missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
Washington is considering the deployment of a national missile
defense system, and such a move was opposed by its European allies
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels on Friday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
said that Russia's proposal for an anti-missile defense system
offers no protection for the United States or even Europe and so
it is not feasible. Cohen will meet Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I think Secretary Cohen is in a good position to allay any
concerns the Russians may have," Cohen added.

The country will have to assume during the next three years
costs close to seven billion U.S. dollars, an amount equal to

<HEADLINE> UNIFIL to Be Deployed Soon in South: Lebanese PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss on
Friday said the U.N. peacekeeping force will be deployed soon in
south Lebanon and Lebanese interior force will be responsible for
the security there, Lebanese National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meeting a group of parliament members in his office Friday
afternoon, Hoss added that Lebanese army will also be temporarily
transferred to the south when necessary.
</P>
<P>
But he did not specify when the deployment was going to happen.
A U.N. verification of complete Israeli pullout from south Lebanon
is an essential requirement for the U.N. force's filling in the
vacuum left by the withdrawal of Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hoss stressed the importance of
reconstruction work in liberated areas. Beirut has been working to
provide residents in southern villages with water, fuel oil and
cooking gas.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed its troop withdrawal from south Lebanon on May
24, ending 22 years of occupation there, because of mounting
casualties in the war of attrition with Lebanese resistance forces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. team to verify withdrawal line in the
Lebanese side suspended its work as Lebanon has disputes with world
body in a part of the drawn by U.N. cartographers.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) spokesman
Timur Goksel said although the problem threatened to indefinitely
postpone the process of verifying the Israeli withdrawal, the two
sides quickly reached a compromise and both U.N. and Lebanese
officials agreed to resume its work on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official did not elaborate on the disputes with
Lebanese side, the National News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, UNIFIL officials accompanied by Israeli and
Lebanese officials began working on each side of the border line to
verify that Israeli forces had pulled back.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese officials on Friday objected to a part of the
withdrawal line and wanted to discuss it with cartographers, which
put on hold the U.N. verification work on the Lebanese side.
</P>
<P>
Goksel said "Lebanese objection was technical" and insisted that
the U.N. is not going to negotiate the map.

<HEADLINE> Residents of Golan Village Demonstrate Against Possible Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Residents of an Arab village on the
muffled border between Lebanon and the Israeli-occupied Golan
Heights of Syria have protested against a possible division of the
village in the United Nations' demarcation of the Lebanese-Israeli
border.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of residents of Ghajar village have staged tyre-burning
demonstrations since Wednesday and launched a general strike on
Thursday. They also threatened to bar the entry to the U.N. team in
charge of verifying Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon late
last month.
</P>
<P>
The residents learned last week from Israeli media that the U.N.
demarcation team indicated that the 1923 international border runs
through Ghajar village and that part of the village might be handed
over to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 1,700 residents of Ghajar are Alawite Muslims of
Syrian nationals. Many of them have taken Israeli citizenship after
the village, at the foot of the Golan Heights, was seized from
Syria by Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's Oriental radio reported that the head of Ghajar's
local council, Suliman Khatib, told the radio that the villagers "
would not be opposed to transferring the entire village to
Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
However, in a fax addressed to U.N. Mideast envoy Terje Roed
Larsen, the villagers said "official documents ... prove that our
land is Syrian and that we are Syrian and that we were occupied by
Israel in 1967."

<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls for Incident-Free Euro-2000 Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry on Friday
expressed hope to avoid incidents that might overshadow Turkey's
team's successes in the forthcoming Euro-2000 Football
Championship.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that measures, including
several warnings, had been taken in view of the Euro-2000 that will
take place in the Netherlands and Belgium between June 10 and July
2.
</P>
<P>
It added that a seven-member group had also been formed to help
and guide the Turkish team players and supporters during the Euro-
2000.
</P>
<P>
Violence broke out in Istanbul and Copenhagen between football
fans before the Union of European Football Association (UEFA) Cup
games in April and May. Two English fans were stabbed to death in
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Foreign Ministry had thought it
beneficial to warn the Turkish citizens living in the Netherlands
and Belgium against possible provocations in order to prevent re-
occurrence of similar incidents during Euro-2000.
</P>
<P>
"We wish that all Turkish citizens should stay away from
attitudes and violence that may overshadow the Turkish team's
successes and harm the prestige of Turkey," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Turkish people and supporters, who watch the games, should
behave calmly without paying attention to provocations."
</P>
<P>
On May 17, Turkey's Galatasaray beat English's Arsenal 4-1 in a
penalty shoot-out after the UEFA Cup final finished 0-0 following
extra-time, winning its first European club trophy.
</P>
<P>
Victorious Turks have high hopes for Euro 2000, because 11
players from Galatasaray are in Turkey's pre-selection.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
will pay an official visit to the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea(DPRK) this Summer to "promote Russia's role in normalizing
the situation on the Korean peninsula," the Russian Foreign
Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Chairman of the DPRK Defense Commission
Kim Jong Il, President Putin "will shortly visit Pyongyang" and
this will be "our head of state's first official visit to the
country in the whole history of Russia," the ministry said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"Moscow now wants to intensify its participation in the affairs
on the Korean peninsula, which borders on our country, towards
stabilization and the favorable development of the situation there,
"it said, stressing the relations between Moscow and Pyongyang "
have quite a long history and we have never suspended them."
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the South Korea is aware of Putin's upcoming
visit and the exact dates are being arranged.
</P>
<P>
It noted that Seoul "does not and cannot have any objections"
to the president's visit or other contacts between Russia's
representatives and the DPRK, since South Korea "knows that Russia
is for achieving stability on the peninsula."
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told a press conference
Friday in Moscow that a slump has been noticed in Russia's ties
with the DPRK in recent years and it should be overcome by joint
efforts.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the relationship between the two countries
will be in focus of Putin's talks with the DPRK leaders and "many
economic projects could be implemented to our mutual benefit."
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two countries will also discuss
international problems, "mainly the situation in the Asian Pacific
region and particularly on the Korean peninsula," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last February, Ivanov visited Pyongyang and co-signed a new
treaty of friendship, good neighborliness and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Putin also may pay a visit to Seoul because"
there is an invitation from South Korea (to Putin) and it is being
considered, but described the date of such a visit as "premature."

<P>
BERLIN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder

<HEADLINE> Greece Determined to Take All Measures to Combat Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government Friday
expressed its determination to take all necessary measures in a
bid to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
During a governmental committee meeting chaired by Prime
Minister Costas Simitis, the premier called for the creation of a
united front by the government, political parties, institutions
and the people, in order to combat terrorism because the
phenomenon of terrorism distorted Greece's image, the Macedonian
Press Agency (MPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility to change Greece's legislation on anti-
terrorism, Simitis said that no change in its core was being
discussed but an exchange of views was underway on the legal
procedure problems that might come up.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that Greece will sign with the U.S. a
memorandum for police cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In the past 25 years, Greece's November 17 terrorist group has
killed more than 20 people, including a number of U.S. diplomats
working at the U.S. embassy in Athens.
</P>
<P>
For years, the U.S. has pressured Greece to change its
domestic legislation and sign a pact for the two police forces to
closely cooperate in dealing with terrorism.
</P>
<P>
So far, Greece has passed two counter-terrorism bills and has
issued a great number of declarations as part of its efforts to
combat terrorism.

</P>
<P>
Putin decided to visit Brunei to attend the APEC summit on

<P>
Earlier Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that at the

<HEADLINE> Russia Specifies Its Initiative on Pan-European ABM System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
here Friday made public the details of the program proposed by
Russian President Vladimir Putin on creating a non-strategic anti-
ballistic missile (ABM) defense system in Europe.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference on the outcomes of the Russian-U.S. summit
in Moscow on June 3-5, Ivanov told the press that the content of
Putin's proposal to the European countries is following:
</P>
<P>
-- Jointly assess the character and scale of missile
proliferation and possible missile threats;
</P>
<P>
-- Jointly develop the concept of the all-European system of
non-strategic ABM, the order of its creation and deployment;
</P>
<P>
-- Jointly create the all-European multilateral center for
warnings about missile launchings;
</P>
<P>
-- Conduct joint staff exercises, research and experiments;
</P>
<P>
-- Jointly develop systems of non-strategic anti-missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, during his working visit in Italy, Putin proposed to
Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato to deploy an anti-ballistic
missile defense system for the European continent jointly with
Europe and NATO and with the involvement of the United States, but
did not give the details of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Moscow is ready to hold constructive consultations
on all these suggestions with European states, stressing that
Putin's proposal "is a logical development of the Russian idea on
international cooperation in the field of non-strategic ABM."
</P>
<P>
"Russia has no intention to make West-European nations depend
on Russian anti-missile technologies," and "this cooperation is
not detrimental to the 1972 ABM treaty. Russia believes it is
basically important that a European non-strategic missile defense
system should be really Pan-European rather than of a bloc nature,
" said Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that questions of strengthening international
security and stability, above all, are to preserve ABM treaty and
the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which were also the
focus of the Putin-Clinton talks in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president "clearly expressed flat opposition to
Washington's plans of creating a national missile defense (NMD)
system and adjusting the 1972 ABM treaty in this connection," and
noted that such actions will lead to the destruction of this
important treaty,said Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
At the same day, Russian defense minister Igor Sergeyev also
expounded Putin's proposal at a meeting of the Russian-NATO
Permanent Joint Council in Brussels, emphasizing "Moscow considers
it fundamentally important that a European non-strategic ABM
system should not create new frontiers of distrust, opposition or
confrontation."
</P>
<P>
However, NATO Secretary-General George Robertson, for his part,
said Moscow's proposal "deserves attention and requires study and
clarification."
</P>
<P>
During U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Russia on June 3-
5,he and Russian President Vladimir Putin held long-time talks on
global strategic stability and bilateral ties, singed a joint
statement on the principles of the strategic stability in the
world and two agreements on cooperation in this sphere.
</P>
<P>
According to Ivanov, at the Moscow summit the Russian and U.S.
presidents also agreed to set up a bilateral working group to work
out measures to fight the terrorist threat from the Afghanistan
territory.

They appealed to Rwanda and Uganda for a cease of hostilities

High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Health Organization, the
U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the U.N.
Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the governments of Rwanda and Uganda to immediately

<P>
The entire civilian population of Kisangani was under fire and
completely cut off from humanitarian relief, with 19 children
killed recently, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
There was lack of water, food and electricity and dimmed
prospects for a major polio campaign, the U.N. Mission in
Kisangani has found.
</P>
<P>
Despite a ceasefire agreement by Rwanda and Uganda Thursday,
fighting continued for the fifth straight day with hundreds of
people reported to be dead or injured.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda used to be strong allies but now back
different rebel factions in the DRC. They have clashed for control

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Runs Into Interpretation Hitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The defense team
said on Friday that the two Libyans accused could not fully
understand what was said in court due to poor interpretation.
</P>
<P>
"An accused is entitled to understand the evidence that is
being provided by the crown (the prosecution) in a case against
him," said defense lawyer Richard Keen.
</P>
<P>
The Scottish lawyer said that in-court interpretation has to be
practical and effective. "The interpretation here seems to have
been far from practical and effective."
</P>
<P>
The defense team raised the matter on Friday when the trial
resumed.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima were
accused of planting the bomb on board the Pan Am Flight 103 that
killed 259 people on the airliner and 11 others on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans have listened through headphones to an Arabic
interpretation of the court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Another defense lawyer, William Taylor, cited a 1942 case in
Scots Law in which an appeal court overruled convictions of three
Polish soldiers on the grounds of inadequate interpretation.
</P>
<P>
If the interpretation issue could not be resolved by the
Scottish court on Dutch soil, it could be referred under the
European Convention for Human Rights to the Scottish High Court in
Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
The trial, that began on May 3 more than 12 months after the
two Libyans had turned themselves in, was expected to last up to a
year before the three Scottish judges could give their verdict on
the case.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the two Libyans would be sentenced to life
imprisonment and would have to serve their jail terms in Scotland.
If found not guilty or the prosecution could not prove the case
beyond reasonable doubt, the two would be set free.

<HEADLINE> China: It's Time for In-Depth Reflection on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- China said Friday that it is
time for in-depth reflection on Kosovo, a Yugoslav province, where
the current situation is very critical as Serbs are suffering from
deportation and persecution.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Shen Guofang, the deputy Chinese
permanent representative to the United Nations, took the floor at
an open U.N. Security Council meeting, at which Bernard Kouchner,
head of the U.N. Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK),
briefed the 15-nation body on the latest developments in the
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that it is time for in-depth reflection,"
he said. "The Security Council has the political responsibility
and moral obligation to face this reality, and it should seriously
seek the resolution to the serious problems faced by Kosovo,
otherwise the credibility of the United Nations will continue to
be impaired."
</P>
<P>
"First, the international presence should respect the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (FRY)," he said."UNMIK should respect the laws of FRY
and seek cooperation with FRY."
</P>
<P>
However, "some of the current administrative measures adopted
in Kosovo impair the sovereignty of FRY and it has created a false
impression that Kosovo is going to independence."
</P>
<P>
Shen said that "any attempt to lead Kosovo to independence is
dangerous and illegal, it will deprive the Balkan region of peace
and the ultimate victim will be the people of the Balkan region."
</P>
<P>
"UNMIK can not afford to make a slightest mistake on this very
important policy of issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, "we are very concerned with the security of Serbs
and other minorities in Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly oppose any forms of ethnic cleansing," he said. "
The flagrant violations of basic human rights in Kosovo, no matter
when it take place and which ethnic group it target, can not be
accepted by the international community."
</P>
<P>
"All human rights violations are crimes," he said. "The crimes,
be they big or small, can not be tolerated."
</P>
<P>
"In the same way, it is irresponsible to use past events as
excuses to explain the way to the critical situation," he said. "
We are concerned at the ways UNMIK and the international
peacekeepers turn about the situation."
</P>
<P>
Apart from that, he said, "What arises our particular concern
is that a large number of non-Kosovo Albanians have entered Kosovo,
and this will change the demographic composition of Kosovo," which
has a multi-ethnic society since ancient times.
</P>
<P>
"There should a Kosovo where different ethnic groups can have
peaceful coexistence, and this should be the target of UNMIK," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are opposed to any attempt to create national division and
sabotage national unity," he said. "Fundamentally, the solution to
the Kosovo issue can only be achieved within the framework of FRY
through substantial autonomy and good ethnic policy."

GDP in the first quarter of this year, Eurostat reported on Friday.

<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical office of the European

<P>
Exports, that grew by 3.2 percent in both the euro zone and the

that proper preparations for elections have not yet begun.
</P>
<P>
He said if preparations had started in May, the elections would
have been held in March or April next year but the present
problems would delay the process.
</P>
<P>
Maope said political parties are still grappling with two main
issues, namely disagreement on the electoral model to be used and
the restructuring of the senate.
</P>
<P>
There has been an agreement on the concept of a mixed member
electoral system but there is no consensus on how the seats will
be allocated under the proportional representation system, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Maope noted that the restructuring of senate is part of
Lesotho's Interim Political Authority's mandate to make it more
democratic and representative of the country and in terms of the
constitution, any change to the structure of the senate requires a
referendum.

JOHANNESBURG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- South African Water Affairs
Minister Ronnie Kasrils said on Friday that his ministry would
redouble efforts to prevent land pollution by the industry.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the parliament, Kasrils said he has set a
month-end deadline for resolution of the issue of polluted land
around Iscor's operations in the country. Iscor is the country's
iron and steel giant.
</P>
<P>
The matter had been dragging on for too long, he said in a
debate on his department's budget vote in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
People who lived in the polluted area had suffered greatly,
their properties were worthless, and the earth had been poisoned,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week Kasrils met Iscor representatives and residents of
the surrounding area.
</P>
<P>
Kasrils announced earlier this week that he had appointed a
representative to conclude agreements on his behalf with Iscor and
the other parties involved.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Visit Burundi Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Former South African president
Nelson Mandela will fly to Burundi next Monday to meet leaders of
various armed groups and people living in the country's
controversial regroupment camps.
</P>
<P>
The former president will visit Burundi from June 12 to 14 as
chief mediator for the conflict in the Great Lakes country,
according to a statement issued by Mandela's office on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela met with Burundi President Pierre Buyoya in
Johannesburg on Wednesday and they reached an agreement to release
Burundians detained in the regroupment camps by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
The two statesmen also discussed the release of political
prisoners, some of whom have been held for seven years without
trial.
</P>
<P>
Although they did not reach any agreement on this aspect, they
undertook to discuss the matter again during Mandela's visit to
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
During forthcoming visit, Mandela is also expected to meet with
Burundi' s religious leaders, the judiciary, the cabinet, members
of the civil society groups and women's groups.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has invited Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to
accompany him on the visit.
</P>
<P>
At least 200,000 people, both Hutus and Tutsis, have been
killed since October 1993 when the conflict between
Tutsi-dominated government and Hutu rebels broke out.
</P>
<P>
As mediator, Mandela is responsible for developing a formula
for a peaceful resolution to the conflict that can also be used as
a model for other African countries where ethnic tension has led
to political instability.

JOHANNESBURG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States has a duty

He was quoted by South African Press Association as saying that
the United States should help alleviate increasing deprivation,

"Diseases like AIDS know no borders and, as we have recently
seen, economic instability in emerging markets can cause havoc

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Strengthen Scrutiny of Poverty Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 9 (Xinhua) --The South African Department of
Finance plans to introduce new measures to monitor the
expenditure of poverty relief funds by government departments, a
senior official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Government departments will in future have to submit quarterly
reports on poverty spending, said finance director-general Maria
Ramos while briefing the finance portfolio committee of the
parliament on supplementary estimates to the budget tabled earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
Government has distributed an extra 523.4 million rand (about
74.8 million U.S. dollars) to nine departments for poverty relief
and HIV/AIDS projects in the 2000/01 financial year, she said.
</P>
<P>
The funds form part of 1.2 billion rand (1.7 billion dollars)
budgeted for poverty relief and the sum of 75 million rand (10.07
million dollars) for HIV/Aids awareness campaigns.
</P>
<P>
With the budget deficit under control, the government's focus
should move toward making sure that funds allocated are spent
properly, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
"The real challenge for government going forward is to spend
the money that has been budgeted to spend," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to Ramos, six departments have asked if they could
roll over a total of 455.9 million rand (65.1 million dollars) in
poverty relief funds from the 1999/2000 financial year.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the unspent funds -- 256 million rand (36.5 million
dollars) -- came from the department of public works, while the
department of housing had 75 million rand (10.7 million dollars)
left and the department of welfare had 37.7 million rand (5.4
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The finance department would establish a "technical committee"
to advise government departments on poverty relief spending, Ramos
said.
</P>
<P>
It is also an exploring option to further involve the
Independent Development Trust in poverty project management, she
said, adding that it is well within the parliament's ambit to
summon government ministers and directors-general to answer
concerns about poverty spending.
</P>
<P>
The South African government allocated 653 million rand (93.2
million dollars) to poverty relief measures at the time of the
Budget, which together with the new disbursements, leaves 98.6
million rand (14 million dollars) unallocated.

<HEADLINE> Continued Ceasefire Violations in Congo Disturbing: Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Continued ceasefire violations by
the rebel groups and foreign forces in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) are threatening the peace and stability of that
country, said Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven Mahachi here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a graduation ceremony for 56 junior staff officers
at the Zimbabwe Staff College, Mahachi said the repeated
violations, which were sometimes characterized by fierce fighting
among themselves, were disturbing enough to weaken the foundation
for peace in that part of the region.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda, former allies in the DRC conflict, went into
clashes again in the last few days, causing the death of about 50
people in Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
At least 15 ceasefire agreements have been reached and
abandoned since the fighting between the two countries erupted on
Monday, Mahachi said.
</P>
<P>
According to the defense minister, a 20-man United Nations team
based in Kisangani failed to broker peace in the area because the
commanders of the rival Rwandan and Ugandan armies refused to
honor any peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the Joint Military Commission and the envisaged
arrival of a U.N. peacekeeping force in the DRC are expected to
arrest the situation from degenerating into further turmoil and
bloodshed, he said.
</P>
<P>
War is undesirable, he said, especially in the African
continent which is grappling to find solutions to the trouble in
Sierra Leone, the border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea,
and the conflicts in Angola and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"The region awaits the speedy deployment of the U.N.
peacekeeping force with bated breadth," he said, adding that this
should kick off the systematic withdrawal of Zimbabwean troops as
provided for in the Lusaka peace agreement signed by all
belligerents in July and August last year.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola have been supporting DRC President
Laurent Kabila in fighting rebels in the country backed by Uganda
and Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Not to Beg Britain for Money: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Friday said his government will not ask for money from Britain to
fund the land resettlement program because the former colonial
power has failed to honor its promise on many occasions.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a campaign rally in Marange communal area of east
Zimbabwe, Mugabe said Britain had agreed to release funds on many
occasions when the Zimbabwean government embarked on the land
acquisition program after the expiry of the Lancaster House
constitution but never fulfilled the promise.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government would go ahead and take the land and
resettle thousands of peasants who had been deprived of their
ancestral land for many years, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are going ahead to take our land and resettle people with
the little resources we have," he said, adding that "but if
Britain wants to provide funds, it is welcome."
</P>
<P>
The president said his government has never refused to pay
compensation to white farmers as long as Britain provides the
funds. Zimbabweans could not pay for their land, he said.
</P>
<P>
He lashed out at British Prime Minister Tony Blair, accusing
him of refusing to support the land program and creating many
problems the country is facing.
</P>
<P>
According to Mugabe, in 1996 the Conservative British
government of John Major agreed to fund the resettlement program
and invited him to London for talks.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was reached on the release of funds but
unfortunately this failed to materialize because Major lost the
election to Blair, he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about white commercial farmers, the president said they
are like Blair who never wants to see blacks being given their
land. Instead, he said, the whites supported and funded the
opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in a bid to take
back their properties.
</P>
<P>
According to Mugabe, the actions of the white farmers to oppose
the Draft Constitution and force their workers to support the MDC
angered war veterans and youths of the ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front.
</P>
<P>
"I did not order them to invade the farms as their patron, but
they did it on their own," he said, warning that people would soon
target other whites in the mines and factories.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would soon introduce price controls as
producers are profiteering at the expense of suffering people.

40-kilometer Tripoli-Zogorta highway and a sanitary drainage
station in Sidon.
</P>
<P>
Egypt exported 28,750 tons of potatoes to Lebanon at a value of
6.3 million dollars in 1999 and is trying to export other
commodities such as rice and electrical products to the country.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- "Middle East 2000 -- First Middle East Industry Fair"
will be organized in southeastern Diyarbakir Province between
September 27 and October 3.
</P>
<P>
Sevket Akalin, general coordinator of the International Fair and
Foreign Trade Company, said on Friday the preparations for the fair
are underway.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Industry Federation, among others, will join the fair,
said Akalin, adding that "We hope this fair will be the beginning
of the relations we desire to have with our neighboring countries.
We target at improving the regional trade and directing our
products to the foreign markets, starting from the neighboring
countries."
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Anex An Express, a private Turkish airlines company,

<P>
The company's president, Sadi Erguvenc, said on Friday that the
company would fly mainly to European countries in addition to
domestic flights.
</P>
<P>

<P>
NICOSIA -- Bulgaria has sent a new draft agreement on preventing
double taxation to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Bulgaria decided to revoke a 15-year treaty with
Cyprus on avoiding double taxation.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's decision was aimed to curtail money laundering and
black economy of the country and to stop people living in Bulgaria
from setting up businesses in Cyprus and using them to siphon
incomes and profits out of Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Finance Minister Takis Clerides said the deal is expected
to be clinched by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Urged to Industrialize New Research Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
today urged scholars and scientists to accelerate technological
innovation and turn their research findings into products as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
These scientific achievements must be industrialized if they
are to become the driving force behind the nation's economic and
social development, Li said at the conference of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the Chinese Academy of Engineering (
CAE) which closed today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Industrialization of scientific achievements has a great
bearing on changing China's existing course of economic growth,
readjusting its economic structure and enhancing its overall
strength, he said.
</P>
<P>
Scholars of the CAS and CAE can play a very important role in
this regard, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"We must strengthen study of basic science and work to achieve
first-rate innovation results. Scholars of the two academies
should play bigger roles in basic science research," he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier called on scientists to focus on key technical
issues and make a breakthrough in the fields in which China enjoys
comparative advantages.
</P>
<P>
The scholars should train young scientists, let them advance,
pass on to them scientific methods and set an example for them in
maintaining a disciplined attitude toward academics, he said.
</P>
<P>
Popularization of scientific knowledge in all trades is crucial
for revitalizing China through science and wiping out superstition
and pseudoscience, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Scholars and scientists should regard popularization of science
as their sacred mission, write more books on popular science, and
work to improve the scientific and cultural levels of the Chinese
people, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Steps Up Excavation at Ancient Zeugma Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is accelerating excavations at
the ancient city Zeugma, a Roman ruin in southern Gaziantep
Province, which will soon be submerged by the Birecik Dam.
</P>
<P>
Mehmet Onal, the archaeologist responsible for the excavations,
on Friday praised President Ahmet Sezer's decision to extend the
date when the dam across the Euphrates River would release water,
as part of the government's ambitious plans to generate electricity
and irrigate vast areas of dry land.
</P>
<P>
However, the extension by 10 days is not enough, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We have found two of the Roman villas at the site. Despite all
our efforts, a part of the history will remain in darkness by the
inundation because we do not have sufficient time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zeugma, hailed as a "second Pompeii" by archaeologists who have
unearthed valuable relics there, can be marked into three
archaeological zones, two of which are scheduled to be inundated in
June and October respectively.
</P>
<P>
But the third and greatest part of the site will not be drowned
by the reservoir, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Zeugma was a summer place of the wealthy Roman people living on
the banks of Euphrates River, who brought some of the best artists
of the time there, Onal said, adding that the unique mosaics and
frescos unearthed at the site had been transferred to the Gaziantep
Archeology Museum.
</P>
<P>
"Zeugma, which is only five meters under the soil, is the way to
reach the people who lived 2,000 years ago, to recognize them and
to see their artifacts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Southeastern Anatolia Project Regional
Development Administration, a Turkish governmental agency on
sustainable development, signed a memo of understanding with
Packard Humanities Institute (PHI), a California-based foundation
in the United States, to reinforce the emergency rescue work at
Zeugma.
</P>
<P>
The PHI has agreed to earmark a budget of 5 million U.S. dollars
for the excavation, conservation and study of Zeugma.
</P>
<P>
Turkey boasts of numerous ancient Greek and Roman cities with
antiquities that are among the finest and most abundant in the
world.

<HEADLINE> Aftershocks Rock Northern Turkey, No Injuries Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 9 (xinhua) -- Two moderate aftershocks hit Cerkes
township of Cankiri Province, some 100 kilometers north of the
Turkish capital Ankara, early Friday morning, said the Anatolia
News Agency. No casualties or damage were reported so far.
</P>
<P>
The first tremor, measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale, jolted
Cerkes at 0:28 a.m. (2128 GMT), the Bogazici University Kandilli
Observatory Center and Seismology Institute said.
</P>
<P>
The second aftershock, with a magnitude of 5.2, struck at 6:14
a.m. (0314 GMT), the report said. It was also felt in the
surrounding provinces.
</P>
<P>
Both tremors were aftershocks of the 5.9-magnitude earthquake
which rocked Cerkes at 5:41 a.m. (0241 GMT) on Tuesday, killing
three people, injuring dozens and damaging thousands of houses.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, an earthquake-prone country with some areas situated
along fault belts, suffered two devastating earthquakes last year,
a 7.4-magnitude one in the Marmara region in August and a 7.2-
magnitude one in November in the Bolu Province.
</P>
<P>
Some 20,000 people were killed in the two quakes and the
property losses were estimated at 20 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Prices Unchanged in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. wholesale prices held
steady in May as falling costs for energy products, eggs and other
food items more than offset increased prices for cars, paper
products and books, the Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The flat reading in department's Producer Price Index, which
measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer,
followed a 0.3 percent decline in wholesale prices in April pulled
down by a sharp drop in the costs of energy.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile energy and food categories, the "core"
rate of inflation at the wholesale level last month rose 0.2
percent, slightly faster than many analysts were forecasting. In
March and April, core prices rose a tiny 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Energy prices fell 0.5 percent in May, following a sharp 4.1
percent decline the month before. Food prices in May fell 0.2
percent, after posting a sharp 1 percent increase in April.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, car prices rose 0.9 percent in May, the largest gain
since September, and light truck prices went up 0.4 percent. Paper
products rose 2.8 percent, the biggest increase since October 1989
and book prices jumped a record 2.4 percent, surpassing the
previous record increase of 1.6 percent in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, wholesale prices have been rising at an
annual rate of 4.3 percent, compared with a 3 percent gain for all
of 1999. The pickup in this year's wholesale prices largely
reflects rising energy costs.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since
last June, including an aggressive half-point increase in May to
slow the economy and keep inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
Some recent economic reports, including home sales, factory
orders and unemployment, have offered signs that the economy may
be slowing a bit. Against this backdrop, economists have offered
mixed opinions on whether Fed policy-makers will nudge up rates
for a seventh time when they meet June 27 and 28.

JOHANNESBURG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- South African Minister in the
Presidency Essop Pahand on Friday defended President Thabo Mbeki's
stand over Zimbabwean land reform, refuting charges that this
policy had harmed his international image.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a parliament debate on the Government Communication
and Information System budget vote, Pahad said everyone in the
ruling African National Congress agreed with Mbeki's position and
approach, which was aimed at finding solutions to a very complex
problem.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki has been accused by the opposition of failing to condemn
Zimbabwean President Rober Mugabe for allowing war veterans to
occupy white- owned farms.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mbeki still enjoyed high international respect,
which could be shown during his recent international trip.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said when Mbeki was in Europe recently, the prime
minister of Portugal invited him to attend the next European Union
summit on June 19 which will be hosted by Portugal.
</P>
<P>
The president of Argentina had also asked Mbeki to attend the
Mercusor summit later this year.

<HEADLINE> Kong Shows Samsonov Who Is Best </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TANGSHAN, North China, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Kong Linghui,
who dethroned Vladimir Samsonov as the world's top-ranked table
tennis player early this month, blanked the lanky Belorussian in
Helongjiang's 3-1 win over Borussia Dusseldorf in the quarter-
finals of the World Club Championship here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kong, 1995 world champion, showed his flair and form as he
nipped former European champion 21-16, 21-18 in 20 minutes after
Japanese Koji Matsushita pulled one point back in the third game.
</P>
<P>
Helongjiang, coached by Kong's father Kong Xiangzhi, is the
winner of the Chinese Super League while Dusseldorf has added the
European club championship to its German league title.
</P>
<P>
Kong Linghui said that Samsonov didn't play to his best today
but he remained a major threat to Chinese in the Olympic Games
this summer.
</P>
<P>
"He couldn't adapt himself to hot and humid weather and didn't
show his killing instinct," said Kong.
</P>
<P>
Kong put Helongjiang in lead as he clinched the opening game
against former World Cup holder Jorg Rosskopf of Germany, 21-5, 21-
17.
</P>
<P>
Yan Sen played an attacking game to upset Samsonov 21-17, 20-22,
21-19 in the second set, but Koji, arguably the best defensive
player in the world, downed China's under-21 national champion Hou
Yingchao 21-15, 14-21, 21-15.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov, a first round casualty in the European championships
late last month, could not reverse his bad form as he fell a
victim to the Chinese whom the Belorussian had beaten many times.
</P>
<P>
"It was my last game for Dusseldorf," said Samsonov. "I will
join Belgian club Royal Charleroi next season."
</P>
<P>
Samsonov also said he would marry his childhood sweetheart on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
Helongjiang will clash with defending world club champion
Chinese Army for a final berth on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Army, led by Olympic champion Liu Guoliang who has
been cleared of doping suspicions last month, whitewashed Royal
Charleroi 3-0 in the quarters.
</P>
<P>
Liu failed in a doping check last August in the world
championships in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, but he was cleared by
the International Table Tennis Federation after the follow-up
tests proved the previous positive result was caused by Liu's
dysfunctioned metabolism.
</P>
<P>
Liu nipped Belgian number one Jean-Michel Saive 21-15, 21-17 at
the first game and Liu Guozheng edged Croatia's two-time World Cup
winner Zoran Primorac 21-6, 11-21, 21-19 in the second.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tao was good enough to beat Canadian Johnny Huang 21-10,
21-19 although the Chinese colonel looked slow and made quite a
few errors.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Daewoo Securities, spearheaded by Kim Taek Soo,
ousted Swedish champion Adleranz 3-0 to make the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Joo Se Hyuk played a chop-and-attack game to outlast Swedish
star Jan-Ove Waldner 21-16, 15-21, 21-18.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, who and Liu Guoliang are the only two players to have
won a "Grand Slam" of Olympic, world championships and World Cup
singles titles, virtually broke down in the final minutes of the
deciding set as the 20-year-old South Korean kept attacking right
after serving.
</P>
<P>
Kim Taek Soo, tipped as the best penhold topspin player in the
world, routed less known Magnus Wahlgren of Sweden 21-17, 21-12,
before Kim Song Hui overcame Park Sang Joon of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea 17-21, 21-18, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo Securities will take on SVS Niederosterreich of Austria,
which reached the last four with a 3-0 victory over French
champion Levallois.

BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will create a better
environment to attract students studying abroad to return for the
city's economic development, Beijing Vice-Mayor Lin Wenyi said
today.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, the municipal government will raise its work
efficiency, launch a venture capital system, improve the legal

Statistics show some 80,000 people in Beijing have gone to
study abroad since the late 1970s, and one third of them have
returned after completing their studies.
</P>
<P>
The development of Beijing will be centered around the
knowledge-based economy and the returned students are important
human resources, Zhang Fusen, deputy secretary of the Beijing
Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said at the
seminar.

<HEADLINE> Clean Fuel Put to Test in East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- China's first filling station
sporting pumps full of light hydrocarbon, a pollution-free fuel to
replace gasoline, held a test run today in Jinhua City of Zhejiang
Province, an economic powerhouse in the east.
</P>
<P>
Twenty refitted cars, which can use either gasoline or light
hydrocarbon as fuel, today got fill-ups and took a spin through
the city streets.
</P>
<P>
Use of light hydrocarbon can cut 80 percent of the toxic
materials from auto exhaust, such as carbon monoxide, and can also
provide greater driving force than natural gas which is also
widely used as a pollution-free fuel for automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese automobiles use gasoline, even though its exhaust
contains a high percentage of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, lead,
sulfur, and other harmful chemicals. Scientists have suggested
that more clean fuels, such as natural gas, be used as gasoline
substitutes.
</P>
<P>
Light hydrocarbon is also an economical fuel, said Zhao,
because an average car will use about 40 liters of gasoline to run
400 km, but only use 34 liters of light hydrocarbon to cover the
same distance.
</P>
<P>
Construction of a standard gasoline filling station costs about
two million yuan (240,000 U.S. dollars). But the cost of
rebuilding a gas station into a light hydrocarbon station is only
200,000 yuan (24,000 U.S. dollars), Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
The hydrocarbon research was patented last September. The
Zhejiang provincial government plans to promote its use throughout
the province this year.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Woos Foreign Investment in Agricultural Development Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Zhejiang Province in east China has
established seven agricultural development zones which are
encouraging foreign investment, a senior provincial official said
here today at the ongoing 2000 Zhejiang Investment and Trade Fair.
</P>
<P>
Wang Liangqian, director in charge of the provincial rural work
office, said that foreign investors are encouraged to sponsor
solely-funded enterprises, Sino-foreign joint ventures and
cooperative projects in the development zones and they will enjoy
preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang has so far approved 190 foreign-funded agricultural
projects, involving a combined contractual foreign investment of
180 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua also learned today from the investment and trade fair
that the Ningbo Baoxin Stainless Steel Co. Ltd, which was jointly
funded by two Chinese steel companies and three Japanese companies,
will get 1.3 billion yuan in investment for its second phase.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to build the Sino-Japanese joint venture
into a stainless steel production base with an annual output of
500,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The first phase involved a total investment of 1.747 billion
yuan, with investment from the Chinese side accounting for 66
percent, and the Japanese side, 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
The company has exported 1,000 tons of products to the United
States, Japan and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
So far, China's stainless steel production capacity is only 100,
000 tons, while annual consumption stood at 600,000 tons. The gap
between supply and demand will further widen to one million tons
by 2006.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Consumption Turns Out to Be Engine of China's Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Consumption has turned out to be
the major growth engine in China while the government's
infrastructure program is still the driving force for investment
growth.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the widely-held argument that China's economy is
driven by the government investment and exports, analysts from the
Hong Kong-based bank Standard and Chartered believed that the
strong recovery is actually rather broadly based.
</P>
<P>
The country has registered a robust growth in the first quarter
in retail sales, investment, exports and imports, but as far as
the contribution to growth is concerned, the recovery is led by
consumption, they said.
</P>
<P>
A report carried in the latest issue of Viewpoints released by
the bank on Friday also showed that the contribution of
consumption to China's gross domestic product (GDP) growth
increased to 62 percent in the first quarter this year from 49
percent in 1998, while the contribution from investment declined
to 26 percent from 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the government's infrastructure program is
still the driving force for investment growth, but its role in
driving GDP growth has been greatly reduced. Consumption has begun
to replace investment as the major growth engine, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Further studies made by the bank indicated that it is true that
export growth has become more pronounced as a result of a robust
recovery in the East Asian economies, but for a big "continental'
economy such as China, the level of consumption is ultimately the
main determinant of economic growth in the long term.
</P>
<P>
Economists here also said that now that China's consumption
growth has stabilized and become the key economic driver, the
coming phase of economic expansion will be more sustainable.
</P>
<P>
"There is no lack of driving forces for consumption growth in
China at this development stage," the economists said. They
expected an annual rise of at least 10 percent in China's consumer
services consumption in the coming decade since the tertiary
sector accounts for less than 30 percent of its GDP.
</P>
<P>
Taken together with the consumption growth in other aspects,
they said, there are reasons to expect potential consumption
growth at the present stage of development to exceed seven percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
China's consumption growth has experienced both a structural
and a cyclical slowdown since 1994 because of as a rapid
improvement in the living standard of the people in the past two
decades and the reform of state-owned enterprises and the
consequential reform of the pension, employment, housing,
education and medical care systems in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the consumption slowdown to a three-year
austerity program by the government, which checked the overheating
of both consumption and investment during the period from 1992 to
1994.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the current consumption-boosting policy, they
said it helps revive the cyclical slowdown, but focuses too much
on investment and urban consumption. "The effects of the
government's infrastructure program remains less-than-expected,
and rural consumption is still out of reach of the policy," they
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
However, they believed that helped by China's imminent
accession to the World Trade Organization, China's consumption
growth prospects will continue to improve with a GDP growth of
about eight percent in 2000.

SHENZHEN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The second phase of a harnessing
project on the Shenzhen River, which borders south China's
Guangdong Province and Hong Kong, was finished here today after
three years of construction.
</P>
<P>
As the narrow 37-km-long river is incapable of draining flood
water during the summer flood season, the Shenzhen government
joined efforts with neighboring Hong Kong to launch the river-
harnessing project in December 1995.

<HEADLINE> China to Step up Personnel Management Reform in State-funded Institutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- To make its state-funded
institutions more dynamic, China will speed up reforms of their
personnel management, including offering contracted employment and
flexible salaries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking today at a joint press conference, Zhang Xuezhong,
executive vice-minister of personnel, said the move, designed to
build an army of better quality professionals and give full play
to their initiative, will be introduced into the institutions of
scientific research, higher learning and public health.
</P>
<P>
Such reforms will then move on to state-funded cultural, radio
and television, and publishing institutions, according to senior
officials from the Organization Department of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, and the ministries of Education,
Science and Technology, and Health.
</P>
<P>
Officials say new personnel management systems suited to
different institutions should be established, and the personnel
management system for the Communist Party of China (CPC) and
government departments should no longer be used by state-funded
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The personnel management systems of the state-funded
institutions should separate themselves from those of the party
and the government departments, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
The reform measures also include the expansion of power of
different institutions in personnel management in line with their
actual conditions and establishment of a mechanism of self-review
by state-funded institutions.

<HEADLINE> Humankind Under Threat of Geochemical Hazards: Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist has warned that
human beings may be threatened by outbreaks of geochemical hazards
if they fail to control the amount of harmful materials released
into the soil.
</P>
<P>
Geochemical hazards have been called "chemical time bombs" by
some European scientists because they may suddenly burst forth due
to the long-term accumulation of harmful materials in the earth,
causing massive damage to agricultural production and people's
health.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the severe aftermath of the 'bomb explosion' is
often underestimated," said Prof. Xie Xuejin, a scholar with the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China's top scientific think
tank. "People care more about clean water and sky, thinking that's
all there is to a good environment."
</P>
<P>
Human beings have discarded waste and chemical materials into
the earth since the Bronze Age, especially during the European
Industrial Revolution that started in the 1760s.
</P>
<P>
Although modern agricultural technology has helped to
dramatically increase the grain output, an enormous amount of
pesticides and fertilizer have been left in the soil, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
"Few people have realized that the heavily-polluted earth may
take its 'revenge' if human beings put too many hazardous things
into it," said the geochemical researcher.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, which has a long history of industrialization, 15
percent of cultivated land is no longer arable or even cannot be
restored with modern technology due to serious pollution, Xie said
today at a CAS symposium.
</P>
<P>
"China could suffer even more severe geochemical hazards than
Europe, even though its industrial history is much shorter,
because environmental pollution is getting worse quickly," he
warned, blaming the country's mushrooming township enterprises
with poor pollution-control measures as a major source of
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Environmental monitoring in east China has revealed that the
amounts of mercury, phosphorous, lead, sulfur and pesticides such
as DDT contained in the soil have risen over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
The scientist noted that the fight against geochemical hazards
would be long-term. Control measures include forming a multi-level
monitoring system in big cities, mines, and along major rivers.
</P>
<P>
Scientists want to imitate the self-cleaning process of nature.
Under the European Union's McSharry Program, 15 percent of
cultivated land in EU will be turned into afforestation zones by
the year 2010. It is believed that by adding limestone to the soil
to prevent soil acidification, 40 percent of the harmful elements
in the soil will disappear after 85 years.
</P>
<P>
And plants can be used to absorb dangerous chemical materials
and metals. Plant roots will prevent pollutants on the earth's
surface from sinking deeper into the soil and likely polluting
underground water.
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Science and Technology has set up a
pollution monitoring system targeting the air, the water and the
soil in Beijing, aiming to create a model for pollution control in
other Chinese cities.

<HEADLINE> Manila Rules out Deadline for Talks on Hostages' Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Contrary to reports, Philippine
President Joseph Estrada did not set a June 12 deadline for the
safe release of 21 hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf in Jolo, the
presidential palace said.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing, Press Undersecretary Mike Toledo said the
president merely wanted to have "substantial" developments in the
negotiations to take place by then.
</P>
<P>
"The president didn't impose any deadline on the negotiating
panel. Negotiations such as this situation cannot be time bound.
The president did say he would want some substantial developments
by June 12," Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports claimed that the president gave the
negotiating panel up to June 12 to secure the release of the 21
hostages.
</P>
<P>
But Toledo said the president merely "expressed the desire to
have some substantive results in the next couple of days."
</P>
<P>
When asked what would happen if the hostages are not released
by June 12, Toledo said the negotiations would still continue.
</P>
<P>
He said the most substantive result would be the hostages' safe
release, adding that the panel members are "optimistic" that "
there would be something substantive" that could happen by June 12.
</P>
<P>
Toledo also said the government panel headed by Robert
Aventajado has received word from the hostage takers that they
want their leader Khadafy Janjalani included in the talks.
</P>
<P>
The president, he further said, has given the government panel
"full authority and discretion" to make decisions on the ground,
though substantive decisions would have to be brought to the
president.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Govt, Opposition Talk Peace Amid Fierce Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government of People
's Alliance Friday continued peace talks with the main opposition
United National Party (UNP) as fierce fighting raged between
government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels in the northern Jaffna
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Two delegations, led respectively by President Kumaratunga and
UNP leader Wickremesinghe, had discussed the key land issue in the
radical power-sharing constitutional reforms, aimed at ending the
17-year ethnic conflicts between majority Sinhalese and minority
Tamils.
</P>
<P>
"The two delegations continued the discussions on provisions
relating to land in the proposed constitution, agreement was
reached on several matters," said a joint communique issued by the
two parties.
</P>
<P>
It said the subcommittee on land will consider the remaining
issues and report to the plenary.
</P>
<P>
During the talks President Kumaratunga emphasized the need to
reach agreement on all matters relating to the proposed
constitution expeditiously, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga had said she was keen to conclude talks with the
UNP by mid-June and press ahead with the constitutional reforms at
the earliest.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believed that a bipartisan approach between the
government and the UNP was crucial for any peace process to
succeed, as together they represent almost the entire majority
Sinhalese community.
</P>
<P>
Any agreement between the two main parties must be presented to
parliament and approved before it stands automatically dissolved
on August 24. Thereafter, fresh elections must be held by mid-
November.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fierce fighting erupted in Jaffna on Friday with
Tamil Tiger rebels launching a dawn attack on military defenses
around the town of Koddikamam but troops had beaten back the rebel
assault.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have been
fighting for a separate state for Tamils in the country's north
and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, who were accused of assassinating Minister of
Industrial Development C. V. Gunaratne on Wednesday, have opposed
the government's constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, Norway has been trying to bring the LTTE and the Sri
Lankan government to the negotiating table even as both sides
remained locked in fierce combat in Jaffna.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zimbabwe to Speed Up Land Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is facing
mounting pressure to accelerate land redistribution to thousands
of landless peasants in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The land issue which has been an emotive one since the turn of
the century took the front seat in February this year when war
veterans of the 1970s liberation struggle occupied more than 1,500
white-owned commercial farms.
</P>
<P>
Farm occupations by war veterans were met with resistance.
Five white farmers were allegedly murdered by war veterans and
their supporters in clashes that resulted in the damage of crops
and equipment worth millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans who have the support of President Robert
Mugabe vow that they will not leave the farms until the 804 farms
gazetted by the government in June are distributed to the
landless.
</P>
<P>
"As war veterans we are saying we want the government to move
fast and allocate land to people before the parliamentary
elections are held on June 24 and 25," said Zimbabwe National
Liberation War Veterans Association leader Chenjerai Hunzvi.
</P>
<P>
Facing this pressure, the government issued a preliminary
notice to compulsorily acquire 804 farms for resettlement
following the passage of the Constitutional Amendment Act and the
amendment of the Land Acquisition Act of 1992.
</P>
<P>
The amendments are intended to assure speedier land acquisition
by allowing the government to seize white-owned farms without
paying compensation.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, the land delivery processes have been cumbersome
and very slow as the "willing seller, willing buyer" promulgated
in the 1979 Lancaster House Agreement before Zimbabwe's
independence did not bring the intended results of giving land to
the majority of the people.
</P>
<P>
The Lancaster House Constitution prevented speedier land
delivery by outlawing constitutional reforms on land ownership for
the first 10 years to 1990.
</P>
<P>
After 1991, Zimbabwean government efforts to resettle people
were undermined by lack of funding for the land reform program.
</P>
<P>
The British government, which undertook to be the main donor of
Zimbabwe' s land reform program during the independence
negotiations in 1979, had promised to bankroll the exercise to the
tune of 30 million British pounds.
</P>
<P>
But Britain withdrew its support claiming that Mugabe was
giving the land to his "cronies and political allies".
</P>
<P>
Later it also said it would release the money for land reform
only on condition that violence and farm invasions end.
</P>
<P>
Since then Mugabe and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have
traded a war of words over the land issue.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has rejected such conditions saying Britain has a
historic obligation to provide the money.
</P>
<P>
Threats by other western countries to isolate Zimbabwe, impose
economic sanctions and cut donor aid have also added to the woes.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zimbabwe to Speed Up Land Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For lack of funds, the Zimbabwean government acquired only 3.5
million hectares between 1980 and 1990 and resettled 71,000
families out of a target of 162,000.
</P>
<P>
More are expected to be resettled on other 55 farms already
owned by the state.
</P>
<P>
And the glaring disparity in land ownership in this southern
African nation of more than 12.5 million people has forced blacks
to speak up despite the economic dangers that go with it.
</P>
<P>
At least 4,500 white commercial farmers own 75 percent of
arable land, or about 11.2 million hectares, with the majority of
people crowded in unproductive land.
</P>
<P>
About one million black communal farmers are still farming on
marginal soils, 16.3 million hectares in all.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, land plays the important role in social stability
and economic development in rural areas, where 70 percent of the
country's population live.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe recently said the revolutionary struggle to liberate the
country was not finished until land was given to the people.
</P>
<P>
He said in addition to the 804 farms that were gazetted for
acquisition, the government would look for more to add to the
list to speed up the land reform. "The next Parliament must take
bold measures to solve the land issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
The wave of farm invasions also threatens to spill to
neighboring countries like South Africa and Namibia which have
similar problems to that of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
South African President Thabo Mbeki secured 15 million U.S.
dollars in May from Norwegian and Saudi governments in a bid to
end farm invasions and defuse tension before the Zimbabwean
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said this will also add pressure on the Zimbabwean
government to speedily distribute land to its people.
</P>
<P>
Critics charged that the land issue is the last trump card for
Mugabe who is facing dwindling support because of high
unemployment, fuel and electricity shortages as well as
skyrocketing prices of basic commodities.
</P>
<P>
They said that Mugabe is using the land issue to divert
attention from the crumbling economy with more than 50 percent
unemployment, 60 percent interest rates and critical shortage of
foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said it is only after elections that violence and farm
 invasions will end. But war veterans leader Hunzvi said, "Every
person in Zimbabwe has a right to land. We want our land. We
will not stop until our people get back their land."

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Hold Workshop on Small, Medium-sized Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will host a
workshop on small and medium-sized enterprises in collaboration
with the Latin America Economic System (SELA) from June 12 to 15
in the country's capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is a result of a previous visit by SELA delegation
to Kenya in May 1999 to explore possibilities of promoting
cooperation between Latin American countries and the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
One of the major objectives of the workshop is to analyze the
achieved experiences in making industrial policies for small
enterprises, Kenyan Minister for Vocational Training Isaac Ruto
told a press conference here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a critical conference for Kenya, which will boost the
country's move toward industrial transformation and poverty
eradication," Ruto noted.
</P>
<P>
The participants to this conference will come from Latin
American countries and African nations including Argentina,
Chile, Peru, South Africa and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
SELA, a regional inter-governmental organization, groups 28
Latin American and Caribbean countries with an aim to promote
economic cooperation between its member states.
</P>
<P>
The small and medium-sized enterprises employ about 61 percent
of labor force in the east African country of Kenya and
contribute to 18 percent of the country's gross domestic product,
according to the Labor and Human Resource Development Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Accuses Rwanda of Violating Newly-Reached Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Friday accused the Rwandan
Patriotic Army (RPA) of attacking all the positions of the Uganda
People's Defence Forces which lasted three and half hours in
violation of a newly-reached ceasefire by multi-parties.
</P>
<P>
"The RPA launched a massive and persistent attack on all UPDF
positions lasting three and half hours," James Wapakabulo,
chairman of National Coordination Committee on the Region, told a
press conference Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The UPDF, remaining in its defence, repulsed all the attacks,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Following Uganda's proposal for a unilateral ceasefire in
Kisangani, a Tele-Conference was held on Thursday and participated
in by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Rwandan President Paul
Kagame, U.N. Secretary- General Kofi Annan, Ambassador of the
United States to the U.N. R. Holbrooke and U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for Africa Susan Rice.
</P>
<P>
The conference agreed that the UPDF and RPA cease fire at 16:00
 Kisangani time, according to Wapakabulo.
</P>
<P>
"In total disregard to the ceasefire agreement resulting from
the Tele- Conference, the RPA launched attacks again on our
positions Friday morning, which have also been repulsed," said
Wapakabulo.
</P>
<P>
"The RPA has persistently taken hostile measures to frustrate
U.N. deployment of the observers," he said, referring to the
unilateral ceasefire declared by Uganda Thursday given
preconditions of U.N. establishing an observer presence on the
UPDF side.
</P>
<P>
Uganda accused the Rwandan government of "flagrant breach" of
an agreement reached by the parties in the Tele-Conference and
Uganda's unilateral offer of ceasefire on Thursday, said
Wapakabulo.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops started to shell each other in
Kisangani, a northeastern city of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, after a UPDF's vehicle was attacked and destroyed Monday
morning. The fighting was the latest following clashes between the
two armies in early May.
</P>
<P>
The two former allies have their troops stationed in Kisangani
where they have backed rival rebel factions fighting against the
DRC President Laurent Kabila.

WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Last month's New Mexico wildfire caused more than 300
million U.S. dollars worth of damage to the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, including the loss of scientific work held in about 20
personal computers consumed by the blaze.
</P>
<P>
-- Britain's defense attache in Greece was shot dead by two
gunmen on motorcycles who fired into his car on a main Athens
thoroughfare Thursday morning, just days after a congressional
commission warning that the Greek government has not done enough
to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Senate approved a measure Thursday to require the
growing number of tax-exempt groups that now secretly raise and
spend unlimited sums on political activities to disclose their
contributors and spending.
</P>
<P>
-- Citing the Pentagon's own plan, critics of the proposed
antimissile defense and even some military experts say all flight
tests of the 60 billion dollar weapon have been rigged to hide a
fundamental flaw: the system cannot distinguish between enemy
warheads and decoys.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Microsoft took the first step toward appealing a sweeping
court order that would split it in two, suggesting that the ruling
be stayed from taking effect because it would inflict "irreparable
harm." Even if the extensive restrictions on Microsoft's
activities are implemented, people who follow and work with the
company say they don't expect much change.
</P>
<P>
-- Next week's Korean summit drew the full support of the
United States which has modest expectations. Russian President
Putin is planning to go to Pyongyang soon.

<TEXT>
<P>
RABAT, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Morocco said on Friday it would not
withdraw from the bid race to host the 2006 World Cup finals,
which broke Johannesburg's hopes of a possible deal during a visit
at the weekend by South African Sports Minister Ngconde Balfour.
</P>
<P>
South African officials said on Thursday that Balfour would try
to persuade Morocco to quit the race, leaving South Africa as the
only African candidate.
</P>
<P>
"Our brotherly South Africans are very welcome to visit us any
time they want. But they should not be under any illusion that
this means the slightest concession in our campaign to host the
2006 World Cup," Driss Benhima, vice-president of Morocco's bid
committee, was quoted by Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have accepted to meet the South African delegation but we
really don't know what the agenda would be," Benhima said.
</P>
<P>
FIFA's 24-man executive committee will meet in Zurich on July 5
and 6 to choose the winner of the bid.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Party Leader on Selection of Young Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Jiang Zemin today called
for redoubled efforts to train middle-aged and young leading
officials who are attuned to the requirements for work in the new
century.
</P>
<P>
"We should take active measures to select and train a great
number of fine young leaders in line with the principle of making
the ranks of cadres more revolutionary, younger in average age,
better educated and professionally more competent," said Jiang,
who is also China's president, at a national conference on Party
schools held here today.
</P>
<P>
It is important to select the right people in the first place,
and they must be trained, helped and supervised if they are to
become effective leaders, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Global competition today and in the future is one for talent,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Party schools can and should play an important role in training
young and middle-aged leading officials, and cadres' school are an
important channel for doing so, he said.
</P>
<P>
When it comes to Party building, it is vitally important to
improve the ideological and political quality of leading officials
at all levels, especially that of young leaders, in order to make
them a new generation of statesmen who are loyal to Marxism,
adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics, and are
capable of running the Party and the country, Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
He outlined four areas of emphasis for the training of young
leaders: They should cultivate a strong Party spirit and persist
in the Party's purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly; they
should be broad-minded and be good at observing the world
situation; they should be able to solve the sticky problems that
inevitably crop up in reforms, development and maintaining
stability; and they must have a thorough understanding of Marxism.
</P>
<P>
Young leaders should be selected with an open mind, Jiang said,
adding that the outdated practice of choosing leaders based on
seniority should be eliminated, and the new crop of leaders should
have both political integrity and professional ability.

<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Changchun Photoelectronic
Industrial Park, the first of its kind in China, was established
today in the Changchun High and New Technology Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
The park will attract home and overseas photoelectrons
producers to establish factories or branches. The products are
expected to cover laser and applied products, photoelectron
medical apparatus, photoelectron testing apparatus and optical
instruments, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
At the first phase, four development and research centers and
three enterprises will enter the park, which will cost 450 million
yuan (54 million U.S. dollars). The annual output of the park is
projected at 1.44 billion yuan (170 million U.S. dollars) at the
initial stage.
</P>
<P>
Changchun in northeast China, known as the country's automobile
city, is also the cradle of photoelectrons in China. The Changchun
Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics and Physics under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences is China's earliest and biggest base
for research and development in photoelectrons.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Supervision on Ethnic Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will take
measures to strengthen the supervision on ethnic medicine, an
official from the State Drug Administration said at a national
meeting on medicine supervision which ended today in Guiyang,
capital of Guizhou Province in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Ren Dequan, deputy director of the administration, said that
the move is aimed at controlling the number of ethnic medicine-
producing enterprises to promote the healthy development of the
sector.
</P>
<P>
China is home to many ethnic minorities, which have their own
medical theories and therapies. So far, production of Mongolian,
Ugyur, Tibetan and Dai medicines has already become substantial:
In Guizhou alone, the output value of ethnic medicine reached one
billion yuan (121 million US dollars) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The loose appraisal and approval procedures for ethnic medicine
enterprises have created a mess in some places, he said. One
province, for example, approved production of 200 kinds of ethnic
medicines in two years, leading to especially low quality of
medicine.
</P>
<P>
The administration will take one year to straighten out the
sector and issue new approval procedures. Those enterprises not up
to the requirement will be closed or ordered to suspend production,
according to Ren.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first one focusing on ethnic medicine since
the administration was established in 1998, was attended by 50
representatives from 11 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Calls for Closer Economic Cooperation With Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda
Mikhailova expressed hope on Friday that the trade and economic
cooperation between Bulgaria and Egypt will match their "
distinguished political ties."
</P>
<P>
At the close of her three-day visit in Cairo, Mikhailova said in
an interview with Egypt's Middle East News Agency that there are
diverse potentials for economic cooperation, particularly in the
engineering, chemical, military and machinery industries, between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria and Egypt have much in common in the economic
conditions, a similarity which can be a good basis for cooperation,
she said. She expressed regret that bilateral trade is current at a
low level of about 50 million U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria held an exhibition of agricultural products in Egypt
last year, which will be reciprocated by an Egyptian product
display in Bulgaria's capital Sofia in October, she added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Mideast peace process, the Bulgarian minister
said her country supports the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she called on the Palestinians to declare an
independent state after reaching a final peace agreement with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel are negotiating for a final
settlement of thorny issues including the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish
settlements, borders, Palestinian refugees and water.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian official also hoped that Syria and Israel would
resume peace negotiations, which broke down in January due to
disputes over Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights it seized
from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
"Peace in the Middle East would not be permanent and
comprehensive without the participation of Syria, which is an
important factor in the region," Mikhailova added.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Computer Society (BCS) and
Bangladesh Association for Software and Information Services (
BASIS) hailed the proposed budget for 2000-2001 fiscal for
withdrawing value-added taxes (VAT) from all computer systems, a
press release said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the press release, the presidents of BCS and BASIS said
withdrawal of VAT from all computer systems, parts and software at
production and supply stages and extension of tax holiday would
encourage greater use of computers for higher efficiency and
productivity.
</P>
<P>
Appreciating government's allocation of 150 million taka (2.9
million U.S. dollars) for development of programmers, they also
said the measures and "Equity Development Fund" for development of
software industry would give a boost to growing software export
industry.
</P>
<P>
In the budget for fiscal year 2000-2001 unveiled by Finance
Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria Thursday, proposals have been made for
total exemption of last fiscal's 15 percent supplementary duties
on modem, CD-ROM, drive, CD and software for accelerating the pace
of software industry.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has withdrawn customs duty and tax from computer
imports since 1998. However, Kibria lamented that the withdrawal
was yet to yield any major impact on the growth of the country's
software industry.
</P>
<P>
But the finance minister said the government will continue to
take concrete measures for ensuring transition to knowledge-based
industry, as "the benefits of knowledge-based growth will not
automatically accrue to developing countries like Bangladesh."

<HEADLINE> Farmers Sowing GM-Rapeseed Get Reimbursed: EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- European farmers who sowed
imported genetically-modified rapeseed seeds unknowingly will be
reimbursed, the European Union said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers should not suffer financially from a situation they
were not responsible for," said EU Farm Commissioner Franz
Fischler.
</P>
<P>
The seeds imported from Canada contained a small amount of
genetically-modified material.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
bloc, was still to consider how much money to pay for the farmers
in Britain, France and Germany where imported genetically-modified
rapeseed seeds were sown.
</P>
<P>
A commission spokesperson said Friday that the crops could not
be sold anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
The commission's decision to reimburse the farmers was approved
by the EU member states Friday at their cereals management
committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
The EU rules that the plants should have been left in the field
until flowering or June 30 for the usual area payment under the
union's Common Agricultural Policy.
</P>
<P>
The company that imported the genetically-modified rapeseed
seeds has agreed to compensate for the losses sustained by the
farmers in the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Some farmers, however, have already removed the crops when it
became known that they had sown genetically-modified rapeseed
seeds and the crops could no longer be marketed.
</P>
<P>
Farmers can now sow a new spring crop or leave the field fallow
until this autumn, the European Commission said.
</P>
<P>
Another payment will be made for the new sowing of the crop.

BRUSSELS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- European soccer's governing body
UEFA will dope-test two players randomly selected from each team
at all matches during the Euro 2000 tournament.
</P>
<P>
The players' numbers will be decided by draw during the
halftime break and the respective teams will be informed 15
minutes before the match end.
</P>
<P>
The players selected have to report to the doping center some
30 minutes after the end of the match. The period of time is for
them to shower and change and to talk to the media before going to
provide their urine sample.
</P>
<P>
Eight UEFA officers will supervise the test procedure, assisted
by a representative of the government authorities in one of the co-
hosts, Belgium or the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Samples will be analysed at International Olympic Committee
accredited laboratories in Belgium or the German city of Cologne.
But the two laboratories will stay distant from urine samples of
players from their countries.
</P>
<P>
There have been no high profile doping cases during the finals
of European championships, but Diego Maradona was thrown out of

Portyakov said that Russia's participation in the development
of western China will not only promote economic and trade ties
between the two countries, it will also enhance the bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Li Jingwen, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said that the cooperation between China and Russia has
solid basis in terms of history, geography and industrial
structure.
</P>
<P>
He said much of Russia's experience and technology can be
applied to the development of western China, stressing that from a
long-term perspective, great potential exists for future
cooperation between China and Russia in the region.
</P>
<P>
The borderline between China and Russia and other countries of
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) stretches for more
than 1,000 km. The Euro-Asian Bridge, an important passage linking
the Orient to Central Asia and Europe, runs through China's west.
The ancient "Silk Road" and Genghis Khan's westward expedition had
immeasurable influence on the course of world history.
</P>
<P>
Both Chinese and Russian authorities hold that the development
of western China will benefit the economic development and social
stability of China's neighboring countries.
</P>

strategy of developing and opening up its western areas and said

Kanstandin Remchukov, vice chairman of the natural resources
committee of Russian Duma, said that the Russian government has

CHONGQING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia is taking part in China's
ambitious program to develop the vast western areas, said a
Russian official here today.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Portyakov, counselor at the Russian embassy to China,
said that Russia and China are now engaged in some trial
development projects in China's Xinjiang Autonomous Region and
Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
Attending an international symposium on developing China's west,
Portyakov said the cooperation projects, which will strengthen
Sino-Russian ties, include building a modern plant to make power
transmitting equipment in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Russia and China are also negotiating on joint exploration of
mineral resources, petroleum and natural gas in Qinghai and
Xinjiang, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, exchanges between Russia and the local governments
and enterprises in western China are becoming more frequent, and
the border trade volume between western China and localities in
Russia is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Last June, the Chinese government launched its grand plan to
develop China's western region, which covers 12 provinces,
autonomous regions and a municipality. The ambitious move has
attracted world attention, and now some Western transnational
corporations have increased their presence in China's west.
</P>
<P>
Portyakov said that Russia is now involved in power generating
projects in China's Hebei, Hubei and Jiangsu provinces.
</P>
<P>
Russia and China have successfully cooperated in some heavy
industry and power generating projects, which have laid a sound
basis for Russia to join in the greater development of China's
west, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> HK Govt Conducts Manpower Studies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region SAR) government is conducting two studies on
the impact of China's accession to the World Trade Organization (
WTO) and the restructuring of Hong Kong's economy on the local
labor market.
</P>
<P>
Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, commissioner for labor of the Hong
Kong SAR, made the disclosure when he addressed the 25th Jubilee
Anniversary and Speech Day of the Cotton Spinners Association
Prevocational School Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cheung said that as China is well-poised to join the WTO, Hong
Kong is expected to benefit from new business and employment
opportunities. To grasp these new opportunities, Hong Kong has to
possess the right kind of human resources in order to tie in with
such developments, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the two studies would cover the employment
prospects of workers aged 40 and above in the labor market and the
collection of views from employer associations and trade unions on
the demand of training for workers.
</P>
<P>
The findings of these studies would be useful in formulating
long-term policies on human resources development in Hong Kong, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Cheung said that while the government is strengthening its
overall and long-term planning of human resources, it has not
overlooked the employment demand of individual working stratums.
</P>
<P>
In order to alleviate the unemployment problem of young people,
the government last September launched the first-ever Youth Pre-
Employment Training Program, which benefited more than 10,000
youngsters in one or more modules, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that with breakthrough development in technology and
the rapid expansion of the Internet, the worldwide economic and
social structures would also undergo radical changes.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Hong Kong's education system would undergo major
and significant changes, Cheung said that regardless of the final
direction of education reforms, there is a consensus in the
community that the next generation should be willing to learn,
effective in communication, ready to accept responsibilities and
eager to innovate.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets Swiss Visitor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National
Committee, today told the former president of the Swiss Federal
Council that tolerance and open-mindedness are necessary if
countries are to understand each other and bridge differences.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Flavio Cotti here this afternoon, Li recalled
that during his visit to Switzerland in 1996, he held frank
discussions with Cotti on the issues of Tibet and human rights,
and both sides had different views on the matters; however, the
discussion helped the two sides reach agreement on quite a few
points.
</P>
<P>
This demonstrated that it is natural that different countries
hold contradictory views on some issues due to their different
historical background, social systems, values, economic
development and insufficient exchanges, Li said.
</P>
<P>
But by treating each other kindly and sincerely, they can help
to narrow the gap and enhance mutual understanding, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his satisfaction with the smooth advancement
of Sino-Swiss ties since the two countries forged diplomatic
relations half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
China would like to push forward the bilateral ties in
accordance with the principles of mutual respect, equality and
mutual benefit, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cotti is here at the invitation of Chinese People's Institute
of Foreign Affairs.

<HEADLINE> UNIFIL Carries out Task of Verifying Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. peacekeeping troops in south
Lebanon have begun the belated verification of Israel's withdrawal
from south Lebanon and the process will be finished by Friday.
</P>
<P>
Once the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is
able to confirm that Israel has completed a troop withdrawal from
all of Lebanon, the peacekeeping force can proceed with its
expansion plans and begin deploying up to the border, Daily Star
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL spokesman Timur Goksel confirmed two inspection teams,
accompanied by Lebanese and Israeli officers, began verifying the
withdrawal on both sides of the border early Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
They set out from the Lebanese border point at Ras Naqoura on
the Mediterranean Sea coast and from Rosh Hanikra on the Israeli
side, and reached as far as Ramiye, 22.5 kilometers inland by
evening, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The teams will check the line of withdrawal finalized by U.N.
cartographers earlier in the week up to the last UNIFIL position in
Lebanon on the edge of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights near
Shebaa Farms. The Golan-based U.N. Disengagement Observer Force
(UNDOF) takes over peacekeeping duties beyond this point.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said "good progress had been made," but the team
on the Lebanese side of the border fences was being hampered by the
presence of land mines. The inspectors are being accompanied by a
UNIFIL mine clearance unit and an ambulance, LBC television
reported.
</P>
<P>
The length of the withdrawal line between Ras Naqoura and just
north of the Shebaa Farms is approximately 74 kilometers, 28 of
which runs between Lebanon and the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
However, it remained unclear whether a disagreement between the
U.N. and the Israelis over the placing of a border maker just south
of Misgav Am had been resolved before the UNIFIL teams set out from
the coast.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis had not contacted UNIFIL specifically over the
disputed hilltop location, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Al Nahar newspaper reported Friday the border fence
near the northern-most Israeli settlement of Misgav Am has been
pulled back 20 meters to tally with the line drawn by the United
Nations to confirm the authenticity of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL Commander Major General Seth Kofi Obeng will report to U.
N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the outcome of the verification
operation in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Annan will then submit a report to the Security Council,
certifying that Israel withdraws completely to the internationally-
recognized borders in full compliance with U.N. Security Council
Resolution 425 of 1978.
</P>
<P>
Israel withdrew its forces from south Lebanon on May 24, ending
its 22-year occupation of the country.

<HEADLINE> Picasso's Missing Painting Found in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A lost painting by world-famous
painter Pablo Picasso has been put in the State Painting and
Sculpture Museum in Ankara after it was retrieved in a police
operation in Izmir, western Turkey, earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The Fine Arts General Director Mehmet Ozel, who went to Izmir on
Culture Minister Istemihan Talay's order, brought the painting "La
Fermiere" to Ankara Thursday, reported Anatolia News Agency Friday.
</P>
<P>
A gang of six people was trying to sell the oil painting to
undercover police by chance for 6.5 million U.S. dollars before
they were arrested by the police.
</P>
<P>
The Head of the Izmir Police Fiscal Department, Serafettin
Bural, said they had been unable to find a home for the painting
after visiting all the museums in the Aegean port city.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at a press conference that "La Fermiere" was
painted by Picasso, the pioneer of modern painting, in 1908 and
that there is the original signature of Picasso on the back of it.
</P>
<P>
Pablo Picasso (1881-1973), a Spanish painter, moved to settle in
Paris in 1904 and became a pioneer of the French modern painting.
He left behind thousands of works with the "Peace Dove" being one
of his most immortal masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
Ozel noted that in accordance with the registration on the back
of the painting, this art piece was displayed in France and in
Hermitage Museum in Moscow in 1930.
</P>
<P>
"La Fermiere" was reported to be seen for the last time in
Kuwaiti Emir's Palace. It was speculated that the painting was
stolen by an Iraqi officer during the Gulf War in 1991 and was
first taken to Iraq and at last to Turkey via Syria.
</P>
<P>
Ozel disclosed nobody has so far applied to Turkey regarding the
painting.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question whether it is safe to keep the painting in
the State Painting and Sculpture Museum, Ozel said the painting
will be put in a secure safe.
</P>
<P>
However, which country or whom the artifact belongs to has not
been determined yet.
</P>
<P>
"If a country or a person proves that it is the owner of the
painting, we will do what is necessary," said Culture Minister
Istemihan Talay in a message read out by Ozel.
</P>
<P>
However, whoever claiming to be the owner of the painting "
should prove this with documents which are accepted in
international platform."
</P>
<P>
The painting will be preserved under the guarantee of the
Culture Ministry until then, he added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Trades Union Launches Campaign for Minimum Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian Trades Union
Congress (MTUC) Friday launched a nationwide campaign to gather
support for its proposal of a monthly minimum wage of 900 ringgit
(236 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the campaign, members of the union will send postcards to
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Human Resources Minister Fong
Chan Onn, MTUC Secretary General G. Rajasekaran told a press
conference in Petaling Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
"We estimate the minimum wage proposal will benefit at least 2
million workers in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The MTUC special committee on minimum wage has sought to have
the minimum wage at 900 ringgit a month, basing its calculations
on the essential and basic needs of a single person, he said.
</P>
<P>
A study of wage scales of 165 companies showed that even in
some major towns, unskilled workers were being paid as low as
between 300 ringgit (78 dollars) and 350 ringgit (92 dollars) per
month, he said.
</P>
<P>
The MTUC believes that if the minimum wage proposal is
implemented,thousands of women will return to work.
</P>
<P>
He said a minimum wage system must be put in place before
productivity-based annual wage increases can be implemented.
</P>
<P>
The MTUC also called for the establishment of a retrenchment
and unemployment fund, ratification and implementation of
International Labor Organization Convention 87 on Freedom of
Association and the Right to Organize, better maternity protection
and raising of the retirement age to 60.
</P>
<P>
He said these calls are contained in the postcards to be sent to
Mahathir and Fong.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM's Plane Makes Emergency Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF)
VIP plane carrying Prime Minister John Howard and opposition
leader Kim Beazley was forced to make an emergency landing in
Brisbane Friday night after a warning light showed an engine was
on fire.
</P>
<P>
The aging aircraft was returning to Australia from Japan where
the Australian prime minister had attended the funeral of the late
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
But about two hours out of Brisbane, capital of Australia's
Queensland state, an emergency light indicated a fire in one of
the plane four engines.
</P>
<P>
The captain asked Brisbane airport to have emergency crews on
standby for the landing.
</P>
<P>
"There were indications of a fire in the number one engine," an
RAAF spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Purely as a precautionary measure, the engine was shut down
and the fire extinguisher discharged," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the captain believed the warning was "
spurious" but they treated it seriously for safety measures.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the same plane was delayed about an hour in Tokyo
because strong winds made it dangerous to take off.
</P>
<P>
The government is considering leasing a new fleet of VIP
aircraft to replace the aging old one but the cabinet is yet to
make a firm decision.
</P>
<P>
Despite Friday night's incident, the plane landed safely and
the prime minister proceeded to Sydney on another aircraft.

JAKARTA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Attorney General's
Office(AGO) has extended former President Soeharto's house arrest
for another one month as of June 12.
</P>
<P>
The letter of extension was sent by Director of Corruption
Affairs of the AGO Ris Pandapotan Sihombing to Soeharto's
residence here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
AGO Spokesman Yushar Yahya told reporters that the decision was

leaving the country since early April and he has undergone
questioning several times at his residence for corruption charges.
He was put under house arrest on May 29.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto is suspected of abusing power and authority by issuing
decrees and government regulations to amass funds through seven
tax-free charity foundations he set up and chaired during his 32
years in power.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
appointed a cabinet sub-committee to organize the funeral of the
slain Minister of Industrial Development C. V. Gunaratne,
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary to the president K. Balapatabendi said the government
will accord a state funeral to Gunaratne on Saturday at the People
's Park in the suburbs of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The minister was assassinated in a suicide bombing Wednesday
when he was leading a procession on the War Heroes Day to collect
donations for the army in his constituency in the southern suburb
of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The bombing was blamed on the separatist rebels of the
Liberation Tiger of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who have plotted a string
of similar attacks in the capital since December as a part of
their 17-year campaign to carve out a homeland for minority Tamils
in Sri Lanka's north and east.
</P>
<P>
Balapatabendi said President Chandrika Kumaratunga was deeply
grieved by the death of one of her loyal and senior cabinet
ministers and had asked all other ministers to take necessary
precautions.

<P>
CANBERRA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Warring groups in the Solomon
Islands Friday night agreed on a two-day cease-fire to allow a
weekend visit by the Australian foreign minister and his
Commonwealth delegation, the Australian Associated Press (AAP)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The AAP said the two groups in the Solomons fighting over
ethnic land rights on the country's main island of Guadalcanal
Friday failed to negotiate a 14-day truce.
</P>
<P>
But they agreed on the shorter cease-fire to allow Australian
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and his delegation to visit.
</P>
<P>
Downer and his New Zealand counterpart, Phil Goff, are prepared
to fly into Honiara, capital of the Solomon Islands, Friday night
as the situation in the capital remained calm.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand High Commissioner in Honiara Nick Hurley was quoted
by the AAP as saying the Commonwealth delegation is expected to
land by military plane at Honiara's Henderson Field international
airport Saturday morning (local time).
</P>
<P>
The delegation is aiming to bring a conciliatory end to the
country's week-long attempted coup after the Malaita Eagle Force (
MEF) captured Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu at gunpoint on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The MEF have signed a truce to the effect that there won't be
any (military) activity during the visit," Hurley said.
</P>
<P>
"On paper, at least, the truce is good while the ministers are
here," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the opposing rebel group, the Isatabu Freedom Movement
(IFM), had declared their own cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Downer's delegation is expected to stay in Honiara for only one
day.
</P>
<P>
There was no fresh fighting reported on Friday between the MEF
and the IFM after up to 100 people were reportedly killed in
raging gun battles earlier this week.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Multinationals Marching Into Western China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 60 out of the world's
top 500 industrial enterprises have invested in western China.
</P>
<P>
In the first several months, foreign investment in Sichuan
Province, southwest China, was three times more than the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Since June last year, China has encouraged foreign businesses
to invest in its western region since the central government
initiated a campaign to develop the region.
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Company Vice Chairman Wayne Booker said that "We
need a balanced development. The western region with one-fourth of
China's total population is the first choice of my company to
develop business potential since there are flood of markets in
eastern China."
</P>
<P>
Booker, who is attending an international symposium on the
development of western China, said his company is considering
investing more in western China.
</P>
<P>
Compared to foreign investment in eastern China, some western
regions are still struggling to attract overseas money. However,
the situation is expected to turn around for the better this year
since some foreign companies are starting to make profits.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. BP Amoco company has invested in an acetic acid
project in Chongqing and made 3 million U.S. dollars in profits in
its first year of operation. The company plans to invest more
funds in the project.
</P>
<P>
The Glaxo Holdings Ltd. from Britain has also made big profits
after increasing investment.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign businessmen have attributed the success to the
rich resources and cheap labor in the western region.

Another factor that encourages foreign investors is that the
Chinese Government plans to invest heavily to improve
infrastructure facilities. China plans to build 20 airports in the
region this year.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Klein, who was awarded a Nobel Economics Prize in 1980,
said at the symposium that multinationals coming to western China
is part of companies exploring new markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
Most multinational companies first put their capital into high-
tech industries zones in some key cities in western China.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Korea (ROK) has become the second largest trade
partner of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. ROK's businessmen
have not only invested in local railway construction, but also in
the development of organic agriculture.
</P>
<P>

<P>
JAKARTA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economy is expected to
grow by 5 to 6 percent in the medium term or in 2004 and 2005, a
senior economic minister said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The (Indonesian) government targets the economic growth at 3

term or in 2004 and 2005," Coordinating Minister for Economy,
Finance, and Industry Kwik Kian Gie said.

"The government also has hammered out a plan to keep the
inflation rate at the level of 5 percent (this year)," Kwik said.
</P>

He is optimistic that the government will be able to meet the
targets.
</P>
<P>
"Data from the Central Bureau of Statistic (BPS) showed that
exports during January-March this year increased by 38.7 percent
against the same period last year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kwik also said the current economic growth is on a solid basis.
</P>

billion U.S. dollars or about 83 percent of the country's gross

<P>
The specially designed 50-seat buses are equipped with an
environment-friendly engine to minimize air pollution. The lower
deck provides elegant and comfortable seats with a teakwood
interior and a toilet while the upper one offers an open-air view.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Rebels Target Wrong Minister in Suicide Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels may
have had another senior minister instead of Minister of Industrial
Development C. V. Gunaratne as their target in a suicide bombing
Wednesday, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The rebel target would have been Minister of Justice and
Constitutional Affairs G. L. Peiris," said Raja Alwis, a member of
the Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia Municipal Council in the southern
suburb of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Gunaratne was killed Wednesday in the bombing when he was
leading a procession to collect donations for the army at
Ratmalana in Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia, the minister's constituency.
</P>
<P>
Minister Peiris, who is considered as a prime target for the
rebels, represents a constituency adjoining Gunaratne's.
</P>
<P>
Peiris was due to join the procession but he failed to show up,
Alwis said, adding that Gunaratne who was to turn back instead
walked up to the point where the suicide bomber carried out the
attack.
</P>
<P>
The bombing was blamed on the separatist rebels of the
Liberation Tiger of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who have plotted a string
of similar attacks in the capital since December as a part of
their 17-year campaign to carve out a homeland for minority Tamils
in Sri Lanka's north and east.
</P>
<P>
The toll in the bombing had risen to 25 by Thursday evening
with Gunaratne's wife, Shyama, and two others, who were among 60
people injured in the blast, succumbing to their injuries,police
said.
</P>
<P>
Minister Gunaratne's body was brought to the local municipal
council on Friday for people to pay their last respects.
</P>
<P>
People from all walks of life paid their last respects to the
slain minister, who will be accorded a state funeral Saturday
evening.

<HEADLINE> Nine Tanzanian Regions Face Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Some nine out of the total 25
regions in Tanzania are facing acute food shortage following
shortage of rains during the 1999/2000 farming season.
</P>
<P>
The official Daily News Friday quoted the Director of the
Strategic Grain Reserve (SGR) Department in the Tanzanian Ministry
of Agriculture and Cooperatives Albert Lazaro Ngondo as saying
that about 5.7 billion Tanzanian shillings (about 7.13 million
U.S. dollars) will be needed to replenish the food stock.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye on the food
situation after he visited several SGR silos in Dar es Salaam on
Thursday, the director mentioned the affected as the eastern
regions of Arusha, Kilimanjaro, Tanga, Morogoro, central regions
of Dodoma, Singida and western regions of Shinyanga, Mwanza and
Tabora.
</P>
<P>
He told the premier his department is sending food to the
affected areas and by the end of this month, the SGR food stock
will decline from the present 82,199 tons to 70,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, about 65,000 tons of maize will
have to be secured from areas which received sufficient amount of
rains to enable SGR boost its stock to 135,000 tons by next
September.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye directed the department to use funds collected from sale
of food to the affected regions to replenish the stock.
</P>
<P>
The premier also challenged Tanzanians to cultivate the culture
of preserving food after harvest and make proper use of the little
that is available.
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, Tanzania received an assistance of just
60,000 tons of food from donors despite its appeal for 900,000
tons of grain.
</P>
<P>
Of the 88.6 million hectares of arable land in the country,
only about half is currently being exploited, leaving millions of
Tanzanians in a constant state of hunger.
</P>
<P>
Rain-fed and hand-hoe agriculture has never improve over the
last half century and the country remains vulnerable to hunger and
starvation.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Printed Currency Hits Somali Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Somali businessmen are struggling
hard to take the profit of the last chance of printing Somali
notes before it is too late as the possibility for the
establishment of a government and a lasting peace for Somalia
increases with the ongoing conference for the Somalis in Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, some Somali businessmen are printing new
Somali bank notes in Jawa of Indonesia as their last chance to do
so.
</P>
<P>
It is said that more than US $ 4 million worth of Somali bank
notes is being printed under fake license and authority from
non-existing Somali government.
</P>
<P>
Reports over the fake money printing scandal had earlier been
published by the Thae Daily Kompas with Yohanes Mulyano, the
manager of the Pt. Pura Baru Kudus company, being in the center of
the disrepute.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the Somali businessmen in
Jakarta, they are looking for US $ 220,000 pending to be paid
before they can withdraw the last shipment from Pt. Pura Baru
Kudus factory.
</P>
<P>
The sources said it has been part of the agreement between the
Somali businessmen and the factory administration that the Somalis
should pay half way the agreed money for the printing before the
first shipment and the other half just before the last shipment.
The factory is printing a total amount of Somali bank notes worth
of US $ 10 million to be delivered on three shipments.
</P>
<P>
The first two shipments of this Indonesian printed fake money
had reached the Northeastern regions known as Puntland sky
rocketing all prices of commodities and even the basic and locally
produced food items.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rose high horribly decreasing the value of Somali
Shilling. Before these two consignments and others from Mogadishu
reach Bossaso (the largest town in the northeastern regions) the
value of each U.S. dollar was 7500 Shillings, but it has been
10,000 Shillings against one dollar lately.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half million dollar worth of this fake money had reached
Baidoa town hitting its markets and even propagating to the
capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the fake shillings are all in 1000 notes
wearing the red color more than the real ones and even far darker
than the earlier printed notes by Hussein Aidid and his ally
businessmen in Canada in 1996 and 1997.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Strike Organizers Reject Government Concession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian government have agreed to
reduce the petrol price to 25 naira (0. 25 U. S dollar) from it
formerly designated 30 naira (0. 30 dollar), but the offer was
rejected by the Nigeria National Labor Congress (NLC), organizer
of the ongoing national strike.
</P>
<P>
This was a major concession the government made to the "labor
and people of Nigeria", said Doyin Okupe, special Assistant to
the President on Media and Publicity Thursday in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
He, however, added that the resulted five naira (0.05 dollar)
rise in petrol price will not be enough to maintain adequate
supplies but it would be used to sustain part of the importation
costs pending the return of full production of Nigeria' s
domestic refineries.
</P>
<P>
He said the government still believed that it was imperative to
fully deregulate the sector within the next 12 months, adding
that a committee would be raised to involve organized labors,
employers, and other relevant consumer groups in formulating
cushioning effects of future fuel price hikes.
</P>
<P>
Most of the big cities across Nigeria came to a standstill when
the nation wide "sit at home" strike began on Thursday morning.
In some state capitals, the strike was dotted with violence,
reportedly leading to the death and arrest of people.
</P>
<P>
A motorist was killed in Lagos, Nigeria' s economic hub and
protesters torched the state House of Kano in the north of the
country.
</P>
<P>
In order to stop the strike, representatives of Nigerian
President Olusegun Obasanjo Thursday invited NLC President Adams
Oshiomhole to an emergency meeting in the capital. But Oshiomhole
said after the meeting that his organization would not go back on
the strike if the Federal Government refused to rescind the hike
and recover the old petrol price.
</P>
<P>
NLC called for the general strike shortly after the Nigerian
government increased the country's petrol price by 50 percent to
30 naira (100 naira equals about one U.S. dollar) per liter on
last Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Farmers to Arrive in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- About 150 Zimbabwean and South
African commercial farmers are due to arrive this month in the
central Mozambican province of Manica, the provincial governor
Felicio Zacarias told Mozambique News Agency (AIM).
</P>
<P>
The farmers will be encouraged to undertake agricultural and
livestock activities over an area of 440,000 hectares, mainly in
the sparsely populated districts of Barue and Macossa.
</P>
<P>
The governor said investments from Zimbabwean farmers in
Mozambique " have nothing to do with the current explosive
situation in Zimbabwe".
</P>
<P>
"This move is to do with the need for the socio-economic
development of the region", he added.
</P>
<P>
The farmers will settle in Manica in phases over the next five
years, and they will enjoy the fiscal incentives that the
Mozambican government has established for projects in the Zambezi
valley.
</P>
<P>
The farmers are being offered land between the Pungoe and
NHazonia rivers "where there is no land conflict with peasants",
and which offers favorable conditions for agriculture. Under
Mozambique's land law they will have tenure rights for a period of
50 years.
</P>
<P>
He said each farmer will be granted about 4,000 hectares and
the investment from the first 60 farmers would amount to around 30
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean and South African farmers will concentrate on
growing soya, maize, tobacco and sunflower.
</P>
<P>
Related industries of vegetable oils will be established which
will imply the import of modern machinery into Manica.

<HEADLINE> WWF Calls for Better Protection of World's Marine Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)
has called on governments and local communities around the world
to find new ways of protecting the world's vital marine resources.
</P>
<P>
The recent estimates suggest that up to 80 percent of the
world's protected marine areas are not being managed effectively,
the world conservation organization said in its press release
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Though properly managed protected marine areas can provide a
range of benefits for fishers, conservation and local economies,
increased resources are urgently needed to make this happen.
</P>
<P>
"Today less than one percent of the world's seas is within
marine protected areas," said Scott Burns, director of the WWF's
Endangered Seas Campaign. "A large proportion of these are
protected in name only because they are poorly managed."
</P>
<P>
There is growing evidence that within two to five years, fully
protected marine reserves - also called "no-fishing zones" - can
turn the tide on overfishing and provide real ecological and
economic benefits to local communities.
</P>
<P>
In fully protected marine reserves, the fish live longer and
grow larger. Increased production of offspring within reserves
also helps to restock nearby fishing grounds, allowing fishers to
benefit. However, these benefits can only appear if governments
and local communities work together to come up with new ways of
ensuring well-managed reserves that can protect marine resources.
</P>
<P>
Fishers are increasingly advocating full protection of reserves
as a way of ensuring healthy fish stocks and their future
livelihood. In the Florida Keys, commercial fishers recently
worked with recreational fishers, divers and conservationists to
jointly design a new marine reserve that promotes sustainable
fishery management.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Unemployment Rate Falls to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in Switzerland
has fallen below two percent for the first time in more than eight
years, Swiss Radio International reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Latest figures released by the Swiss Federal Department of
Economic Affairs show 69,788 people were registered as jobless in
May, down from 75,642 in April.
</P>
<P>
Pascal Couchepin, head of the department, said the figures
represented an important moment for the Swiss economy. The
exceptional figures were partly due to current good economic
conditions, and they were also attributed to the flexibility of
the labor market, stable labor relations and the quality of
training, he added.
</P>
<P>
As to regional figures, the department said on Friday that
unemployment had fallen mostly in the Italian-speaking canton of
Ticino. The jobless rate there fell to 2.7 percent. However,
Geneva still has the highest unemployment rate at 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of job vacancies in Switzerland has risen to 15,724.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Launches New Loan Scheme for SMEs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Friday introduced an
enterprise program specially designed to resolve the non-
performing loan (NPL) problems of small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs)expeditiously.
</P>
<P>
The program, which would take immediate effect, is part of the
government's initiative to support the development of SMEs, Bank
Negara Malaysia (BNM) said in a statement issued here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, new loans worth about 715 million ringgit (
188.157 million U.S. dollars) would be made available by banking
institutions, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the program, it said, SMEs must have been
affected by the financial crisis and their non-performing loans
must be between 500,000 ringgit (131,578 dollars) and 5 million
ringgit (1.315 million dollars) in one banking institution or the
banking system in aggregate.
</P>
<P>
The loans of the affected SMEs should have been classified as
non-performing between January 1, 1998, and April 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at assisting borrowers who have credit
facilities with a number of banking institutions, using simple and
standard loan restructuring guidelines to accelerate the debt
restructuring process of SMEs, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The program also complements the various mechanisms that have
already been put in place so far to assist SMEs affected by the
financial crisis, including the establishment of a rehabilitation
fund for small and medium industries (SMIs), loan rehabilitation
units at individual banking institutions and the loans complaint
and monitoring unit at BNM.
</P>
<P>
The move would facilitate consensus on restructuring loans in a
cohesive manner and would provide a mechanism to encourage banking
institutions to give additional financing to these SMEs to enhance
the stability of their business in the long run, it said.
</P>
<P>
BNM stressed that all new financing can only be used for
business-related purposes while inter-company transactions would
not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate and expedite the debt restructuring process, BNM
and the banking industry have formulated a set of standard and
simple loan restructuring guidelines which specify the maximum
standstill period, the moratorium on interest payments and the
maximum tenure of the old and new financing.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the program would have to attend compulsory
training to better manage their businesses which will encompass
lessons on cash flow management, computerized accounting, trade
finance and financing tools throughout this year, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Greek Terrorist Group Claims Responsibility for Killing British Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A Greek terrorist group, the "
November 17", Friday claimed responsibility for killing British
defense attache, Brigadier Stephen Saunders.
</P>
<P>
In a 13-page letter sent to the Athens daily Eleftherotypia,
the group said that Saunders, 50, was targeted because he played a
key role in NATO's bombing campaign against Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to execute him because through his post he
participated in the planning of the barbaric act raids against
Yugoslavia and, therefore, is among those responsible for last
year's nazi-style crime and the murder of thousands of civilians,"
the letter, carried by the daily, said.
</P>
<P>
The letter added that the British government's role was "more
provocative than that of the United States during the NATO raids
against Yugoslavia".
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the group admitted that the assassination was
being planned since March.
</P>
<P>
Saunders, who had been in Athens since last May, was shot dead
by two gunmen on a motorcycle Thursday as he was driving alone
from his northern suburban home in Nea Erithrea to the British
embassy in downtown Athens.
</P>
<P>
In the past 25 years, the "November 17" group has killed more
than 20 people, including CIA's station-master in Greece Richard
Welsh in 1975, but none of its members have been arrested so far.

to the developer Baidu.com company.
</P>
<P>
"The concept of search engines was already introduced to China

com. Li obtained a Masters degree in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Xu Yong, another founder of Baidu, pointed out that the
current Chinese search engines are not able to meet the demands of
Internet users due to the complexities of the Chinese language and
lack of advanced technical know-how.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, Baidu's new-generation search engine has been

<HEADLINE> Asia Development Forum Expresses Optimism, Caution About Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The 2nd Asia Development Forum
ended its discussions Thursday after its participants expressed
both optimism and caution about the socioeconomic development in
East Asia, which has witnessed serious disparities as a result of
globalization in the distribution of wealth and opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the forum's discussions at a press conference
Thursday, Director of Singapore's Institute of Southeast Asian
Studies Chia Siow Yue said, "There are both optimism and caution"
over the sustainable growth in East Asia in the coming years
although it has taken a strong growth road.
</P>
<P>
Optimism emerged on the back of lessons the region has learned
both from its spectacular growth before the crisis and from its
bitter experiences in the financial crisis that swept the region
in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
One general consensus is that East Asia had achieved
substantive and high-rate growth and now the region is on a strong
recovery path although there is some concern that this fast
recovery may not be sustainable and a lot of things are yet to be
done.
</P>
<P>
The participants were convinced that economic and institutional
reforms have to continue, particularly reforms for good corporate
and state governance, reforms in the banking industry and the
financial sector and corporate reforms.
</P>
<P>
The forum gave the strong message that Asian countries should
continually push forward the reforms which are necessary and
essential for sustainable recovery.
</P>
<P>
Attention was also drawn to the fact that the reforms, which
will involve changing institutions, values and social practices,
will take a very long time, even generations.
</P>
<P>
Another agreement is that the fundamentals and basic strategies
that accounted for East Asian success should remain valid and
should not be set aside in a new environment.
</P>
<P>
At the forum, many policy makers and many in the intellectual
community became more cautious as they noted that some fundamental
problems still remain in Asian economies and more state and
corporate restructuring is needed.
</P>
<P>
There is also a general consensus that Asia in the past gave
emphasis and priority to growth and its refined development
strategy must now pay more attention to and focus on issues of
poverty and social inequality to make sure that those in poverty
will not be marginalized and the development process will meet the
expectations of the government and people.
</P>
<P>
In addition to sustainable growth, what the majority of the
participants were most concerned about was a social balance
between growth and equality, the key issue the region is
confronting in meeting challenges from globalization.
</P>
<P>
Participants stressed that the social balance issue is becoming
more and more important as both the gap between countries and the
domestic inter-persons disparity are widening.
</P>
<P>
They called for more efforts by Asian governments to help those
economies that are left behind and are less equipped to build up
their capacities catch up with well-equipped economies.
</P>
<P>
In view of globalization, the information technology revolution
and the competition the region has to face, the participants also
agreed to put more emphasis on human resources development,
education and training which they say will help economies rapidly
become knowledge-based.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Autonomous Region Chief Denies Independence Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Governor Nur Misuari of the
Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) said Friday that he
has no intention of reviving the bid of the Moro National
Liberation Front (MILF) for independence.
</P>
<P>
Misuari said in a radio speech that President Joseph Estrada
continues to give his "generous support" to the development of the
autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
"Until now, the great majority of the leadership (of the MILF)
still would like to give government a chance to prove its
sincerity especially with President Estrada giving his generous
support for the bridge construction," Misuari said.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada has reportedly ordered concerned government
agencies to speed up the construction of these bridges, which will
link the four provinces of the autonomous region -- South Lanao,
Tawi-Tawi, Sulu and Maguindanao -- and spur development there.
</P>
<P>
On its part, the presidential palace expressed satisfaction
over Misuari's assurance that he is not seeking to revive his bid
for independence, but reminded him that he should account for the
funds received by his region from the national government.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said Misuari, just like any
other government official, must make an accounting of public funds
under his supervision.
</P>
<P>
"What should be done by the Senate is to ask for the accounting
not only of the funds under Misuari but also of the funds under
other ARMM officials," Zamora said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Team to Assess Economic Recovery in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- An economic team of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) is expected to arrive in
Indonesia on June 12 to assess the progress of the economic
recovery program in the country, a senior official said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF (team) will arrive here on June 12, instead of June 30,
to assess the progress which has been made by the government in
its economic recovery program," Coordinating Minister for Economy,
Finance and Industry Kwik Kian Gie told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing special with the forthcoming arrival of the team. It
just will discuss what next to be done by the government (to boost
the on-going economic program," Kwik added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kwik also said the government has done its best to
make the economic recovery program successful.
</P>
<P>
He noted that during the economic crisis, the country's GDP
grew by minus 13 percent, with an inflation rate of 80 percent and
an interest rate of 60 to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
"But now, the interest rate stands at around 11 percent and we
sometimes undergo inflation and also deflation while our GDP has
been growing," Kwik said.
</P>
<P>
"So I don't really understand if you say that the real sector
has not yet begun to recover," Kwik added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, IMF Managing Director Horst Koehler said he was
optimistic over the country's economic growth and pointed out that
that this year Indonesia's economy would grow by 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Koehler also said Indonesia's economic growth has been coming
back and this is a good and encouraging starting point.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government reassured
the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) Friday that it
would continue to pursue efforts to bring genuine and lasting
peace to Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio interview
that this should allay concerns raised by the claims of the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) that the government is gearing up
for an all-out war in the south.
</P>
<P>
The government troops and the MILF are clashing in the Mindanao
area. Earlier, the government vowed to diminish the Moro rebel
group's military strength.
</P>
<P>
"We never said we are pursuing an all-out war. We merely
respond to acts of harassment by the MILF. We want all-out peace
in Mindanao and that is very important to us," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Philippines would send a delegation to Kuala
Lumpur, capital of Malaysia, later this month to present the
government's side on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The member states of the OIC, an influential forum of more than
50 Islamic states worldwide, reportedly will meet in Malaysia
later this month.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Faces Worst Crisis: Kenyan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is facing the worst ever
crisis, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has said.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks Thursday when addressing
thousands of Kenyans who attended a passing out parade for 1,399
police recruits at the Administration Police Training College
here, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Moi said besides famine, the country is having to deal with
power rationing, water shortage, crime, high employment, falling
export earnings and a slump in tourism.
</P>
<P>
He said his government would form a national committee to
coordinate and monitor the distribution of famine relief food,
which is headed by Uhuru Kenyatta, son of Kenya's first president
the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta.
</P>
<P>
Moi said he was hopeful the problems would be abated if the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank agree to resume aid to
Kenya at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the president further appealed for local and
international aid to help three million Kenyans who are
absolutely destitute and require emergency food relief and life
saving support, due to the prolonged drought befallen the
country.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar to Seek Foreign Assistance Directly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The semi-autonomous Zanzibar
is allowed to directly seek external aid and loans without going
through the Tanzanian central government, the African newspaper
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Submitting the government's budget proposals for the 2000/2001
fiscal year starting in July to the House of Representatives of
the self-governing region including Zanzibar and Pemba Isles, the
Zanzibari Minister for Finance Amina Salum Ali said the Union
government had accepted that Zanzibar should be free to look for
foreign assistance.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, agreement was recently reached
between the Zanzibar and the Union governments, enabling Zanzibar
to have direct contact with foreign countries or agencies when it
comes to seeking aid.
</P>
<P>
The decision will make it easier for Zanzibar to realize about
1.5 billion Tanzanian shillings (about 1.88 million U.S. dollars)
in aid for the next financial year, which it direly need for
stalled development projects, said Amina.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Zanzibar government has appealed to donors to
reconsider their decision of suspending aid to the Indian Ocean
islands for human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
It called on donors to support Zanzibar's development rather
than sponsoring political seminars that further worsen the
situation in the Isles.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United
Republic of Tanzania in 1964. But it has its own government and
parliament.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Between Uganda, Rwanda Continues in Kisangani, Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Fighting between Ugandan and
Rwandan troops is going on Friday in Kisangani, the third largest
city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"The Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) is shelling the positions of
the Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF) in Kisangani today, and
the UPDF repulses them," Phinehas Katirima, Ugandan Army
Spokesman, told Xinhua in a telephone interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The RPA said they would observe the cease-fire, but they
haven't," he added.
</P>
<P>
The UPDF and the RPA reached a cease-fire on the mid-night on
June 6. But the cease-fire was not observed so far.
</P>
<P>
The 24-hour unilateral cease-fire by the UPDF, which was
declared on Thursday, will not come into effect until the U.N.
Military Observer team establishes presence on the UPDF's side,
Katirima said.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops started to shell each other in
Kisangani after a UPDF's vehicle was attacked and destroyed Monday
morning. The fighting is the latest following clashes between the
two armies in early May.
</P>
<P>
The two former allies have their troops stationed in Kisangani,
a northeast city of the DRC, where they have backed rival rebel
factions fighting against the DRC President Laurent Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Condemns Latest Fighting in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has strongly condemned clashes between Rwanda and Uganda in the
northeastern Congolese city of Kisangani, Times of Zambia
newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who brokered the Lusaka Peace Accord to end the
conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) last July,
told reporters Thursday that the fighting threatened the planned
deployment of 5,500 U.N. peacekeepers in Africa's third largest
country.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very sad turn of events. The whole thing defies
logic and is a big shame to Africa," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"This fighting is a direct threat to the peace process, a
direct threat to peacekeeping plans and a direct threat to
regional stability," Chiluba added.
</P>
<P>
He called on both countries to end the fighting. "I will be
visiting both countries to see what can be done to end this
fighting. We need to find a permanent solution to the Kisangani
crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he had already spoken by telephone with Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni and Rwanda President Paul Kagame over
the latest clash started on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the comments after the head of a U.N. observers'
team trying to broker a ceasefire in Kisangani condemned Rwandan
and Ugandan commanders for destroying the Congolese city and
killing innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
Intense shelling and machine gun fire echoed across the city as
Rwandan and Ugandan troops fought for a forth day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the political committee on Congo held a crucial
meeting in Lusaka on Thursday to discuss the pull-out of foreign
troops from the war- torn central African nation.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door meeting followed the 7th plenary session of the
Joint Military Commission (JMC) held earlier here. Sources said
the political committee would discuss modalities for disengagement
of troops and creation of a buffer zone in readiness for the U.N.
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
The planned deployment of U.N. peacekeeping forces and
observers in the DRC has been hampered by ceasefire violations in
some parts of the vast country.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The benchmark Nikkei index in Tokyo
closed below 17,000 Friday for the first time in a week, as the
weaker-than-expected gross domestic product (GDP) data dampened
market hopes for a robust recovery.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 142.43 points, or 0.84
percent from Thursday's 16,861.91 points, listing the fourth
straight day of decline in this week.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) which covers
all First Section issues, however, rose 0.64 point or 0.04 percent
to 1,586.81.
</P>
<P>
Before the market opened, Japan's Economic Planning Agency (EPA)
said the country's economy expanded 2.4 percent in the January-
March quarter from the previous three-month period.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Japan's GDP grew a real 0.5 percent in fiscal 1999,
undershooting the government's 0.6 percent growth target.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors had been expected to buy more stocks if
stronger GDP data were released, but such expectations have
receded at present, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section increased to 1,104.46 million
shares from Thursday's 712.85 million shares due to special
quotation fixing for settling June index futures and options.
</P>
<P>
Warehousing firms, construction firms and information and
telecommunication issues drew buying, while losers included
brokerage houses, retailers and pharmaceutical firms.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers outnumbered
losers with 697 to 541, while 165 issues closed unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Firms Develop Handheld Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese companies are developing
handheld computers to meet the growing market demand, industry
sources say.
</P>
<P>
Liang Shuang, a sales manager with the Hisense Group, said that
her company is working with the Chinese Academy of Sciences to
develop color handheld computers.
</P>
<P>
The company will work to improve battery functions and network
technology for these computers.
</P>
<P>
The new products are expected to be put on the market by the
end of this year, she said, adding that the company has already
been able to manufacture black-and-white handheld computers.
</P>
<P>
Hisense Group, based in Qingdao in east China's Shandong
Province, is the eighth biggest electronic enterprise in the
country, mainly producing TV sets, computers, air conditioners,
telephone sets and cameras.
</P>
<P>
The Founder Group Corp., China's computer giant, is working to
further improve the functions of its handheld computers, so that
users can have an easy access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Despite technical problems, all the developers expressed their
beliefs that the handheld computers have a considerable market
potential, because it is easy to take and convenient to use.
</P>
<P>
Other developers of handheld computers include the Langchao
Group based in Jinan of Shandong, Huajian Group affiliated with
the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Legend Group, and Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
Major Chinese computer companies displayed their handheld
computers at a recent national exhibition on technological
innovation achievements in Suzhou in the eastern Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The companies said that handheld computers are priced at more
than 5,000 yuan (about 600 U.S. dollars), which is deemed too high
for common customers.
</P>
<P>
"If the price is less than 3,000 yuan (about 360 U.S. dollars),
I think the sales will be brisk," said Liu Yonggui, a marketing
manager with Huajian.
</P>
<P>
Foreign handheld computers, such as IBM and Philips, have also
entered China's market.

BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Moldova President Petru
Lucinschi said he is very satisfied with the results of his
current visit to China, and believed that Moldova-China relations
will further develop in various fields.
</P>
<P>

that the relations between China and Moldova could be a good
example of how two countries, regardless of their size, can work
together on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Both countries respect each other's national conditions and do
not interfere into each other's internal affairs. At the same time,
they cooperate in maintaining world peace and participating in
economic globalization, he added, stressing that Moldova hopes to
further consolidate and develop such ties.
</P>
<P>
During the past two days, Lucinschi held talks with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and met with other Chinese leaders during

concern.

In Pikit, heavy fighting is going on in the villages of
Daungawin and Nalapaan where some 500 rebels are presently holed
up.

<P>
Leading commercial bank in the capital Nairobi Thursday quoted
the shilling at 77.85/78.05 to the dollar from 77.75/77.95 at
Wednesday's close. The previous lowest of the shilling against
the dollar was 77.80 last September.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the shilling fell after investor rushed to close
forward positions in reaction to an appeal from Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi on Wednesday for some 150 million U.S. dollars in
food aid to fight drought.
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the government may have to borrow the money,"
said Stephen Okoko, a dealer with Standard Chartered Bank.
</P>
<P>
The shilling has been under pressure this week after the
government announced a tighter power rationing that gives
industry electricity for just eight hours a day.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here predicted the shilling could weaken in the next
few sessions, although not at such an alarming rate, as power
rationing continued to weigh on the market.

<HEADLINE> IMF Likely to Resume Aid to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) may resume aid to Kenya by the end of this month, the East
African Standard reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi as saying
that senior management and executive boards of both the IMF and
the World Bank had agreed to meet at the end of this month in
stead of July as earlier indicated.
</P>
<P>
Moi, who renewed an appeal for international food aid to help
feed millions of starving Kenyans in rural areas on Wednesday,
said members of international community were sympathetic to
Kenya's economic difficulties following the prolonged drought.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks when he presided over a passing
out parade for 1,399 police recruits in the capital Nairobi
Thursday, but he did not give any details regarding the latest
development on the proposed resumption of aid to Kenya by the two
international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and the World Bank that have been negotiating with the
Kenyan government over resumption of aid for the past three years
gave a nod last month following the latest round of talks in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
However, the agreement reached during last month's talks would
still be subject to ratification by the IMF board in July.
</P>
<P>
According to Kenyan Finance Minister Chris Okemo, Kenya
expected the IMF management board to consider a facility of about
210 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended a loan of 205 million dollars to Kenya in
July 1997 for poor governance and rampant corruption.

-- Chinese archeologists believe Persian-style silver basins,
ivory, glass bowls and crystal-bead strings unearthed from a leud
tomb dating back to the Warring States Period (475 BC-221 BC) in
south China's Guangzhou City, suggested China's marine trade with
the Middle and West Asia began much earlier than that through the
ancient "Land Silk Road".
</P>
<P>
The "imported commodities" came to China in the third century
Before Christ. However, the ancient "Silk Road" that starts from
Xi'an City in western China was explored some 200 years later in
119 BC, said Chinese historians.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Veterans to Stay on White-Owned Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Thursday launched his countrywide election campaign tour with a
stern message that the government will not drive out war veterans
from the white-owned farms they occupied until the land issue was
resolved.
</P>
<P>
"We will not drive them out of the farms until the land issue
is resolved and resolved amicably," Mugabe told 12,000 supporters
at a campaign rally in Gutu of southern Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He praised the war veterans for their stance on the land issue,
saying, " they were the vanguard of this phase of the land
revolution."
</P>
<P>
The war veterans have occupied more than 1,000 white-owned
farms since February this year.
</P>
<P>
There had been speculation that the former freedom fighters
would be removed from the farms following the amendment of the
Land Acquisition Act, which now allows the government to acquire
white-owned commercial farms without paying any compensation.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the death of white commercial farmers in
skirmishes with the war veterans, Mugabe said the liberation
fighters were provoked by those whites who resisted, at times, by
using gunfire.
</P>
<P>
He added the British government is making futile attempts to
block the smooth flow of fuel into Zimbabwe in an act of sabotage
meant to discredit his ruling party and bring the government to
its knees.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe will hold the fifth parliamentary elections on June 24
and 25.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Nordic countries will take
positive actions to urge the international community to help
African nations with their social and economic development, said
Danish Prime Minster Poul Rasmussen Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The international community must take concrete measures to
support the social and economic development of the developing
countries, said Rasmussen at a news conference after the one-day
summit meeting Thursday between Nordic countries and South Africa
in Skagen, northern Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The measures included providing financial aids through long-
term loans and direct investment to developing countries, giving
them access to markets and technology, and reducing their heavy
debts, Rasmussen said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Nordic countries also expressed their
support for the call by South African President Thabo Mbeki to
reconstruct Africa. Mbeki, who is in Denmark for a two-day visit
starting Wednesday, left here for home Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Internet Commonly Used for College Selection in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A national survey released
Thursday reveals that the Internet is now one of the most
pervasive and powerful elements in college selection and
application process among college-bound American high school
students.
</P>
<P>
Results from the survey conducted by the Art &AMP; Science Group,
one of America's market research and consulting firms specializing
in higher education, indicate that the Internet is now both a
widely-favored medium by students for filing an application and a
key source of information as application decisions are made.
</P>
<P>
"The emergence of the Internet, Web sites, online applications
and other new forms of communications technology in college
admission marks one of the most profound changes in the college
selection process in history," the research firm said.
</P>
<P>
Forty-three percent of the 500 students interviewed said that
if they had a choice, they would prefer to file their college
applications via the Internet, while 44 percent indicated that
they preferred the traditional pencil and paper and "snail mail"
method. In actual usage of online application, 35 percent of
respondents reported they used an online application for at least
one of their applications.
</P>
<P>
Respondents ranked the Web second in importance only to
guidance counselors as a key source of information in helping them
decide where to apply for colleges. In fact, 48 percent mentioned
a high school guidance counselor, followed by 37 percent who cited
Web sites with information about colleges. Traditional sources of
information such as friends and college viewbooks trailed far
behind.
</P>
<P>
The Art &AMP; Science Group said that the findings presage greater
changes resulting from the impact of technology on the higher
education market, including the diminishing use of expensive
viewbooks and other printed materials in college selection, new
roles for guidance counselors, and the promise of new
possibilities and efficiencies in enrollment data collection and
management.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi Restores Ancient Building Complex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi province has
restored a building complex constructed in the late Ming Dynasty (
1368-1644) and the early Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), and plans to
turn it into a tourism attraction.
</P>
<P>
The complex belongs to Chen Jingting, a teacher of Emperor
Kangxi and a famous prime minister of the Qing Dynasty. The
complex is located in the Huangcheng Village, Beiliu Town of the
province's Yangcheng County.
</P>
<P>
The complex was later used by local residents and in 1998,
local government moved the villagers out of the complex and at the
same time raised 20 million yuan (about 2.4 million U.S. dollars)
to repair the complex.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some of the rundown or damaged structures
have been repaired or restored according to historical records.
</P>
<P>
The complex is divided into inner and outer parts which consist
of 16 courtyards and 640 rooms, covering an area of 36,580 square
meters.
</P>
<P>
The inner part, constructed in 1632, includes eight courtyards
which feature typical Ming Dynasty architectural styles. The seven-
storey Heshan Building and its affiliated buildings which consist
of 108 troops-hiding caves are the rare structures of the Ming
Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The outer part, completed in 1703, is formed by main halls, an
academy of classical learning, gardens, boudoir buildings,
pavilions and other structures.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the complex is of great research value since
it reflects the social situation of the late Ming Dynasty and the
political situation and religious belief in the early Qing Dynasty.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Initiates Strict Monitoring of Taxis Meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Strict monitoring has been initiated recently after reports
were received that taxis show higher meter readings than actually
are,Purna Manandhar, director general of NBSM, told the local
press Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The monitoring is being done in close coordination with the
Valley Traffic Police," Manandhar was quoted by The Kathmandu Post,
the largest English daily in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
"Monitoring was initially done only during the day-time. Now
the routine has extended even late at night," he added.
</P>
<P>
If the meter of a taxi is found faulty, the driver or the owner
is liable to a maximum fine of 1,000 rupees (14.5 U.S. dollars) on
each count of offense, even if it is for mechanical failure,
Manandhar said.
</P>
<P>
Taxis drivers are obliged to get their meters checked regularly
at NBSM to avoid such faultiness, and a system of maintaining
inventory has been started to this end, he said.
</P>
<P>
In this system, the vehicle numbers will be recorded in a
computerized database each time they visit NBSM for routine check
up,and their frequency of visits and past records will be
maintained in the computer.
</P>
<P>
In case taxis drivers are found to have tampered with meter,
NBSM has the authority to confiscate the meter plus the fine, said
Manandhar.
</P>
<P>
As popular vehicles for foreign tourists, taxis in the
Kathmandu valley are often found charging much inflated fare based
on tampered meter readings.

<HEADLINE> Thai Industry Sector Robust But NPLs Hamper Growth: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Suwat was quoted as saying that the industry sector has shown
positive signs as witnessed by the four-month report ending April
that showed industrial production index rose by 12 percent year-on-
year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, industrial production exports in the period amounted
to 22 billion US dollars and are expected to reach 63 billion
dollars by year-end, up 25 percent from the same period a year
earlier, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Thailand had come only half way on the path
to economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"Stable trade surpluses and steadfast exports are the main
signs of economic improvement," he said, "but when factored with
the risk of the failure of the banking system and mountainous
external debt,recovery was retarded."
</P>
<P>
"Thailand's sovereign debt has skyrocketed to 83 billion
dollars while non-performing loans (NPLs) in the entire banking
system are 38 percent which is alarmingly high. Bank lending,
meanwhile, has contracted in the past four months," Suwat said,
considering these factors as the main hindrance to the economy.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the government turn its attention to the industry
sector as it is the only sector that can bail out the country from
the economic slump.

<HEADLINE> Japan's GDP Grows 2.4 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan's economy grew 2.4 percent in
the January-March quarter from the previous term for the first
upturn in three quarters, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The quarter-to-quarter growth in gross domestic product (GDP)
translates into an annualized expansion of 10.0 percent, the
agency said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Japan's GDP, the total value of goods and services
produced domestically, expanded a real 0.5 percent in fiscal 1999,
which ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
The 0.5 percent GDP expansion undershot the Japanese
government's 0.6 percent growth target, but was the first increase
in three fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
For the January-March quarter, domestic demand and external
demand contributed 1.5 percent and 0.9 percent respectively to the
GDP figure, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Personal spending, which makes up about 60 percent of Japan's
GDP, increased 1.8 percent from the previous quarter, up for the
first time in three quarters.
</P>
<P>
Corporate capital spending grew 4.2 percent, while housing
investment rose 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the reporting quarter, Japan's GDP totaled 486 trillion yen
(4.54 trillion dollars) in annualized terms, compared with 475
trillion yen (4.44 trillion dollars) in the previous period.
</P>
<P>
Japan's exports grew by 5.4 percent but imports shrank by 0.6
percent during the three months.
</P>
<P>
"In broad terms, the economy has been recovering steadily. But
it has not crept out of its severe situation entirely," EPA chief
Taichi Sakaiya told a press conference following the release of
the GDP data.
</P>
<P>
Sakaiya said it is premature to say whether the government
needs to compile a supplementary budget for fiscal 2000, adding
that the time is also not ripe for the Bank of Japan to reverse
its hyper-easy monetary policy.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Renews Iraq's "Oil-for-Food" Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council decided Thursday night to renew Iraq's "oil-for-food"
program for another period of six months until December 5, 2000.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution, which was unanimously adopted, the Security
Council allowed Iraq to sell as much oil as it can over this
period, which begins on June 9.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also allowed Iraq to spend 600 million U.
S. dollars in this period for spare parts and equipment to upgrade
its dilapidated oil industry.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council invited the U.N. Secretary-General to
appoint independent experts to prepare by November 26, 2000, a
comprehensive report and analysis of the humanitarian situation in
Iraq, including the current humanitarian needs arising from that
situation and recommendations to meet those needs, within the
framework of the existing U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under stringent U.N. sanctions since its
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. The "oil-for-food" program,
which was aimed at easing the deteriorating humanitarian situation
in the country caused by the sanctions, began implementation in
late 1996.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions cannot be lifted until the United Nations is
certain that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction in accordance with relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq has barred U.N. arms inspectors from returning since
their withdrawal from the country just days before the U.S.-led
air strikes in December 1998.

<HEADLINE> Euro 2000 Referees Ordered to Show No Tolerance toward Foul Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- UEFA chief executive Gerhard
Aigner said that referees have been ordered to show no tolerance
toward foul play during the three-week Euro 2000 tournament.
</P>
<P>
Aigner said: "We hope to improve the performance of referees.
We want them to show the quality that they have demonstrated in
European competition this season." "Above all we hope that
referees will take a firm line. We don't want matches to
degenerate."
</P>
<P>
Among other priorities set out by UEFA, referees will be
instructed to clearly step out ten meters to force players to
retreat the correct distance. Referees have also been told to
clamp down on shirt-pulling.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Gamal Ghandour, the only non-European referee, will
officiate Spain's clash with Norway.
</P>
<P>
Ghandour's appointment follows the nomination of a European
referee for a match at this year's African Nations Cup.
</P>
<P>
"The players will be different but I will approach the match in
exactly the same way," Ghandour said. "European and African
football are becoming more alike because so many Africans play in
Europe."

<HEADLINE> Interview: Malaysia for Fair, Open, Transparent Multilateral Trading System (1) (by Wu Dingbao) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The preservation of such a multilateral trading system is
imperative for Malaysia's continued economic prosperity, Kerk Choo
Ting said in a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In pursuing liberalization initiatives, it is important to
ensure the results are mutually beneficial to all, Kerk said,
adding Malaysia will continue to emphasize the principle of
progressive liberalization and recognition of the different
capacities of economies to embrace liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The element of special and differential treatment is to remain
an integral part of the WTO negotiations, he stressed, adding "
Weaker members must not be expected to assume the same level of
commitments to liberalize their markets as the stronger ones."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has assumed and will continue to assume a proactive
role in the WTO negotiations to ensure that the WTO's work program
and agenda takes into account Malaysia's interests and concerns.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia will continue to work with other WTO members who share
a common interest or concern, in particular, developing countries
in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia looks forward to working closely with China in
influencing the WTO' agenda," the deputy minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in line with the WTO obligations, Malaysia, which
joined the GATT (now WTO) in 1957, has increased tariff bindings
up to 65 percent and undertaken tariff reduction on industrial and
agricultural products since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Referring to how Malaysia protects the sectors affected by
liberalization such as car making, telecommunications, finance and
insurance, Kerk said several of these sectors are strategic
industries and as such Malaysia undertakes liberalization
progressively commensurating with their level of development.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia applies the flexibilities provided for under the WTO
which safeguard the domestic industry, he said, adding in the case
of cars, Malaysia has excluded them from its concessions during
the Uruguay Round and the country is able to maintain the existing
tariffs.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, June 8, (Xinhua) -- Visiting Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu and his Croatian counterpart Stjepan Mesic Thursday
pledged support for clearing the Danube River and building oil
pipelines linking the Caspian, Black and Adriatic seas.
</P>
<P>
Mesic said after the meeting of the two leaders that his
country is interested in clearing the Danube as it will lead to
the re-opening of its Vukovar port and boost the economic
development of that area, the Croatia radio and television station
reported.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu said that two countries will make efforts to
build petroleum pipelines linking the three seas and that a
Romanian experts delegation would soon head for Zagreb to discuss
the matter further.
</P>
<P>
During NATO's airstrikes against Yugoslavia last year several
bridges over the Danube were destroyed, which has blocked the
waterway and caused heavy economic loss to the countries along the
river.
</P>

The Romanian president arrived here Thursday for a state visit.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Tennis Body Launches New Programs for Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- In a campaign to discover young
tennis talent, the Indonesian Tennis Association (Pelti) has
decided to step up efforts to introduce tennis to children.
</P>
<P>
Pelti official in charge of tennis development, promotion and
foreign affairs Martina Widjaja said Indonesia's lack of recent
pride-provoking international achievements were mostly due to the
country's failure to promote new players.
</P>
<P>
The program, known as Mini Tennis, is expected to start in
early July.
</P>
<P>
As part of the nationwide tennis campaign, the association will
also hold tennis contests for Junior and Senior High School
students.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to introduce two programs. The first is a Mini
Tennis Program, which is aimed at elementary school students while
the second involves contests for junior and senior high school
students," Martina was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Friday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
She said the Mini Tennis program, which allows only children
under nine years of age to participate, will require much in the
way of adjustments to Pelti rulings if children are to be
comfortable while playing.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the potential difficulties the children will face
using normal equipment, the International Tennis Federation will
provide the balls and the rackets in mini sizes. We will also
reduce the size of the court," she said.
</P>
<P>
The International Tennis Federation has launched the Mini
Tennis Program worldwide. Hundreds of schools in Europe have
participated in the program.
</P>
<P>
Martina said that the two programs will be tested first in
Jakarta and the Central Java town of Ambarawa in July. She expects
the program to have covered Java by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Other islands will follow suit next year.

western region.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that during the January-April period, six of
the ten provinces, a municipality and autonomous regions including
Guizhou, Chongqing, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Sichuan and Tibet all

<HEADLINE> Chengdu Wins Four Int'l Awards For Fine Environmental Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Chengdu, capital of southwest China
's Sichuan Province, has won four international awards for an
environmental project it has launched in its urban area.
</P>
<P>
All the four awards go to the comprehensive harnessing of the
Funan River which runs through downtown Chengdu. The project was
completed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The latest award for the project is the "Local Initiative Award
" issued by the International Council for Local Environmental
Initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Chengdu invested heavily to tackle the Funan River in 1993, and
within five years, the city reinforced 16 km of the river course
and relocated 100,000 people to new residential areas.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the city also stopped all the 600 pipelines
which discharged waste water into the river, built 320,000
hectares of grassland, a flowing water park, a musical square and
other facilities.
</P>
<P>
The project won three medals in 1998 including one from the U.N.
Center for Human Settlement, one for its flowing water park from
an international organization, and a design award from the
International Environmental Design Research Association.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Development Program and the U.N. Center for Human
Settlement have regarded the project as a good example for big
cities in the world to follow.

<HEADLINE> State Sector Turns Profitable in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The State-owned and State holding
enterprises in north China's port city of Tianjin have turned
losses into profit for the first time in the past three years,
posting a quarterly profit of 301 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The rosy picture in the State sector is closely related with
the recovering national economy and also attributable to the
municipal government's effort to restructure its economy and
introduce new technologies, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin pledged to eliminate deficit in the State sector by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 20 municipalities, provinces, and autonomous regions
in China reported profits in the State sector at the end of last
year. Tianjin was the only one in the eastern region to still have
loss-making State enterprises at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The municipality has since intensified its effort to pull the
State sector out of difficulties, injecting 27 billion yuan into
the State-owned large or medium-sized enterprises to help them
upgrade technology.
</P>
<P>
The index measuring the economic efficiency of industrial
enterprises in Tianjin increased by 16.67 percent during the first
three months this year. Output of the State-owned industry
registered a rise of 14.7 percent during the period, the highest
increase into the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Large and medium-sized enterprises played a pivotal role in the
basic turnaround in the State sector. The profitable ones of these
enterprises, for instance, made 1.122 billion yuan of profit
during the January-March period, a surge of 64.5 percent from the
same 1999 period.

However, relief efforts have been hampered by heavy rain,
damaged roads and severed communications.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that hundreds of people in the provincial
capital of Bengkulu on Thursday expressed frustration over what
they saw as the slow pace of emergency assistance to thousands of
people badly needing help.
</P>
<P>

that the government was neglecting them while foreign aid was
pouring into the quake zone.
</P>
<P>
At least 120 persons were killed and 2,300 others injured in
the strong earthquake measuring on 7.9 on the Richter Scale on
Sunday night. The epicenter of the quake was in the Indian Ocean
about 112 kilometers southwest of the western coast of Bengkulu.

<P>
A powerful aftershock measuring 6.2 on the Richter Scale jolted
this area again on Thursday morning. The Meteorological and
Geophysics Office said the aftershock's epicenter was near Enggano
island, some 120 kilometers from Bengkulu city, and 100 kilometers
below sea level.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of small aftershocks have followed the Sunday's
earthquake. Indonesian seismologists said the aftershocks would
continue through the week and expected to vanish only in two or
three weeks' time.

<HEADLINE> Australian FM to Head to Solomons, Fiji Visit off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer will head to the Solomons Islands Friday as part
of a Commonwealth mission to try to bring an end to fighting there.
</P>
<P>
"The security situation allowing, the intention is to go today,
" a spokesman for Downer told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a planned visit by Downer to Fiji has been called
off until at least next week, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Downer will fly to the Solomons with New Zealand Foreign
Minister Phil Goff, the Botswanan foreign minister and a special
representative of the Malaysian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"They're going to send a message from the Commonwealth," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"They're going to meet with government and other
representatives to convey the Commonwealth's position and they
will also try and talk to the warring parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
The visit plan was only finalized late Thursday night after it
earlier appeared to be in doubt because of continuing fighting in
the Solomons.
</P>
<P>
However, a truce between warring ethnic groups appears to be
holding.
</P>
<P>
On Fiji, the spokesman said "the Fijians didn't really want the
delegation until they had resolved the hostage crisis."
</P>
<P>
Australian Defense Minister John Moore also said on Friday that
he believed the situation in the Solomons was stable enough to
allow the Commonwealth mission to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
"The truce is still holding, and I think that's very hopeful
for the Commonwealth mission," he told the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation radio.
</P>
<P>
"If those people can get there, which includes Foreign Minister
Downer, then we may be able to negotiate some political settlement,
because that's what must happen in the end," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moore said Australia would await the outcome of the talks
before considering whether any peacekeeping force was needed in
the Solomons.
</P>
<P>
"When they report back from those talks, then the government
will consider its next move," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Within defense of course you always have plans, but it's a
long gap, long step, between plans and putting those into action,"
Moore said.

ZHENGZHOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese doctors have successfully
separated two Siamese twins who were joined at the chest, abdomen
and liver in Puyang city of central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The twin infant boys weighed only 2,500 kilograms before the
surgery. Doctors said the survival rate for such light Siamese
twins is very low after separation.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the success of the surgery, medical experts were
pooled in the hospital to work out the best way to separate the
twins. The surgery lasted more than three hours and the twins are
currently recovering well under special-care treatment in the
hospital.

<HEADLINE> Shearer Faces Anxious Wait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- England team captain Alan Shearer
has given England a major injury scare just four days ahead of
their opening match in the European Championship finals.
</P>
<P>
Shearer, who is the cornerstone of Kevin Keegan's plans and has
started every single one of his 13 games in charge, underwent a
scan on a knee problem before flying out to the squad's base in
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Both Shearer and Keegan were expressing confidence the striker
would be able to face Portugal on Monday, although they were not
anticipating receiving the results of the "precautionary" scan
until at least Friday.
</P>
<P>
And while Shearer may not be able to train until Saturday, the
England coach - who revealed that a total of eight players have
undergone scans in the past week or so - will give him until the
last possible moment to prove his fitness.
</P>
<P>
Until the scan results come back without any problems, the news
therefore remains a major worry for England fans so close to the
start of the tournament, given that - for all his critics -
Shearer is the one regularly proven goalscorer at international
level within the squad.
</P>
<P>
However, he apparently went into last Saturday's game against
Malta with a "slight niggle" in his knee and then had to be
substituted after just 51 minutes after falling "awkwardly" during
the match.
</P>
<P>
Keegan had insisted earlier that Shearer was "fine" and would
train, yet he still felt the scan was necessary to get a
specialist view on the problem.
</P>
<P>
Just before boarding the flight to Belgium, Shearer revealed: "
I had a scan this morning just as a precaution to see if there's
anything in there.
</P>
<P>
"We'll wait for the results and take it from there. I don't
think it will be a problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Newcastle forward, who is due to retire from
international football after the tournament, told Sky Sports.com:
"I think it needs another day or two to settle down. I'm very
confident, and the medical staff are very confident, that I'll be
back in training on Saturday."
</P>
<P>
Keegan, who only last week declared his confidence in his
players telling him the truth about the full extent of any injury
problems, added: "The scan is a precaution."

<HEADLINE> Aston Villa Vows to Fight to Keep Southgate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Aston Villa will fight to the last to keep Gareth Southgate at the
club.
</P>
<P>
Southgate stunned the Villa Park hierarchy by slapping in a
transfer request just hours before he was set to depart on England
's Euro 2000 bid.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old central defender, who skippered Villa in their
FA Cup final defeat by Chelsea at Wembley last month, is unhappy
at the lack of ambition shown by his club and is looking for the
chance to express himself on the highest European stage.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal will have all been
alerted by Southgate's statement, which follows on closely from
the decisions of Ugo Ehiogu and Julian Joachim to leave the club
and Paul Merson's assertion that he will not be around at the
start of next season.
</P>
<P>
With manager John Gregory away on holiday as the continuing
turmoil envelopes his team, talks with Southgate will not take
place until England return from the tournament in Holland and
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
However, Villa chairman Doug Ellis has privately indicated that
he wants to keep one of his most influential players, even though
Gregory has previously said that he will not keep men whose
commitment can be called into question.
</P>
<P>
"Gareth Southgate is contracted to Aston Villa Football Club
for a further period of three years and remains an Aston Villa
player for this period," said the club in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Gareth and the manager are out of the country at present and
the manager will be discussing the matter with Gareth at the
earliest possible opportunity."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Talks Must Get into Substance: British Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- British special envoy for Cyprus,
Sir David Hannay, said here Friday the negotiations on Cyprus must
address the core issues if there is to be any hope of success.
</P>
<P>
Concluding his talks in Cyprus, Hannay told reporters that "we
certainly hope for early decisive progress and that is what we will
be working for in the weeks" ahead of the July Geneva talks.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, which has been mediating between the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot communities for a settlement of the divided
island, identified security, constitution, property and territory
as the core issues.
</P>
<P>
But so far the two rival sides have only outlined their
positions during two rounds of proximity talks under the U.N.
auspices, substantive negotiations on those issue are yet to begin.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island after a failed pro-Greece
coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Hannay, the first of several foreign envoys to visit Cyprus to
prepare the ground for the third round of U.N.-sponsored talks
between the two communities on July 5 in Geneva, arrived here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He had met with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash as well as other officials.
</P>
<P>
Hannay said the background against which foreign envoys are
working has become a lot more favorable, because of the improvement
of relations between Greece and Turkey, which have enormous
influence on the two communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
He urged the two sides to change gear by getting into "the
substance of the core issues" and moving away from "simple
recitation of the individual positions to the U.N.."
</P>
<P>
"The change of gear we are looking for is for the negotiators,
the two sides and the U.N., to get stuck in to the substance of the
core issues and to begin the serious search for solutions," Hannay
said.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Tajikistan Stress Peaceful Solution to Afghan Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Tajikistan on Friday
stressed the ongoing Afghan crisis should be solved by peaceful
means instead of military means.
</P>
<P>
Through the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), which
Iran currently chairs, Iran has made efforts to find peace in
Afghanistan by non-military channels, President Mohammad Khatami
told his Tajik counterpart Emomali Sharipovich Rakhmonov.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Khatami also stressed Iran's support for
cooperation of regional countries and international organizations
in bringing an end to the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmonov said the Afghan crisis has no military solution and
peace can only be achieved through talks, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan has been torn by a bloody civil war since 1992 when
militant Islamic groups toppled the former pro-Soviet government.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Afghan government under President Burhanuddin
Rabbani was ousted by the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban militia,
which is now controlling more than 90 percent of the country's
territory.
</P>
<P>
Military clashes are continuing between the Taliban and the
Northern Alliance headed by Rabbani, who has had Iran's support in
the past years.
</P>
<P>
During Friday's talks, Khatami and Rakhmonov also called for
more cooperation between their countries to boost bilateral ties,
especially in the field of trade.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmonov arrived here early Friday to attend the summit of the
10-member Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) slated for
Saturday. Pakistan's Chief Executive Pervez Musharraf, Kyrgyz
President Askar Akayev, Turkmen President Saparmurad Niyazov and
Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliyev have already arrived for the
summit.
</P>
<P>
The ECO was founded by Iran, Pakistan and Turkey in 1985. It was
subsequently joined by Afghanistan and the Central Asian and
Caucasian republics of Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan,
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan joined the group following
the collapse of the former Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: King's Visit Consolidates Jordan-U.S. Ties by Wang Bingfei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
returned home Friday after a 10-day trip to the United States,
which was widely seen here as a landmark visit that has further
consolidated the strategic ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The king said he was satisfied with the results of his extensive
talks in Washington with President Bill Clinton and senior U.S.
political and business figures on bilateral ties, economic
cooperation and developments of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
One of the most visible fruits of the visit is that Washington
promised some 475 million U.S. dollars in various economic and
military aid to the kingdom in fiscal year 2000, almost 100 million
dollars more than 1999. Jordan is the largest recipient of U.S. aid
on per capita basis.
</P>
<P>
Out of different strategic considerations, Jordan and the U.S.
have been moving closer to each other in recent years, and analysts
believe the king's U.S. visit gave this trend a great push.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is in desperate need of economic and military assistance
from Washington, its biggest donor, to lift its economy out of a
decade-old stagnation and to embark on a road of sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
It also wants to uplift its own status on the international
arena through cooperation with the U.S, particularly in the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Washington, on the other hand, takes Jordan as an important ally
in the Arab world and a peace broker between Israel and its Arab
neighbors, and as a bridge of dialog between Arab countries and the
U.S. itself.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, becoming the
second Arab country after Egypt to strike peace with the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
During his U.S. trip, King Abdullah promised to make continued
efforts for progress in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and a
resumption of the Israeli-Syrian track, stalled since January due
to Israel's refusal to promise full return of the Golan Heights it
seized from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The king also pledged to work towards a just, durable and
comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Clinton pledged his continuous support for the
king's efforts to improve Jordan's economic performance and to push
the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Jordanian monarch also scored in bilateral trade
and economic cooperation with the U.S.. He signed with Clinton an
agreement on jointly establishing a free trade zone and on U.S.
help to build Jordan's information technology industry.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been eyeing for a larger share in the American market
since it joined the World Trade Organization late last year, and it
is counting on the envisaged free trade zone to create more jobs to
check its growing unemployment, which stands at over 14 percent
according to official statistics, if not 27 percent by independent
estimates.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade is gaining increased importance in bilateral
ties since the two countries signed in 1997 an agreement on the
economic and social security of Jordan. The trade volume hiked to
1.29 billion dollars in 1999 from a meagre 7.77 million dollars in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh said the king's
just-concluded visit to the U.S. would further bolster bilateral
trade opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Vows to Keep Positive Economic Trends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Mikhail
Kasyanov on Friday pledged to build up current positive trends in
national economic development, which he described as "quite good."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the TV station ORT, he identified the
positive trends over the first five months of this year as stable
macroeconomic situation, controllable inflation, stable ruble
exchange rate and revenues ahead of budget targets, which made the
Central Bank's foreign currency reserve reach 20 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
What makes the premier optimistic about the prospects for the
current fiscal year includes that foreign investors are eager to
directly invest in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to be very much in touch with the State Duma in autumn
in order to improve the investment climate in the country,"
Kasyanov said.
</P>
<P>
He is convinced that a government economic program with "the
important ideas" of the Center for Strategic Development taken
into account will be adopted by the end of June. But the cabinet
should take some necessary measures to accelerate the economic
improvement before this document comes into effect, Kasyanov said.
</P>
<P>
The premier is very much encouraged by the State Duma's (the
lower house of the parliament) support for the government's
initiative to introduce a single income tax scale.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the lawmakers will endorse a single
social tax bill formulated by the cabinet as a measure to keep the
budget revenues' stable growth.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister also promised to make efforts to ease the
tax burden of the population.

<HEADLINE> Russia Offers Joint Missile Defense Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia Friday offered NATO a joint
missile defense proposal but the NATO chief said the plan was
still short on details.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev explained to the Western
military alliance about the joint European anti-missile defense
system Russian President Vladimir Putin had put forward days ago.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Sergeyev avoided questions
concerning details of the Russian proposal and only went so far as
to say that the Russian proposal would not breach the 1972 Anti-
Ballistic Missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian proposal by President Putin does not violate or
compromise in any way the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty," said
Sergeyev. "These are proposals on the creation of a tactical ABM
system."
</P>
<P>
Russia as well as some NATO allies were afraid of the United
States national missile defense system and oppose the American
plan to deploy a limited anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday that if the
Russians were talking about a theater missile defense system, that
would not be sufficient to protect the United States and much of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
"So it is now an idea that does not sound to be feasible or
desirable for protecting us against the kind of threats that are
emerging," said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
A final test on the American system, a small number of
interceptors that would shoot down incoming missiles, is scheduled
for early July while U.S. President Bill Clinton is to decide in
the autumn whether to begin deployment of the system.

<HEADLINE> Second Salvo of Sun Plasma to Hit Earth: Canadian Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Canadian scientists are warning of
the arrival of the second salvo of sun plasma Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Geomagnetic Forecasting Center posted a "major
storm warning" for both Thursday and Friday, but said the second
solar salvo appears weaker than the first hitting the earth's
magnetic field Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Canadian scientists said they expect a weaker solar salvo
judging by its estimated speed and the size of the radiation burst
or solar flare that accompanied it.
</P>
<P>
No serious technical problems have been reported in Canada
since the massive solar storm first hit earth at about 5 a.m.
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the high Arctic, however, the blast made radios useless
Thursday with some camps operated by the Canadian Geomagnetic
Forecasting Center being caught in a blackout, the center
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
But the disturbance seemed only about half as bad as in 1989,
when the solar storm last hit earth, leaving 6 million Canadians
without power for hours in winter, according to Canadian
scientists.
</P>
<P>
Such havoc is caused when charged particles from the sun hit
the earth every 11 years to distort the magnetic field and
generate power surges in transmission systems.

<HEADLINE> Alitalia Takes Tough Line With Ex-Partner KLM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian national carrier Alitalia won'
t be giving back the 100 million euros (about 102 million U.S.
dollars) which KLM Royal Dutch Airlines invested in Milan's new
airport Malpensa 2000, and is planning to sue its former strategic
partner for 250 million euros in damages, according to a company
statement issued Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, released ahead of a shareholders' meeting next
Friday, said that the Italian airline "viewed the justifications
given by KLM for breaking its alliance accord as insufficient and
incongruous and believes it has no grounds for claiming back its
contribution of 100 million euros."
</P>
<P>
It also said that Alitalia "reserves the right to sue for
damages incurred by KLM's illegitimate withdrawal from the
alliance" to the tune of 250 million euros.
</P>
<P>
It said that, if it failed to reach an out-of-court agreement
with KLM, then it would take its case to Amsterdam, where it would
be heard by a panel of three judges, one Italian, one Dutch and
the third belonging to a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch airline made the abrupt announcement on April 28 that
it was withdrawing from its strategic accord with Alitalia, citing
uncertainties surrounding the future of Malpensa and the stalled
privatization of Alitalia, which was originally slated for sell-
off by June 30.
</P>
<P>
It demanded that Alitalia refund the 100 million euros it
forked out on December 30 as its contribution towards the costs of
upgrading the troubled hub of Malpensa, originally a small
military airport.
</P>
<P>
The development of Malpensa into a fully operational
international hub was a crucial feature of the alliance announced
by KLM and Alitalia in December 1997 and which became operative in
November 1999, with KLM retaining the option of terminating the
accord if the airport failed to take off.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Andean Countries Seek Zero Customs Tariff in the Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The agriculture ministers of the
Andean Community Nations (ACN) member countries are studying the
feasibility of establishing a zero customs tariff in the region,
Peruvian Agriculture Minister Belisario de Las Casas Friday told
the press.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian agriculture minister said that this plan is
directed to the formation of a common block that will permit the
Andean countries to take part in more developed markets.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to establish a common customs tariff system for
all the countries of the Andean region," said De Las Casas.
</P>
<P>
A proposal to modify Resolution 328 that refers to the Andean
System of Agriculture and Livestock Sanitary regime, and the
creation of Andean guidelines for the registration, control, and
marketing of veterinary products is also in the agriculture
minister's agenda.
</P>
<P>
The Andean Community of Nations (ACN) is formed by Bolivia,
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Aid Agencies Calls for End to Fighting in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations aid
agencies have called for a halt in the fighting between Rawandan
and Ugandan troops in Kisangani, a town in the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC), where the humanitarian situation is deteriorating
rapidly, a U.N. spokesman said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told a press conference here that
despite an agreement by Rwanda and Uganda to cease fire Thursday,
armed hostilities continued for the fifth straight day in the
northern town of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
Heavy shelling had put a halt to U.N. humanitarian operations
in the town where hundreds of people had been reported dead and
wounded and there was no electricity or running water, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We just spoke with the force commander who says that the U.N.
mission in Kisangani was working on a humanitarian cease-fire so
that urgently needed assistance could be provided to the
populations," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a joint statement issued here, the chiefs of
five U.N. relief agencies Friday expressed "grave concern" about
the plight of civilians in Kisangani, echoing statements made by
the U.N. Security Council and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply dismayed about the situation facing civilians in
Kisangani, especially children and women, many of whom are already
malnourished," said the heads of the World Food Program (WFP), the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the World
Health Organization (WHO), the U.N. Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
"We urge the governments of Rwanda and Uganda to immediately
end the fighting that is killing innocent civilians," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. organizations said that the city's entire civilian
population was under fire and completely cut off from humanitarian
relief. They also underscored their concern about the current
inability of humanitarian organizations to move urgently-needed
relief goods across front lines, and noted that vaccines in cold
storage in Kisangani were being compromised due to the lack of
electricity for refrigeration.
</P>
<P>
The polio immunization campaign slated for July in Kisangani
province -- covering an area the size of France -- was now in
serious jeopardy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Justice Department Concludes Probe of King Assassination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
could not find evidence supporting the allegation that there is
conspiracy in the assassination of civil rights leader Martin
Luther King Jr. after an 18-month investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department, in an investigation report released
here Friday, concluded that Martin Luther King Jr. was killed by
James Earl Ray and recommended no further investigation on this
case.
</P>
<P>
The new investigation, headed by one of the department's
leading civil rights prosecutors, Barry Kowalski, rejected
allegations that arose in recent years from former Memphis bar
owner Loyd Jowers, former FBI agent Donald Wilson and earlier from
Ray himself that a mysterious Raoul or others, including federal
agents, police or black ministers, participated in a plot to kill
King in 1968.
</P>
<P>
Like four earlier investigations, the new Justice inquiry "
found no reliable evidence that Dr. King was killed by
conspirators who framed James Earl Ray."
</P>
<P>
"Nor have any of the conspiracy theories advanced in the last
30 years, including the Jowers and the Wilson allegations,
survived critical examination," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Ray pleaded guilty in 1969 to killing King and was sentenced to
99 years in prison. He claimed before his death in prison in 1998
that a mysterious figure named Raoul, later Raul, had framed him.
</P>
<P>
"The allegations relating to Raoul's participation in the
assassination, which originated with James Earl Ray, have no merit,
" the report said.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno ordered the new probe on the
assassination case on August 26, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Parade Commission Restricts Belfast March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Parades Commission in Northern
Ireland Friday placed restrictions on the disputed Tour of the
North Orange Order parade in north Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The parade has been rerouted away from a number of nationalist
areas on the proposed route to be marched by more than 2000
members of the Protestant order.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said if it were to proceed along its original
route, there would be potential public disorder.
</P>
<P>
Making its determination, the Commission said it recognized the
role the north Belfast parade had in linking up "isolated"
sections of the Protestant community.
</P>
<P>
But it also recognized that "demographic change" had taken
place along the proposed route.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said: "The route of the parade alternates each
year, with the parade taking a less contentious route on 'odd'
years. The notified route for this year's parade would take it
through parts of north Belfast where it is strongly opposed."
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen have been prohibited from entering Cliftonpark
Avenue beyond Alloa Street.
</P>
<P>
It is also barred from entering the Cliftonville and Antrim
Roads and Duncairn Gardens between the Antrim Road and Edlingham
Street.
</P>
<P>
The Commission also said it was concerned about the potential
for public disorder, following "serious civil disturbances" along
the route in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Commission also imposed restrictions on a feeder parade to
the main march, planned by the Old Boyne Island Heroes.

LONDON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Prince of Wales's press
secretary Friday resigned in a row over who owns the valuable
copyright to pictures of Prince William.
</P>
<P>
Sandy Henney, who had been in the job for seven years, tendered
her resignation which was accepted by Charles "with deep regret."
</P>
<P>
She was accused of breaking an agreement with the Daily
Telegraph after releasing photographs to other national newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph and St James's Palace both claimed they
owned the copyright.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the palace said: "The copyright of these
pictures should have been established at the time they were taken
to ensure that St James's Palace owned the copyright and that any
proceeds arising from the use of the photographs went to charity
as has normally happened in the past."
</P>
<P>
"This issue was not resolved and copyright is now wrongly
vested elsewhere. We share our part of the blame in that we should
have taken action to ensure that copyright was vested with us," it
added.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph and its royal photographer Ian Jones were
given access to William to take pictures marking his 18th birthday
on June 21. The photos at Eton were to be released to all national
newspapers.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany Almost Agree Upon European Institutional Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- French and German leaders Friday
almost reached at their 75th summit in Mainz, western Germany, an
agreement on European institutional reform, the key task of France
during its European Union (EU) presidency in the second half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
French officials said that the summit formally renewed the role
of the French-German locomotive in pushing forward the European
integration, and will pave the way for a successful French EU
presidency.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said after the summit
meeting with President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin that Germany and France have reached understanding without
exception on the issue of EU institutional reform and the details
of the agreement will be worked out by the foreign ministers of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
``We have agreed upon the limit of number of the European
commissioners, and the need to make as quickly as possible the
decisions on the qualified majority in the EU council of ministers,
'' he said.
</P>
<P>
A reform of the EU institutions, above all the voting mechanism
of the EU councils of ministers, will be needed for the
enlargement of EU into a body with from 25 to 30 members in future
instead of the present 15 members.
</P>
<P>
France also seems to have reached a compromise with Germany on
the re-balancing of the number of votes to be shared by each
country in the councils of ministers, which is the main thorny
issue between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Germany wants to have more votes because its population is much
bigger than those of France, Britain and Italy, with whom Germany
share the same number of votes at the present time.
</P>
<P>
``Taking into account of the demographical factor is desirable,
'' said Chirac at the joint press conference with Schroeder in the
wake of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said that Germany and France will find a solution to
the problem by taking into account both the factors of population
and influence of EU member countries.
</P>
<P>
France is opposed to the idea of Germany having more votes than
it does in the council of ministers, because it considers its
political influence no less than Germany.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Inaugurates Andean Countries Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori
inaugurated Friday here the 12th summit of the Andean Community
Nations (ACN).
</P>
<P>
Amid heavy security, presidents Hugo Banzer of Bolivia, Andres
Pastrana of Colombia, Gustavo Noboa of Ecuador and Hugo Chavez of
Venezuela attended the summit's opening ceremony at a hotel here,
along with summit host Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Peruvian state and pro tempore ACN president
Fujimori highlighted during the opening ceremony the strength of
the bloc, and proposed the creation of an Andean nationalism.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said that the target for the Andean countries in the
21st century will be the full integration in all aspects of the
five countries that form the Community of Andean Nations.
</P>
<P>
Colombian President Andres Pastrana recommended to the Andean
heads of state the building of the Andean unity for the benefit of
the future generations of that regional bloc.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana said that only with a sincere commitment and with a
political will of all and every one of the Andean nations, it will
be possible to arrive at the ambitious goals they have set for
themselves to fulfill a bicentennial dream and for the good of
their citizens.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that while the official agenda of the
summit covers regional stability and economic integration, the
gathering of leaders, which continues through Saturday, may also
afford Fujimori an opportunity to confirm regional recognition for
his government.
</P>
<P>
President Alberto Fujimori won his third term in office in the
May 28 runoff election with 51.6 percent of the vote. His rival,
Alejandro Toledo, who boycotted the poll after complaining of
electoral fraud, garnered about 17.7 percent of the ballot.

In a statement attributable to his spokesman, Annan said: "The
international community views the detention of U.N. peacekeepers
as a serious crime, and the perpetrators would no doubt be held
accountable for their actions."
</P>
<P>
Early in May, the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in
Sierra Leone seized more than 500 U.N. peacekeepers mandated to
disarm the RUF according to a peace accord last year. Under the
international pressure, it released them recently but is still
surrounding another batch of over 200.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General remains extremely concerned about the
encirclement and detention by RUF of 11 UNAMSIL (U.N. Mission in
Sierra Leone) military observers of various nationalities and 245
Indian peacekeepers in the areas of Kailahun and Pendembu in
eastern Sierra Leone," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely essential that the RUF immediately and
unconditionally restore the freedom of movement of the
peacekeepers and allow them to join their UNAMSIL units," the
statement added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Offers Joint Missile Defense Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday offered NATO a
joint missile defense proposal but the NATO chief said the plan
was still short on details.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev explained to the western
military alliance about the joint European anti-missile defense
system Russian President Vladimir Putin had put forward days ago.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Sergeyev avoided questions
concerning details of the Russian proposal and only went so far as
to say that the Russian proposal would not breach the 1972 Anti-
Ballistic Missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian proposal by President Putin does not violate or
compromise in any way the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty," said
Sergeyev, "These are proposals on the creation of a tactical ABM
system."
</P>
<P>
Russia as well as some NATO allies were afraid of the United
States national missile defense system and oppose the American
plan to deploy a limited anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Minister William Cohen said on Friday that if the
Russians were talking about a theater missile defense system, that
would not be sufficient to protect the United States and much of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
"So it is now an idea that does not sound to be feasible or
desirable for protecting us against the kind of threats that are
emerging," said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
A final test on the American system, a small number of
interceptors that would shoot down incoming missiles, is scheduled
for early July while U.S. President Bill Clinton is to decide in
the autumn whether to begin deployment of the system.

<HEADLINE> Bush Unveils Government Reform Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Texas Governor George W. Bush of
the United States has unveiled a government reform plan that he
said would save 88 billion dollars over five years.
</P>
<P>
The presumptive Republican presidential candidate Friday
pledged to cut federal bureaucracy by not replacing 40,000 senior
and middle managers scheduled to retire over the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed creating a chief information officer and
spending 100 million dollars on a program to support interagency e-
commerce proposals.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Bush suggested creating a "sunset review board" to
recommend elimination of duplicative jobs, and to make government
more modern by moving all significant government procurement to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"Today when Americans look to Washington, they see a government
which is slow to respond, slow to reform, ignoring changes that
are taking place in the private sector and in some local and state
governments," Bush said in a campaign speech in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
The Texas governor promised to establish a citizen-centered
government that will listen and answer to the people.
</P>
<P>
Bush's proposals invited harsh criticism from the presidential
campaign of Democratic Party candidate Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
Complaining of inconsistencies between Bush's words and stated
intentions, Gore's campaign noted that since Bush took office as
Texas governor in 1995, the two-year Texas budget has grown from
72.8 billion dollars to 98.1 billion dollars, a 36 percent
increase, compared with 21 percent on the federal level.
</P>
<P>
"Governor Bush should try to keep the promises he made to Texas
before making promises to the rest of the country," said Doug
Hattaway, spokesman of Gore's campaign.

<HEADLINE> German-Franco Consultation in Mainz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 BERLIN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
arrived in Mainz, the capital of the state of Rhineland-Pfalz, to
talk with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. It is the 75th
German-Franco Consultation.
</P>
<P>
The German-Franco consultation is a traditional summit of the
leaders in the post-war era. This time French Premier Lionel
Jospin also attended as well as the foreign and defense ministers
of both sides.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting Schroeder and Chirac made an announcement in
which two leaders stressed both countries were in full agreement
on the European Union's reforms and Balkan policy.
</P>
<P>
"We achieved far-reaching results both for our nations and
also for Europe," said Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Chirac thought that the summit had shown the Franco-German
motor was running on full power.
</P>
<P>
German and French leaders reached an agreement on going ahead
with the Airbus A400M military airlifter. Germany will order 75
A400M airlifters and France will also purchase about 50 pieces.
</P>
<P>
Germany and France also announced in a declaration that they
would create a German-Franco spy satellite alliance which would be
open to other European states.
</P>
<P>
The German-Franco bilateral relations played an important role
as an axis of the European Union in the past. France will take
over the EU. rotating presidency for the second half of this year.
In December the EU summit will be held in the French city of Nice.
The reforms must be undergone before any new member states from
Eastern Europe can be admitted to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Chirac stressed that France would consider Germany's size with
regard to the weighting of votes in the European Council. Germany
has a population of 82 million and France has 59 million. But both
France and Germany have 10 votes in the Council.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder and Chirac had also discussed in their meeting about
the U.S.'s National Missile Defense system and the EU's sanctions
policy to Austria.
</P>
<P>
"We have the same view on the terrible consequences that NMD
could have ...," said Chirac. He was worried that the NMD system
would damage the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty which was
signed in 1972 and strictly limited such missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
Chirac expressed that the NMD system will be a top issue at
the EU's summit in Nice.
</P>
<P>
About the question whether they had discussed possible lifting
the sanctions against Austria Schroeder said : "We see no reason
to introduce any changes."
</P>
<P>
France backed firmly to continue the embargo on Austria.
Because the rightist Freedom Party (FPOe) led by Joerg Haider
joined the Austrian Government last February 14 EU. states decided
to boycott it as a reaction.

<P>
The first group of orders for the helicopters, which are
capable of carrying about 20 soldiers each, will be made in the
next few weeks from the four countries, said sources close to the
deal which was signed on Thursday in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Germany will buy 134 NH 90 helicopters, Italy 117, France 95
and the Netherlands 20, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The helicopters will be made jointly by the French-German
Eurocopter, the Italian Agusta, and the Dutch Fokker and their
first examples will come out of assembly lines by 2003, eight
years after the project was launched to rival the U.S. S92
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Apart from those to be ordered by the four countries, from 500
to 600 more such helicopters are expected to be produced in the
next 20 years for export, said officials at Eurocopter.
</P>
<P>
The Scandinavian countries could buy from 70 to 90 such
helicopters in an on-going bidding, while Britain, Spain, Portugal,
Greece and Singapore have also expressed their interest.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia Friday said that its
troops have launched a counter-offensive against Eritrean forces
at the eastern frontier and inflicted heavy losses on them.
</P>
<P>
The counter-offensive, which began last night, was in response
to repeated Eritrean provocations at the Bure front, the Office of
the Ethiopian Government Spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the operation was very successful, the office said
Ethiopian troops continued their counter-offensive up to Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
According to the office, Eritrean army also provoked Ethiopian
positions at the central Senefe front Friday morning in the
vicinity of the Imbaseira Mountain, but the Eritrean attack was
effectively repulsed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the western front, the office said the Eritrean
troops incited hostilities in the vicinity of Guluj, resulting in
small-scale fighting.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Condemns Latest Fighting in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has strongly condemned Rwanda and Uganda for latest fighting in
Kisangani, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the Times
of Zambia newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, mediator for peace in the DRC, said here in an
interview on Thursday that the fighting defied logic and
threatened a United Nations plan to deploy peacekeepers in
Africa's third largest country.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very sad turn of events. The whole thing defies
logic and is big shame to Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This fighting is a direct threat to the peace process, a
direct threat to peacekeeping plans and a direct threat to
regional stability," he added.
</P>
<P>
He called on both countries to end the fighting. "I will be
visiting both countries to see what can be done to end this
fighting. We need to find a permanent solution to the Kisangani
crisis," Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, he had already spoken by telephone
with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwanda President Paul
Kagame who is now in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the remarks soon after the head of a U.N. team
trying to broker a ceasefire in Kisangani condemned Rwanda and
Uganda commanders for destroying the Congolese city and killing
innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
Intense shelling and machine gun fire echoed across the city as
Rwandan and Ugandan troops fought for the fourth day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the political committee on the DRC held a crucial
meeting in Lusaka on Thursday to discuss the pull-out of foreign
troops from the war- torn central African nation.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door meeting followed the seventh plenary session of
the Joint Military Council (JMC) held earlier here. It is said
that the political committee would discuss modalities for
disengagement of troops and creation of a buffer zone in readiness
for the U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
The planned deployment of more than 5,000 U.N. peacekeepers and
 observers in the DRC has been hampered by ceasefire violations in
some parts of the vast country.

<HEADLINE> Political Committee for Congo Ceasefire Adopts Mechanisms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Political Committee for the
implementation of ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) ended its sixth meeting here Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The meeting adopted mechanisms for disarmament, demobilization,
 resettlement and reintegration of members of all armed groups as
stipulated in the Lusaka ceasefire agreement signed by all
belligerents in July and August last year.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the implementation of the Disengagement Plan,
the committee said in an agreement adopted by the two-day meeting
that all the parties had fulfilled their undertaking to submit
information on location of their troops.
</P>
<P>
The committee further noted that the completion of the drawing
up of sub- plans had reached an advanced stage.
</P>
<P>
The committee commended the Joint Military Commission (JMC) for
its work towards the implementation of various aspects of the
Lusaka ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was attended by all parties to the ceasefire
 agreement, noted that resource constraints continue to pose a
serious impediment to the speedy discharge of its
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
It appealed to the international community to step up its
support to the JMC so that it can perform its work more
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
On the release of prisoners of war, the agreement said, all the
parties still holding prisoners should declare their readiness to
release them immediately and without pre-conditions.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the inter-Congolese Dialogue, the committee
welcomed the establishment of regular contacts between itself and
the office of the Facilitator of the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also accepted an invitation from the United Nations
Security Council for a consultative meeting in New York on June
15-16, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the political committee expressed concern over the
continued fighting in Kisangani and welcomed the various efforts
being employed to return the situation to normalcy.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Founder's Son Named Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's ruling Chama Cha
Mapinduzi (CCM) party nominated on Friday Zanzibar Minister for
Communications and Transport Amani Abeid Karume as its candidate
for the isles presidency in the October general elections.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the central town of Dodoma said that Karume, 52,
the eldest son of the late founding president of Zanzibar since
the 1964 revolution, Abeid Amani Karume, scooped 111 out of 196
votes cast at a special meeting of the powerful CCM National
Executive Committee (NEC).
</P>
<P>
Karume vowed following the voting that he would defend the
union between Zanzibar and the mainland at any cost and boost the
isles economic development if elected Zanzibar President.
</P>
<P>
CCM Secretary General Philip Mangula told a press conference
that Karume beat three other CCM contenders by winning 56.63
percent of the total votes casting.
</P>
<P>
Karume urged supporters of his rivals, Zanzibar Chief Minister
Mohamed Gharib Bilal, Zanzibar Finance Minister Amina Said Ali and
Union Deputy Minister for Finance Abdisalaam Issa Khatib, to
automatically dissolve after a winner has been chosen.
</P>
<P>
Veteran Ambassador Hassan Ahmed Diria was also on the list of
aspirants but he withdrew his candidature before the NEC day-long
session reportedly to avoid creating groupings within the party.
</P>
<P>
The CCM is a mature political party with a long history of
respecting democracy, Karume said, the nomination outcome would
not create any enmity or division among Zanzibaris.
</P>
<P>
He would face the challenge by the Civic United Front (CUF),
the main opposition party in Zanzibar whose Secretary General Seif
Sharif has vowed to win the October 29 second multiparty elections
in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
When collecting presidency candidate forms on May 6, Karume
said that a ruling party must forge working ties with rival
political parties to achieve development objectives.
</P>
<P>
"Rapid development will only be possible in the Isles when
cooperation of all political parties is achieved," he said.
"Parties are an integral part to democracy."
</P>
<P>
However, he did not say specifically if he would form a
coalition government with the oppositions if elected.
</P>
<P>
The semi-autonomous Zanzibar region in the Indian Ocean joined
with mainland Tanganyika to form the United Republic of Tanzania
after a revolt in 1964 led by the elder Karume that ousted the
sultan and Omani Arabs who ruled the island.
</P>
<P>
The elder Karume led Zanzibar until he was assassinated on
April 7, 1972.
</P>
<P>
A special congress of the CCM is scheduled on Saturday to
confirm CCM Chairman and Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa the
sole candidate for the Union presidency.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement by Tanzania's National Electoral
Commission on Thursday, a total of 12.5 million of the 30 million
population are expected to vote in 232 constituencies throughout
the country in this year's general elections.
</P>
<P>
According to a time table issued by the NEC early this year,
the registration of voters will be conducted between August 1 and
21 while the nomination of contestants will be made on August 13,
and election campaigns between August 14 and October 28.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania had been under a single political party (CCM) system
from 1965 until 1992 when the multiparty system was introduced.
</P>
<P>
The October elections will be the second time since 1995, but
the first time in the country's post-independence history for
presidential, parliamentary and civic elections to be held
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
All the 13 fully registered political parties will run for the
elections which are likely to be dominated by the ruling CCM, at
least on the mainland as President Mkapa, who won the 1995
elections, is expected to win him the second five-year term.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed Amid Tame Inflation Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Friday after a government report showed that the inflation rate in
May rose slightly but remained tame.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 54.66 at 10,614.06.
The blue chip index finished the week with a loss of 180.70 points.
</P>
<P>
But the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 49.28 at 3,
874.84. The composite rose 61.46 points in the week.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index fell 4.72 at 1,456.95.
</P>
<P>
The stocks sensitive to higher interest rates fell after the
Labor Department reported that outside the volatile energy and
food categories, the "core" rate of inflation at the wholesale
level rose 0.2 percent in May, slightly above analysts'
predication. In March and April, core prices rose 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report failed to calm inventors' fears of higher rates,
dragging the Dow and the S&AMP;P lower. The Federal Reserve has raised
rates six times since last June in an effort to cool off the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
But investors moved in the technology sector to buy stocks of
Qualcomm and Sun Microsystems, driving the Nasdaq index higher.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 3.50 at 648.44. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 1.98 at 939.75 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 8.52 at 523.06.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,671 up, 1,218 down and 507
unchanged.
</P>

NYSE volume declined to 782.64 million shares from 842.33
million in the previous session.

MEXICO CITY, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Foreign shipping companies
handle 30 percent of Mexico's exports after the disappearance of
the Mexican high-seas merchant navy, and especially after the
demise of the country's container ships fleet, the private sector
and exporting companies announced.
</P>
<P>
Mexico misses an income of nearly 40 billion dollars in hard

Alejandro Martinez Gallardo, Cocamin chairman, said during the

Acapulco, in the southern Mexican state of Guerrero that Mexico
exports goods worth 140 billion U.S. dollars every year, with 30
percent corresponding to the mobilization of TEUS (20-foot
containers) that are transported in container ships owned by
transnational firms.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have a fleet to handle containers in Mexico, and the
commodities that are transported in containers are practically 30
percent of all the goods moved in this country, and the movement
of containers is made by foreign shipping companies," said

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Swift Completion of Verification in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The verification process has begun with a brief postponement
due to technical problems, and more work will need to be done
Saturday, Annan's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Verification is the sole responsibility of UNIFIL, but the
task will require the full cooperation of the parties, which the
Secretary-General is confident of receiving," spokesman Fred
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. teams continued to work with Israeli experts on Israel's
side of the withdrawal line, and other U.N. teams, in tandem with
Lebanese experts, will resume their verification work on the
Lebanese side of the line Saturday, he confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to inform the Security Council in writing
once the UNIFIL force commander, Maj. Seth-Kofi Obeng, reports to
him on the verification teams' work, according to Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and carved up a border strip as
a so-called "security zone" in 1985 to allegedly protect its
northern area from cross-border attacks by Lebanese Muslim
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted resolutions 425 and 426 after
the Israeli invasion, demanding immediate and unconditional
Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state decided earlier this year to pull out from
Lebanon by July 7. However, it completed withdrawal of its troops
from southern Lebanon on May 24.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected its military presence in southern Lebanon,
claiming that some areas along the borderline are still occupied
by Israel and insisting that its deployment in the south will be
done only after the U.N. confirmation of full Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief continued to follow very closely developments on
the ground in Southern Lebanon, believing that the parties have
come a long way: Israel towards complete withdrawal and Lebanon
towards the reassertion of its sovereignty and territorial
integrity, said Eckhard, adding that Annan voiced his wish for the
verification process to be completed as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Have 4 Billion Dollars in Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Cuba has received since its
opening to foreign capital foreign investment pledges for four
billion dollars, part of which has entered the country and the
rest is in process, said Friday Cuban Foreign Investment Minister
Martha Lomas.
</P>
<P>
Lomas said during the meeting of U.S. businessmen with Cuban
authorities in the tourist city of Cancun, in the southeastern
Mexican state of Quintana Roo, that the investments arrived Cuba
in difficult times but now they are ripening.
</P>
<P>
She said that Cuba's economy is not going through a process of
privatization, but it is rather seeking a complement in important
sectors like tourism, oil, and communications, to continue its
development, despite strong United States pressures.
</P>
<P>
The minister highlighted the importance of Mexico as one of
Cuba's main partners, especially in relation to commerce activity,
and mentioned as an example the participation of a firm of Mexican
capital that offers cell telephony services.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban minister said that the United States is obsessed with
changing Cuba in a radical way, and that it is very possible that
it will get in the future other ideas, such as the emerging of a
list in which there are firms that allegedly make illegal business
in the island.
</P>
<P>
It would be also possible that it would think up another law,
similar to the Helms-Burton, or the Torricelli, to hamper the
development of the country, said Lomas.
</P>
<P>
She mentioned that the Sherryl International firm, related to
the nickel and oil industries, and the BN firm, were sanctioned by
the United States, but despite that, they continue in Cuba making
investments, which is respected and valued by Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The minister told all the businessmen attending the meeting and
those who will learn in the future about this meeting, that all of
them are welcomed in Cuba, and much more the big business
entrepreneurs, who support the country with their capitals and at
the same time all Cubans.

WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Mexico

potentially oil-rich area of the Gulf of Mexico.

<P>
The agreement was signed at the White House by Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Mexican Foreign Affairs Secretary
Rosario Green, with President Bill Clinton and Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo observing.

The agreement now goes to the U.S. Senate for approval.

Under the terms of the agreement, the United States is
prevented from unilaterally awarding contracts to drill for oil

<HEADLINE> Argentine President Criticizes General Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Fernando
de la Rua said Friday that the general strike called by the three
labor centrals is "unnecessary and useless."
</P>
<P>
The president admitted before the local press that the country
faces a very difficult economic situation, especially because of
the big trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the government took "painful" measures to
solve the serious problems of the balance of trade deficit, and
said that this policy aims at the development and growth of the
country with social equality, giving attention to social problems.
</P>
<P>
The president deplored the occurrence of some episodes of
violence and forcefully condemned those actions, and insisted that
no answers or solutions to the problems can be found with violence.
</P>
<P>
Rodolfo Daer of the General Labor Confederation (CGT) Friday
called on the government to get out of its isolation and seek an
agreed-on solution in defense of production and work.
</P>
<P>
Daer told the press that the wide response to the strike is "a
call of attention to the government," and called on it to convoke
to a dialogue to seek an agreement to solve the current situation.
</P>
<P>
The De la Rua government announced on May 19 a package of
measures of adjustment that include a reduction of the salaries of
public servants who earn more than one thousand pesos (the same in
dollars) a month, and the privatization of the workers health
system, which caused strong repercussions in the country.
</P>
<P>
The three national labor union centrals Friday called for a
general strike as a protest against the government's adjustment
measures, which had a big response in the whole country.

<HEADLINE> Bolivian Economy Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bolivian economy grew 1.6 percent
in the first quarter of 2000, Economic Development Minister Jose
Luis Lupo said Friday in the country's capital city of La Paz.
</P>
<P>
The Bolivian economy grew only 0.6 percent in 1999 due to the
influence of the turmoil on world financial markets, according to
reports reaching here from Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia is now seeing the beginnings of recovery thanks to
growing agricultural and livestock production, which together make
up some 19 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, Lupo
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that such sectors as mining and
manufacturing were also beginning to show signs of growth.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia's government has predicted that full-year economic
growth will total some 3.5 percent in 2000.
