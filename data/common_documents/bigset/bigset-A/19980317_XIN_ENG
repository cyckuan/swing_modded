<HEADLINE> Britain to Consider Reducing Forces in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain will consider reducing
its military presence in the Gulf region if Iraq fully comply with
the agreement signed with the United Nations on arms inspections,
a senior British defense official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There will be some considerations that the size of our
military presence in the region should be reduced if Iraq
completely implements the agreement," British Secretary of State
for Defense George Robertson told reporters at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Robertson, who arrived here Sunday night on a two-day official
visit, said Britain "was satisfied with Baghdad's allowance for
U.N. arms inspectors access to sites suspected of containing
weapons of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
But he pointed the implementation of the U.N.-Iraq agreement
"still has to be tested."
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the U.N. signed the agreement in late February, under
which Baghdad agreed to unconditionally and completely allow U.N.
arms inspectors, charged with dismantling weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq, to enter any sites.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the United States remained cautious about that and
kept their troops on alert to monitor Iraq's implementation of the
accord.
</P>
<P>
London deployed in the Gulf waters two aircraft carriers and
some other warships as part of the military buildup for an
possible use of force against Iraq in a four-month-long standoff
over weapons inspection. Washington has three aircraft carrier
battling groups in the area.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Robertson stressed that he "very much hope that
the Iraqi people's plight will be eased by the U.K.-co-sponsored
resolution which doubled the oil-for-food program."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council approved last month to allow Baghdad
to sell 5.3-billion-U.S.-dollar-worth of oil in six-month period
to buy food and medicine needed in Iraq. The figure more than
doubled the 2 billion dollars of oil sales under the oil-for-food
deal struck between Baghdad and the U.N. in 1996.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Robertson has held talks with senior
officials of the United Arab Emirates and discussed with them
bilateral relations and the latest developments in the Gulf
region.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Sonia Gandhi, Dual Chief of India's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Sonia Gandhi has become the
dual chief of India's century-old Congress party following her
election as chairperson of the Congress Parliamentary Party on
Monday and her appointment as party president last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Born on December 9, 1946 into a family of modest means in a
village called Ovassanjo near Turin, Northwestern Italy, Sonia
Gandhi not only transcended continents and oceans but also covered
a political marathon and finally rose to the top posts of the
113-year-old Congress within months.
</P>
<P>
In the process, Sonia Gandhi emulated her husband,
mother-in-law and grandfather-father-in-law -- Rajiv, Indira and
Nehru -- who all held the two posts during their career.
</P>
<P>
Married into India's best known family of Nehru-Gandhi in 1968,
the 52-year-old Sonia Gandhi became a primary member of the
Congress less than a year ago before the Calcutta Congress Plenary
Session in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Since Rajiv's assassination on May 21, 1991, Sonia had led a
life of near recluse for six years, keeping observers guessing
about whether she nursed political intentions at all.
</P>
<P>
During the period, fawning congressmen, looking for a
charismatic personality to lead the party to electoral success,
kept sending their appeals to her to come and take over the party.
</P>
<P>
After an excruciating spell of suspense, Sonia, who had long
remained something of an enigma to many, finally decided to
campaign for the Congress in the just-concluded Lok Sabha
elections and is credited with preventing a rout for the party.
</P>
<P>
The Congress, which was forecast not to cross the double digit
mark, managed a tally of 141 seats in the Lower House, largely due
to her charismatic presence during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the top job of the Congress was offered to her on a
platter immediately after the death of her husband, but a grieving
and reluctant Sonia declined the offer.
</P>
<P>
Sonia, whose Italian origin gave her opponents propaganda
grist, became a full-fledged Indian citizen in 1984 after the
death of Indira Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
Sonia met Rajiv Gandhi in Cambridge during 1960s when the
former Indian Prime Minister was studying at the famous British
university from where his grandfather Pandit Nehru too did his
graduation.
</P>
<P>
Rakov and Sonia were married in 1968 after three years of
courtship.

<HEADLINE> Sudan to Return Expropriated Egyptian Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese relevant ministries
have started carrying out President Omar Al-Bashir's decision to
return expropriated Egyptian property, Sudanese media reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research Ibrahim
Ahmed Omar announced that his ministry has started to consider
return the Egyptians the educational institutions.
</P>
<P>
According to sources of the Sudanese embassy in Cairo,
Al-Bashir's instructions cover the expropriated Egyptian property
including the branch of Cairo University in Khartoum, public
schools and the guest house of an Egyptian irrigation and
hydrological survey team.
</P>
<P>
These properties have been seized by Khartoum over chilling
relations after an Islamist-backed government assumed power in
Sudan in 1989.
</P>
<P>
In a step towards improving the long-hit ties with Egypt,
Al-Bashir has ordered necessary arrangements to restore Egyptian
property in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Omar said that his ministry has prepared some relevant materials
and will convey them to the Egyptian side for an agreement on
returning these institutions.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Irrigation Ministry has also started to study the
president's decision to consider returning the guest house to the
Egyptians, which was confiscated by the Sudanese government in
1994.
</P>
<P>
However, the student union of the Nilain University, formerly
the branch of Cairo University in Khartoum, Sunday issued a
statement in which it declared its refusal of the decision to
return the university to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir's decision came just a month after the two countries
resumed the river Nile navigation after a hiatus of three years, a
move hailed by both sides as a good turn after a long period of
strained ties.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors were at odds over a border dispute and have
traded accusations of harboring militants and oppositions.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Prices for Services Soaring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Service businesses are raising
their prices across the United States because of a tight labor
market in the country, according to U.S. media reports Monday.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that prices for services from cable TV to
dry-cleaning and haircuts are rising 3 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
But the prices of U.S. goods are falling or holding steady.
Falling energy prices sent wholesale prices lower for a fourth
straight month in February, according to the latest report of the
U.S. Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
Intense global competition, sharpened by the Asian financial
crisis and the strong U.S. dollar, combined with recent
productivity gains almost ensure that prices on goods will
continue to fall.
</P>
<P>
Goods account for some 42 percent in the U.S. economy while
services' share is 58 percent.

<HEADLINE> White House Spokeswoman Questions Clinton Accuser's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A White House spokeswoman
Monday questioned the credibility of U.S. President Bill Clinton's
latest accuser, saying former White House volunteer Kathleen
Willey's account of an alleged sexual advance is "contradicted" by
her positive attitude toward Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Appearing on morning television talk shows, White House
spokeswoman Ann Lewis said Mrs. Willey's description on CBS' "60
Minutes" Sunday of the 1993 Oval Office encounter with Clinton
"surprised" her.
</P>
<P>
"What I saw last night was someone who talked about being
angry, feeling that she has been taken advantage of. And yet in
1996, when she was no longer associated with the president or the
White House, she came to see me and said `I really want to work in
this campaign,'" said Lewis on NBC's "Today" show.
</P>
<P>
"There was such a contradiction between what I saw and heard
last night and the person I met with in 1996," Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
Lewis denied that she was trying to spread a White House
"message" to rebut Mrs. Willey's account, saying this is her
"personal message."
</P>
<P>
Willey said the story she was telling on television was the
same one she swore to before a Whitewater grand jury last week.
Clinton has given a sworn deposition denying her account.
</P>
<P>
Willey's family finances were in a state of collapse and she
wanted a paying White House job when she came to see Clinton on
November 29, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Clinton "has no idea why she said what she did or whether she
now believes that's what happened," said a White House statement
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's lawyer, Robert Bennett, said on ABC's "This Week"
that "there is substantial material of what she has said which is
under seal, which has not been released, which seriously
undercuts" her story.
</P>
<P>
"I think in fairness it's important... to note that there have
been at least five versions of this encounter," former White House
counsel Jack Quinn said on CBS' "Face the Nation."
</P>
<P>
The president said earlier he may have kissed Mrs. Willey on
the forehead to comfort her but that there was nothing sexual.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Members Urged to Sign Investment Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior official from the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has
called upon the member states to sign an agreement for protecting
investment in the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar held on Monday in Karachi, Kanti Kumar
Podar, president of SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI),
said SCCI is looking forward to a regional agreement for
investment promotion and protection among South Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Podar said such an agreement would encourage export-oriented
joint ventures in the SAARC region and facilitate their financing
from non-SAARC regions.
</P>
<P>
He also called for formulating a time-bound action plan for the
transition from South Asian Preferential Trading Agreement (SAPTA)
to South Asian Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, entitled "SAARC Economic Union by 2008", was
jointly organized by SCCI and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers
of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Podar said that the Customs Union of SAARC is to be achieved by
2005 through adopting a common external tariff and allowing free
flow of capital.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the delay in the third round negotiations under
SAPTA, he said this round should have been completed by the end of
1997.
</P>
<P>
Podar hoped that commerce ministers of the seven SAARC member
countries would complete the negotiations in Islamabad next month.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the SAARC states are currently constrained by
lack of infrastructure and communication linkages between them.
</P>
<P>
He called for the immediate signing of an agreement to
facilitate the movement of goods and people by road.
</P>
<P>
"Similar regional agreements at SAARC level for promotion of
shipping, railways and airlines are necessary to further the cause
of free trade," Podar added.
</P>
<P>
SAARC comprises Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Currency Market Stable in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, (Xinhua) March 17 -- The foreign currency market in
Romania is following a positive trend, the daily Curentul said in
Tuesday's issue.
</P>
<P>
The daily quotes Adrian Vasilescu, the communication director
of Romania's Central Bank (BNR), as saying that "BNR stopped
intervening in the interbank foreign currency market three weeks
ago."
</P>
<P>
Vasilescu is also quoted as saying that an increased foreign
currencies demand was recorded at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The bank-to-costumer and the bank-to-bank operations in the
first three months of 1998 were equal on total transactions, which
proves that the Romanian market is functional and becoming more
active, Vasilescu said.
</P>
<P>
According to specialists at BNR, the Bank's main objective is
to control the money supply and inflation, with ulterior control
of interest rates and exchange rates.

<HEADLINE> EU Suspends Preferential Import Tariffs for Czech Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural ministers from 15
European Union (EU) countries decided to remove preferential
tariffs on the import of pork, poultry and fruit juice from the
Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's decision was a response to an import quota of 24,000
tons a year imposed by the Czech government on EU apples starting
in 1998, the EU said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Under the measures passed by Czech authorities, the EU will
have to pay a 95 percent duty for its above-quota apples exported
to the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
According to the European Commission, the EU's executive body,
the suspension of preferential tariffs will only serve as the
first step, said the statement. The adoption of further measures
will depend on how the dispute develops.
</P>
<P>
The new Czech quota would cause an estimated potential loss of
seven million ECU (some 7.5 million U.S. dollars) to the EU apple
growers, said EU sources.

<HEADLINE> British FM Visits Har Homa, Despite Israeli Anger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Despite Israel's anger and the
bitter weather, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook toured
Tuesday afternoon the controversial Har Homa in Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival in Jerusalem from Gaza, where he met Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, Cook, accompanied by Israeli officials, went
ahead to the site.
</P>
<P>
Israel broke ground for the construction of a Jewish settlement
on Har Homa a year ago, leading to a standstill in the peace talks
between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
When Cook reached Har Homa, he was confronted with a group of
Israeli nationalist, rightwing demonstrators who chanted "Cook, go
home" in protest of his visit.
</P>
<P>
But about a dozen peace advocates of the Israeli Peace Now
movement greeted the British top diplomat to show their support
for his position on demanding Israel's halt of settlement
activities.
</P>
<P>
Israel, displeased with Cook's trip to the site, canceled
police escort for Cook on his way to Har Homa, but deployed a
large contingent of policemen at the site in an effort to curb
radical protesters.
</P>
<P>
Cook's visit was very brief not only because of his tight
schedule, but also because of the hail storm, which was associated
with strong wind and sporadic rain.
</P>
<P>
He was briefed by Israeli officials at the scene and talked
with local Palestinians to get their respective accounts of the
situation there.
</P>
<P>
Cook, as a representative of the European Union (EU), is on a
tour of the Middle East aimed at helping revive the peace
process. He has visited Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian
self-rule areas, and will travel to Syria and Lebanon. Britain is
holding the rotating presidency of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Cook's insistence on seeing for himself Har Homa angered
Israel, which warned that the visit might undermine EU's role in
mediating the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Due to the strong opposition of the Jewish state, Cook dropped
his original plan to visit Har Homa with Palestinian Minister for
Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini and agreed to be escorted by
Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
Israel contended that it has sovereignty over the whole
Jerusalem, including the Arab east part it occupied in 1967.
</P>
<P>
By visiting Har Homa, Cook was trying to send a clear message
to Israel that the EU views its settlement activity as a major
obstacle to progress in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting Arafat in Gaza, Cook made it clear that
Israel must stop settlement expansion in order to advance the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Cook is to hold talks with Palestinian
officials in East Jerusalem, and with Israeli leaders, including
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai.

<HEADLINE> Feature: China's Tibetan Art Exhibition Warmly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Phrases like "Very good", "Nice
exhibit, welcome again" and "Breath-taking" appeared repeatedly in
the two visitor books at the six-day China's Tibetan Art
Exhibition opened on Monday in Kathmandu, capital of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
"I'm really pleased to see this grand art exhibition," a Nepali
visitor wrote in the book. "We enjoy very much seeing your
country's arts. Thanks for your exhibition, " another visitor
echoed.
</P>
<P>
Rabin Bajracharya, a student learning the Chinese language,
said that in the past he knew little about Tibet, but now he came
to know more about it through the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
"The Tibetan culture is unique, very similar to the Newari
culture, so it is easily acceptable for me," he said. Newari is
one of the minority nationalities in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
On display at the exhibition sponsored by the Chinese Embassy
in Nepal are about 100 pictures and some 500 objects relating to
archaeology, animal husbandry, agriculture, dress and personal
adornment, tangka and masks in Tibet known as "the Roof of the
World."
</P>
<P>
As most common traditional art products of Tibetan Buddhism,
tangka depicts a wide range of subjects including historical
events, biographies, religious doctrines, Tibetan natural
conditions and social customs, folklore and mythologies. Ever
since the exhibition opened, stream of visitors poured in
continuously, according to a cultural official from the Chinese
Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa noted in his
inaugural speech that relations between Nepal and China are
greatly consolidated by promoting at the people's level
understanding of each other's culture.
</P>
<P>
"I like it because Tibetan art and culture are beautiful," said
Nabin Subelli, a Nepalese businessman.
</P>
<P>
A teacher from Nepal's Tribhuvan University showed great
interest in the pictures about samples of cultural relics from the
New Stone Age unearthed in Tibet. "They are informative and nice,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Deepak Dahal, a social worker, said he was especially
interested in the exhibits concerning the Buddhist culture and
agriculture, because they are the same as Nepal's.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed here that the exhibition is bound to be
succeeded in achieving its aim of further strengthening the
cultural ties and understanding between Nepal and the Tibet
Autonomous Region of China.

<HEADLINE> Kabila Slams West for Rumor-Mongering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- President of Democratic Congo
Laurent Kabila Tuesday blamed the west for spreading rumors that
scandalize his government through the use of advanced information
technology.
</P>
<P>
Kabila arrived here Monday evening and held talks with
President Robert Mugabe which ended Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing after their talks in Harare, Kabila said
his country was receiving a lot bad publicity through the use of
the internet.
</P>
<P>
He said when he marched from the eastern part and ousted the
late former Zaire leader Mobutu Sese Seko last year, he received
a lot of support from the west.
</P>
<P>
''We do not expect any more support from them now,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
Explaining one of the incidents, Kabila said 19 armed rebels
from Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi had been executed because they
were captured, questioned and found trying to cause civil unrest
in the country.
</P>
<P>
''It was right. It is in our interest that no one is allowed
to use our territory to launch war on our country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same press briefing, Mugabe said he was concerned about
the rumors and false information on the political situation in
the central African country.
</P>
<P>
''These rumors have to be dispelled, and we will support
Kabila to dispel rumors that all is not well and that there is
resistance to democracy by Kabila and his government,'' Mugabe
said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe disclosed that he was briefed on the difficulties faced
by Kabila's government as it tried to overcome deprivation, lack
of food, transport and other facilities in general.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also consulted on regional issues as both are
members of the Southern African Development Community and the
Organization of African Unity, especially on how to solve the
problems in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Kabila and his delegation left Harare for Kinshasa Tuesday
afternoon after his two-day visit.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China today loaned
70 million U.S. dollars to Shanghai No.1 Iron and Steel Corp.,
helping it with a new construction project.
</P>
<P>
The corporation plans to build a blast furnace with a working
volume of 2,500 cubic meters, which should greatly increase its
pig iron production.

The project is expected to save the company 300 million yuan
annually, or about 36 million U.S. dollars, in production costs.
</P>
<P>
Bank of China's Shanghai branch and the corporation will
further strengthen cooperation in project development, financial
consultation and other services.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Revokes State of Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Tuesday revoked the state of emergency imposed after the
October 28 foiled coup.
</P>
<P>
He announced here that the state of emergency has been lifted
because there has been no more threat to the national security of
the country since the coup suspects started appearing in court
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The president said the state can continue to bring the
suspects to court and ensure that their conduct is within the
requirements of the law.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, however, warned that he will not hesitate to invoke
the state of emergency again if there is any threat to the peace
of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency was imposed one day after the coup
attempt and extended for another three months on January 29 this
year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 95 people, including former President Kenneth
Kaunda, had been arrested after the coup.
</P>
<P>
Following international appeals for Kaunda's immediate release
or an early law process, the government transferred Kaunda to the
treatment of being under arrest house on December 31 of 1997,
just six days after his being placed into prison in alleged
involvement in the coup.
</P>
<P>
Last month Kaunda, who had been in power for 27 years after
Zambia's independence in 1964 till 1991 when he was defeated by
Chiluba in the multi-party elections, was formally charged with
misprison of treason.
</P>
<P>
He was alleged to have known between October 26 and 28 last
year that certain Zambian army officers intended to commit
treason but did not pass such information on to Chiluba or other
senior leaders of the country, or try to stop the coup.
</P>
<P>
In January, Kaunda was charged with conspiring with some army
officers and two top leaders of two other opposition parties to
topple the government.
</P>
<P>
Some donor countries have been calling for lifting the state
of emergency in Zambia and some even went so far as to withhold
their aid payments to the country.

BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China's first group of 120
environmentally friendly buses with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
will hit the road here in May in an effort to control the
deteriorating air pollution in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The city will also set up an LPG station for the buses.

<P>
At the same time, a local automobile plant and Beijing LPG
Company have developed a new kind of LPG truck which can use
either gasoline or LPG. Some 34 such trucks are available on the
market.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 100 automobiles in Beijing have replaced
gasoline with LPG and three LPG stations have been set up.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has been suffering from abundant emissions from its 1.3
million automobiles, said an environmental expert, and "the use of
LPG will produce much less pollution."

<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi Stock Exchange
(KSE) 100-Index dropped 61.42 points on Tuesday to close at
1526.32 from Monday's closing index of 1587.74.
</P>
<P>
A total of 65.6 million shares were traded Tuesday against 31.5
million shares Monday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believed that the drop of the KSE 100-Index was
in reaction to a statement by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif that his
government was thinking of renegotiating power tariffs agreed by
the previous government.
</P>
<P>
The analysts are of the view that Sharif's statement might have
a negative impact on foreign investment in the long run.
</P>
<P>
There are expectations that the stock market will continue its
slide on Wednesday since there is little buying.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is a seller," said one dealer, who expected the KSE
100-Index to go down 10 more points before making some sort of
recovery.

<HEADLINE> French Right Wing Opposition Rejects FN Alliance Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- France's Rally for the Republic
(RPR) and Union for French Democracy (UDF) said Tuesday that they
will not seek alliance with the far-right National Front (FN).
</P>
<P>
The RPR and UDF, two main right-wing opposition parties,
rejected categorically the proposal by the FN to set up an
alliance, though they suffered a major setback in the regional
elections Sunday by losing nearly half the 20 regional councils or
parliaments they controlled to the left-wing coalition.
</P>
<P>
The FN won 15 plus percent of votes and will play an arbitrary
role in electing the president of eight regional councils or
parliaments, where the right wing and Socialist-led left wing are
running shoulder to shoulder.
</P>
<P>
In a ``formal instruction'' to all its elected regional
deputies, the RPR asked them to ``refuse to take whatever part''
in allying with the FN.
</P>
<P>
The UDF said there would be ``neither alliance, nor compromise,
nor agreement with the National Front for the election of the
presidents of the region.''
</P>
<P>
The FN President Jean-Marie Le Pen proposed Monday that FN
support RPR and UDF in exchange for a six-point program on
economic and social policies.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Launches Road Safety Bid over Easter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa launched a
road safety campaign Tuesday to curb road deaths over the Easter
weekend, South Africa Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Launching the second phase of the Arrive Alive campaign in
Pretoria, Transport Minister Mac Maharaj said the 10-million-Rand
(2 million U.S. Dollars) program would run until the end of
April.
</P>
<P>
The campaign would especially highlight the dangers of
speeding and driver fatigue, he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from previous years have shown that speeding is a
particularly serious problem over the short Easter holidays, when
South Africans seem to rush to get to their destinations.
</P>
<P>
Maharaj said the success of the first phase of the Arrive
Alive campaign, from last October to January, surpassed all
expectations when it reduced the road death toll over this period
by almost a third, from the previous year's 3,170 to 2,139 this
year.
</P>
<P>
Half of the budget for the campaign would be spent on
communication, including radio and television commercials
emphasizing the dangers of speeding, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> WEU Capable of Resolving Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Western European Union (WEU)
has been showing its ability to deal with the new strategic
situation effectively, said WEU Secretary-General Jose Cutileiro
Tuesday during the 50th anniversary of the Brussels Treaty, the
founding document of WEU.
</P>
<P>
"WEU is showing that it can respond to various crises that put
European interests at risk, especially those events with which
their North American allies do not wish to become directly
involved." said Cutileiro.
</P>
<P>
The WEU launched its first concerted action during the
Iran-Iraq war via a minesweeping operation in the Strait of
Hormuz. It later coordinated the minesweeping and embargo
monitoring operations during the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Then the European body helped set up a unified Croat-Muslim
police force to support the European Union administration in the
Bosnian city of Mostar.
</P>
<P>
Hans van den Broek, European commissioner responsible for
external relations, said that although the EU-WEU cooperation is
developing, the WEU still needs to express its readiness to
respond to EU requests.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner cited as a missed opportunity the WEU's
failure to decide on a contingency action when civil unrest broke
out in Albania last year.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1955, the WEU now has 10 members which consist of
Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The WEU also has three associate members that include Iceland,
Norway and Turkey; five observers made up of Austria, Denmark,
Finland, Ireland and Sweden; 10 associate partners from Bulgaria,
the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,
Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Stress Importance of Cultural &AMP; Ethical Progress (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- While showing great concern about
economic growth, laid-off workers, public security and the rule of
law, lawmakers attending the ongoing session of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, have not forgot
to underline the importance of cultural and ethical progress.
</P>
<P>
In their panel discussions on a government work report
submitted to the session for examination and approval, the
lawmakers have reached consensus that unremitting efforts must be
made to promote China's cultural and ethical progress, which is
indispensable for all-round social progresses.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades of reforms and opening-up, China has
maintained an annual average growth rate of about 10 percent for
its national economy, which has resulted in a far better material
life for its people.
</P>
<P>
The government work report notes: "In developing a market
economy and opening to the outside world, we are confronted with a
new situation and new tasks in promoting socialist cultural and
ethical progress. In concentrating on promoting economic
development, we are prone to neglect the promotion of cultural and
ethical progress."
</P>
<P>
Deputy Lu Shanzhen, who is president of the Beijing Teachers'
University, said that promotion of cultural and ethical progress
is becoming ever more important as the economy grows steadily.
</P>
<P>
"What's the point of economic growth if all people are
spiritually decadent and unwilling to serve their motherland?" he
asked.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers agreed that in the past five years, the Chinese
government has made remarkable achievements in promoting cultural
and ethical progress, whose significance has also been realized by
more and more people.
</P>
<P>
They noted that in many Chinese cities today, young volunteers
are actively engaged in community service, some taxi drivers offer
free ride to senior citizens, and local libraries are often packed
on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lei Feng, a famous model of altruism in the 1960s,
has once again become one of the most admired heroes in the
Chinese people's hearts, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Deputy Li Bo from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, who is
an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that
science, technology, culture and education, which are regarded as
part of cultural and ethical progress in China, could provide the
most powerful intellectual backing for material progress.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that promotion of cultural and ethical progress will
add great impetus to economic growth in comparatively
underdeveloped regions in central and western China," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Xiang Jianping from east China's Zhejiang Province cited
the example of Wenzhou, a booming coastal city in Zhejiang noted
for its highly developed private economy, to explain the
importance of cultural and ethical progress.
</P>
<P>
She said that in the primary stage of development, Wenzhou
people used to neglect cultural and ethical progress, and that
with an atmosphere of money worship prevailing in the city, fake
and shoddy commodities proliferated and almost destroyed the
fledgling local economy.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, people in Wenzhou have drawn lessons from the
past and made a lot of efforts to promote local cultural and
ethical progress, which has helped the city to improve its image
across the country and usher in greater prosperity," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Fu Yiming, another lawmaker from Zhejiang, suggested the
society make great efforts to curb the spread of evils like
pornography, gambling and drugs and prevent the rise of juvenile
delinquency.
</P>
<P>
Some other deputies noted that the promotion of cultural and
ethical progress would teach people how to correctly handle the
relationship between personal and collective, partial and overall,
and immediate and long-term interests, and thus help ease social
tensions caused by layoffs of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Deputy He Shaochuan from east China's Fujian Province pointed
out that cultural and ethical progress relies heavily on the
improvement of the quality of all people, especially of leading
officials, and greater efforts for relevant legislation.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Xu Zhiqin from southwest China's Chongqing City
suggested more revolutionary relics be used in the promotion of
cultural and ethical progress to influence people with the spirit
of revolutionary martyrs.
</P>
<P>
"It is also necessary to encourage writers and artists to
create more works of high taste that can appeal to both the more
and the less cultured," said Qin Bailan, a deputy from northeast
China's Liaoning Province.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The State Bank of Pakistan
(SBP) has lifted controls over U.S. dollar transactions by
allowing dealers to fix their own rates.
</P>
<P>
The bank made the announcement Tuesday with effect from March
24, permitting authorized dealers to quote different exchange
rates for the U.S. dollar like other currencies.
</P>
<P>
The bank also decided to widen its buy and sell spread for the
green back from 0.5 percent to 1 percent and allow banks to quote
their own dollar-rupee exchange rates for transactions.
</P>
<P>
The bank on January 20 allowed authorized dealers to set their
own exchanges rates for about 24 foreign currencies other than the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, importers will be free to purchase U.S.
dollars for imports, in ready or forward, from any authorized
dealer like other foreign currencies subject to the procedure and
stipulations of the SBP announcement.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the same rules will apply for the sale of U.S.
dollars as is the case with the sale of other foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
SBP also said it will discontinue publication of spot rates for
the U.S. dollar for the public and that of the U.S. dollar bill
buying rate by the Foreign Exchange Rates Committee from March 24.

<HEADLINE> Qaidam Basin China's Vital Resource Base in Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Along with the central
government's strategy to develop China's central and western
areas, the Qaidam Basin on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is expected
to be a major base of natural resources in the next century.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan worked out by southwestern Qinghai Province
where the basin is situated, reserves of the dotted saline lakes,
such as petroleum, natural gas and other minerals, will be tapped
in the next 15 to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The 250,000 sq km basin, one of the three biggest basins in
China, has scores of proven minerals, which have an estimated
potential value of 20 trillion yuan (2.4 trillion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The basin has 33 saline lakes, and their salt deposits with
contents of potassium, magnesium and lithium, make up more than 90
percent of the related deposits in the country, according to Ma
Peihua, deputy director of the Qinghai Institute of Saline Lakes
under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Approximately one-third of China's arable land suffers a
shortage of potassium, so the production of potassium chloride
will be key projects in developing the saline lakes, said Ma, who
is here attending the annual session of China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
Production of potassium fertilizers in the Qairhan Saline Lake
only reaches 350,000 tons each year.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the operation of a Sino-Israel joint
venture with a yearly output of 800,000 tons of potassium
chloride, the Qaidam Basis will turn out 1.3 million tons of
potassium chloride and 150,000 tons of potassium sulphate annually
by the year 2000. In this sense, Qaidam will be the country's
largest production base of saline chemicals.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, other types of minerals will be exploited, Ma
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang Jiemin, director of the Qinghai Petroleum
Administration, the central government has decided to focus on
the exploitation of natural gas resources in the Qaidam Basin.
</P>
<P>
The crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimated at 4.06
billion tons and 1.05 trillion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the production of crude oil was 1.6 million tons, and
production of natural gas 200 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Jiemin further estimated that by the year 2005, Qaidam
will turn out five million tons of crude oil and five billion
cubic meters of natural gas, which will make up one-thirtieth of
China's total oil and gas production.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, large projects to make polyvinyl
chloride, caustic soda, synthetic ammonia and carbamide will be
set up.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the basin boasts huge reserves of nonferrous and
nonmetal minerals, with the deposits of asbestos accounting for 60
percent of the country's total.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Expecting Regional Tourist Visa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A single regional visa for
South Africa, Swaziland and Mozambique may be introduced to
encourage cross-border tourism and tourism-generated investment,
South African Tourism Minister Pallo Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
The visa would be treated separately from a proposed South
African Development Community (SADC) protocol on the movement of
its member citizens, Jordan said Monday at a ministerial meeting
in Mbabane, capital of Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
He said tourism policy makers had been discussing how to do
away with the visas of the three countries needed to visit South
Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province, Swaziland and southern
Mozambique, as the three bordering regions are rich in tourist
attractions.
</P>
<P>
The largely unspoiled area in the region is to be developed,
Jordan said at the meeting, aimed at discussing the
600-million-Rand (121-million-U.S. Dollars) Lubombo development
project.
</P>
<P>
"We need a common approach to soften our borders in specific
areas... so that we can sell them both to investors and to
tourists as a package," Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the tourist visa would only allow for free
access to certain projects across borders in the region, but not
the free movement in SADC member states as the proposed SADC
protocol would do.

<HEADLINE> Institutional Restructuring Vital Step in Political Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- "The success of institutional
restructuring will facilitate extending the space of political
structural reform and improving socialist democracy and legality,"
Xing Bensi, vice-president of the Party School of the Communist
Party of China's (CPC) Central Committee, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang Jiaqiu, another vice-president of the Party
School, said: "Taking institutional restructuring as a point of
breakthrough in reforming political set-up not only complies with
popular feelings but creates a good social environment for relevant
political reform in other aspects, and this shows the political
wisdom of Chinese leaders."
</P>
<P>
According to Dong Fureng, a noted economist and a member of the
CPPCC National Committee, when economic basis undergoes changes,
the superstructure, including the way of how political power is
operated, should be adapted to such changes, and political
restructuring reforms, including those concerning government
institutions and their functions, are imperative.
</P>
<P>
With the Plan Concerning Institutional Restructuring of the
State Council approved by the ongoing session of top legislature
with overwhelming votes, a vital step has taken in this regard,
and some Chinese theoretical authorities reached consensus that
the current reform will crack the hard nut for China's overall
political restructuring.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua this morning, Xing explained that
the fundamental goal of political reform in China is to build a
democratic socialist country ruled by law.
</P>
<P>
"The arrow is ready to be released now that it has been put on
the bow," said Xing, who is concurrently the editor-in-chief of
Qiushi (seeking truth), a theoretical periodical of the CPC
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Without the restructuring, overstaffed government institutions
are hindrance to China's economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some new concepts reflected in the reform will be turned into
the new reality in the Party and state leadership system, Xing
said, and it will represent another important reform in the system
of the Party leadership and state power as well as another
breakthrough after the the life-long tenure of leading officials
was abrogated in 1982, Xing said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, it demonstrates the resolve of the central
government since it set forth such an unprecedented and detailed
institutional structural blueprint only six months after the 15th
CPC National Congress was convened.

<HEADLINE> China to Enact Law on Reporting Private Properties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China is to enact a new law
requiring government functionaries to report their private
properties to the government, according to Hu Kangsheng,
vice-chairman of the Subcommittee on Legislative Affairs of the
National People's Congress Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
This is intended to prevent government functionaries from
seeking personal gains by abusing their power and taking bribes,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Pending legislation on personal property reporting has touched
a responsive chord among Chinese lawmakers, who are here attending
an annual NPC session.
</P>
<P>
"In our struggle for a clean government, self-restraint on the
part of government functionaries is necessary, but there must also
be restraint from the outside, a law in this regard," said deputy
Feng Xichu, mayor of Xi'an City.
</P>
<P>
"Education on ethics and disciplinary measures alone are not
enough to curb corruption. We must crack down on corruption by
law," he said.
</P>
<P>
The reporting of personal properties and incomes by government
functionaries is not only an important democratic system but also
a key anti-corruption measure, commented other deputies.

<P>
Wang Jiaqiu acknowledged that "there are many difficulties
involved in the process of institutional restructuring, but
methods of coping with them can precisely enrich the contents of
China's political system." However, she said, in order to avoid
"the vacancy of functions", efforts will be intensified to foster
intermediary organizations and law-enforcement and supervision
departments while the government is in the process of shifting its
functions.
</P>
<P>
"Downsizing government institutions helps stop corruption,
whereas improving the system concerning civil servants is a major
guarantee for building a clean and honest government," she said.
</P>
<P>
Institutional reform is really the "most hard nut to crack" in
carrying out the country's in-depth political restructuring, she
once said, because it involves not only the redistribution of
power and interests but change of concepts in the people's mind,
ways of management method and the style of work."
</P>
<P>
The blueprint for institutional restructuring has "broken the
ice" and "opens navigation course" for overall political reform,
and then China's political reform will charge ahead like the "flow
of a turbulent river in spring time," Xing Bensi said.
</P>
<P>
As deputies to the ongoing the First Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), both Xing Bensi and Wang Jiaqiu
have outlined the future trends in China's political
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Xing held that the most crucial step in the next phase of
political restructuring is to improve democracy and legal system
and accomplish the administration of the state by law, and that
prime measures will precisely be adopted to enhance the
legislative and supervisory functions of the people's congresses,
and increase relations of mutual restrictions, which somewhat
resemble "checks and balance", among government organs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he added, the system of multi-party cooperation and
political consultations under the Communist Party leadership shall
be strengthened, so that the will of the state can incorporate the
aspirations of the people on a still more extensive scale.
</P>
<P>
"In promoting the process of political restructuring, China
will draw on some good experience of Western democracy instead of
copying it blindly," this theorist of great attainments said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Wang Jiaqiu acknowledged that the great set-up of
China's political system will remain unchanged. That is to say,
the entire system and framework will not be dismantled in the
course of the country's political institutional restructuring, but
the relevant restructuring will be advanced steadily and smoothly.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia Tuesday pledged to
continue its economic reforms, with or without the assistance fromaid he and oth
er officials will meet with an IMF
team here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia is ready to accept assistance from the IMF
and other countries but he regretted that a lot of
misunderstanding often occur.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia agreed in November last year to embrace an IMF reform
program in return for a 43-billion-U.S.-dollar aid package to
rescue its economy, crippled by the rapid decline of the rupiah
(national currency) against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF delayed its second tranche of assistance worth
3 billion dollars to Indonesia early this month because of the
"lack of reforms" in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since early February, the Indonesian government has repeatedly
said that it was preparing to set up a currency board, which would
peg the rupiah to a hard currency.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and other international monetary institutions opposed
the plan.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said the government is still in the stage of studying
the possibility of adopting a currency board to stabilize the
battered rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a better (solution to stabilize the rupiah), we
would do it," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Soeharto also instructed the ministers to
ensure enough food supplies and clothing, shelters and health
services for the people, Ginandjar said.

BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Over 94 percent of school-age
girls of Hui nationality in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region,
northwest China, attend schools, a local women's federation
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia, home to 1.7 million Hui people, has 600,000 girls of
Hui nationality, many of whom were unable to attend schools owing
to poverty and the trammel of old ideas, said Zhang Xiaosu,
chairwoman of the regional women's federation, who is here
attending the ongoing annual session of the National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, the regional government has spent 3
million yuan building 300 primary schools in the mountainous
southern Ningxia, she said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the regional government spends 500,000 yuan each
year as a special fund to help girls with financial difficulties
attend schools.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, several anti-illiteracy campaigns have
been launched on a regional scale, enabling 400,000 illiterates in
the region to learn to read and write, she said.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia still has an arduous task in providing education for
all owing to its weak economic foundation. In poverty-stricken
southern Ningxia, she said, 13,000 girls still fail to attend
schools, of whom 70 percent are of Hui nationality.

<HEADLINE> Bridal Photography Business Withers in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The bridal photography business
is withering in Shanghai, with more than 20 such shops
closing.
</P>
<P>
Bridal photography was most prosperous in 1996, with more than
100 companies soliciting newlyweds to take pictures.
</P>
<P>
However, the business declined in 1997. During the second half
of 1997, prices for a bridal photo were reduced by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey, overly high prices and an
obsession with making everyone look like stars led to its
unpopularity.

<HEADLINE> Chen Lu Confirms Her Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Former world champion and twice
Olympic bronze medalist Chen Lu confirmed here on Tuesday that
she has quit figure skating and will go to the United States for
study.
</P>
<P>
Chen, 21, who just returned from Nagano Olympic Games with a
bronze medal, said it was too old for a skater at her age.
</P>
<P>
"At 21, I think I have had no potential," said Chen, who won
the gold medal in the 1995 World Figure Skating Championships and
the silver the next year.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who began her figure skating career at four, said she
hoped to try best to offer a hand to the Chinese skaters whenever
necessary.
</P>
<P>
"Athough I have left the naitonal team, I will be a Chinese
for ever wherever I go," she said, "I hope I can give my
teammates some help in the future."
</P>
<P>
The former world Champion has been helping teammate Guo
Zhenxin polish his techniques these days before she leaves for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"She is a great skater. We'll miss her," said Guo, who
finished eighth in the men's individual event in the Nagano Games.
</P>
<P>
From world champion to the second-time Olympic bronze
medalist, Chen experienced dramatic ups and downs during the last
three years.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who made history by winning China's first medal in
Lillehammar Olympic Games in 1994, slipped into a long time slump
after being dethroned by American Michelle Kwan in the 1996 World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997 figure skating Worlds in Lausanne, Chen was
eliminated from free skating as she placed a distance 25th in the
short program, failing to qualify for the Nagano Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"It's a shock," Chen said. "It's hard for me to accept the
reality."
</P>
<P>
She attributed the defeat to the foot injury that she
sustained in 1995. But it was an open secret that the seperation
with her long-time coach Li Mingzhu had affected her normal
training and form.
</P>
<P>
"The past is past. I only want to say I should thank her
(Li)," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
But Chen, who was expected to vanish from the circuit after
the defeat in Lausanne, finally stepped out of the shadow.
</P>
<P>
"Back from Lausanne, I determined that I would never retire
unless winning a medal in the Nagano Olympic Games or the
following World Championships," Chen recalled.
</P>
<P>
Then she began a Spardan training. She went on a diet but
trained much harder than ever.
</P>
<P>
The former world champion grasped the final chance last
October, qualifying for the Nagano Games by wining the Olympic
qualifying round in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
She went to Nagano on a low note, reiterating that there would
be no hope for her to win a medal.
</P>
<P>
When the Olympic bronze medal eventually draped around her
neck, she was too emotional to control herself with tears bathing
her cheeks on the podium.
</P>
<P>
"It was not merely a bronze medal," Chen said. "I think I set
an example for all the skaters. As long as you keep working
hard, you are sure to succeed."

<HEADLINE> Gulf States Sign Protocol on Controlling Marine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the Kuwait-based
Regional Organization for Protection of Marine Environment
(ROPME) signed a protocol here Tuesday to control marine
transboundary movement and disposal of hazardous wastes.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA reported that the
document titled "Tehran Protocol" was signed by representatives
from eight countries bordering the Persian Gulf and it would
be implemented after being approved by the respective
parliaments.
</P>
<P>
However, the agency gave no details about the protocol.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Vice President and Head of the Environment Protection
Organization Masoumeh Ebtekar told the ROPME meeting Tuesday that
the signing of the protocol was a significant development in line
with the environmental protection and security of the region.
</P>
<P>
Regional cooperation will pave the way for further security in
the region without the need of foreign intervention, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
The first Iranian female vice president said that as a
consequence of expanded industrial and urban activities, the
world's oceans have been increasingly polluted and the marine
ecosystems are continuously threatened by the exploitation of
natural resources such as oil.
</P>
<P>
Despite international efforts and conventions, the
transboundary movement of hazardous substances is a serious
concern at the global level, she said. And this trend is
particularly disturbing when developed countries deploy their
hazardous wastes to developing countries, she added.
</P>
<P>
The ROPME region is particularly susceptible to environmental
pollution, Ebtekar said, adding that the daily deployment of more
than 100 ships, numerous port facilities and oil refineries all
exert a negative effect on the marine ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
The ROPME comprises Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman,
Iraq, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> 10,000 Textile Industry Spindles Destroyed in Qingdao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China's bloated textile industry
has undergone its second major cut this year, with 10,000 spindles
destroyed and melted today at Qingdao, a port city in East China's
Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 23, nearly 120,000 outdated spindles were melted in
Shanghai under the supervision by the China National Textile
Council (CNTC).
</P>
<P>
The destroyed spindles were manufactured 27 years ago. CNTC
officials attended the widely publicized event.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao plans to reduce 181,000 outdated spindles in two years,
laying off 10,000 textile workers.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao -- along with Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Jinan and
Dalian -- has been designated by CNTC to lead the country in
spindle reduction.
</P>
<P>
China plans to eliminate 10 million outdated spindles by the
end of the century, laying off 1.2 million workers. The target for
this year is to destroy 4.8 million spindles.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Record Low Birth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The birth rate in China was 16.57
per 1,000 in 1997, 5.54 lower than that of 1989, said Peng Peiyun,
minister in charge of the State Commission of Family Planning
(SCFP) today.
</P>
<P>
The total population, including Hong Kong, was 1.243 billion at
the end of 1997, according to SCFP statistics.
</P>
<P>
During the last decade SCFP has been focusing its work on
residents in rural areas, especially those in remote and poor
areas, and trying to help them understand the need to reduce
family size, Peng told an ongoing national conference on family
planning, which opened in Beijing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
She said family planning departments at all levels have also
provided people with safer and more effective methods of
contraception and birth control.
</P>
<P>
SCFP has taken such measures as providing education and
services of reproductive health care nationwide and giving proper
sex education to youngsters to improve the health level of the
nation,
</P>
<P>
The country's investment in family planning has increased by
6.6 billion yuan (550,000 U.S. dollars) during the 1991-1995
period, up 127 percent than the 1986-1990 period, Peng said,
adding that SFPC has suggested to the central government doubling
the per capita family planning budget by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Daily Calls for Revision of Election Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran's moderate daily newspaper
Iran News Tuesday called for a revision of the country's election
laws to cancel the right of the Constitutional Guardians Council
(CGC) to disqualify any candidates.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Majlis by-elections held last Friday, the
daily said in its editorial that "it appears to have been far
wiser for the Guardians Council to have permitted the disqualified
candidates to compete for the Parliament."
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, the majority of rejected hopefuls had either been
deputies (Majlis members) before, or held sensitive posts after
the victory of the Revolution (in 1979) or in recent years," the
daily said, adding that CGC's rule was one of the main reasons for
the low turnout in the by-elections on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Many left-wing factions lodged strong protest against the
rejection of their hopefuls for the Majlis by-elections and
called on their followers not to participate in the polling.
</P>
<P>
"A statistic analysis of voters during the fifth Majlis shows
that on March 9, 1996, more than 2,444,000 voters turned out in
Tehran, whereas on March 13, 1998, only 273,000 voters cast their
ballots," the pro-leftwing newspaper noted.
</P>
<P>
The rejection of several left-wing candidates for the
by-elections triggered a violent factional clash in a rally in
front of Tehran University early this month, and put the right of
the Guardians Council to disqualify candidates under question.
</P>
<P>
Former Iranian Majlis Speaker Mehdi Karubi also openly
challenged the Constitutional Guardians Council (CGC) over its
right to disqualify candidates for the country's elections,
saying that the country's election laws did not authorize the
CGC to approve or reject the qualifications of any candidate but
only empowered it to generally supervise elections.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the left-wing factions demanded to
nullify the CGC's right to disqualify candidates in order to pave
the grounds for the success in the forthcoming elections for the
country's Experts Assembly later this year.
</P>
<P>
After the elections of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami last
May, the elections of the Experts Assembly would be sensitive for
both the left and right wings since the 83-member body has the
right to determine the fate of the country's supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said that the Iranian Majlis would discuss the
issue of revising election laws at the beginning of the new fiscal
year starting on March 21.

<HEADLINE> A Confident China Pursuing Bolder Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- With progresses made in
step-by-step reforms in the last two decades, China is more
confident than ever in solving problems by continuing to carry out
reforms, and bolder ones at that.
</P>
<P>
Enhanced confidence is demonstrated at the on-going session of
the National people's Congress, China's parliament, when it
approved a reform program last week to restructure and downsize
the central government.
</P>
<P>
This confidence is a reflection of broad popular support for
continued reforms, including the government restructuring program.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging there are still many tough problems to be
resolved, deputies to the NPC session believe that accelerating
reforms can help address the problems, which, in turn, is
conducive to maintaining economic growth and social stability.
</P>
<P>
The way the Chinese government has been dealing with the Asian
financial turmoil has convinced deputies that the central
leadership is competent and skillful in regulating the national
economy and coordinating relations between reform, development and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Lu Xueyi, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, spoke highly of the central government's macro-economic
controls over recent years, which have successfully brought down
inflation while managing to achieve a high economic growth rate.
</P>
<P>
"The achievements are impressive, " said Lu. "We have every
reason to trust such a leadership."
</P>
<P>
Deputies naturally expect much from the central authorities on
issues they are most concerned about: state enterprise reform,
reemployment of laid-off workers, risks in the banking sector,
corruption and public security.
</P>
<P>
To their relief, the central government generally is paying
adequate attention to all of the problems and taking corresponding
measures.
</P>
<P>
He Shulan, a construction worker from northeastern Heilongjiang
Province, said about half of the workers in her work unit have
left their work, but no one has ever tried to make trouble with
the factory management.
</P>
<P>
"They realize that a market economy means competition, which
will result in losers as well as winners," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to find jobs for themselves and some of them
have succeeded," He said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu Xueyi of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
if workers' proper understanding of being laid off represents
grassroots support for economic reform, the move to restructure
and downsize the government should be seen as a reform move
initiated from upper above,
</P>
<P>
"The existing administrative structure has proved to be a
hindrance to economic reform," said Lu. "The government
restructuring is not only timely but also the only path the
country can take to deepen reforms."
</P>
<P>
As pointed out by a senior Chinese official,"Reform cannot
be free of risks or resistance, but it is the only way out and
there is no turning back."

<HEADLINE> Macao Gasoline Price Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The price for gasoline products
dropped slightly here Tuesday, following a similar move earlier in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The price for lead-free gasoline, industrial asphalt and black
asphalt dropped by 0.10 patacas to 0.13 patacas (1.25 U.S. cents
to 1.63 cents) per liter, or 1.66 percent to 4.27 percent.
</P>
<P>
The price cut was made by the Macao Oil Business Association,
who followed a world tide of price drop of oil products. The
previous price cut was in January.
</P>
<P>
After the cut, the price for lead-free gas will be for the first
time lower than the leaded gas, with a very slight gap. The
environment-friendly gas is being increasingly widely used in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Macao now has about 80,000 vehicles running, against its
overall population of 420,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Over 70 percent of crops in
Namibia have been ruined due to the El Nino phenomenon and more
damage was expected if dry weather continues, a national farmers'
association said.
</P>
<P>
Namibian farmers would lose all their harvest this year if
there is no good rains within two weeks and the country's annual
yield could be decimated if it failed to rain at all, the
Agricultural Producer's Association said.
</P>
<P>
Officials said this year's drought, which has hit all farmers
from drought-resistant cotton, sorghum to mahangu growers, could
be compared with that in 1992, when the government was forced to
seek drought relief aid.
</P>
<P>
Mahangu crops in northern Namibia have started to wither and
farmers began to panic, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Grazing hit snags and water for animals was also running out
as some districts had not received rain since early March, the

<HEADLINE> 2,100-year-old Lotus Soup A Clue to Earthquake Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A pot of lotus soup dating back
2,100 years has given scientists evidence that a southern Chinese
city has been relatively earthquake-free since then.
</P>
<P>
The soup, with slices of lotus root, was found intact in a
lacquer, three-legged pot among more than 1,000 luxury articles
buried with the wife of a minister of Changsha State in the early
Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-24 A.D.). The find was made 20 years
ago in Mawangdui, an eastern suburb of Changsha in Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
When the pot was taken to the city museum from the excavation
site, the slices of lotus root had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
"The fibre organization of the lotus root had rotted in the
long period of time, leaving only the outer structure which
vanished quickly after the inevitable shaking during the move,"
scientists explained.
</P>
<P>
The scientists inferred that few earthquake had shaken Changsha
in the last 2,000 years or else the slices of lotus root would
have vanished long ago. That theory was recently confirmed by
Chinese seismologists.
</P>
<P>
According to the seismologists, Changsha suffered only 11
earthquakes in the 1,700 years from 209 B.C. to 1980 A.D. None of
them was strong enough to cause obvious damage, or stronger than
4.75 on the Richter scale.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Help Vietnam Draw Plan Required by APEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will assist Vietnam
in drawing up an individual action plan required by the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), Malaysian Minister of
International Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia will also help Vietnam with the preparation of the
Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) list that is required
by the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) scheme, the minister told
reporters after her meeting with three Vietnamese ministers
accompanying President Tran Duc Luong on a visit here.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam became a member of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) in 1995 and is expected to be admitted into APEC
during the informal meeting of APEC leaders to be held here in
November.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said Malaysia's assistance in both areas will be
speeded up following her meeting with Vietnamese Minister of
Planning and Investment Tran Xuan Gia, Minister of Trade Truong
Dinh Tyuen and Industrial Minister Dang Vu Chu.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is the seventh largest investor in Vietnam. As of
December 31, 1997, Vietnam had approved 64 Malaysian projects with
a total capital outlay of 1.35 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Total trade between the two countries in 1997 stood at 1.356
billion ringgit (about 358.73 million dollars) compared to 1.191

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Macao External Trade Brisk in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Macao's imports and exports
business saw a brisk increase in 1997 despite an economic
slowdown, achieving a record trade surplus of 526 million patacas
(about 65.75 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Macao had reported trade deficits for years, but that reversed
in 1997. The latest figures from the Macao Census and Statistics
Department show that the value of exported goods reached 17.1
billion patacas (about 2.1375 billion dollars), up 7.7 percent
from that in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The value of imports was 16.6 billion patacas (about 2.075
billion dollars), up 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase in exports was due mainly to a surge in the
exports of garments and textile goods, which accounted for 85
percent of all exports last year.
</P>
<P>
That indicates Macao's exports have become increasingly
dependent on garments and textile goods, which mainly went to the
United States and the European Union, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The traditional export items, like toys, cement, machinery and
equipment, have been gradually dying out as their proportion
dropped to the minimum.
</P>
<P>
Sales to the United States rose by 1.3 billion patacas (about
162.5 million dollars), up 20.8 percent from 1996. The exports to
the European Union climbed 5.2 percent, an increase of 34.5
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the economic slowdown starting three years ago have
hit Macao's consumption. Although Macao bought more capital goods,
fuel and lubricating oil, raw materials and semi-finished goods,
the imports of consumer goods last year dropped 0.2 percent
compared with 1996.
</P>
<P>
Most of Macao's imported goods came from the Asian-Pacific
region, which supplied about 80 percent of the imports. While
goods from China's inland grew 24.2 percent, from Taiwan 9.6
percent and from South Korea 0.9 percent, the imports from Japan,
Hong Kong and Australia dropped as much as 15.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Macao bought 11 percent more goods from the United
States in 1997, but imports from the European Union declined six
percent.
</P>
<P>
A leading economic sector for Macao, external trade will most
likely suffer a blow in 1998 as there is no indication the
financial turmoil in Asia is ending, experts predict.

<HEADLINE> Russia Far East Seeks Trade Opportunities in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia's largest business
delegation ever to visit Hong Kong, seeking opportunities for
economic and trade cooperation, made a presentation of the
Khabarovsk Territory located in the center of Russia's Far East
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center, Alexander Levintal, head of the delegation and
deputy governor of the Khabarovsk Territory, said that whoever
wants to carry out mutually beneficial cooperation with the region
will be welcome.
</P>
<P>
The Khabarovsk Territory, one of the largest regions in Russia,
is among the best developed areas in the Russian Far East, he
said, adding that it has established direct contacts with some
Chinese provinces like Heilongjiang and Liaoning, the American
states of Alaska and Oregon, the Japanese prefectures of Hyogo,
Aomori and Hokkaido, and also with some provinces of South Korea
and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The Khabarovsk Territory is rich in diverse natural resources
-- land, water, timber and other inland and marine biological
resources, and also numerous useful minerals. About 30 percent of
the Far East industrial potential is based in the territory,
including about a half of the mechanical engineering and chemical
enterprises, big facilities of timber cutting and processing
industry, Levintal said.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Russian Trade Association in Hong Kong Peter
Gordon told Xinhua that the seminar, accompanied by a related
photo exhibition, was the largest discussion ever organized by his
association in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Hong Kong remains an international trade and
financial center, Gordon said an increasing number of Russians
will come here to seek opportunities for cooperation not only in
the fields of trade and investment but also in joint manufacturing
and bilateral tourism.

<HEADLINE> HK's Air Cargo Import Throughput Surges in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The volume of inbound cargo
passing through Kai Tak International Airport surged by 25.2
percent to 50,558 tons in February this year compared with the
same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The figures were released by the Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals
Limited (HACTL) here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Charter, managing director of the air cargo operator,
attributed the increase to an unusual rise in the quantities of
fresh fruit and seafood imported from Thailand last month.
</P>
<P>
"We think this is due to the weaker baht and possibly
alternative food sources because of the bird flu scare," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, in the long term, "we would expect the growth in
imports to be more gradual, month-on-month and without such
striking surges," he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that total air cargo handled by the HACTL
in February amounted to 104,992 tons, 10.3 percent more than a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
This includes a fall of 1 percent to 40,050 tons in export
cargo and a 0.1-percent increase to 14,384 tons in transshipment
goods.
</P>
<P>
A modest increase of 3.1 percent has also been registered in
air freight throughput so far this year over a year ago, according
to the figures.

HONG KONG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong began to stage for
the first time an exhibition of Icelandic art Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Icelandic Paintings of the 20th Century" in the Provisional
Urban Council's Museum of Art features 49 paintings by 28 artists.
</P>
<P>
The works cover a variety of subject matters and techniques.
They include figurative paintings portraying Icelandic landscapes
and people, and testify to the great diversity of contemporary
Icelandic art.
</P>
<P>
They display different artistic styles such as abstract art,
abstract expressionism, geometric abstraction, pop art, new
realism and minimal art "to express their vision and reflect both
new artistic concepts and traditional culture", said Provisional
Urban Councilor Ada Wong Ying-kay.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has always served as a bridge for Chinese and Western
cultural exchanges, Wong said. Through this exhibition, "Hong
Kong people can broaden their horizon as well as deepen their
understanding of European art and culture," she added.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is jointly presented by the Provisional Urban
Council and the Consulate of Iceland in Hong Kong and co-organized

<HEADLINE> Design Contracts for HK's West Rail Project Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kowloon-Canton Railway
Corporation (KCRC) signed here on Tuesday five contracts totaling
one billion HK dollars (128.2 million U.S. dollars) for the
detailed design of Hong Kong's giant West Rail project.
</P>
<P>
KCRC Chairman K.Y. Yeung described the signing of the contracts
as a big step forward for the project.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good news not only to the people of Hong Kong whom
West Rail will serve, but also to those in the design and
construction industry," Yeung said at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The start of the West Rail Phase I project will certainly be a
stimulant to the industry in view of the slowdown of the local
economy and the near completion of the new airport, he said.
</P>
<P>
More contracts for West Rail will be awarded later this year as
the project moves forward. After the railway scheme is approved
by the Executive Council (ExCo) of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region around September this year, the KCRC will be
able to award the first construction contract for West Rail --
the design and build contract for one of the two major tunnels --
in the fourth quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The detailed design works under the five contracts are expected
to be completed early next year.
</P>
<P>
The ExCo has endorsed a draft Project Agreement between the
KCRC and the government on the implementation of the West Rail
project. The two-phase project, when completed, will provide
railway links between urban Kowloon and the northwestern part of
the "New Territories," where population is growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
It is also designed to provide cross-boundary passenger and
freight services by connecting the railway network in Shenzhen of
South China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Phase I of the project is scheduled to be put into operation
before the end of 2003, with an estimated total cost of 64 billion
HK dollars (8.21 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Detailed arrangements for Phase II are still under study and
discussion by the KCRC and the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government pledged to provide Mozambican authorities with
whatever assistance they required in their gun smuggling
investigations of Foreign Affairs official Robert Mcbride, the
Business Day reported.
</P>
<P>
A top-level delegation led by South African Safety and
Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi Monday met the Mozambican
interior minister and the deputy foreign minister to discuss the
case of Mcbride.
</P>
<P>
South Africa confirmed that the two governments were of "one
mind" on the need for a thorough investigation into the matter,
the report quoted a statement issued after the meeting as saying.
</P>
<P>
South Africa pledged not to interfere in the due process of
Mozambican law, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
But it would "willingly give" Mozambican authorities any
assistance they needed, because it was "just as interested" in
the outcome of the case, it said.
</P>
<P>
Mcbride, a South African foreign affairs director in charge of
the Asian desk, is now in jail for the seventh day in Mozambique
Tuesday after being arrested for suspected arms dealing last
Monday.
</P>
<P>
A Star paper report said the high-level delegation, including
South African Police Service (SAPS) Commissioner George Fivaz,
Secret Service director-general Billy Masetla and South Africa's
ambassador to the Organization of African Unity Welile Nhlapo,
had attempted to persuade Mozambican authorities to swiftly
charge or release Mcbride.
</P>
<P>
It said Mufamadi would brief President Nelson Mandela and his
deputy Thabo Mbeki Tuesday on the controversy surrounding the
case.
</P>
<P>
A Mozambican judge has ruled that Mcbride be held until the
police are ready to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad will fly to
Maputo Tuesday for further discussions.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Bank of America, the second
largest bank holding company in the United States, has launched a
new consumer Internet service, targeting at home buyers.
</P>
<P>
The new HomeWorth Service, an interactive tool to the bank's
Web site, allows consumers to obtain home sales and price
information, along with other data, for specific properties and
general neighborhoods located throughout the country's 21 states.
</P>
<P>
Information includes sales date, sales price, square footage,
year built, number of bedrooms and bathrooms and other property
features.
</P>
<P>
Consumers can order a more detailed online report listing up to
30 percent property sales that were completed in the last 12
months within a half-mile radius of the address they entered in
the system.
</P>
<P>
Visitors can first access the bank's Web site and from there
click on the HomeWorth logo to access the service. From the bank's
award-winning Web site visitors can obtain information about home
equity loans, as well as an online mortgage application form,
current mortgage interest and information about how to set up and
finance a home office.

December 31, 1997, the bank had a mortgage serving portfolio of
almost 90 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Rise on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to rise
on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials
Index (STII) gained 16.47 points to close at 1621.26 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said stocks finished higher with several property
stocks and blue chip stocks chalking up the biggest price gains on
moderate institutional buying. Strong demand for a real estate
project by Keppel Land revived interest in property issues, they
said.
</P>
<P>
But they were quick to add that the standoff between the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Indonesia and uncertainty
about whether Indonesia will be implementing a currency board plan
continued to weigh down on sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume increased to 339 million units, valued
at 592.72 million Singapore dollars (about 368.15 million U.S.
dollars). Advances overtook declines by 224 to 107, while 280
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Telecom was the most actively traded stock as it
registered a turnover of 83.88 million units. It was followed by
IPC Corporation which had 18.16 million shares traded. Renong Bhd
was next with 13.68 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Jardine Matheson Holdings (JMH) 400 led the gainers of the day
as it rose by 40 cents to finish at 4.9 U.S. dollars. DBS
(Development Bank of Singapore) Foreign, Elec and F&AMP;N increased by
30 cents each to end at 12.6 Singapore dollars, 6.15 U.S. dollars
and 7 Singapore dollars respectively. OCBC (Overseas Chinese
Banking Corporation) Foreign was up by 25 cents to close at 8.75
Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Creative 50 and M. Banking 200 shared the top
spot on the losers' list as each of them declined by 20 cents to
end at 36.6 and 5.4 Singapore dollars respectively. Robinson and
VICOM fell by 15 cents each to close at 5.1 and 0.4 Singapore
dollars respectively.

<HEADLINE> SADC Leaders to Bid Farewell to Masire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) will meet in Gaborone
Wednesday to bid farewell to Botswanan President Ketumile Masire
before his retirement on March 31.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) Tuesday quoted informed
sources as reporting that the 13 presidents
will arrive in Gaborone, capital of Botswana, to participate
in a ceremony and a banquet to bid their colleague farewell.
</P>
<P>
Part of the ceremony will see Masire planting a tree at the
SADC House, headquarters of the organization, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
SADC information spokesman Kgosinkwe Moesi ruled out SADC
leaders discussing business matters during their one-day stay,
saying "This is not a working meeting."
</P>
<P>
Masire, 72, is to step down on March 31 after being at the
helm of Botswana for the past 18 years. Prior to that, he was
vice-president for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
Masire took over the presidency on the death in 1980 of
Seretse Khama, who ruled Botswana since independence from Britain
in 1966.
</P>
<P>
Masire, a former primary school teacher and part-time farmer,
served as SADC chairman from 1980 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to his leadership, Botswana has been in a sound
economic condition. Since the discovery of diamonds in the early
1970s, Botswana has been transformed from a barren desert into
one of the richest countries on the African continent.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President to Meet U.N. Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
will meet Thursday with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan who is
due in Cairo Wednesday on his first visit to Egypt since he took
helm at the world organization on January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss a number of important issues, mainly the
Mideast peace process, the latest developments of the
situation in Iraq and relations between Egypt and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The Arabic daily Al Ahram quoted well-informed diplomatic
sources at the U.N. as saying that Mubarak's talks with Annan will
focus on the U.N. role in pushing forward the peace process and
the importance of activating its role in quest of clearing the
Middle East of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
They will also exchange views on the issue of U.N.-imposed
sanctions on Libya, the situation in Somalia and other issues.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit here, Annan will hold talks
Wednesday with Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid the latest regional and
international developments and envisaged U.N. reform.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief, who will also visit Syria, Lebanon, Israel, the
Palestinian self-rule area and Jordan on a nine-day Mideast
trip, reportedly carries a specific U.S. peace plan to
breathe life into the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The new peace initiative to be unveiled by U.S. President Bill
Clinton is aimed at unblocking the peace logjam through direct
U.S. involvement, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson
told the London-based daily Al Hayat.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that Annan, with a deal at hand to ease the
Iraq-U.N. arms inspection crisis, will confer with regional
leaders the implementation of the U.N resolutions on the
decades-long Arab-Israeli conflicts and cooperation between these
countries and the world body.
</P>
<P>
Annan, a Ghanadian, who had been working with the United
Nations for 30 years, is the first U.N. chief to assume the office
from inside.
</P>
<P>
On New Year's Day in 1997, Annan, U.N. under-secretary-general
at that time, replaced former secretary-general Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, an Egyptian who retired at the end of his five-year
term.

<HEADLINE> S. African Truckers to Intensify Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's transport
sector faces further disruption as strike by truck drivers
nationwide picks up momentum Tuesday and bus drivers plan to join
them in two days' time.
</P>
<P>
A freight union spokesman predicted a 100 percent disruption
in the road and freight sector Tuesday as seven unions, which
represent more than 40,000 workers across the country, planned to
intensify their protests to back up their wage demands, The Star
paper reported.
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 workers are expected to gather in Johannesburg
Tuesday and march to the industry's National Bargaining Council
to hand in a memorandum of their demands.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of truck drivers embarked on a strike Monday in
Johannesburg following last Friday's deadlock in labor-management
talks over wage increases and other benefits. There were reports
of violence during their march across the city.
</P>
<P>
The workers rejected employers' final subsistence allowances
and minimum wage offers ranging from 11.5 to 18 percent, saying
that their job, which means a lot hours on the road, high risks
of being hijacked and little time to be with their families,
deserves higher pay and better working conditions.
</P>
<P>
A parallel meeting in the Commission for Conciliation,
Mediation and Arbitration, the first since the parties
deadlocked, is scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the industrial action may peak on Thursday
when more than 20,000 bus drivers stage a strike in major parts
of the country if wage negotiations fail. The bus drivers are
demanding a 10.5 percent wage rise and employers are offering 7.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The strike could affect bus commuter services to more than 6.2
million people around the country, including the major
metropolitan centers.

JOHANNESBURG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Girls as young as eight
years old have been found working as prostitutes in certain
hotels in inner-city Johannesburg, local daily Sowetan reported
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Child prostitutes have added to the growing forms of
exploitation of children in South Africa, the newspaper quoted a
report by the Network Against Child Labor (NACL) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Of the 400,000 estimated child workers in South Africa, some
were girls who were forced or sold into prostitution in different
parts of the country, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Others between the age of 13 and 18 were working in Pretoria
and Midrand, a city between Pretoria and Johannesburg, as
prostitute.
</P>
<P>
Jackie Loffel, an official of the Johannesburg Child Welfare
Society, said child labor was another form of child abuse in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
She said a large number of boys, particularly those seeking to
survive on the streets, were among those drawn into prostitution.
</P>
<P>
The NACL has organized a national campaign to mobilize action
against injustice contributing to child labor. The campaign
includes a national march due to start in Cape Town on March 21.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey indicated that a
mere 8.2 percent Chinese respondents purchase foreign goods on a
regular basis, with a much higher percentage indicating a
preference for foreign brands.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 5,138 families in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou
revealed that 33.1 percent of respondents occasionally purchase
foreign goods, with some 36.1 percent rarely and 21.2 percent
never purchasing related items.

<P>
A breakdown of age groups revealed that people over 55
represented the highest proportion of respondents expressing
dislike for foreign brands.
</P>
<P>
In terms of professional status, executives working in the
non-state and private sectors were the most avid shoppers for
foreign goods, followed by executives working for state
enterprises. The figures indicated that higher preference levels
are determined by higher income levels.
</P>
<P>
Some 87.8 percent of respondents cited better quality as the
reason for purchasing foreign brand names, with 59.3 percent
noting their hesitancy to purchase same things on higher price.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Ministers Asked to Donate to Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
Tuesday asked all his ministers to donate their one-year basic
salary to help the government's poverty alleviation program.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto himself pledged to donate his basic salary
and other allowances to the poverty alleviation program,
Minister/State Secretary Saadilah Mursyid told the press following
the first cabinet meeting of the newly-appointed ministers at the
Bina Graha here.
</P>
<P>
"I receive pension and that is enough for me. Therefore, I am
giving all my salary to the program," Soeharto, who chaired the
meeting, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official salary of a cabinet minister is around 4 million
rupiah (at present, one U.S. dollar equals 9,000 to 10,000 rupiah)
per month.
</P>
<P>
According to Soeharto, the fund may be used to help run small
food kiosks by people who have been laid off from their jobs
recently because of the current monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
During the one-hour meeting, Soeharto explained to his
ministers the country's latest economic situation and its
connection to the Washington-based International Monetary Fund
(IMF), Saadilah said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been hit badly by the monetary crisis since July
last year, with its currency, the rupiah, having lost about 80
percent of its value against the U.S. dollar. As a result of the
monetary turmoil, the country has been facing spiraling inflation,
growing unemployment and other serious economic and social
problems.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the economic difficulties, the Indonesian
government agreed in November last year to embrace IMF reforms in
return for a 43 billion U.S. dollar global aid package.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF delayed its second tranche worth 3 billion
dollars in assistance to Indonesia because of the so-called lack
of reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Soeharto also asked all his ministers to
declare their personal wealth and that of their respective
spouses.
</P>
<P>
"All ministers were asked to itemize their personal wealth,
including properties and assets," Information Minister Alwi Dahlan
said.
</P>
<P>
Saadilah said all governors are also required to make the same
report to the president.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's seventh cabinet was formed last Saturday by
President Soeharto who was reelected to his seventh term of office
at the general session of the people's Consultative Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The 36-member cabinet will serve a five-year term from 1998 to
2003.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- France's far-right National Front (FN) is trying to lead
astray the most vulnerable elements of the rightwing opposition of
RPR and UDF in an operation of seduction.
</P>
<P>
The FN is making moderate proposals for shifting the votes it
has won in the regional elections to the opposition, in order to
sow seeds of trouble within the PRP and UDF, which have excluded
an alliance with the far-right.
</P>
<P>
-- Thirty years after the 1968 extreme-leftist movement in
France, the extreme-leftists of the country are now coming up as an
electoral force by winning 4.35 percent of the votes in the regional
elections on Sunday, against 1.2 percent they won six years ago.
</P>
<P>
The extreme-left Lutte Ouvriere will take 20 seats in regional
councils, half of them in the northern region of
Nord-Pas-de-Calais and in the Paris region, while another
extreme-left group the LCR will have three seats.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The far-right National Front will play the role of arbitrator
in the election of president in eight regional parliaments on
Friday. The FN president Jean-Marie Le Pen has made a minimum
proposal on socio-economic policy to the opposition RPR and UDF in
exchange for support.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party has warned the opposition against an
alliance with the FN.
</P>
<P>
-- Will Robin Cook, the British Foreign Secretary, walk the steps
of Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Cook seems determined to play an active role in saving the
Mideast peace process by deciding to visit the Arab part of
Jerusalem on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Economy Grows Only 1.9 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel's gross domestic product
(GDP) for 1997 rose 1.9 percent compared with the around 4 percent
in 1996, according to figures published by the Central Bureau of
Statistics (CBS) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure suggests that the recession of the Israel's economy
is deepening.
</P>
<P>
For the second half of 1997, there was a shrinking in
investments and a significant slowdown in activities in the
industrial and building sectors in Israel.
</P>
<P>
CBS said that the per capita GDP fell 0.5 percent in 1997 after
rising 1.8 percent in 1996 and 4.2 percent in 1995. The per capita
GDP for 1997 stood at 16,571 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The CBS noted that the decline in the product per capita is
worrisome. It has also become evident that per capita private
consumption rose only 0.9 percent in 1997, compared to 2.6 percent
in 1996 and 4.6 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Senior Finance Ministry officials were reportedly surprised by
the extent of the decline in investment and growth rate in the
second half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
They estimated that there will be only 1 to 1.5 percent growth
in 1998, much less than the 3 percent set in the state budget.
</P>
<P>
CBS economists also noted that Israel's economic performance
this year is not as good as expected and January-February figures
do not indicate a revival in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
They attributed this to the economic adjustment policy of the
current government aimed at cutting overspending and privatization.
</P>
<P>
But others also pointed out that the stalled peace process is
another major reason hindering Israel's economic development,
resulting in sharp decline of foreign investments in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Motorola to Produce Copper Chips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Motorola company announced
Monday that it has completed testing of its first silicon wafers
utilizing copper technology, which will lead to production later
this year.
</P>
<P>
Engineers at Motorola's Semiconductor Products Sector, based in
Austin, Texas, completed the testing wafers, and prototypes in
various applications were now underway, according to reports from
the company.
</P>
<P>
In September last year, Motorola said it had developed a
technique that replaced aluminum wiring with copper interconnects
in integrated circuits, resulting in smaller and faster chips.
</P>
<P>
Called a dual-inlaid metallization technique, the process takes
advantage of copper's higher conductivity than aluminum to provide
smaller, thinner interconnects. Copper also has greater
resistance to electro-migration.

<HEADLINE> Computer Maker Has Global Ambition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Legend Group, a computer giant in
China, strives to rank among the world's top 10 information
technology firms in a decade, according to Legend President Liu
Chuanzhi.
</P>
<P>
At the present stage, Legend is to concentrate efforts on
expanding its domestic market share and gradually shift its
emphasis onto the international market, says Liu, who is here
attending the going annual session of the National People's
Congress, China's top lawmaking body.
</P>
<P>
Legend was set up in 1984 by 11 technicians in Beijing with an
initial capital of 200,000 yuan. It has been the largest desk-top
PC maker in China since 1996 with a domestic market share of 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
Its business turnover was 12.5 billion yuan last year and is
expected to reach 18 billion yuan this year, Liu says.
</P>
<P>
"Legend plans to raise its annual turnover to 3 billion US
dollars by the year 2000 to rank among the world's top 50 computer
firms," he says. "We aim to rank among the world's top ten by the
year 2008."
</P>
<P>
The PC maker has been exporting computer motherboards
to more than 40 countries and regions in the world, with its
total sales ranking fifth place in the world.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, it is possible that demand for PCs in China will reach
10 million a year to become the second biggest PC market in the
world, next only to the United States, he says.
</P>
<P>
At present, home-made computers enjoy a competitive edge over
imports on the domestic market thanks to their good performance
and low prices, he says.
</P>
<P>
"However," he adds, "Chinese PC producers should bring their
advantages into full play and offset their disadvantages,
especially in product development."

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka Parliament Debates Civil Rights Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's parliament Tuesday
began a debate on a motion to deprive former minister Wijepala
Mendis of the United National Party (UNP) of his civil rights for
seven years and expel him from Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Mendis, who is the Chief Opposition Whip, was found guilty last
March of abuse and misuse of power by a Special Presidential
Commission which recommended that he be made subject to civil
disability for seven years and be expelled from Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The law requires a majority of two-thirds to pass the motion,
which government will not be able to muster without the support of
the main opposition UNP.
</P>
<P>
The debate, which was broadcast live over the Sri Lankan
broadcasting Corporation (SLBC), started at 10:00 a.m. (local
time). But the UNP is staging a boycott of Parliament for one
month from March 3 protesting against the erosion of democratic
institutions.
</P>
<P>
In presenting the motion which stood in the name of Prime
Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the Leader of the House Ratnasiri
Wickremanayake said there was no malice against anyone in moving
the motion and all they wanted to do was to clean up society.
</P>
<P>
Ceylon Workers Congress R. Yoganathan said his community
(estate workers of Indian origin) had suffered for forty years
without civil rights. They believed nobody should be deprived of
civil rights and nobody had the right to remove the civil rights
from anybody else. It was worse than a murder sentence.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Planning Samaraweera Weerawanni and Deputy
Minister of Transport Athauda Seneviratne also supported the
motion.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Stronger Baht Arouses Mixed Sentiments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Thai baht Monday rebounded to
a four-month high of 39.80 baht to the U.S. dollar before slipping
slightly. But the stronger baht aroused mixed sentiments among the
country's exporters.
</P>
<P>
The baht slipped slightly after reaching 39.80 to close at
40.40/40.60 compared with 41.00/41.20 last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers and analysts attributed the appreciation of the baht to
the successful visit to the United States by Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai.
</P>
<P>
Besides, good indicators in the market also helped the currency
to strengthen. Among them were the announcement by the Customs
Department that exports were up 90 percent year on year in baht
terms and 14 percent in dollar terms, and last week's fourth
consecutive monthly current account surplus.
</P>
<P>
However, the currency's rise in turn worried exporters, who
were afraid of a rapid appreciation would hurt the industry and
cut competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Vanida Kulkumthorn, executive director of the Thai Garment
Manufacturers Association, said the quick appreciation of the baht
over the past two to three trading days has already affected
exporters, especially in sectors which have high import contents
such as textiles.
</P>
<P>
The currency fluctuations made it difficult to quote new
contracts due to greater uncertainty over the currency's value,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Most contracts written earlier, which take four to five months
to fulfill, were based on 45 baht per dollar. Under those
conditions, exporters lose money when the baht appreciates
significantly.
</P>
<P>
Vanida also said that rapid currency fluctuations will also
hurt exporters' liquidity as a stronger baht means higher prices
for Thai products in the world markets, which will reduce the
competitiveness of the country's exporters.
</P>
<P>
According to foreign bank officials, exporters who have foreign
debts will benefit from the situation. But they will also get less
export income at the same time.
</P>
<P>
For the economy as a whole, the appreciation of baht is mostly
welcomed, since a strengthening baht will lead to increased
confidence among foreign investors and the return of capital.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Thailand Governor Chaiyawat Wilbulswasdi said the
increased stability of the baht could allow interest rates to
gradually come down in the middle of the year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor said lending rates would likely
reduce to around 15 to 16 percent from the current 20 percent,
while deposit rates to 13 percent from 16 percent now.
</P>
<P>
Thai businesses have complained bitterly of high interest
rates, which they say are driving them into bankruptcy.
</P>

Despite the baht's rise, analysts warn that it could be the
lull before the storm as foreign debt repayments are expected to
come due in April, June and July.
</P>
<P>
So far, it is hard to predict what level the baht should stand
at. The country must be patient to follow the direction of the
baht's move.

<HEADLINE> Australia Welcomes Sugar Quota Increase to US Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Australia will be allowed to
export an extra 16,000 tons of sugar to the United States this
year following an increase in the U.S. sugar import quota,
Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister Tim Fischer
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This is welcome news for Australian sugar exporters," Fisher
said.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in Australian access results from a 200,000 ton
increase in the U.S. global import quota for the year ending
September, 1998," the deputy prime minister said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Australia is the United States' fourth largest source of
imported sugar, behind the Dominican Republic, Brazil, and the
Philippines. The market access for Australia this year will now be
109,699 tons.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said Australia remained concerned over the limited
access offered to the U.S. market, and that Australia's original
quota for 1997-1998 had been cut by 40 percent from the previous
financial year.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the U.S. global quota followed a periodic
assessment of the U.S. stocks-use ratio for sugar.

<HEADLINE> Survey Exposes Worsening Economic Situation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- One fifth of Palestinians are
living in poverty as the Palestinian economy has worsened since
the 1993 signing of peace deals with Israel, a survey said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by Palestinian Economics and Trade
Ministry and World Bank, said that about 500,000, or 19.1 percent,
of the 2.5 million Palestinian population are living under the
poverty line of 650 U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
The study attributed the worsening situation to the frequent
closures Israel has imposed on the Palestinian self-rule areas,
which restricted the movement of goods and people and caused a
slowdown in the private sector and labor market.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Palestinians who worked in Israel have
been affected by the closures. The number of laborers working in
Israel dropped from 116,000 in 1993 to 28,000 in 1997, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, unemployment in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has
almost doubled since 1993, rising to 28.4 percent in 1997 from
18.2 percent in 1995. World Bank officials said this is
considered to be the highest unemployment in the world.
</P>
<P>
The closures have also pushed up the cost of transporting
goods and reduced the volume and value of trade. Between 1992 and
1995, revenues fell to 48 percent of gross national product (GNP)
from 61 percent and exports dropped from 14 percent of GNP to 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
Israel meanwhile insisted that the Palestinian economy is
improving due to Israeli efforts. Yaacov Orr, Government
Coordinator in the territories, told the Knesset (Parliament)
Monday that there is no limit on the number of Palestinian
workers entering Israel and there is increased trade between
Israel and the territories.
</P>
<P>
Orr said Israel would continue making efforts to improve the
Palestinian economy, because the improved feeling of well-being
would reduce the ability of terror organizations to recruit
activists.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has termed as "constructive" the 25th assembly of the
foreign ministers of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC) which opened in Doha, Qatar on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to local press upon his return from the meeting Monday
evening, Kharrazi said that the meeting discussed issues
concerning the Muslim world, the regional problems and other
international topics "in a new atmosphere charged with cordiality,
sincerity and solidarity."
</P>
<P>
He said that the new spirit of cooperation and unity between
OIC member states had enhanced the block to reminisce of their
destiny and the issues of the region, particularly the question of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister noted that Israel, which is in
possession of weapons of mass destruction and in pursuance of its
expansionist policy, posed a grave danger to all the countries in
the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel's threat was taken up at the OIC foreign
ministers' assembly as a projected topic of discussion and that
the assembly needed to follow up the matter more seriously so that
the weapons of mass destruction in Israeli silos would be
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda of the assembly were regional, international
issues including that of Afghanistan, Iraq and the Middle East,
Kharrazi added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his meetings with OIC foreign ministers, Kharrazi
said that the exchange of views were essential for preparing
ground for member countries to benefit from such
side talks.
</P>
<P>
On his one-day visit to Saudi Arabia and his meetings with top
ranking Saudi officials, he said that the relation between Saudi
Arabia and Iran was on the right course of expansion, particularly
after Chairman of Iran's State Expediency Council Hashemi
Rafsanjani visited Riyadh late February.

BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Growing demand for air
transportation will require China to increase its civilian
aircraft fleet by 1,591 units for the period between 1997-2016,
with related purchases involving total funds of 75.94 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Japan Extends 600 Million Dollars to Thai Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of Japan
and 14 other leading Japanese banks have signed a contract to
provide 600 million U.S. dollars to help Thailand's cash-strapped
exporters.
</P>
<P>
The loan, to be guaranteed by the Thai Finance Ministry,
carries a term of five years with a three-year grace period, the
Bangkok Post said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The loan, to be on-lent partly in yen, will carry an average
2.65 percent annual interest.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said at the signing
ceremony Monday that the Industrial Finance Corporation of
Thailand (IFCT) and the Export-Import (EXIM) Bank of Thailand will
each receive half of the loan.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be re-lent by the IFCT and EXIM bank to
exporters, Japanese subsidiary companies, and companies
participating in joint ventures with Japanese firms, which require
medium- and long-term loans or working capital.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin also said the first disbursement of the loan, totaling
40 billion yen or 300 million dollars, will arrive by the end of
this month, and second between August and September.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japanese vice-minister of finance Yasuhisha
Shiozaki, who also attended Monday's signing ceremony, said the
loans showed the Japanese government's strong support of
Thailand's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the yen loans were the first step toward
encouraging yen-denominated trading in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said that "internationalizing" the Japanese currency would
require more capital to be raised in yen, with the latest loans to
Thailand a good start.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the largest investor in Southeast Asia and one of the
biggest creditors in the region. However, regional trade and
finance transactions have long been dominated by the U.S. dollar.

CHANGSHA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Netherlands-aided centers to
test for newborn baby diseases have opened in Hunan, Henan and
Jiangxi provinces and the cities of Shanghai and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Health said the centers, first
of a kind in China that receive blood tests of newborn babies, are
being established to control genetotrophic and congenital
secretory diseases.
</P>
<P>
Wallac Corp. from the Netherlands provides the facilities for
the centers and offers technical training for Chinese doctors. The
cooperative project will last three years.
</P>
<P>
The congenital diseases of newborn babies are mainly abnormal
functioning of thyroid and phenylketonuria (PKU) which hinder the
development of babies' intelligence.
</P>
<P>
During the trial period, the Hunan center has performed blood
tests for more than 7,000 newborn babies; three cases of PKU were
discovered. After a period of treatment, the three children are
doing well.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health official said China will gradually

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Wellington region led New
Zealand in economic growth last year despite the impact of the
Asian financial crisis which began to hit the country in the
latter half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The local Evening Post newspaper Tuesday quoted a National Bank
survey as saying that the region's economy grew 4.2 percent in
1997, nearly twice as fast as all of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The region has outperformed the national economy for the past
two years after seven years during which it lagged behind the
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that real estate sales rose 4 percent in the
Wellington region last year, while sales nationally dipped;
Consumer confidence was the highest in the country; New housing
starts climbed 4.7 percent compared with an 8 percent decline
nationwide; Retails sales increased 4.4 percent against a 5.5
percent fall across New Zealand; And employment grew faster than
the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that the short-term prospects for the
region remain bright, thanks to the opening of the new Museum of
New Zealand which is expected to attract more tourists to
Wellington.
</P>
<P>
The power failure in the country's largest Auckland also helped
the economy in Wellington, as some companies in Auckland have
shifted their staff to the capital.

<P>
HARARE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Air Zimbabwe will start operating
long-haul flights to London for Air Malawi and Zambia Express
from next month, The Herald reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The airline is consolidating its ties with regional carriers
to try to improve its viability.
</P>
<P>
As competition within the skies stiffens, survival of smaller
airlines such as Air Zimbabwe will depend on their ability to
withstand the competition and build alliances with both large and
small carriers.
</P>
<P>
Air Zimbabwe will be maximizing the use of its Boeing 767
aircraft by offering its excess capacity to Air Malawi and Zambia
Express.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for Air Zimbabwe, David Mwenga,
said that the flights to London would be strictly for Air
Malawi and Zambia Express and would originate from Lusaka and
Lilongwe.
</P>
<P>
"Air Zimbabwe will provide the aircraft and cockpit crew while
the two airlines would provide cabin crew from their capitals,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the flights have started, with cabin crews
from both Air Malawi and Zambia Express attending a
familiarization flight safety exercise in Harare recently.

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A Yellow River water diversion
project is going well and bringing benefits to farmers in
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The project, begun in 1996, aims to develop 133,000 hectares of
arable land along the Yellow River and help a million impoverished
farmers in the region's southern mountainous areas resettle.
</P>
<P>
By last year, a 32-kilometer water aqueduct and canal was
completed, diverting water from the river up to the Xihaigu
mountainous areas to irrigate 120 hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Trial irrigation on nearly 100 hectares of farmland in two
counties has been successful, making it possible to promote
water-efficient agriculture in the area.
</P>
<P>
After the first phase of the project is completed at a cost of
2.33 billion yuan in static investment, more than 3,300 hectares
of wasteland will have been irrigated by the end of this year, as
well as infrastructure and living conditions for the resettlement
of 25,000 farmers will be improved.
</P>
<P>
By now, more than 100 million yuan has already been spent on
the project, and this year a loan from Kuwait of 33 million
U.S. dollars will be put into use.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Economy to Slow Down Sharply This Year: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore economy will slow
down sharply this year, although the country is benefiting from
its strong underlying economic fundamentals, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an appraisal of Singapore's economic development and
policies released here, the IMF Executive Directors said
Singapore's strong fundamentals had helped to shield the country's
financial market from the regional turmoil and had allowed foreign
investors to remain confident about Singapore's short- and
medium-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
The strong fundamentals included its high saving rate, large
fiscal and external current account surpluses, flexible markets,
robust reserve position, and high standard of regulation and
supervision for domestic financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
However, the Directors observed that there are still downside
risks associated with the regional economic slowdown, and that,
even in the absence of further unexpected regional spill-overs,
growth in Singapore will slow down sharply this year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said that given Singapore's circumstances, it is
appropriate for the authorities to reduce over the medium term the
government's operating surplus and, in order to do that, corporate
and personal income tax rates should be reduced in next year's
budget alongside the intended increases in development expenditure
to provide some fiscal stimulus to the economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF Directors also endorsed the Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS)'s "intention to maintain an easier monetary policy
stance as long as the inflationary outlook remains subdued."
</P>
<P>
But they added that the authorities need to "review the stance
at frequent intervals to ensure that inflation remains low."
</P>
<P>
The IMF's board also supported Singapore's move to a more
flexible exchange rate policy given volatility in Asian
currencies. But they added that an appreciation of the Singapore
dollar would be appropriate once the regional situation stabilizes
and output returns to its potential level.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the IMF said, continued restructuring of the
economy into higher value-added sectors and upgrading of the skill
level of the workforce were essential to safeguard Singapore's
competitiveness over the medium term.
</P>
<P>
The IMF Directors also urged the Singapore authorities to
increase transparency regarding holdings of government assets
abroad and the net open forward position of the MAS, and to
broaden the coverage and to improve the breakdown of the public
sector accounts so as to facilitate economic analysis.
</P>
<P>
The MAS said in a statement on Tuesday that the Singapore
government "welcomes the IMF's endorsement of its macroeconomic
management during the past year under difficult conditions of
regional financial market turbulence."
</P>
<P>
It also stressed that the authorities "will continue to manage
the Singapore dollar flexibly against a trade-weighted basket of
currencies. The primary objective of our exchange rate policy
remains unchanged, namely to maintain price stability."

<HEADLINE> Kenya Moves to Curb Dumping of Untaxed Petroleum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
announced tough measures to curb dumping of petroleum products
which are destined for export and diverted to sell at black
market in Kenya, the East African Standard reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Energy Minister Chris Okemo as
saying Monday that the government had banned export of
petroleum by road to Somalia, Sudan and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
All exports of petroleum products to Uganda and Tanzania will
now be limited to only licensed marketers, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The measures to curb the oil dumping include the establishment
of a special police unit to enhance the Transit Monitoring Unit
of the Kenya Revenue Authority.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan police who have launched a countrywide operation to
round up illegal petrol dealers, said that more than 400 people
had been arrested in the on-going operation.
</P>
<P>
A senior police source said, "So far over 80,000 liters of
super petrol, 210 liters of regular petrol and 32,000 liters of
diesel had been seized."
</P>
<P>
The operation on illegal oil dealers followed a directive made
by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi on March 6 that those
involved in the oil racket be rounded up.
</P>
<P>
the president said that oil destined for export was diverted
to sell in the black market and the government lost a large
amount of money through unpaid taxes.
</P>
<P>
About 45 of those arrested had been taken to court and other
50 cases were still pending before the court, said the police
source.

GUANGZHOU, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, plans to further improve its policies
to ensure minimum standards of living for poor families in urban and
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in May, all local people living below the poverty
line will receive subsidiaries from the government, instead
of their work units.
</P>
<P>
The city adopted the bottom-line policy for urban residents in
July of 1995, and the poverty line for urban residents was raised
from the 200 yuan to 240 yuan a month in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
Since January of 1997, more than 10,000 rural people in the
suburbs have also been covered by a similar policy. A total of
5.41 million yuan has been spent for the purpose last year.
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year, the policy will cover all local people in
rural areas, while the bottom lines for rural people will be set
differently in three categories: 100 yuan for poverty-stricken
areas, 120 yuan for common areas and 150 for well-off areas.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the subsidiaries will be shared by the city,
townships and villages.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Province Dealing with Issue of Migrant Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 17 (Xinhua) -- More and more migrant workers
are having difficulty finding jobs in south China's Guangdong
Province, where a well-planned labor flow is preferred.
</P>
<P>
Local labor departments began last year to classify the labor
force and asking every potential employer to apply for the use of
laborers. They also required migrant workers to have employment
cards issued by labor departments.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the province has taken steps to guide
transient labor forces into an orderly flow, as fears arise that
an increasing influx of migrant laborers could bring negative
impact on local life.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that slightly more than 4 million laborers
found jobs with the help of labor departments, an increase of
500,000 over the previous year. And 95 percent of them had
employment cards.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the developed Pearl River Delta area accepted
100,000 surplus laborers from poor areas of neighboring Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, and Shenzhen employed more than 6,000
rural laborers from the mountainous Guizhou Province.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Ensures Labuan as Good Financial Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Tuesday that
it is determined to ensure that Labuan, a federal territory off
Sabah, East Malaysia, would continue to be a reputable offshore
center for quality and genuine investors.
</P>
<P>
The Labuan International Offshore Financial Center (IOFC),
established in October 1990, is one of the few integrated offshore
financial centers in this region.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in the region, together with a slowdown in
the regional economies, would have some adverse effects on certain
types of offshore activities, particularly offshore banking and to
some extent, company incorporation and registration, State Bank
Governor Ahmad Mohd Don said.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, on the part of the government, additional
measures continued to be adopted to establish Labuan as a premier
IOFC," Ahmad was quoted by the Malaysian national news agency
Bernama as saying at a seminar on "Labuan: Malaysia's
International Offshore Financial Center" held in Johor Baharu,
southern Malaysia, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad is also chairman of the Labuan Offshore Financial
Services Authority, which is a regulatory agency set up to handle
the problems investors may have when operating in Labuan.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad said that while many new activities have been introduced
in Labuan, prudential requirements and greater supervision would
be given adequate focus.
</P>
<P>
To this end, he said Labuan has decided to build its offshore
center on a more solid ground through the exercise of prudence and
unwavering commitment toward maintaining a clean reputation.
</P>
<P>
The Labuan IOFC currently offers a full range of offshore
financial services including offshore banking, insurance, trust
business, fund management, investment holding, investment banking
and management services activities.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad said the Labuan IOFC is now in a position to further
consolidate and brace itself for greater challenges this year as
it has made encouraging progress since its establishment, thus
providing a firm foundation for further growth.

HANOI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Office rents in Vietnam's capital
city of Hanoi have fallen at least 30 percent in recent weeks,
the Vietnam News reported Tuesday.
</P>

Prices in downtown Hanoi have fallen to 30 US dollars per

The total demand on office rentals is now 11,000 square metres
out of a capacity of 60,000, with no change in the number of
tenants, the Vietnam News said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the cause of low occupancy rates is the slowdown
in investment and the overall economy resulting from the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in the first two months of
this year, the Vietnamese government licensed 24 foreign-backed
projects amounting to an investment of 926 million dollars.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
met with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams Monday night, hoping to push
the Northern Ireland peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
After a 15-minute talk with Clinton, Adams and the Sinn Fein
chief negotiator Martin McGuinness said their talk had focused on
positive discussions and praised the president for his commitment
to search for peace in the province.
</P>
<P>
As the head of the Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army, Adams indicated that the talks would not achieve
his goal of an unified Ireland, but he would accept the outcome of
the current round of talks.
</P>
<P>
However he insisted: "Britain (should) accept the creation of
a rolling process, a transitional process, a bridge from today's
situation into a new beginning for all the people of Ireland."
</P>
<P>
Adams, McGuinness and leaders of other parties in Northern
Ireland are gathered in Washington for a St. Patrick's Day
reception at the White House on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The White House expects the present round of talks to achieve
some success. Clinton hopes the meeting could reach the outline
of an agreement, said the White House spokesman Mike McCurry.
</P>
<P>
The multi-party peace talks, which began in June 1996, are
supposed to conclude in May. Negotiators hope a compromise on
governing Northern Ireland, which is acceptable to both its
Protestant majority and the large Catholic minority, can be
agreed.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Europe University Center to Be in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Education Minister
Najib Tun Razak said Tuesday that a center will be set up here
soon to provide the infrastructure for enhancing Asia-Europe
university relations.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the proposed center, to be known as the
"Asia-Europe University Center" is expected to be endorsed by
ministers attending next month's Second Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM)
in London, he told reporters here after opening a seminar on
"Asia-Europe Educational Link: Laying The Foundation."
</P>
<P>
He said that besides serving as a vehicle for networking
activities between Asia and Europe in university relations, the
center would also be used as a medium for creating a system to
ensure better information flow and initiate cooperative dialogues
and seminars.
</P>
<P>
The idea of closer cooperation between Asia and Europe beyond
traditional ties was mooted by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad during the inaugural ASEM in Bangkok two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Najib said details about the center are still confidential
pending the tabling of the proposal at the forthcoming ASEM.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in his speech at the seminar, Najib said people of the
two continents would be able to reach a higher level of
understanding through the educational process.
</P>
<P>
He said it is time for Asia and Europe to appreciate each other
and no longer treat the two continents as separate entities based
on their economic and trade linkages.

<P>
As President Clinton will return a visit to China this year at

three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, implement the China-U.S. Joint
Statement in real earnest, enhance mutual understanding, expand
common ground and increase cooperation, they will be able to bring
a steadily developing Sino-U.S. relationship into the 21st
century," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Fully aware of the heavy responsibility upon him, the
ambassador pledged to do his utmost to develop bilateral relations

in Asia and the world as a whole, and he was looking forward to
visiting China and meeting once again with President Jiang in
joint efforts to further the bilateral ties.

achievements" in recent years.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Encourages Firms to List on Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
plans to prompt more of its backbone enterprises to become listed
on the stock market in an effort to quench an investment thirst.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial official, priority will be given to
its 1,000 large state-owned companies and 120 group companies
which dominate Jiangsu's agriculture, energy, transportation, raw
material and high-tech industries to help promote the
development of machinery, electronics, chemical, automobile,
biochemical, new material and tourist industries.
</P>
<P>
A number of these companies engaged in industrial and
infrastructural sectors are expected to be allowed to list on
stock exchanges in Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and New York for
overseas investment, said Li Sanyuan, a senior official from the
provincial securities regulatory office.
</P>
<P>
Stock market listings have helped raise 17.7 billion yuan for
38 companies in the province, according to Liu Jian, provincial
vice-governor. In 1996, 14 stocks were issued amassing 2.87
billion yuan; and, in 1997, 16 were issued accumulating 8.5
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Stocks issued by a number of well-performing companies from the
province have been trading well in the secondary markets of
Shanghai and Shenzhen, said Li.
</P>
<P>
He also said Jiangsu will set a faster pace in gaining overseas
finance, following its initial tryout in entering international
capitalization markets with five of the listed companies issuing
B-shares in Shanghai and three issuing H-shares in Hong Kong
raising 8.38 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> 86 Reservoirs, Dams Built in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A total of 86 reservoirs and dams
have been built in Myanmar since 1988, irrigating 535,400 hectares
of farmland, official The New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is the mainstay of Myanmar's economy, and paddy,
beans and pulses, cotton and sugarcane are the country's four
pillar crops.
</P>
<P>
The country maintained an average annual rice export of 463,750
tons in the last four-year plan period (1992-93 to 1995-96),
fetching 88 million U.S. dollars annually, 40 percent of the
country's foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's paddy production in the 1996-97 was 17.08 million
tons with 93,000 tons of rice exported.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of rice exports in the fiscal year and the
planned stop in the export in the current 1997-98 were seen as
giving priority to the domestic demand and the stabilization of
the internal rice market.
</P>
<P>
However, a total of 6.48 million hectares are being targeted to
be under paddy in the whole country to produce 20 million tons of
paddy for the current 1997-98 fiscal year ending March.

<P>
PRAGUE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The population of the Czech
Republic dropped again last year, despite official encouragement
for couples to have more children.
</P>
<P>
Josef Zabrasky, spokesman of the Czech State Census Bureau,
said Tuesday that the population stood at 10.299 million, 10,012
less than the previous year.

Though many efforts have been tried by the authority to

</P>
<P>
But the population is also aging and 25 percent of Czechs are
expected to be aged 60 or over by the year 2015, he said.
</P>
<P>
The population was not expected to rise for some time, the
spokesman said. It is estimated that the population of the Czech

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Concerned Over Threat of Widespread Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's new State Minister of
Environment Juwono Sudarsono has declared his intention to instill
"a sense of crisis" in the public over the threat of widespread
forest fires in the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the declaration Monday after taking the oath
at the Merdeka Palace, newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that forest fires would damage Indonesia's
international image if the nation failed to properly handle the
recurring problem.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two months, fires have been raging over almost
80,000 hectares of forest and brush in the country's East
Kalimantan province bordering the Malaysian states of Sarawak and
Sabah on the island of Borneo.
</P>
<P>
Head of the provincial Environmental Impact Management Agency
Awang Farouk Ishak said Monday that 76,949.4 hectares of forest
have been destroyed by fires this year, causing losses of up to 22
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Local people in the province and residents of neighboring
Singapore and Malaysia have expressed concern that choking smog,
caused by massive fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan last year, will
return, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 million people in Kalimantan and Sumatra were exposed
to hazardous haze caused by fires which burned for around nine
months last year. The World Wide Fund for Nature said that the
haze cost Indonesia over 900 million U.S. dollars in short-term
health costs alone.
</P>
<P>
This year, more than 2,000 East Kalimantan residents have
reportedly suffered respiratory ailments caused by haze over the
past two months.
</P>
<P>
Juwono, who is also chairman of the Environment Impact
Management Agency, said that to help counter the wide regional and
international impact of this year's fires, the country would have
to launch an "all-out environmental diplomacy drive".
</P>
<P>
"We must work hard in order to be able to cope with
environmental impact," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Accepts no Pretended Humanitarian Aid From US: Editorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Cuba is set to refuse United
States aid offers backed by a senator responsible for tightening
the economic blockade against Havana.
</P>
<P>
Cuban authorities accused Senator Jesse Helms of violating his
own Helms-Burton Act, which imposed further restrictions on
foreign investment in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper Trabajadores criticised Helms in an
editorial after the senator interceded to allow U.S. federal funds
to be used to send food and medical aid to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"The Cuban people will under no circumstances accept the
proposal of Senator Helms to send pretend humanitarian aid to the
island," said the official publication of Cuba's Central Trade
Union.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government was seeking to give its economic blockade
an "altruistic mask which is a pantomime that nobody takes
seriously", the editorial claimed.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton Act, which was signed into law by President
Bill Clinton in March, 1996, took the U.S. blockade to "the
highest summit of political absurdity".
</P>
<P>
Any solution to the Helms-Burton Act would have to respect the
dignity, independence and sovereignty of Cuba, the editorial
said.

Carlos Alvarado, General Secretary of the Drivers Labour Union
of Chiriqui demanded the agreement be reciprocal among all Central
American countries in order to cut the costs of Panama drivers.
</P>
<P>
Alvarado said drivers had trusted governor Ricardo Saval
because he said he had orders from President Ernesto Perez
Balladares to negotiate the negative points of the agreement with
other CentralAmerican countries.
</P>
<P>
If the agreement was not amended, the Panama drivers would stop
their trucks again to show the government their position.
</P>
<P>
The drivers barred Costa-Rican drivers from entering their
country in previous strikes.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji, Premier of State Council (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Zhu Rongji, well versed in
economic management and widely known for his pragmatic style of
work, has been approved as the fifth premier of the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Zhu was nominated as premier of the State Council by President
Jiang Zemin and confirmed by the Ninth National People's Congress
(NPC) at its first session being held here in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
After four years of successful macro-economic controls with
curbing inflation as the primary task, an overheated Chinese
economy has cooled down to a "soft landing" and a good situation
rarely seen in the world has been prevailing in the country. With
these achievements, Zhu, acknowledged as an able economic
administrator, has become premier of the State Council, the
Chinese cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, 69, was born in Changsha, capital of central China's Hunan
Province. He joined the Communist Party of China in October, 1949.
After graduation from the prestigious Qinghua University, where he
majored in electrical engineering, he worked for the Northeast
China Ministry of Industries as deputy head of its production
planning office.
</P>
<P>
During 1952-58, he worked in the State Planning Commission as
group head, deputy director of minister's office, and deputy
section chief.
</P>
<P>
From 1958 to 1969, Zhu continued to work in the State Planning
Commission, as a teacher at a cadre school and an engineer. From
1970 to 1975, he was transferred to work at a "May Seventh Cadre
School", a kind of farm for re-education during the Cultural
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
From 1975 to 1979, he served as deputy chief engineer of a
company run by the Pipeline Bureau of the Ministry of Petroleum
Industry and director of Industrial Economics Institute under the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. From 1979 to 1982, he worked
for the State Economic Commission as division chief and bureau
deputy director. He was appointed member of the State Economic
Commission in 1982 and vice-minister in charge of the commission
in 1983, where he held the post until 1987 before he was appointed
mayor of Shanghai.

<TEXT>
<P>
The three years of his office as Shanghai mayor saw tremendous
changes in the development and opening-up of Pudong, a
Singapore-size area wedged between Shanghai proper and the East
China Sea, as well as in the city's telecoms, urban construction
and transport sectors. For these he won popular respect and
acclaim.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Zhu became vice-premier of the State Council and
director of the State Council Production Office. He has focused
his attention on tackling tough economic problems in industry,
agriculture and finance.
</P>
<P>
Soon after he came to Beijing from Shanghai, Zhu launched a
drive to disentangle the "debt chains" of state enterprises; he
took the lead in eliminating IOUs in state grain purchasing for
the sake of farmers. He served concurrently as governor of the
central bank to straighten out the financial order. Deng Xiaoping
once said that Zhu "has his own views, dares to make decisions and
knows economics."
</P>
<P>
The year of 1992 saw runaway investment in fixed assets, an
excessive money supply, soaring prices and a chaotic financial
market. With support from Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, Zhu, as
vice-premier and head of the State Council Economic and Trade
Office, took tough macro-economic control measures. He began by
bringing runaway money supply under control, laying a foundation
for driving down prices. Zhu did did not advocate overall
entrenchment, however.
</P>
<P>
While he axed low-tech duplicated projects and sectors that
would result in "a bubble economy", Zhu backed projects in
transport, energy, agriculture and sectors that had promising
prospects as new areas of economic growth. Thanks to these
measures, the Chinese economy has been able not only to avert
violent fluctuations but also maintain a healthy development.

<P>
Now Zhu Rongji has turned to reforming state enterprises. His
attention is also focused on strengthening agriculture as the
economic base of the country and on continuing a moderately tight
monetary policy. He faces both opportunities and challenges,
observers note. And he has much room to display his talent.
</P>
<P>
"Strict administration" is a principle he upholds. He deports
himself in a calm and unhurried manner, but he is decisive in
handling affairs and quick to act. He cannot tolerate a dilatory
style of work.
</P>
<P>
"My criticism is too severe sometimes and that is not good," he
once said. "But why don't you start doing your work unless your
leader flies into a rage? It is not that you cannot do it but that
you don't want to do it." But he declared that he only criticizes
people but never fixes anybody.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also shows his emotional side sometimes. At the 80th
anniversary of the founding of Qinghua University, his Alma Mater,
Zhu defied fatigue from a long European visit and rushed to the
school to offer his greetings.
</P>
<P>
Between 1993 and 1995, Zhu served as a member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee,
vice-premier of the State Council and concurrently governor of the
People's Bank of China. Since 1995, he has kept the positions of
Standing Committee member and vice-premier. In September, 1997,
Zhu Rongji was re-elected member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Zhu has a good command of English. He is rarely seen speaking
from script. His eloquent speech has always riveted the attention
of his listeners. Zhu is also a Peking Opera fan.
</P>
<P>
His wife, Lao An, was once vice-chairman of the board of
directors of China International Engineering and Consulting
Corporation. She and Zhu were in the same schools twice, first the
Hunan First Provincial Middle School and then Qinghua University.
They have a son and a daughter.

HEFEI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province, one of
the country's major grain production bases, has vowed to promote
the Spark Program in order to accelerate growth in the rural
sector.
</P>

effort will focus on densely populated areas in northern Anhui,
the major production area for grain, cotton and oil-bearing crops.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for the establishment of concentrated
technological zones in one third of townships in the region by the
year 2000. Each zone is expected to have 15-odd companies with an
annual sales of 300-500 million yuan and pretax profits of 30-50
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, plans call for the zone to achieve a 10 percent
annual increase rate in the value-added new and high technology
industries, and each zone will train some one million people.
</P>
<P>
Group companies with annual output values of between 500
million and two billion yuan each will be encouraged to enter the
food processing, aquatics, forestry, herbal medicines, forage crop
and light industrial sectors.

<HEADLINE> Oil Price Plunges to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The price of a basket of seven
crudes plunged to 11.83 U.S. dollars a barrel last week, the
lowest in nearly a decade, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
OPEC had expected a price of 21 dollars a barrel and seems
quite helpless in tackling the problem. It had planned to hold a
special meeting of its Market Monitoring Committee on Monday to
consider ways of stopping the price decline. However, members,
including Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, refused to attend, forcing
OPEC to put off the meeting until the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices, which have been going down in recent years,
increased slightly at the end of 1996 and the start of 1997 when a
freezing winter afflicted Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The price dropped dramatically after October 1997 as the
Southeast Asian economies went into a financial crisis and a mild
U.S. and European winter cut demand.
</P>
<P>
Iraq began exporting limited amounts of oil in 1997 to buy food
and medicine and this contributed to the price problem.
</P>
<P>
But experts say the essential reason behind the slump lies
inside OPEC, which boosted its production by 10 percent in
January. The output ceiling for OPEC members rose to 27.5 million
barrels a day this year from the 1997 ceiling of 25.05 million
barrels.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, has adamantly
opposed curtailing output without having all the producers --
including non-OPEC members -- to do so as well.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, the second-largest producer within OPEC, and the
largest exporter to the United States, also showed no inclination
to cut production already well above its quota. The South American
country is producing 3.5 million barrels a day, an increase of 36
percent on its quota of 2.58 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
Because most OPEC members gain their earnings through oil
exports, decreases in oil outputs and exports will devastate their
economies. For example, crude oil and natural gas account for 79
percent of the total exports in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also have different views on the falling price. Some
believe that OPEC could only stop the decline after the price
slides under 10 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Others say the low price will not last long and will go up to
15 to 17 dollars in the summer.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Vows to Boost Agricultural Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's newly appointed
Minister of Agriculture Justika Sjarifudin Baharsjah has promised
to boost the production of several important commodities including
rice, corn and soybeans to cut back on imports.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the promise here Monday after swearing in at
the Merdeka Palace, newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She said increasing the production of such commodities would be
her top priority.
</P>
<P>
However, she acknowledged that it would be difficult to meet
the target, given the unfavorable weather conditions and a decline
in the amount of productive land.
</P>
<P>
She said that at least 10,000 to 30,000 hectares of
agricultural land was converted for non-farming purposes every
year.
</P>

BUCHAREST, March 16 (Xinhua) -- For nearly three years,
McDonalds has been massively penetrating the Romanian market,
owning 28 restaurants at present in more than nine cities and
towns.
</P>
<P>
Marin Alecu, general manager of the McDonalds in Romania, told
Adevarul Economic Weekly (The Economic Truth) the reason for such
success.
</P>
<P>
"It is rooted in the conclusion drawn after quite detailed
market surveys and testing the company has been carrying out since
1993", he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Romanians have proved to be great fans of the American
life style. The estimate was later confirmed and it still stands
true.
</P>
<P>
"The country's potential is very high and McDonalds is
preparing itself for the future," Alecu said.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we offered 32,000 (U.S.) dollars for studies aimed
at helping us understand what was going on in the Romanian society
and economy, and especially what we were supposed to do in order
to increase sales", Alecu said. "The Romanians like McDonalds'
offers, and our pricing policy."

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Sets New Export Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has set a new target of
earning 200 million U.S. dollars from exports in 1998-99 fiscal
year beginning April, said official The New Light of Myanmar
newspaper Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
New export items would be found to achieve the new target,
Myanmar Minister of Commerce Kyaw Than was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's traditional export commodities include rice, beans
and pulses, rubber, fish and prawn, teak and hardwood, base metal
and ores.
</P>
<P>
The new export target is obviously far lower than that in the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is now encouraging the private sector to boost
exports, Kyaw Than said.
</P>
<P>
An export promotion meeting was held by the ministry here
Monday, inviting new means and suggestions from local exporters
for the move.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar exported 725 million
dollars' worth of goods in the first ten months of 1997, up from
598 million dollars in the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Of the country's exports in the period, the private sector
contributed 75 percent or 548 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Myanmar's export and import volume dropped markedly
since the outbreak of the Asian financial turmoil.

BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Maolan state-level nature
reserve in southwest China's Guizhou Province has become one of
the gene data banks of precious species in China.
</P>
<P>
Located in Libou County -- an area between the provinces of
Yunan and Guizhou and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region -- the
Maolan forest protection zone covers 21,285 hectares.
</P>
<P>
With a forest coverage rate of 92 percent, the region has a
distinct environmental feature. After incessant research on the
nature reserve's environment, both domestic and foreign experts
concluded that the zone is a rare natural laboratory and precious
gene data bank.
</P>
<P>
"The nature reserve boasts over 1,600 kinds of plants and more
than 300 kinds of vertebrates," said Wei Lumin, deputy director of
the protection department of the reserve.
</P>
<P>
He said that the precious tree species include the fir of the
genus ormosia, emmenopterys henryi, dysosma versipellis, and
cephaaalotaxus oliveri, most of which are under top state
protection.
</P>
<P>
Scientific observations also have revealed that the reserve is
home to such endangered animal species as the clouded leopard,

<HEADLINE> China's Processing Trade Volume Going Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China reported nearly 170
billion U.S. dollars worth of processing trade in 1997, up 15.75
percent over the previous year. Processing accounted for 52.2
percent of last year's foreign trade volume.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show that processing trade has become the
largest contributor to the country's foreign trade, in contrast to
29.3 billion U.S. dollars in 1988 and 28.5 percent of the national
total imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
Major growth came from processing trade by overseas-funded
enterprises. In 1988, these businesses provided 14 percent of the
total processing trade, but in 1996 the percentage rose to 64.
</P>
<P>
Processing of some world name-brand products from Japan,
Europe, and the United States -- including electronics
information, stationery, shoes, and clothing -- has been moved to
China.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Province in south China is a typical example. It
reported 93.85 billion U.S. dollars of processing trade last
year, making up 55.3 percent of the national total. However,
processing trade in the central and western parts is also on the
rise.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Southeast Asia Facing New Haze Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Barely a few months after haze
cleared away over Southeast Asia, the region is facing a new haze
threat from forest fires in Indonesia and Malaysia. Possibly, this
year's calamity in Southeast Asia will be even bigger than last
year's.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-January, official reports said, fires in Indonesia's
East Kalimantan and Sumatra have gutted over 65,000 hectares of
forest. In Miri, an oil town in Malaysia's Sarawak state, some 500
firefighters are curbing spreading fires covering some 1,000
hectares of forest.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of the new fires, a result of burning by some
companies for plantations, has made people in Southeast Asia
worrisome as memories of last year's nightmare are still fresh.
</P>
<P>
According to a February report by the World Wide Fund for
Nature, last year's haze caused by Indonesia's forest fire cost
the Southeast Asian region 1.384 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Falls in tourism, short-term health, industrial production and
fishing, cost Indonesia 1.012 billion dollars, Malaysia 310
million dollars and Singapore 62.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
But this year, the situation could be more serious because
Indonesia's fires are harder to stop and fires also occur in
Malaysia, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
At present, areas of Indonesia which should have enjoyed heavy
rainfall are experiencing a severe drought. With no rain expected
for months due to freak weather caused by El Nino, the fires are
likely to get worse, they said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, hit severely by the ongoing financial crisis, the
Indonesian government cannot allocate enough money to curb the
fires, they said.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to reduce economic losses and lessen
environmental damages to the region, environment ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) met in Malaysia at
the end of last month, and activated a haze action plan agreed on
last December.
</P>
<P>
Under the action plan, Indonesia focuses its action on fighting
the fires, Malaysia on preventing measures and Singapore on
satellite monitoring.
</P>
<P>
During the past two months, Indonesia and Malaysia have
dispatched aircraft to drop water-bombs and fire-retarding
chemicals on the disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
However, high-resolution satellite images show fires are still
spreading at an alarming rate. Early this month, forest fires in
Malaysia were reportedly limited to 200 hectares, but now are
covering 1,000 hectares. In East Kalimantan, dozens of new
outbreaks are spotted daily along the 80-kilometer highway between
Samarinda and Bontang, and hot spots increased to 394 last week.
</P>
<P>
A hot spot is a single pixel on satellite images depicting a
one square area, where one or more fires have been detected.
</P>
<P>
The new fires have caused serious damages to the environment in
disaster areas of the two countries. In Miri, the air pollution
index has breached the hazardous levels to 360, with visibility
down to 1.6 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
As Malaysia will host the Commonwealth Games in September,
officials fear that many athletes and visitors will stay away if
there is return to last year's smoke level.
</P>
<P>
For the moment, air pollution is limited to the disaster areas
of the two countries, but the situation may change soon. Experts
said that the northeast monsoon is blowing the smoke away from
Indonesia's northern neighbors, but everything will change when
the southwest monsoon begins in July.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say that Southeast Asia must learn from the
terrible price it is paying for the forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Topfer, executive director of the United Nations
Environment Program, said that right now, the firefighting part is
the most important, but there must be a lot of effort put into
prevention.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, since the fires are now already in intensive
development, prevention may be not very successful this year, and
the world must come to Southeast Asia's assistance.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Leftist Rebels Sign Human Rights Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government signed
late Monday night a human rights accord with the country's leftist
rebel group, the National Democratic Front (NDF), a breakthrough
that may finally lead to an end to a nearly three-decade-long
leftist insurgency.
</P>
<P>
The NDF peace panel led by Luis Jalandoni and the government
peace team lead by Howard Dee signed the Comprehensive Agreement
on Respect for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law, in
The Hague, the Netherlands, the daily Philippine Star said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The accord was the first component of a proposed peace treaty
between the NDF and the government, which began peace negotiations
12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Details of the human rights agreement, which commits the two
sides to respect human rights, were not immediately released.
</P>
<P>
The government expected the signing of the accord to reduce
encounters between the military and the NDF's armed wing, the New
People's Army (NPA), in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The first fruit of this agreement must be a marked reduction
or, better yet, a total suspension of armed hostilities," the
government peace panel said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The leftist rebellion, which began in the late 1960s and peaked
during the mid-1980s, has claimed the lives of tens of thousands
of people in the country.
</P>
<P>
The NPA's strength shrank sharply to about 8,000 members from a
high of more than 26,000 in 1987 due to a series of massive
offensives launched by the military. Some NDF leaders fled to the
Netherlands in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The government and the NDF will begin to discuss political and
constitutional reforms in the next round of negotiations starting
this month.

<P>
SANTIAGO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Together, Chilean President
Eduardo Frei and his Mexican counterpart Ernesto Zedillo voiced
again their opposition against a U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement Monday, the two presidents said they were
against the so-called Helms-Burton Act, as well as any law or
unilateral measure with an extra-territorial effect.
</P>
<P>
The law, initially designed to further the sanctions against
Cuba, "is against the regulations and principles of international
rights and ... the sovereignty of other countries," they said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Frei and Zedillo, here on visit since Sunday,
agreed that the U.S. application of certification processes in the
fight against drug trafficking is a big threat to multilateralism.
</P>
<P>
They expressed support for the initiative to organize a
Latin-American and the Caribbean Head of States summit currently
scheduled for the first half of 1999 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The summit was expected to enhance economic exchange and
cooperation between Latin-America and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The Chilean and Mexican leaders appreciated the work by the Rio
Group and backed the bloc's efforts to strengthen its mechanism as
the region's consultation and political reconciliation body.
</P>
<P>
They wanted to see the Rio Group playing a more active role as
as a speaker for Latin American and the Caribbean regions and for
other countries and regions.

<P>
CHANGSHA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Dongting Lake in central China's
Hunan Province has become the winter habitat for white-forehead
wild geese, one of the world's endangered species.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates by Chinese and Japanese experts engaged
in bird protection, there are 14,000 wild geese in the nature
reserve of the Dongting Lake, the second largest of its kind in

The white-forehead goose only weighs 1.3-to-2 kilograms. There
are only 20,000 in the world, said experts attending a seminar on
bird protection around the Dongting Lake.
</P>
<P>
Occupying about 15,000 square kilometers, Dongting Lake is home
to more than 16 million migrant birds in winter.
</P>
<P>
The eastern section of the lake is a state-class nature reserve
and has been included on the International Important Wetland List.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A 21-year-old woman received a
new liver at a hospital here Monday and became the first patient
to undergo such an organ transplant in Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The woman, who suffered terminal liver failure, was in the
operation room for 11 hours at the Instituto Nacional de
Enfermedades Hepaticas of the army's central hospital.
</P>
<P>
The liver was from a 44-year-old man who died the same day. His
other organs would be distributed among several receptors in the
coming days, said the National Bank of Organs and Tissues.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Edgardo Tortorel, the head of a medical team in the liver
transplant, said the procedure on the woman was successful so far.
</P>
<P>
In the past, as Uruguayan physicians were yet to develop the
skills needed, patients had to travel to Argentina to undergo
liver transplant under an agreement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
With the success on the first case, Uruguayans could receive
such surgery in their own country, physicians said.

<HEADLINE> Chile, Mexico to Forge Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Chile and Mexico committed
themselves, by signing a joint statement Monday, to forge closer
ties for bilateral cooperation in various areas.
</P>
<P>
The statement was signed here at the "Palacio de Moneda" by
Chilean Presidents Eduardo Frei and his Mexican counterpart
Ernesto Zedillo, who had been in Chile since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
While promising more cooperation in areas like politics,
technology and culture, the two presidents were also looking
forward toward the signing of a free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral free trade instrument would replace a trade
cooperation document that has been in practice between Chile and
Mexico, both economic giants in Latin America, since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The new document, likely to create additional jobs for both
countries, was expected at a hemispheric summit bringing together
leaders of both North and South American countries later this year.
</P>
<P>
Also there at the summit, the second of the kind, leaders will
start negotiations for kicking off a hemispheric free trade regime.
</P>
<P>
Frei and Zedillo, whose stay here at the invitation of his host
would last through Wednesday, said they would focus cooperative
projects on areas helpful for the development of both countries.
</P>
<P>
They also outlined the need to continue to work on the
Chilean-Mexican integration.

MANILA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines has imposed stricter bank entry qualifications and
competency criteria for bank ownership effective this month,
Manila Bulletin reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Deputy Governor Alberto Reyes was quoted as saying
the stricter requirements form part of the central bank's move to
further strengthen the banking system and make it less vulnerable
to shocks.
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines include the presentation of evidence of
assets ownership of the investors, net worth of at least twice the
amount of the proposed investment in a bank and presentation of
sufficient proof of resources of income to support net worth.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the monetary authorities want the proposed
bank president has at least two years' experience as a senior
official of a bank or non-bank financial institution.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said the move aims to
better ensure that potential main bank investors have adequate
legitimate resources to fully support their prospective bank.

<P>
The March 2 operation of a new water distribution system in the
Dujiangyan irrigated area of southwest China's Sichuan Province
was considered one of the most advanced irrigation projects in the

<HEADLINE> Shanxi To Spread Environmentally Friendly Energy Techniques </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANXI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi Province in north China is
spreading the use of solar energy and marsh gas as substitute
energy sources to relieve the energy shortage and improve the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of Shanxi Province is suffering from an energy
shortage because of backward natural and economic conditions,
which has led to the deterioration of the environment.
</P>
<P>
"The spread of the environmentally friendly energy techniques
has brought relief to the environment," said an official with the
provincial energy protection station.
</P>
<P>
He said the province has developed energy-efficient stoves for
1.9 million households, solar-powered water heaters for more than
10,000 households, 4,600 hectares of solar greenhouses, and nearly
70,000 hectares of plastic-covered farmland.
</P>
<P>
The spread of these techniques has saved energy amounting to
burning 2 million tons of coal, and harmful emissions have also
been cut by more than 5 million tons each year.
</P>
<P>
The widespread use of marsh gas as rural household's new energy
has saved 2 million tons of firewood, reducing the use of chemical
fertilizers, which has brought a relief to air and ground
pollution.
</P>
<P>
"Although the increasing energy demand has posed a threat to
environmental protection, these environmental friendly energy
techniques will be adopted more widely," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The province has also combined the use of marsh gas with solar
greenhouses to develop ecological agriculture, which has increased
the agricultural output, as well as improving the rural
environment and hygienic conditions.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Baogang, one of China's biggest
iron and steel corporations in Shanghai, has received ISO14001
certification recently for its internationally advanced
environmental administration.
</P>
<P>
The recognition by the International Standard Organization
(ISO) of Baogang's efforts in environmental protection has made it
the first in China's metallurgy industry to reach international
environmental protection levels.
</P>
<P>
The huge enterprise adopted environmental protection measures
when it was still under construction. The investment in
environmental protection reached 1.04 billion yuan (120 million
U.S. dollars) during its first and second phases, and the
investment accounted for 5.3 percent of the total investment in
equipment during the third phase.
</P>
<P>
"Baogang has expanded its environmental protection from solo
pollution treatment to saving resources and energy, and
comprehensive utilization of resources," said Xie Qihua, Baogang's
general manager.
</P>
<P>
"The whole production process is being controlled against
pollution, and everyone is held responsible for environmental
protection. Baogang has already been turned into an ecologically
friendly 'clean factory' according to evaluations from various
aspects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-eight percent of the enterprise's pollutants were
qualified to be discharged and the amount of sulfur dioxide and
carbon monoxide in the air conformed to the state standards set
for first-degree air quality, according to a survey conducted last
year.
</P>
<P>
The enterprise also has achieved an economic return of 400
million yuan in its efforts to efficiently use energy and raw
materials.

"terrorist activity from legal actions by law enforcement agencies
within the bounds of struggle against terrorism."

LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Chilean striker Seb Rozental of
Glasgow Rangers, will certainly miss the World Cup finals in
France due to another operation on his knee, team manager Walter
Smith said on Monday.

Smith confirmed that Rozental was set to undergo a third knee
operation. The latest injury is with the same knee, but is
unconnected to the previous ligament damage which has sidelined
him for almost a year.

The operation will surely forbid the Chilean from playing this

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Spanish athletics body said
here on Monday that they would be appealing against the withdrawl
of two-year doping ban on discus thrower David Martinez by a
sports discipline body.
</P>
<P>
Martinez, holder of Spain's discus record, tested positive for
the steroid nandrolene at a meeting in Halle, Germany, last May.
</P>
<P>
He was suspended but appealed to the country's sports
discipline council (CEDD) claiming that he had eaten infected pig
meat.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the CEDD said the doping test laboratory in Cologne
could have made a mistake and there was not sufficient evidence
Martinez had taken the drug.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish Athletics Federation spokesperson said the decision
put the body in a difficult position.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson said the CEDD is this country's supreme body
for sports discipline but meanwhile his organization is a member
of the International Amateur Athletic Federation.

NEW YORK, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Globalization and product
innovation are the principal strategies for the growth of
aerospace and defense (A&AMP;D) industry in the next century, a study
found.
</P>
<P>
A&AMP;D executives surveyed by U.S. service company Deloitte &AMP;
Touche said they anticipate that 31 percent of their revenue will
be derived from new products introduced in the next three years.

This is a phenomenal rise from last year's near 20 percent
level, said the company in its 1998 Vision in Manufacturing global
CEO study, released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The executives pointed out that A&AMP;D companies are diversifying
into new sectors such as telecommunications and space technology,
the fastest growing segments in the industry.
</P>
<P>
While North America and Western Europe continue to be important
targets for A&AMP;D expansion overseas, Asia Pacific is the choice
destination for almost 90 percent of North American and European
A&AMP;D executives, despite the continued currency crisis in the
region, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Doubts Cook's Har Homa Trip would Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday that Washington does not believe Britain's Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook could help ease Middle East tensions by
visiting a controversial Jewish settlement project.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said Cook would visit the settlement, known as Har
Homa in Hebrew and Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the Jewish settlement was decided by the
Israeli government last March, which was met with protests from
the Palestinians and from the Arab states, and was greeted with
criticism from the international community as the decision was
sheer betrayal by Israel of Oslo peace accords agreed upon by both
Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process has since been brought to a
standstill because of Israel's violation of the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Cook's plan to visit the Jewish settlement in the east part of
Jerusalem was first met with opposition from Israel which
threatened to exclude the European Union from Middle East
peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
But Israel later agreed Cook's visit plan on the condition that
he would be accompanied by Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin, in answering a
question whether Cook's visit would "help settle things down" in
the region, said: "It doesn't look that way."
</P>
<P>
But he said it was up to Cook to decide where he wanted to go.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official said that Washington had told Cook what
the result would be for his decision to visit the settlement.
</P>
<P>
"It would be controversial, and that has proven to be true," he
said. "It's a shame that it's overshadowing the other parts of
(Cook's) trip."
</P>
<P>
Rubin reiterated that the United States was again looking at
ways to move forward, but had made no decisions.

<HEADLINE> EU Criticizes Employers on Worker Consultation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, Monday criticized a European
employers' group for refusing to negotiate rules with its union
counterpart on worker consultation.
</P>
<P>
The Union of Industrial and Employer Confederations of Europe
(UNICE) said Monday that it had decided against talks with the
European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) and public employers'
group CEEP to set out rules which could then become EU law.
</P>
<P>
"This is a serious setback for social dialogue," Commission
President Jacques Santer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive asked UNICE last year to negotiate new rules,
which would require companies to set up procedures for informing
and consulting their workers at national levels about major
decisions.
</P>
<P>
"Our member federations are virtually unanimous in their
conviction the European Union should not intervene in such a
matter, which has no transnational implications," UNICE President
Francois Perigot said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
An EU directive already requires big multinational companies to
set up European works councils or other consultation systems.
</P>
<P>
Under procedures introduced by the EU's 1992 Maastricht treaty,
EU ministers could agree to turn an agreement negotiated by the
employers' and workers' bodies into EU law.
</P>
<P>
Social Affairs Commissioner Padraig Flynn said that in the
absence of negotiations he would propose EU legislation on the
issue. The Commission also called for "mini-summit" with employer
and trade union groups to discuss future relations.

<HEADLINE> British FM Determined to Visit Har Homa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said here on Monday that he is determined to visit Har Homa
in Arab East Jerusalem despite Israel's opposition.
</P>
<P>
"I will go to Har Homa to see the situation for myself," Cook
told reporters when he arrived here in the afternoon for a one-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
He will have "no objection," if Israeli officials accompany him
to Har Homa, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has warned that Cook's planned visit to Har Homa would
harm the role of the European Union (EU) in mediating the peace
process. Britain is holding the rotating presidency of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Israel broke ground for the construction of a Jewish settlement
on Har Homa a year ago, which brought the peace talks between the
Palestinians and the Israelis to a grind halt.
</P>
<P>
Cook was critical of Israel's policy of expanding settlements
in the occupied Arab lands. "It is wrong to expand settlements on
the occupied territories, (because) it does not fit in with the
spirit of the Oslo accords," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cook called on Israel to refrain from settlement expansion in
Arab East Jerusalem, which he said would help build trust between
itself and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Cook, who arrived here after ending a brief visit to Egypt, is
on the second leg of his Middle East tour, which will also take
him to Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The EU has proposed that Israel freeze construction of Jewish
settlements, implement significant troop pullback in the West
Bank, and the Palestinians fulfill its commitments to meet
Israel's security demands.
</P>
<P>
But the proposal has reportedly been snubbed by the Jewish
state.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Opposes Limiting NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
pressed the Senate to resist limits on expanding the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) after Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic join the alliance.
</P>
<P>
In letters over the weekend to Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott of Mississippi and Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, Clinton criticized proposals that would impose a
moratorium on additional NATO members after the three.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly urge the Senate to reject any effort to mandate a
pause on the process of enlargement," Clinton said in the letter
which was issued Monday by the White House.
</P>
<P>
"Such a mandate is unnecessary and unwise, for it would reduce
our own country's flexibility and leverage, fracture NATO's open
door consensus, and draw a new and potentially destabilizing
dividing line in Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must leave the door open to the addition of other qualified
new members in the future," he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton said that neither his administration, nor
U.S. NATO allies, "has made any decisions or commitments about
when the next invitations for membership should be extended, or to
whom."
</P>
<P>
The accords to accept the three new members have got a
bipartisan support in the Senate and analysts believe that they
will be approved.
</P>
<P>
However, a group of senators led by John Warner, R-Va., and
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., are seeking a three-year freeze
on further NATO members.
</P>
<P>
They have also asked Lott to delay action on the overall
measure, at least until after Congress' April recess.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on Monday, Lott said he still hoped to
get to the NATO bill later this week, but that it might be
postponed until next week because of other matters before the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
"The president has indicated that he would hope that we could
do it sometime this week, because he's going to be out of town
next week," Lott said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton plans a week-long trip to Africa next week.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Refuses Suggestion of Dialogue with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
refused to take any suggestions that Washington should have a
dialogue with Iraq as a way to clarify U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe it would be wise to have a dialogue with
Iraq," State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He was answering a reporter's question of what the United
States would react if King Hussein of Jordan raises the
suggestion for a possible dialogue when he visits Washington,
probably this week.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have much to say to Iraq, and until they do what
the international community has demanded for so long, this isn't
a question where there's a confused message that needs to be
clarified with direct discussions," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Reports on Sunday said top Iraqi officials expressed their
wishes to hold direct dialogue with the United States and
Britain so as to establish a kind of "normal relations."
</P>
<P>
But Rubin made an immediate response that Washington would
not change its policy toward Iraq and said what Baghdad should
do was to fully comply with U.N. resolutions on weapons
inspections.

<HEADLINE> EU Farm Ministers Vote to Ease Ban on British Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Agriculture ministers from the
15 European Union (EU) member countries Monday voted to ease a ban
on British beef exports which was imposed two years ago over mad
cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The farm ministers voted to show their support for a proposal
allowing some beef to be shipped from Northern Ireland, where
computer records can show cattle to be free of brain-wasting mad
cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The vote, which offered a ray of hope to all Britain's cattle
farmers, was "the first step in the resumption of trade in beef
between the U.K. and the rest of the world," Britain's junior farm
minister Lord Donoughue told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
British Farm Minister Jack Cunningham said this was "excellent
news" for all Britain's cattle farmers who have been crippled by
the two-year-old trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
"The decision recognizes that our beef is safe to export," said
the British farm minister, adding that the vote had demonstrated
that the approach of the British government was getting results.
</P>
<P>
Only two EU farm ministers -- Germany and Belgium -- Monday
voted against the plan. Luxembourg and Spain abstained from the
vote.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal by the farm ministers, a final inspection
visit to Northern Ireland will be carried out by EU food safety
experts before the final decision is taken to ease the ban.
</P>
<P>
Germany and Belgium said they wanted another ministerial
meeting after the inspection visit to decide on whether the ban
should be eased.
</P>
<P>
Phelim O'Neill, marketing manager of the Livestock and Meat
Commission for Northern Ireland, said he expected exports could
resume within six to eight weeks, but acknowledged that was just
the start of the battle to regain lost market share.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be trying to win back an export market worth an
estimated 180 million pounds (300 million U.S. dollars) before the
ban was in place," he said. "But we now also have to battle
against a strong pound."

<HEADLINE> Greece Hails EU Foreign Ministers' Decision on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday voiced its
satisfaction about the decision made by European Union (EU)
foreign ministers in Edinburgh, Scotland, on the Cyprus membership
talks which will start on schedule on March 31.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing, acting Greek government spokesman
Nikos Athanasakis welcomed the proposal by Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides inviting the Turkish Cypriots to take part in the
Cyprus accession negotiating team as "positive and generous."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey could abandon
their intransigence. The island's entry into the EU would also
benefit the Turkish Cypriots, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day informal meeting in the Scottish capital
Edinburgh at the weekend, both Greece and France withdrew rival
amendments to the British presidency's proposed opening position
in Cyprus' accession talks, which does not make a joint
Greek-Turkish Cypriot delegation a condition for negotiations or
make the resolution of the division of Cyprs an explicit condition
for accession.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the meeting, Paris had insisted that the EU
should freeze its talks with Nicosia if it was not possible to
negotiate with a joint team representing both sides of the divided
island while Athens had threatened to block the entire EU
expansion process if the negotiations could not begin as scheduled
at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island in the wake of an abortive coup
backed by Athens.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the EU decided in Brussels to include Cyprus to the
list of countries waiting to join the group, but Turkish Cypriots
and Turkey opposed such a move by the EU.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
looks forward to a return visit to China and meeting with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin "sooner rather than later," said White House
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We have... enjoyed high-level exchanges with the People's
Republic (of China) that included successful summit meetings with
President Clinton," said White House spokesman Mike McCurry.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a White House spokesman announced that Clinton has
decided to move the summit with Jiang up to June or July from a
later date this year.
</P>
<P>
"Our expectation is that it will come either at the very end of
June or possibly going into the early part of July," said James
Steinberg, deputy national security advisor.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue our cooperative work on a broad range of
things that reflect the expansive nature of this bilateral
relationship, while not missing the opportunity for dialogue and
exchange of views on those areas in which there are clear
differences between our two governments," said McCurry.
</P>
<P>
Jiang visited the United States last October. It was the first
visit to the U.S. by a Chinese head of state in 12 years.

<HEADLINE> Qatar's Emir to Visit Egypt on Mending Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad bin
Khalifa al-Thani is due to visit Egypt later this month to patch
up relations between the two countries, a Qatari government
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari Foreign Ministry's spokesman Fawaz al Attiyah was
quoted by the Qatari news agency as saying that the emir would go
to Cairo on March 23 for talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak "to iron out differences" between Doha and Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have been strained after a
war of words between them on the Qatar-hosted the fourth Middle
East and North Africa economic conference in last November. Egypt
joined Arab states in boycotting the meeting to protest against
Israel's participation.
</P>
<P>
The row worsened when Doha accused Cairo of masterminding a
failed attempt to topple the Qatari government in 1996. Egypt has
denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz mediated in a meeting
between the Qatari emir and the Egyptian president in Riyadh last
December to end the rift.
</P>
<P>
But tension increased again after Cairo imposed visa
requirements on Qatari visitors while Doha sacked hundreds of
Egyptian employees working in some Qatari governmental
departments.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Warns Against Settlers' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The head of Palestinian
security forces in West Bank Jibril Rajoub warned Monday Jewish
settlers against intruding Palestinian-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Hebron, Rajoub said any settlers who entered
the self-rule areas to harm Palestinians could not come out
alive. He was apparently commenting on the incident Friday night
when a group of Jewish settlers entered the Palestinian-rule
area of Hebron and triggered clashes with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen people, including eight Palestinian journalists, were
hurt during the clashes as Israeli soldiers fired rubber
bullets to disperse the Palestinian protesters. One Israeli
soldier and two border policemen were also wounded in the
rioting.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police have begun investigating the incident, and
issued summons to fifteen Jewish settlers in Hebron who
organized the Friday march into the Palestinian area of the
divided city. The settlers claimed that they staged the protest
only after shots were fired at the Abu Sneineh quarter.
</P>
<P>
Until Monday, most of the settlers summoned have ignored
the police summons. Hebron settlers' spokesman Naomi Arnon said
most of the organizers were from other areas.
</P>
<P>
The recent wave of Israeli-Palestinian clashes was sparked by
the Tuesday killing of three Palestinians by Israeli soldiers at
a roadblock near Hebron.
</P>
<P>
About one hundred Palestinian protesters in the territories
have been wounded by Israeli soldiers. With the help of
Palestinian police to calm the tension, the violence began
subsiding in the territories from Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Germany Urges Milosevic to Talk With Kosovo Albanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The involvement of Slobodan
Milosevic, president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, is
important to negotiating a resolution of the Kosovo crisis, a
senior diplomat in Bonn said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The central point is whether Belgrade is prepared to open a
(serious) dialogue with the Kosovo Albanians," the government
source said on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot expect the Albanians to sit at a table with the
Serbians while the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia says it has
nothing to do with it," said the source.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations need to be between Yugoslav President Milosevic
and the Albanians, said the diplomat.
</P>
<P>
So far Belgrade has dispatched Serbia's deputy premier, Ratko
Markovic, as the representative for the talks.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Kosovo Albanians Monday for the third time
boycotted talks with Belgrade originally scheduled in the Kosovo
district capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
They said they would not enter into conditional talks with
Serbian officials or allow them to force a `constitutional
framework" on the region that abolished its autonomy in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Markovic said the ethnic Albanians attempted an unrealistic
goal of the secession of Kosovo (from Serbia), which could not be
achieved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The senior diplomat in Bonn said the Kosovo Albanians were
right to boycott negotiations and demand a better framework for
talks on the future of Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia loses about 1.7 billion
U.S. dollars annually because of the trade discrimination, Russian
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a session of the Consultative Council for Foreign
Investments, Chernomyrdin said that this year the Russian
government will start intensive talks on admission to the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
He noted Russia must carefully verify the tariff tactics
coordinate its moves with partners in the Customs Union. The
Russian government had sent an official application for membership
to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin noted that Russia's admission to the organization
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Council "may considerably facilitate
the inflow of foreign capital to Russia's Far East and
Trans-Baikal region."
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet is drafting a national plan for the liberalization
of trade and investments, which Russia will offer its partners in
this international organization, Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
The volume of foreign investment in the country's economy
amounted to about 10 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, including 4
billion U.S. dollars in direct investments, a report cited
Chernomyrdin as saying.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Supports Setting up Cotton Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chamber of Commerce and
Industry (CCI) of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) strongly supported the suggestion to form a
SAARC cotton forum to maximize the benefits from cotton.
</P>
<P>
The message came at a meeting Monday in Karachi between the
members of the Karachi Cotton Association (KCA) and SAARC Chamber
of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Earlier KCA had proposed to have a cotton association or
committee within SAARC to look after the interests of
cotton-producing member countries.
</P>
<P>
Chaudary Mirani, member of the executive committee of the SAARC
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that western world was
exploiting cotton business from South Asia and SAARC cotton
committee or association would protect the interests of its member
countries.
</P>
<P>
Mirani said the three members including Pakistan, India and
Bangladesh were producing cotton in the region and they should
exchange expertise amongst them.
</P>
<P>
This forum should exchange information and expertise in
technology, production, seed development and import and export to
benefit each other, said Mirani.
</P>
<P>
He said the western world was imposing uncalled barriers,
including anti-dumping, child labor clause on the exports from
developing countries, particularly from South Asia.
</P>
<P>
He believed that a cotton forum within SAARC is necessary and
practical to project the interests of the south Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> EU Welcomes ERM Entry of Greek Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) welcomed
the entry of the Greek currency drachma in the exchange rate mechanism
(ERM) of the European monetary system and the fixing of a new
central rate for the Irish pound.
</P>
<P>
President of the European Commission, Jacques Santer, and
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the European commissioner responsible for
economic, monetary and financial affairs, made the announcement in
Brussels on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The chosen central rate for the drachma is in line with the
fundamental characteristics of the Greek economy," they said in a
declaration.
</P>
<P>
Share prices rose sharply in Athens early Monday following a
weekend decision to admit the drachma to the European Monetary
System and to devalue it by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
EU finance officials decided this weekend to admit Greece into
the European Monetary system at a new rate of 357 drachmas to the
European Currency Unit compared with a previous trading rate of
313.9.
</P>
<P>
The move was apparently aimed at boosting Greece's hopes of
joining the euro single currency, which it wants to do by 2001.
</P>
<P>
EMU is due to launch next January with Britain, Sweden and
Denmark opting out of early entry.
</P>
<P>
The Commission also said in the declaration that the new
central rate for the Irish pound was completely in line with the
performance of the Irish economy and the market situation.
</P>
<P>
The Irish punt has been the strongest currency in the ERM for
several months, going as high as 2.70 marks, far above its central
ERM rate of 2.41 marks.

There has been improvement in balance of payments position and

has been successfully managed its currency, the Vietnamese dong,
Vietnam News Agency Monday quoted Finance Minister Nguyen Sing

Almost all changes in prices have taken place under the state

Thanks to the close control of the circulation of local foreign
currencies, Vietnam has increased its reserve of foreign
currencies to meet the import requirement, the minister said.

He noted that Vietnam's foreign currency reserve can ensure
the country's import for many weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Fitch IBCA, the international
rating agency, downgraded the long-term foreign currency rating of
Indonesia to B- Monday.
</P>
<P>
The short-term foreign currency rating is maintained at B but
the long-term local currency rating is downgraded to BB+ from
BBB-.
</P>
<P>
These ratings apply to public and publicly guaranteed senior,
unsecured debt and set a ceiling for all other Indonesian
entities, according to IBCA.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating economic and financial situation since last
summer has raised grave concerns among financial institutes all
over the world about Indonesia's capacity to service its external
debt.
</P>
<P>
At current exchange rates, much of its corporate sector is
technically bankrupt and an unofficial debt moratorium is already
in place.
</P>
<P>
IBCA said sovereign default, however unintentional, could also
become a real possibility unless Indonesia reaches an agreement
with the IMF very soon and is seen to deliver on its commitments.
</P>
<P>
The agency commented that it is essential that any modification
to Indonesia's program, agreed by the IMF, offers a credible way
forward to restore the economy to sustainable health, and not just
a quick fix.

He also accused Ugandan President Museveni, Rwandan Vice

cooperation" to a new government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP), the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general body meeting of the Congress
Parliamentary Party (CPP) after her election as its chairperson,
Sonia Gandhi said her party would offer constructive cooperation
to the new government for those policies which were in the
interests of the country.
</P>
<P>
Sonia Gandhi, Congress star campaigner in the just-concluded
general elections to the 12th Lower House of the Parliament,
succeeded Sitaram Kesri to become the new president of the
Congress party last Saturday at a meeting of the Congress Working
Committee, the highest decision-making body of the party.
</P>
<P>
Indian President Kocheril Raman Narayanan appointed BJP leader
Atal Behari Vajpayee on Sunday to form a new government and
Vajpayee will be sworn in as Prime Minister on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sonia Gandhi, whose Italian origin gave her opponents
propaganda grist, gave no indication of the Congress' stand on the
crucial confidence vote in Lok Sabha sought by Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
She said that she would measure up to the responsibility which
the Congress has imposed on her.
</P>
<P>
Appealing to the party members to strengthen their resolve to
combat communalism and sectarianism, she admitted that the
Congress did not have the privilege to provide leadership in
government formation after the recent elections.
</P>
<P>
The Italian-born chairperson constituted a six-member committee
to coordinate with other secular forces both within and outside
the parliament to devise strategies to challenge the BJP-led
government.
</P>
<P>
The dual chief of the century-old Congress is neither a member
of Lok Sabha, the House of the People, nor a member of Rajya
Sabha, the Council of states.
</P>
<P>
The 52-year-old widow of assassinated former prime minister
Rajiv Gandhi was born into a family of modest means in an obscure
village on the banks of river Po neat Turin, northwest of Italy.

<HEADLINE> IDB Attaches Importance to Social Programs in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- More than half the lending
program of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) during 1997
was dedicated to social sector investment, poverty reduction and
modernization of the state, the IDB reported here Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to its 1997 annual report released Monday, the IDB's
6 billion U.S. dollar lending program made the bank the main
source of development finance for the region for the fourth
consecutive year, particularly for the smaller countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The IDB's disbursements reached a record high of 5.4 billion
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The bank also approved 77 million dollars in grants for 318
technical cooperation projects in 1997, investing in such areas as
project preparation, sector studies, institutional strengthening,
human resources and regional integration.
</P>
<P>
In the social area, the IDB approved 47 projects totaling some
2.6 billion dollars, or 43 percent of the value of the lending
program, for investments in education, health, water and
sanitation, social investment funds and reforms, urban development
and housing as well as environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
According to the 200-page report, loan approvals for direct
financing to the private sector for infrastructure projects
reached a record 320 million dollars as against 198 million
dollars a year earlier. Approval for syndicated loans reached 563
million dollars, an increase of 136 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Latin America and the Caribbean grew 5.2 percent in 1997, the
second most rapid rate of growth since 1980, and inflation
continued its steady decline of recent years. The median inflation
rate for the region last year was less than 9 percent, compared
with 11 percent in 1996, which capital flows reached a record 70
billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Water Week Begins in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The annual Water Week
began on Monday in Pretoria in a bid to ensure all people in the
country to have access to clean water.
</P>
<P>
South African Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal, who
inaugurated the event, said that the government has been doing
its utmost to speed up water projects in the country so that all
South Africans could have proper access to water in the early
years of the new century.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, over two million more people enjoyed
water supply, and the pace was being quickened.
</P>
<P>
The Water Week will be highlighted by various special
activities throughout the country, which include President Nelson
Mandela's participation at the opening of a water project in
KwaZulu Natal Province.
</P>
<P>
The theme of these activities is that all South Africans
should work together to conserve water, said Water Chief
Executive Vincent Bath.
</P>
<P>
He warned that "unless we begin using our water more
efficiently, we will run out of natural water suplies by the year
2020."
</P>
<P>
South Africa has been classified as a water-stressed country
in terms of international standards, he said. This situation
would not be changed by just two or three seasons of good rains.
</P>
<P>
Asmal also said that water conservation was vital, and much
progress had been made to change the thinking of South Africans
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"The community water supply and sanitation program is one of
the challenges by which we shall be judged by future
generations," said the minister.

<HEADLINE> Le Monde Plays Down Gains by Left Parties in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The French daily Le Monde Monday
played down the gains won by the leftist parties in the regional
elections Sunday, and highlighted the scores held out by the
far-right National Front and the newly erupting extreme-left
groups such as Lutte Ouvriere.
</P>
<P>
"The pluralist left has not really confirmed... its victory of
legislative elections of 1997," said Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
It estimated that the leftwing parties have only won 36.48
percent of the votes in France proper, 5.77 points lower than what
it won in the legislative elections and slightly higher than 35.85
percent won by the right wing opposition Rally for the Republic
(RPR) and Union for French Democracy (UDF).
</P>
<P>
The Socialist-led leftwing parties will have absolute majority
in the regional parliament of Limoussin in the mountainous Massive
Central, and relative majority in nine other regions, while the
RPR and UDF will have absolute majority in the local parliament of
Pays de la Loire, a castle-dotted region extending from the Loire
Valley, and six other regions, according to Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
The extreme-left groups, such as a previously unknown party
called Lutte Ouvriere (Workers' Fight), won 4.38 percent of the
votes -- mostly coming from those who voted for the Socialists and
Communists in 1997 -- and will enter some regional councils or
parliaments for the first time.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Leaders on Unilateral Pullout From Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli leaders reiterated
Israel's readiness to carry out immediately a unilateral
withdrawal from South Lebanon provided that Lebanon assumes its
security responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at a ceremony to inaugurate a police
station in Jerusalem, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Israel is ready to pull out from Lebanon immediately according
to United Nations resolution 425, if Lebanese government fulfills
its international obligations on preventing terror attacks against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Israeli government would conduct orderly
discussions on Lebanese issue in the coming days. He said the
425 resolution also required Lebanon to take its international
obligations of maintaining peace and stability in South Lebanon
after an Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Netanyahu demanded Lebanese government dismantle
the anti-Israeli guerrilla forces Hezbollah (Party of God) and
promise not to harm Israeli allies in the region, especially
the pro-Israeli South Lebanese Army.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting of Knesset (Parliament) Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
also said that Israel would try to reach an agreement with
Lebanon on the withdrawal. He stressed that Israeli troops are
happy to leave the region if Lebanese government exercises
authority to safeguard the safety of Israeli northern border.
</P>
<P>
The committee also discussed a withdrawal proposal put forward
by National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon who launched the
aggression against Lebanon in 1982 when he was the defense
minister. The military action led to the establishment of
so-called South Lebanon Security Zone in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Sharon proposed a phased unilateral pullout from South
Lebanon, which contains a stern warning against the failure by
Lebanese government in preventing guerrilla attacks against
Israel's north.
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Uzi Landau came out in support for Sharon's
proposal, saying this formula would not allow Syria to benefit
from the pullout.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise in the guerrilla war in South Lebanon and
a desire to deviate attention on the stalled Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks prompted the latest Israeli diplomatic offensive on
Lebanese pullout.
</P>
<P>
But analysts remain doubtful if the Israeli initiative has
even a moderate chance of success given the opposition of
Syria, which is believed to use the Lebanese issue as a
bargaining chip to retrieve the Golan Heights occupied by
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Iran Stresses Political Aspect of Hajj Ritual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 16 (Xinhua) - Iran Monday stressed the political
aspect of the Muslim hajj rituals as Iranian pilgrims started to
leave for the annual hajj performance in Mecca of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"There is no distinction between the political dimension of
the hajj rituals and those pertaining to worship, Mohammadi
Reyshahri, representative of Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei said at a special ceremony at Tehran international
airport when seeing off the first group of Iranian pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
He said the Iranian pilgrims are messengers of unity and
amity and those sowing discord among Muslims should know that
they have no place among the Muslims who would foil their
conspiracies, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not mention whether the Iranian pilgrims
would stage anti-U.S. political demonstrations again during the
hajj rituals in Mecca. The demonstrations during the past few
years seriously harmed relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran-Riyadh relations warmed up only after the election
of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami who advocated friendly
and peaceful coexistence with regional countries.
</P>
<P>
Before the first group of Iranian pilgrims left Iran,
President Khatami sent his Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi to
Saudi Arabia, handing over a letter to the Saudi Crown
Prince Amir Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Although the content of the letter was not revealed,
observers believed that Khatami expected a coordination from the
Saudi side with Iran over hajj issue in order to keep
bilateral relations moving forward.
</P>
<P>
"We hope effective steps will be taken to restore the rights
of the Muslims thanks to the insight and the wisdom of the Saudi
statesmen," Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah
Mohajerani also said at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that some 87,000 Iranian pilgrims would
attend the hajj rituals in Mecca this year.

<HEADLINE> Cook Says "Anxious" to Visit Har Homa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said on Monday that he wanted to see for himself the
situation in Har Homa in traditionally Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Cook made the remark when talking with British reporters who
accompanied him on his flight from Cyprus to Cairo, where he was
to pay a four-hour visit at the start of his Middle East trip.
</P>
<P>
The British top diplomat's planned visit to Har Homa, where
Israel is expanding Jewish settlement despite world outcry, has
arisen controversy in Israel, which went out its way to prevent
the trip.
</P>
<P>
Cook, however, defended his decision. "I am anxious to see Har
Homa for myself. I would have thought that it would be in the
interests of both parties including the government of Israel that
were informed of seeing the situation myself," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's construction of Jewish buildings at Har Homa in March
1997 sent the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations into a
impasse, which has so far remained unbroken.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Har Homa trip was part of his visit to the
Palestinian National Authority, Cook said he would view the site
"from land which is under the Palestinian control," stopping short
of saying he would set foot on the soil there.
</P>
<P>
Israel on Monday threatened to deny the European Union (EU) as
a mediator in the peace process if Cook insists on going
there. Britain now holds the rotating presidency of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Cook told reporters that Britain and the EU opposed the Israeli
practice of settlement expansion, a stance he claimed is shared by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I do want to take this opportunity to say quite clearly that
our approach has been impartial and that we do want to make
progress on the peace process with both parties," said Cook.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Cairo, Cook, together with EU Mideast peace
envoy Miguel Moratinos, held an hour-long meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on ways to
revive the peace process, provide economic assistance to Iraqi
people and solve the Libya-West crisis over Lockerbie incident.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Cook said the European Union (EU) would
continue to support the Middle East peace process and the
Palestinians as it has done in the past.
</P>
<P>
Cook would hold further talks with his Egyptian counterpart on
bilateral ties and an EU proposal aimed at pushing forward the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for Palestinian commitment to Israel's
security demands, and urges Israel to implement a significant
troop redeployment in the West Bank, halt settlement expansion and
support Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
Cook was leaving here later in the afternoon for Jordan to
continue Mideast trip, which also includes Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule areas, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He had been scheduled to arrive here Sunday night, but was
forced to stop over in Cyprus due to a sandstorm that hit Egypt,
Lebanon, Cyprus and other regional states.

KUWAIT CITY, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Five foreign delegations will

An Irish delegation with representatives of 11 companies will

<HEADLINE> Greek Drachma Devalues, Cyprus Little Affected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The devaluation of the Greek
currency drachma will have only marginal repercussions on Cypriot
economy, the Central Bank of Cyprus said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said in a press release that these
repercussions would be direct and indirect and relate to bilateral
trade, tourism and exports to third countries.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government recently devalued the drachma by 14
percent when the currency entered the European Exchange Rate
Mechanism in preparation for a unified European currency in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said Greek exports to Cyprus will be more
competitive while Cypriot goods exported to Greece will be less
competitive after the depreciation of drachma.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade transactions between Cyprus and Greece is
too small, reaching only 7.5 percent, compared with the total
trade transactions between Cyprus and overseas markets, the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism will be directly affected, however, since Greek
tourists will have to pay more for their holidays in Cyprus while
Cypriots will benefit from their visits in Greece.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the number of Greek tourists visiting the
Mediterranean island is small and any fluctuation will not affect
the total number of tourists to Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot National Guard Chief to Be Replaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus announced on Monday that
its National Guard (armed forces) Commander, Greek Lieutenant
General Nicolaos Vorvolakos will be replaced by his compatriot
Major General Demetrios Demou.
</P>
<P>
The procedure for the replacement is underway, and the time
when Demou takes over the post will be decided by Cypriot Defense
Minister Yiannakis Omirou and his Greek counterpart Akis
Tsohatzopoulos at a meeting in Athens later this month, Cypriot
government spokesman Chirstos Stylianides told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between the two countries, many senior posts
of the Cypriot National Guard are taken by Greek officers.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said the defense ministers of the two neighbors
would also discuss the inauguration of an air base near the
southwest coast, which is seen by Turkey and Turkish Cypriots as a
threat.
</P>
<P>
Arrangements for the ceremony will be decided after evaluating
Cyprus' strategic plans with regard to the peace process of the
island and the accession talks with the European Union due to
start on March 31, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The air base near the western coastal town of Paphos was
constructed last January under a joint defense pact signed between
Cyprus and Greece in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, however, has warned that
if Greek military aircraft take off from the air base, their wings
"will be broken" by Turkish warplanes.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed coup by Greek Cypriot supporters of a union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1984 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Turkey, against
the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus dominated by the
Greek Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Denies Israeli Statement on Assassination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordan denied Monday that the
Israeli government had informed the Jordanian government its
decision to assassinate anti-Israeli Hamas leader Khalid Mashaal
before carrying it out.
</P>
<P>
Acting prime Minister Abdullah Ensour told a press conference
here that they (the Israeli government) never talked to the Jordanian
government about their decision to kill Mashaal, who was seriously
poisoned in Amman in September last year by Israeli Agents.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon made a statement
to Israeli television Saturday saying that Israel had informed
Jordan that it intended "to finish the job" of assassinating
Mashaal, a Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement) leader operating in
Jordan, but not on Jordanian soil.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan knows nothing about it," said Ensour who is incumbent
Deputy Prime Minister for Services and Minister for Information
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Mashaal is a Jordanian citizen protected by the Jordanian
law and the leadership of Jordan and we will never accept
such threats to his life," Ensour told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli statements did not tally with statements made by
the Israeli government earlier that it was willing to regain
understanding with Jordan, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We denounce these statements. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs
will take the appropriate action," Ensour said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the acting prim minister said, Jordan had clarified
its position on the issue when Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs
Talal Sata'an Al-Hassan on behalf of the government summoned
Israeli Ambassador to Jordan Odid Airan on Sunday to inform him of
Jordan's protest and rejection to the statements.
</P>
<P>
Referring whether the Jordanian government will have special
measures to protect Mashaal from Israeli assassination, Ensour
said that the government would provide Mashaal with "moral and
material protection."
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli secret agents were arrested in Amman for trying
to kill Mashaal by injecting poisonous chemical into his left
ear before his office on September 23, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Mashaal was rescued after King Hussein of Jordan pressed
Israel to provide the antidote.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian-Israeli relations sharply deteriorated over the

<HEADLINE> Kenya Urged to Enact Law to Fight TB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya was urged Monday to enact
laws prohibiting smoking in public places and the emission of
dark smokes so as to curb the tuberculosis (TB) which now is fast
spreading in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
The TB cases in Kenya shot up from about 10,000 in 1987 to
42,000 last year, 40 percent of them associated with the HIV
virus which causes AIDS, a high-level African medical conference
opening on the day was told.
</P>
<P>
A combination of poverty, urbanization, malnutrition and the
escalating HIV situation has led to the four-fold increase of the
disease, said Daniel Kibuga, a senior official of the
International Union against TB and Lung Disease (IUATLD).
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Chief Justice Z.R. Chesoni, when addressing the 12th
IUATLD African Regional meeting, called the parliament to enact
tough legislation measures to curb smoking in public places and
to prohibit the emission of dark smoke from factories or motor
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The law, he argued, should provide a list of authorized fuels,
with the government intensifying public awareness education on
the need to keep the environment clean.
</P>
<P>
Where smoke is emitted from a chimney of a building, the
occupier of the building should be charged with an offense,
unless the occupier can prove that the emission resulted only
from the use of an authorized fuel.
</P>
<P>
The four-day IUATLD meeting was attended by about 300
top-ranking medical practitioners and researchers from Europe and
within the continent. The IUATLD, dated from 1867, is said to be
the oldest international body dealing with health in the world.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the meeting also predicted that by 2020 nearly one
billion more people worldwide will be infected with the airborne
illness, which is spread by coughing or sneezing.
</P>
<P>
TB is said to be the leading killer of adults worldwide and
causes more deaths than malaria and AIDS combined. Currently it
is estimated that two million people die in the world every year
and the threat seems to be increasing.
</P>
<P>
Treatments for TB are effective but they must be taken
repeatedly over at least eight months usually.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebuilding Challenges Kabbah: ECOMOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The greatest challenge before
Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah is rebuilding the
country and creating an environment conducive for foreign
investment inflow, the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG)
has said.
</P>
<P>
The process of rebuilding the country should start with the
re-organization of the civil service, the judiciary and armed
forces, said ECOMOG Force Commander Maj.-Gen. Timothy Shelpidi.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional force liberated the country last month by
overthrowing the military junta, paving the way for Kabbah to
return a week ago from more than nine months exile in neighboring
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
"No foreign investor would like to invest in a country that is
not secure and safe," Shelpidi said during a meeting with Kabbah,
according to an ECOMOG statement from its headquarters in Liberia
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The commander called on Sierra Leoneans to cooperate with the
force to realize the objective of restoring peace, security and
stability to all parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Shelpidi was quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria Monday as
telling Kabbah that the western part of Sierra Leone, where some
rebels are still in hiding, would soon be cleared of rebel
activity.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for the speedy implementation of the
disarmament process to avoid arms ending up in the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, he noted that arms could end up in the hands of
youths recruited by the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), a
partner of the junta which overthrew Kabbah's government in a
coup on May 25 last year.

<HEADLINE> Germany's SPD to Center Election Campaign on Jobs, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Germany's main opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD) today unveiled its election platform,
vowing to cut unemployment and conduct reforms to restore social
justice.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to replace Chancellor Helmut Kohl's center-right ruling
coalition in the next general elections on September 27 this year,
the SPD said it would go into the election campaign with the most
pro-market program in the party's history, with job creation,
fundamental economic and social reforms being the central goals.
</P>
<P>
To combat a record high unemployment of about 4.8 million, the
SPD pledged tax reforms as early as 1999 with the aim to cut the
lowest income tax rate from the current 25.9 percent to 15
percent, and the highest tax rate from 53 percent to 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in case of an election victory, the SPD would also
introduce an urgent program to create about 100,000 jobs for the
young jobless.
</P>
<P>
The SPD also pledged to double state spending on education and
research within the next five years, and called for more flexible
and shorter working hours and more part-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
Under the SPD election platform, which still needs to be
endorsed by a party convention next month, big assets owners would
face new tax levies while university students and families with
children could count on more state financial help.
</P>
<P>
On foreign policies, the SPD supports the idea of setting
mandatory goals for reducing unemployment and advocates European
Union-wide coordination of financial and economic policies.
</P>
<P>
It also backs the French call for a stronger European role in
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The next German general elections will put SPD chancellor
candidate Gerhard Schroeder against Kohl, who is seeking an
unprecedented fifth term in office since 1982. Results of current
opinion polls are all in favor of Schroeder.

<HEADLINE> Angola: Ex-Chief Expelled from Opposition Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) said on Monday that its former
General Secretary Eugenio Manuvakola has been expelled.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party announced this in its headquarters in the
central city of Ballundo.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Angolan News Agency, UNITA issued a
news release, saying that the decision of expelling Manuvakola
was made by its Political Commission last weekend. It said that
the Political Commission decided to expel the former general
secretary because he has violated the party constitution.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in its announcement that as of that day,
Manuvakola would not be a member of UNITA any more and he should
be responsible for himself. He can no longer speak for UNITA and
his speeches and political activities will have nothing to do
with the party.
</P>
<P>
Manuvakola has been one of the senior leaders of UNITA. He
entered the Central Committee in 1975 and became one of the
Politburo members in November 1988. He was elected as the General
Secretary of UNITA in 1992.
</P>
<P>
UNITA expelled Manuvakola largely because of his critical
speech against the party leaders on the official radio last
Friday, in which he said that UNITA was already incapable of
waging a war against the government and expressed his hope that
UNITA members should give up their idea of doing that and isolate
its President Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Manuvakola also said that except a peaceful solution, there is
no way out and Savimbi should be aware of this and discard his
absurd attitude toward the peace process. Savimbi always plans to
find a military solution instead of a peaceful one.
</P>
<P>
In November 1994, Manuvakola, representing UNITA, signed a
peaceful agreement with the Angolan government in Lusaka, the
capital city of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Because of his dispute with the leaders of UNITA on the peace
process, Manuvakola was discharged from the position of the
General Secretary.
</P>
<P>
Manuvakola fled Ballundo where he had been jailed and arrived
in Luanda in November 1997, and after that he still regarded
himself a member of UNITA and declared that "without Savimbi,
UNITA will exist just the same."

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Hopes for Russia's Help in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia believes that Russia
can play a very important role in settling the Kosovo crisis, the
Interfax news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Ambassador in Moscow Danilo
Markovic, commenting on the coming trip by Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov to several former Yugoslav republics,
said that Russia has supported and is continuing to provide
support for the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Markovic meanwhile expressed regret that the Contact Group on
former Yugoslavia in its statement on the situation with Kosovo
approved in London last week did not set a clear line separating
"terrorist activity from legal actions by law enforcement agencies
within the bounds of struggle against terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group consists of Russia, the United States,
Britain, France, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade has met the main demand of the Contact Group and
appointed a representative for talks with leaders of the Albanian
community in Kosovo, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
The group's decision should influence the position of Albania,
which supports the separatists, he said.
</P>
<P>
Markovic declared that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would
be glad if Albania regarded this problem as a domestic problem of
a friendly neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
It was known that the Contact Group called on the U.N. Security
Council to consider a comprehensive arms embargo on Kosovo on
March 9, when holding a meeting on the level of foreign ministers.
But many Security Council members held that the Kosovo crisis was
an internal affairs of Yugoslavia and that the U.N. Security
Council should not be involved in the matter.

MOSCOW, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Some 48,000 Russian officers will
be laid off before the end of the year due to a merger of the
military air defense troops, Col. Gen. Anatoly Kornukov, the
military air force commander-in-chief, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Kornukov, who is
currently inspecting the Zabaikalye Military District, said that
about 125,000 servicemen and 39 generals will be laid off from the
military air force and the air defense troops this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the cuts will in no way afflict the combat readiness
of the military air force or Russia's security, the general said.
Aircraft and equipment in the military air force and the air
defense troops will undergo necessary repairs, he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In his view, the military potential will rise due to quality

Kornukov said the military air force will not receive new

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Calls for Return of Peace to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
said in Djibouti Monday that regional leaders should make more
efforts to end the protracted conflicts in Somalia and Sudan so
that peace can return to the whole Horn of Africa region.
</P>
<P>
"The conflict in Somalia remains a matter of great concern to
us all," he said at the annual summit of the seven-member
Inter-Governmental Authority of Development (IGAD) opening the
day, according to a Kenya News Agency report.
</P>
<P>
The 73-year-old president urged all Somali leaders to create a
conducive environment to "seriously consider restoring Somalia to
her feet."
</P>
<P>
On the same day, local press reported that Somali warlord
Hussein Mohamed Aideed, accompanied by top policy aides, visited
Kenya last week and left Saturday. Aideed's faction is one of
Somalia's strongest.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya can be an honest peace broker in Somalia," a member of
Aideed's delegation, asking anonymity, was quoted by local press
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Also at the summit, Moi re-confirmed that a new round of
face-to-face Sudan peace talks between the Khartoum government
and the southern rebels was scheduled to be held in Nairobi in
April and shuttle diplomacy had been done.
</P>
<P>
"Resolving the Sudanese conflict was not an easy process and
commitment to peace should be a paramount objective of those
involved in the long and protracted war," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called for the removal of hindrance to the free
movement of goods and services and set up an efficient
communication network within the IGAD, adding the body is mainly
a vehicle for regional integration and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Leaders attending the summit are presidents Hassan Aptidon of
Djibouti and Issaias Affeworki of Eritrea, Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi of Ethiopia, Uganda's Minister of State in Charge of
Regional Cooperation Rebecca Kadaga and Sudan's First Vice
President Ali Osman Mohamed Taha.
</P>
<P>
President of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland Mohamed
Ibrahim Egal arrived in Djibouti on Saturday ahead of the summit.
But both Aideed and him were unable to attend the summit since
Somaliland remains unrecognized as a country.

<HEADLINE> Greece Hails EU Foreign Ministers' Decision on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday voiced its
satisfaction about the decision made by European Union (EU)
foreign ministers in Edinburgh, Scotland, on the Cyprus membership
talks which will start on schedule on March 31.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing, acting Greek government spokesman
Nikos Athanasakis welcomed the proposal by Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides inviting the Turkish Cypriots to take part in the
Cyprus accession negotiating team as "positive and generous."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey could abandon
their intransigence. The island's entry into the EU would also
benefit the Turkish Cypriots, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day informal meeting in the Scottish capital
Edinburgh at the weekend, both Greece and France withdrew rival
amendments to the British presidency's proposed opening position
in Cyprus' accession talks, which does not make a joint
Greek-Turkish Cypriot delegation a condition for negotiations or
make the resolution of the division of Cyprs an explicit condition
for accession.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the meeting, Paris had insisted that the EU
should freeze its talks with Nicosia if it was not possible to
negotiate with a joint team representing both sides of the divided
island while Athens had threatened to block the entire EU
expansion process if the negotiations could not begin as scheduled
at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island in the wake of an abortive coup
backed by Athens.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the EU decided in Brussels to include Cyprus to the
list of countries waiting to join the group, but Turkish Cypriots
and Turkey opposed such a move by the EU.

It urged all parties to work together, seeking a ceasefire to
provide conducive environment for the next round of talks which
are scheduled to take place in April this year in Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the summit reviewed the 1997
annual report and planned activities for 1998.
</P>
<P>
It expressed concern over the impact of poor infrastructure on

<HEADLINE> King Hussein to Propose Direct U.S.-Iraq Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Hussein is to propose
to U.S. President Bill Clinton that a direct political dialogue be
opened between the U.S. and Iraq to iron out their difference,
Jordanian acting prime minister said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Abdullah Nsour said the
king will hold talks with Clinton Wednesday on a series of issues,
including relations between Iraq and the U.N Security Council and
the deadlocked Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hussein is on an official visit to the U.S. during which he is
to assess with U.S. officials the prospects for a permanent
solution to the Iraq-U.N. crisis over arms inspection, and a
breakthrough in the long-stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace
negotiations, said Nsour.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks will focus on Jordan's "ideas" for an end to
the crisis in Iraq, Jordan's largest trade partner, in accordance
with full implementation of U.N. resolutions and the agreement
signed last month by U.N. chief Kofi Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had threatened military attack on Iraq to force it
fully comply with U.N. resolutions and grant U.N. arms inspectors
full accession to suspected weapon sites.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with U.S. officials, Hussein will also
emphasize the need for Israel to implement the second phase troop
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his Washington trip, Hussein made a six-day tour of
the region early this month that included talks with the leaders
of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan paid visits to
the West Bank city Ramallah and Tel Aviv last Monday and Tuesday for
talks with Palestinian and Israeli officials on the stalled
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian king's visit to Washington followed a string of
Israeli officials' visits to Jordan aimed at restoring bilateral
relations deteriorated by Israel's botched assassination of a
Hamas leader in Amman last September.
</P>
<P>
Besides peace issues, Hussein would also make efforts to
procure more U.S. aid for Jordan, Ensour added.
</P>
<P>
The king had undergone regular medical check-up at the Mayo
Clinic, Minnesota, and was ensured there that he was in good
health, said Ensour.
</P>
<P>
The king will also hold extensive meetings on the Capitol Hill
with the Senate and House of Representative leaders as well as
high-level administration officials.

Minister Yevgeny Primakov to several former Yugoslav republics,
said that Russia has supported and is continuing to provide
support for the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Markovic meanwhile expressed regret that the Contact Group on
former Yugoslavia in its statement on the situation with Kosovo
approved in London last week did not set a clear line separating
"terrorist activity from legal actions by law enforcement agencies
within the bounds of struggle against terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group consists of Russia, the United States,
Britain, France, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade has met the main demand of the Contact Group and
appointed a representative for talks with leaders of the Albanian
community in Kosovo, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
The group's decision should influence the position of Albania,
which supports the separatists, he said.
</P>
<P>
Markovic declared that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would
be glad if Albania regarded this problem as a domestic problem of
a friendly neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
It was known that the Contact Group called on the U.N. Security
Council to consider a comprehensive arms embargo on Kosovo on
March 9, when holding a meeting on the level of foreign ministers.
But many Security Council members held that the Kosovo crisis was
an internal affairs of Yugoslavia and that the U.N. Security
Council should not be involved in the matter.

<HEADLINE> Greece Hails EU Foreign Ministers' Decision on  Cyprus Accession Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday voiced its
satisfaction about the decision made by European Union (EU)
foreign ministers in Edinburgh, Scotland, on the Cyprus membership
talks which will start on schedule on March 31.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing, acting Greek government spokesman
Nikos Athanasakis welcomed the proposal by Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides inviting the Turkish Cypriots to take part in the
Cyprus accession negotiating team as "positive and generous."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey could abandon
their intransigence. The island's entry into the EU would also
benefit the Turkish Cypriots, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day informal meeting in the Scottish capital
Edinburgh at the weekend, both Greece and France withdrew rival
amendments to the British presidency's proposed opening position
in Cyprus' accession talks, which does not make a joint
Greek-Turkish Cypriot delegation a condition for negotiations or
make the resolution of the division of Cyprs an explicit condition
for accession.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the meeting, Paris had insisted that the EU
should freeze its talks with Nicosia if it was not possible to
negotiate with a joint team representing both sides of the divided
island while Athens had threatened to block the entire EU
expansion process if the negotiations could not begin as scheduled
at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island in the wake of an abortive coup
backed by Athens.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the EU decided in Brussels to include Cyprus to the
list of countries waiting to join the group, but Turkish Cypriots
and Turkey opposed such a move by the EU.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rises in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The inflation rate continued to
rise in Kenya as February's underlying three-month annualized
inflation doubled January's to hit 26.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figure stood at 10.5 and 6.2 percent in January and
December respectively, according to the March edition of Monthly
Economic Review issued by the Central Bank of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The increase was traced mainly to the mounting costs of
transportation, the weak state of infrastructure damaged by
months of El Nino rains, as well as the hike in liquidity during
the last quarter of 1997, said the report reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The underlying month-on-month inflation rose to 10.6 percent
last month from 7.0 percent in January while the underlying
average annual inflation to 6.5 percent from 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The overall three-month annualized inflation jumped to 33.4
percent in February from 19.9 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the overall month-on-month inflation
went up slightly to 12.3 percent from 11.3 percent. The average
annual inflation was 11.3 percent, nearly the same level as in
January.
</P>
<P>
The country will have to pursue a tighter fiscal policy so as
to reduce the month-on-month inflation to within the targeted
range of less than five percent by June, when the current fiscal
year ends, the Central Bank said in the review.
</P>
<P>
Among the efforts, the annual expansion in broad money supply
in the year to June should also be revised from 11.0 percent to
8.3 percent, said the bank.

<HEADLINE> Roads to Telecommunications Liberalization Can Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- It takes time and efforts to
realize telecommunications liberalization and problems won't be
totally resolved by simply copying and simulating the models of
others, a Chinese official said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Deqiang, vice minister of the Ministry of Information
Technology and Telecom Industries of China, made the statement at
the opening session of the Second World Telecommunications Policy
Forum.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the three-day forum hosted by the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) is Trade in telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 delegates from the public and private sectors will
examine the regulatory and operational implications of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) agreement on trade in telecommunication
services, which entered into effect on February 5, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that the Chinese delegation had been fully aware of
the trend in which the globalization of communications and
restructuring of the telecommunications industry are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
He said that his delegation had been also fully aware of the
basic steps a country should take in reforming its
telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhou pointed out, the liberalization of
telecommunications is not the only panacea for developing
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, in reforming its telecommunications
sector, a country should take such steps in conformity with its
actual situation.
</P>
<P>
"The reform of the telecommunications sector will involve a
series of legislative changes on matters in regard to
telecommunications regulation," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that ITU members will find rational solutions
to these issues through cooperation and exchanges, pursuing mutual
understanding of each other's positions and observations and
seeking common ground while putting aside differences." he said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Stresses U.S. Key Role in Peace-making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Monday that Cairo seeks European efforts to break the
Middle East peace deadlock but it looks upon the U.S. as the major
mediator in the process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa was speaking at a joint news conference with British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook following the talks they held over a
working luncheon here Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The two examined developments of the peace process, bilateral
ties and future partnership between Egypt and the European Union,
whose presidency is currently exercised by Britain.
</P>
<P>
"We should give a full opportunity to all effective diplomatic
means, whether the American, the European or any other" provided
that their proposals are based on equitability, the land-for-peace
principle and honest mediation, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
"There is the feeling of responsibility and the exigency that
the Europeans must float bedrock ideas and initiatives, but in a
way that does not conflict with the American initiative, which we
all support," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt and Europe saw "identity of views" on the peace
process, both calling for a quick U.S. initiative especially as
Washington is the main sponsor of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa acknowledged there will be an imminent U.S. scheme on
ending the peace freeze. Any further slowing of the peace process
will expose the whole drive to a complete fiasco, he warned.
</P>
<P>
"Even though the aspired progress has not been secured, we
should never give up the stage for a backward and extremely
perilous stance like that adopted by the Israelis," he added.
</P>
<P>
The continued failure to revive the peace process evidences
that Israel does not want to comply with the Madrid or Oslo
conventions or the land-for-peace formula, said Moussa.
</P>
<P>
He added that the current mediation efforts would manage to
have Israel to reconsider its policies.
</P>
<P>
Cook is bringing a European initiative to help end the deadlock
in the Palestinian-Israeli talks due to Israel's controversial
settlement construction in Arab East Jerusalem despite
international outcry.
</P>
<P>
Cook, who left here for Amman after a four-hour visit at the
start of his Middle East trip, had met with President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day EU mission, Cook will also visit Israel,
the Palestinian self-rule areas, Syria and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Greece Decides to Intensify Money Market Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Monday decided to
intensify market checks to prevent profiteering following Greek
currency drachma's entry into the European exchange rate mechanism
(ERM) as of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting of the newly-formed coordinating
committee aimed at checking on price and ensuring the smooth
operation of the money market in general, Greek National Economy
and Finance Minister Yiannos Papantoniou said that the special
police squad was recently set up to combat financial crimes and
commerce ministry inspectors would intensify their checks.
</P>
<P>
Greece and the European Union's monetary committee agreed at
the weekend that the Greek national currency's new parity to the
European currency unit (ecu) was set at 357.00 drachma against one
ecu, denoting a 14 percent devaluation.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Greek business world and traders not to pass on
the consequences of the devaluation to prices by exercising self
restraint.
</P>
<P>
Repercussions for the Greek market would be small and
short-lived, he said, warning that those guilty of profiteering
would face extremely harsh penalties.
</P>
<P>
Greece's money market reacted favorably Monday to the Drachma's
entry into the ERM with the Athens general index closing 7.31
percent higher at 1,649.69 points.
</P>
<P>
Trading was extremely heavy with turnover at 41.1 billion
drachmas (about 4.3 million U.S. dollars) while interbank interest
rates dropping to 12.5-14.5 percent from 18-20 percent last
Friday.

<P>
ANKARA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Mongolia signed three
cooperation agreements here Monday in a bid to develop the
existing friendly ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A cooperation protocol, an agreement concerning the reciprocal
encouragement and protection of investments and a convention in
the field of veterinary medicine were signed during the visit
of Mongolian President Nachangyn Bagabandy, who arrived in Ankara
Monday morning for a two-day state visit to Turkey, the first
of its kind by a Mongolian president.
</P>
<P>
Following the official talks between Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel and Bagabandy, Demirel said that Turkey wanted to
develop the relations with Mongolia in every field, adding: "We
never depart Mongolia from Central Asian countries and we show
great concern about its development".
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president called on the Turkish businessmen to
invest in Mongolia to develop the economic ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Bagabandy said that he was satisfied with
Demirel's promise to provide support for Mongolia in the
international platform.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Parliamentary Speaker Hikmet Cetin said that
Turkey regards Mongolia as a brotherly state in Central Asia
during his meeting with Bagabandy in parliament.

<HEADLINE> US Confirms No Resolution Against China to Be Sponsored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States confirmed
Monday that it will not sponsor a censure on China's human rights
record in view of the changes in that Asian country.
</P>
<P>
The State Department Spokesman James Rubin said at a press
briefing that "We took this decision because of the steps taken
and the anticipation of further progress."
</P>
<P>
Press reports said that the U.S. decided to give up the attempt
to sponsor a resolution condemning China on human rights issue
just before the United Nation's Human Rights Commission meets in
Geneva this week.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that the State Department confirmed the
press reports. Washington and its allies have tried for almost
nine years to seek such a resolution, but they never succeeded.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decision was taken after China announced last week its
readiness to sign the International Covenant on Civil and
Political rights, a move hailed by the Administration as a
"significant step forward."
</P>
<P>
"We believe this step, when ratified, will be a major advance
in China's recognition and acceptance of the universality of human
rights," Rubin replied to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
China also agreed to sign the International covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights prior to the state visit to
the U.S. by Chinese President Jiang Zemin last October.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also noted that China has released a number of
prisoners and invited the U.N. Arbitrary Detention Working group
to visit Chinese prisons.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, China also agreed to create a U.S.-China
nongovernmental organization forum for discussion of human rights
issues.
</P>
<P>
Press commentaries here suggest that the U.S. decision was
intended to avoid further isolation as the European Union had
announced not to push for an anti-China resolution this year.
</P>
<P>
It is another significant measure taken by the U.S.
Administration regarding China's human rights record since U.S.
President Bill Clinton delinked the issue with trade in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"We believe they (Chinese) are moving forward to bring China
more into the fold on human rights principles, and we clearly have
seen progress in this area," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the decision did not mean that the
U.S. is satisfied with China's human rights record, vowing to
continue to speak out publicly about the U.S. concern.
</P>
<P>
China has said that it never intends to ignore the human rights
issue. But it has warned against foreign interference in its
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
On nonproliferation issue, Rubin said that Washington believes
that the Chinese are following through on their pledge of
nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
Defending the government's China policy, the spokesman
said, "Critics will criticize. They have to earn a living. We here
believe that we are doing the right thing for the United States of
America on China policy."
</P>
<P>
He refused to be specific about the date of President Clinton's
planned trip to China. Clinton announced last week he decided to
move up the visit to late June from later. No firm date has been
announced so far.

WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will meet later this month with the foreign
ministers of Germany, Russia, France, Britain and Italy to discuss
crisis in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing, State Department spokesman
James Rubin said Monday the meeting will be held in Bonn on March

</P>

High on the agenda of the meeting, which follows up the one in
London early this month, are how to contain the crisis and U.S.
plans to provide military training to other countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Albright had canceled plans to accompany President Bill Clinton
on a trip to Africa next week, thereby giving additional
prominence to the foreign ministers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
Since the crisis broke out in the region, the Clinton
administration has taken a tough policy towards Belgrade. It

<HEADLINE> Dhanapala's Visit to Baghdad Successful: Aziz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz said on Monday the visit to Baghdad by U.N. official Janatha
Dhanapala was successful and his talks with Iraqi officials were
constructive and scientific.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made the remark during an interview with a television
station of the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Dhanapala, head of the United Nations special group to escort
weapons inspectors into Iraq's presidential sites suspected of
hiding weapons of mass destruction, concluded his first, four-day
visit to Baghdad last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, he discussed with Aziz and other Iraqi
officials about ways and means of carrying out his mission.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the agreement signed on February 23 by United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan and himself is being implemented with
good faith.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Iraq will open eight presidential sites to
the special group of arms experts of the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) charged with overseeing the elimination of the banned
weapons and senior diplomats appointed by Annan.
</P>
<P>
Iraq formerly declared the presidential sites off-limits to the
U.N. arms inspectors, prompting the United States to unleash
threat of military actions to force Iraqi compliance.
</P>
<P>
Annan's mediation mission to Baghdad resulted in a deal with
the Iraqis, which successfully defused the crisis and averted an
imminent U.S.-led air strike.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the arms experts of UNSCOM in the special group would
be responsible for technical issue of the mission, and that the
political conclusion would rest with Dhanapala and the diplomats.
</P>
<P>
On relations with Gulf Arab countries, Aziz expressed Iraq's
wishes to normalize ties with them, including Kuwait, and exchange
visits to each other.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the relations would be based on mutual respect and
non-interference in others' internal affairs according to the Arab
League Charter.
</P>
<P>
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. Gulf Arab countries, notably Saudi
Arabia, supported Kuwait and joined the U.S.-coalition in the 1991
Gulf War which drove the Iraqi troops out of the sheikdom. Iraq's
invasion has scared its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Aziz criticized U.S. Congress' proposal to set up an
international court to try Iraqi leaders for war crimes. "This
proposal is ridiculous, and the U.S. Congress imagines that it
can order the world to act according to its will and intentions,"
Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Iraqi people are still suffering from the continuous
sanctions "which, in the viewpoints of all honest people and just
lawmen," is a genocidal crime which has led to the deaths of
thousands of innocent Iraqis every month.
</P>
<P>
The american administration insists on prolonging the sanctions
against Iraq, therefore, it should be responsible for the deaths
of those innocent people, said Aziz.

<HEADLINE> 31st Inter Arab Parliamentary Union Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The 31st session of the inter Arab
Parliamentary Union council opened here Monday with participation
of 19 Arab countries to discuss key regional issues.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day meeting, participants will mainly discuss
a number of regional and international issues, including the
stalled Middle East peace process, U.N.-Iraq deal over the weapons
inspection, Judaization of the holy city Jerusalem, Arab
solidarity and the establishment of Arab common market.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session, Yemeni Speaker House of
Representatives Abdulla Bin Hussein Al Ahmar said the meeting
takes place at a crucial and complex phase in the history of the
Arab nation, calling for reviving Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, he said peace shall never be
established unless the Palestinians are able to create their
independent state on the whole of their national territory with
Jerusalem as their capital.
</P>
<P>
Nor will peace be established unless the Golan Heights returns
to Syria, and south Lebanon liberated from Israeli occupation.
Otherwise, peace will have no real substance, and one party will
exercise power over the other, exposing the region to danger and
instability, he added.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that "it is our prime duty today to reconsider Arab
boycott of Israel, and to cease all forms of normalization (of
relations with Israel)."
</P>
<P>
On the Iraq-U.N. crisis, he spelled out the necessity of Iraq's
respect of U.N. resolutions imposed after its invasion of Kuwait,
particularly those related to the release of Kuwaiti and other
prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
But he indicated that the continuing U.S. threats to use force
after seven-and-half years of inspection, under the pretext of the
existence of Iraqi mass destruction weapons, is no longer
acceptable, because Israel possesses mass destruction weapons and
nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the accord reached between Iraq and U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan in Baghdad last month on peacefully ending the
crisis, he called upon the two sides to fully adhere to the deal.

He also announced solidarity with the Libyan people, calling
upon the U.N. to shoulder its responsibility and lift the embargo
against Libya, imposed after Libya refused to hand over to
U.S. and Britain two suspects allegedly responsible for the
bombing of a Pan Am jet over Scotland in 1988, which killed 270
people.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Hopes for Russia's Help in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia believes that Russia
can play a very important role in settling the Kosovo crisis, the
Interfax news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Ambassador in Moscow Danilo
Markovic, commenting on the coming trip by Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov to several former Yugoslav republics,
said that Russia has supported and is continuing to provide
support for the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Markovic meanwhile expressed regret that the Contact Group on
former Yugoslavia in its statement on the situation with Kosovo
approved in London last week did not set a clear line separating
"terrorist activity from legal actions by law enforcement agencies
within the bounds of struggle against terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group consists of Russia, the United States,
Britain, France, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade has met the main demand of the Contact Group and
appointed a representative for talks with leaders of the Albanian
community in Kosovo, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
The group's decision should influence the position of Albania,
which supports the separatists, he said.
</P>
<P>
Markovic declared that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would
be glad if Albania regarded this problem as a domestic problem of
a friendly neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
It was known that the Contact Group called on the U.N. Security
Council to consider a comprehensive arms embargo on Kosovo on
March 9, when holding a meeting on the level of foreign ministers.
But many Security Council members held that the Kosovo crisis was
an internal affairs of Yugoslavia and that the U.N. Security
Council should not be involved in the matter.

<HEADLINE> 48,000 Russian Officers Face Dismissal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Some 48,000 Russian officers will
be laid off before the end of the year due to a merger of the
military air defense troops, Col. Gen. Anatoly Kornukov, the
military air force commander-in-chief, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Kornukov, who is
currently inspecting the Zabaikalye Military District, said that
about 125,000 servicemen and 39 generals will be laid off from the
military air force and the air defense troops this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the cuts will in no way afflict the combat readiness
of the military air force or Russia's security, the general said.
Aircraft and equipment in the military air force and the air
defense troops will undergo necessary repairs, he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In his view, the military potential will rise due to quality
rather than quantity.
</P>
<P>
Kornukov said the military air force will not receive new
equipment until the year 2001.
